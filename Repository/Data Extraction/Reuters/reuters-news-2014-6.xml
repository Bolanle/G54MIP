&lt;p&gt;By Greg Roumeliotis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 1 (Reuters) - KKR &amp; Co LP said on
Sunday it had decided to terminate a hedge fund that invested in
stocks which the private equity firm had launched in 2011 after
poaching a team of proprietary traders from investment bank
Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move shows some of the challenges that alternative asset
managers still face in capitalizing on the retrenchment of banks
from some investment activities that regulators and lawmakers
cracked down on in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, KKR co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts had
described the hiring of nine members of Goldman Sachs'
proprietary trading group, led by Bob Howard, as an ideal fit
with their objective of strengthening KKR's product offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The co-ordinated exodus of an entire team from Goldman Sachs
remains to this day one of the most striking examples of the
impact of the "Volcker rule," which limits the extent to which
banks can bet on some investments with their own capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attributing the latest move to a lack of scale and a focus
on other hedge fund products, a KKR spokeswoman said the New
York-based firm had decided to close its KKR Equity Strategies
fund and return its capital to investors, confirming an earlier
report in the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the former Goldman Sachs traders will be part
of about a dozen people to leave KKR, according to a person
familiar with the matter and not authorized to discuss such
details publicly. Howard will now serve as senior adviser to
KKR, the person added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched in August 2011, the KKR Equity Strategies fund had
$510 million in assets as of the start of May, $337 million of
which came from external investors and the rest from KKR and its
investment staff. The fund had less than 20 external investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since inception, KKR Equity Strategies has reported an
annualized return of around 5 percent, according to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund's liquidation leaves KKR with two other hedge funds
that focus on credit investment and manage about $800 million in
total. Prisma, a fund-of-hedge funds manager that KKR acquired
in 2012, now has more than $10 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KKR also has a strategy of buying stakes in other hedge
funds managers. Its first such deal came in 2013 with its
acquisition of a 24.9 percent stake in Nephila, which makes
natural catastrophe and weather risk-related investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the move reflects two key thrusts. First,
management continues to migrate toward solutions, hedge fund
stakes and hedge seedings to drive distributions... Second, we
believe KES was not generating strong enough return on equity,
particularly given the pro forma size of the balance sheet,"
Citigroup Inc analyst William Katz wrote in a note on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move should not adversely impact KKR's fee-related
earnings and will free up some capital to get redeployed, Katz
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KKR had $102.3 billion in assets under management as of the
end of March, $60.5 billion of which was in private funds such
as private equity and real estate, and about $30 billion in
credit assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm suffered another blow to its expansion plans in
February when it disclosed it would liquidate two funds
targeting individual, rather than institutional, investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investment firm that has partnered with KKR has since
then registered a new fund with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission that would allow accredited investors to invest as
little as $10,000 in KKR's core business of buying and selling
companies.

		&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, CHINA--(Marketwired - Jun 1, 2014) -  IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the opening of a new SoftLayer data center in Hong Kong to meet growing customer demand for its cloud-based IT services. The data center is the first of 15 new data centers that the company will open as part of a  rel="nofollow" href="http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=1119838id=4266826type=1url=http%3a%2f%2fwww-03.ibm.com%2fpress%2fus%2fen%2fpressrelease%2f42956.wss".2-billion dollar investment to strengthen and extend IBM cloud services in Asia and around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our expansion into Hong Kong gives us a stronger Asian market presence as well as added proximity and access to our growing customer base in region," said Lance Crosby, CEO of SoftLayer, an IBM Company. "This new data center gives the fast-growing, entrepreneurial businesses that Hong Kong is known for a local facility to tap into SoftLayer's complete portfolio of cloud services."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoftLayer provides on-demand cloud infrastructure that includes bare metal and virtual servers, storage, and networking all on a single platform, with full customer access and control. These enterprise-grade components give users the ability to create their ideal infrastructure environment -- public, private, as well as hybrid cloud -- capable of supporting the most demanding applications and workloads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key to these unique capabilities is how SoftLayer builds its data centers around the world in a consistent, standardized format. Each data center is able to deliver the same portfolio of fully automated services, along with a private and secure network that connects all data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong data center follows this approach and will have capacity for more than 15,000 physical servers and the trademark SoftLayer network of networks architecture. It adds to an existing Asia footprint that already includes the Singapore data center and network Points of Presence (PoPs) in Hong Kong, Singapore, and Tokyo. With network connectivity provided by multiple Tier-1 network carriers, including NTT, Tata, and Equinix, customers and end users in region have redundant network protection, high-speed throughput, and a connection to SoftLayer services with less than 40 milliseconds of latency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Innovative companies in Asia and around the world, such as AdNear, Distil Networks, Tiket.com, Simpli.fi, 6waves, and Beijing Elex, already take advantage of SoftLayer's Asia footprint to improve cloud performance, provide a better experience to their end users, and expand their customer base in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"AdNear has been building its capabilities on SoftLayer's infrastructure services over the past two years," said Anil Mathews, founder and CEO of AdNear. "The ability to easily access SoftLayer's high-performance and scalable infrastructure gives us a competitive advantage that we don't get anywhere else. We congratulate SoftLayer on increasing their presence in Asia. The new data center in Hong Kong will provide startups and mature businesses alike with a foundation to deliver cloud-based services to their end-users." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today's news is a continuation of IBM's commitment to investing $1.2 billion to expand its global cloud operations in all major geographies and financial centers, increasing the reach and capability of a business' IT operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SoftLayer became part of IBM back in July 2013 and is now the foundation for the company's cloud portfolio of services. Earlier this year, IBM announced a  rel="nofollow" href="http://ctt.marketwire.com/?release=1119838id=4266847type=1url=http%3a%2f%2fwww-03.ibm.com%2fpress%2fus%2fen%2fpressrelease%2f43257.wss" billion investment in BlueMix, a Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) built on SoftLayer enabling developers to take advantage of cloud capabilities and offering IBM's middleware software as a cloud service. These investments are helping customers take advantage of cloud services based on SoftLayer's infrastructure that provide higher performance, scale, and security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more information about SoftLayer data centers, visit http://www.softlayer.com/about/datacenters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About IBM Cloud Computing

&lt;p&gt;QUITO, June 2 (Reuters) - Ecuador will invest gold held as
monetary reserves in financial instruments in an operation with
Goldman Sachs meant to boost the available cash without
affecting the value of reserves, the central bank said on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The three-year operation will commit 466,000 ounces and will
generate between $16 million and $20 million in profits,
depending on the international price of gold, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This operation will allow the (Ecuadorean Central Bank) to
take advantage of its excess liquidity in gold without any loss
in the value of its reserves," a bank official wrote in an
email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country's gold reserves as of May 16 stood at $1.098
billion but dropped on May 23 to $493 million, according to
central bank data. The difference between the two amounts is
similar to the dollar value of the gold to be used in the
operation, based on the current market price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank declined to provide additional details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ecuador had $4.1 billion in reserves as of May 23, with
around $493 million of that in gold, according to official
figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Rafael Correa has said the country will need
financial resources to pay for hydroelectric generation projects
and has warned that 2015 will be a financially difficult year
for the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The popular socialist leader has said Ecuador is studying a
return to debt markets with a $700 million issue following a
default in 2008.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details on Scherr's history at Goldman and his promotion)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Lauren Tara LaCapra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
has named Stephen Scherr to become chief strategy officer, a
wide-ranging role that will tap his experience as head of the
financing group to grow the Wall Street bank's returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scherr, 50, has led the financing group globally since 2008.
That team works across Goldman's trading, investment banking and
investment management units to meet clients' funding needs using
loans, derivatives and stock or bond offerings, as well as more
exotic products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scherr's appointment, announced in an internal memo on
Monday, came after discussions between him and Chief Executive
Lloyd Blankfein about ways Goldman can boost returns by growing
revenue rather than cutting costs, people familiar with the
matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scherr plans to lend more to clients, grow the investment
management business through new product offerings and create new
businesses using technology, said the people, who declined to be
identified discussing internal matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other Wall Street banks, Goldman's returns have been
under pressure from weak trading volumes and new regulations.
For the past few years it has relied largely on cost cuts to get
its return-on-equity out of the single digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts and investors have criticized Goldman's
reliance on trading, and compared it to top rival Morgan Stanley
, which has made more dramatic changes to its business
model since the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lately, Goldman executives have publicly said that they are
not idly waiting for business to improve. Inside the bank, some
view Blankfein's promotion of Scherr as evidence that the bank
is shifting to a more aggressive position to grow revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's return on equity last year was 11 percent, above
the 10 percent bare minimum that investors and analysts consider
the cost of issuing new stock. While that is above some rivals,
Chief Financial Officer Harvey Schwartz has called it
uninspiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scherr will take on his new role at the start of 2015, and
will maintain his other role as head of Latin America, Goldman
said in the memo. He replaces Andrew Chisolm, who is retiring at
year-end and will become an advisory director, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also announced internally that Jim Esposito and Marc
Nachmann will replace Scherr as co-heads of the global financing
group. Esposito is being promoted from head of financing for
Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), while Nachmann is
moving from his position as co-head of the global natural
resources business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Nachmann moves to the financing group, Brett Olsher will
become co-chairman of global natural resources alongside John
Vaske; Gonzalo Garcia and Suhail Sikhtian will become co-heads
of the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olsher had been co-head of the group with Nachmann. Garcia
had been head of the EMEA natural resources group as well as
co-head of the global power and infrastructure group. Sikhtian
was co-head of global energy and of Goldman's Houston office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman confirmed the contents of four memos
announcing the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by Chris Reese,

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has agreed to pay $325 million to resolve claims it defrauded insurers and other healthcare benefit providers by marketing Neurontin for unapproved uses, its second settlement over the epilepsy drug in six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preliminary accord was disclosed on Friday in U.S. District Court in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It resolves allegations in a decade-old civil lawsuit that Pfizer and its Warner-Lambert Co unit sold Neurontin for uses for which it was neither approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration nor medically effective, in an effort to boost profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs included third-party payers that said they bought or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Neurontin from the defendants, or bought gabapentin, the chemical name for Neurontin, from Pfizer's Greenstone LLC generic drug unit. Pfizer's settlement also resolves claims under state antitrust laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, New York-based Pfizer said it did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The settlement requires approval by Chief Judge Patti Saris of the Boston court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several law firms represent the plaintiffs and plan to seek attorney's fees of as much as one-third of the settlement amount, court papers show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 21, Pfizer agreed to pay $190 million to settle separate litigation in a federal court in New Jersey in which Neurontin purchasers accused it of taking steps to keep cheaper generic versions of the drug off the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2004, Pfizer agreed to pay $430 million and to plead guilty to criminal charges for illegally marketing Neurontin for unapproved uses such as migraine headaches and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer obtained Neurontin when it bought Warner-Lambert in 2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is: In re Neurontin Marketing, Sales Practices, and Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, Nos. MDL 1629, 04-10981.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Jonathan Oatis)&lt;/p&gt;

			Automate EHS Program Reporting with Microsoft SharePoint
				to 
      Save Time and Cut Costs, Advises New Whitepaper from EHE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Environmental 
      health and safety (EHS) managers at both large and small 
      manufacturers can save time and cut costs by automating their EHS 
      programs with Microsoft&#174; SharePoint&#174;, according to 
      a new whitepaper.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;SharePoint is a cost-effective software solution offering an array of 
      data collection, process automation and reporting opportunities that can 
      alleviate the administrative burden of manually transcribing and 
      entering stacks of EHS program inspection forms into Microsoft Word&#174; 
      documents, Excel&#174; spreadsheets, and Access&#174; 
      databases,&#8221; says Robert Foster, M.S., Director, Automation Services, 
      Environmental Health  Engineering Inc.(EHE), and author of &#8220;Microsoft 
      SharePoint: A Single Platform for EHS Management and Automation.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft SharePoint is widely used by manufacturers of all sizes, 
      Foster notes. In his whitepaper, he discusses how manufacturers can use 
      this existing resource to automate data processing and reporting 
      requirements, meet diverse EHS 
      program needs, and otherwise benefit EHS program management. Case 
      studies outline the success of SharePoint implementation for EHS program 
      compliance requirements including accident/incident reporting, 
      compliance calendars, inspections, corrective actions and compliance 
      documentation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With some initial development, SharePoint&#8217;s inherent functionality and 
      ease of use make it particularly useful for developing a variety of EHS 
      management applications to automate the gathering, tracking and 
      collating of program information. By greatly increasing the efficiency 
      of these routine administrative tasks, EHS managers are freed to focus 
      on program analysis and forward-thinking initiatives,&#8221; Foster says.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 2 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has agreed to pay $325
million to resolve claims it defrauded insurers and other
healthcare benefit providers by marketing Neurontin for
unapproved uses, its second settlement over the epilepsy drug in
six weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The preliminary accord was disclosed on Friday in U.S.
District Court in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It resolves allegations in a decade-old civil lawsuit that
Pfizer and its Warner-Lambert Co unit sold Neurontin for uses
for which it was neither approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration nor medically effective, in an effort to boost
profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs included third-party payers that said they
bought or reimbursed patients for the purchase of Neurontin from
the defendants, or bought gabapentin, the chemical name for
Neurontin, from Pfizer's Greenstone LLC generic drug unit.
Pfizer's settlement also resolves claims under state antitrust
laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, New York-based Pfizer said it did not admit
wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The settlement requires
approval by Chief Judge Patti Saris of the Boston court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several law firms represent the plaintiffs and plan to seek
attorney's fees of as much as one-third of the settlement
amount, court papers show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 21, Pfizer agreed to pay $190 million to settle
separate litigation in a federal court in New Jersey in which
Neurontin purchasers accused it of taking steps to keep cheaper
generic versions of the drug off the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2004, Pfizer agreed to pay $430 million and to plead
guilty to criminal charges for illegally marketing Neurontin for
unapproved uses such as migraine headaches and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer obtained Neurontin when it bought Warner-Lambert in
2000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is: In re Neurontin Marketing, Sales Practices, and
Products Liability Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of
Massachusetts, Nos. MDL 1629, 04-10981.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Combined Solution Streamlines Delivery of SAP Applications and SAP 
      HANA in the Cloud
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Virtustream, 
      the enterprise-class cloud software and services provider, today 
      announced IBM will use Virtustream&#8217;s cloud management platform (CMP) 
      software, xStream, as an option to deliver SAP and SAP HANA environments 
      on the SoftLayer, an IBM Company, cloud globally for both managed and 
      customer managed SAP environments.&#160;This partnership will enable 
      companies to easily move existing mission-critical SAP applications to 
      the SoftLayer cloud with confidence - gaining cloud efficiency and 
      enhancing both security and performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Virtustream will also utilize SoftLayer data centers and 
      cloud infrastructure to expand its own Infrastructure-as-a-Service 
      business service beyond current capacities in the US and UK markets in 
      which it currently operates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are very excited to work with IBM to address the explosive market of 
      migrating, running, and managing mission-critical SAP applications in 
      the cloud,&#8221; said Chairman and CEO of Virtustream Rodney Rogers. &#8220;We 
      believe the combination of xStream, Virtustream&#8217;s cloud management 
      software, and SoftLayer&#8217;s cloud infrastructure will be the premier cloud 
      solution offered in the market today.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Virtustream xStream CMP software is purpose-built for enterprise, 
      government and service provider customers wanting to deploy 
      mission-critical and production applications in cloud environments. 
      xStream software can be added to existing virtualized and/or physical 
      infrastructure to provide highly secure, compliant and performance 
      assured clouds &#8211; private, public and hybrid. The company&#8217;s underlying 
      Virtustream Micro-VMTM (&#181;VM) technology enables IT expenses 
      to be efficiently reduced, while assuring the overall performance of the 
      mission-critical applications when running in a cloud. With xStream, 
      customers are now able to move existing mission-critical enterprise 
      applications to the cloud, without re-engineering the software, and 
      without compromising on performance or security.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SoftLayer cloud, managed by Virtustream&#8217;s xStream CMP software, will 
      enable clients to migrate and run the entire SAP portfolio in the cloud: 
      SAP ECC/ERP, SAP HANA, SAP BI, SAP BW, SAP B1 and other SAP products. 
      The solution supports both production and test/dev environments and 
      delivers dynamic cloud efficiency, on-demand scale, assured performance 
      and enhanced security.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Businesses today are looking for ways to lower the cost of deployment 
      and gain greater efficiency in addressing new market opportunity,&#8221; said 
      IBM General Manager of Cloud Services, James Comfort. &#8220;By delivering SAP 
      applications using the SoftLayer cloud running Virtustream&#8217;s Cloud 
      Management Platform software, companies will now have broader choices 
      and new levels of control to design the cloud environment best suited to 
      their business.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Single-chamber Devices Receive CE Mark for Full Body MRI Scans Without Positioning Restrictions&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS - June 2, 2014 - Medtronic, Inc. (NYSE: MDT), today announced CE (Conformit&#233; Europ&#233;enne) Mark and commercial launch of the Advisa&#174; and Ensura SR MRI(TM) SureScan&#174; single chamber pacemaker devices in Europe. Both pacemakers are approved for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans positioned on any region of the body. These devices are not approved in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;MRI is the standard of care in soft tissue imaging, providing information not seen with X-ray, ultrasound, or CT scan, and without exposing patients to ionizing radiation. MRI is therefore critical for the early detection, diagnosis and treatment of many diseases, including stroke, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, muscle, bone and back pain - all of which are prevalent among older adults.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Until the approval of MR-conditional pacemakers, patients with these implanted devices were denied access to MRI procedures because of the potential for harmful interaction between the device and the MRI scanner. It is estimated that 50 - 75 percent of patients with an implantable cardiac device will need an MRI scan over the lifetime of their device.[1]&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"For patients with chronic atrial fibrillation and intermittent AV block, the availability of the Advisa or Ensura MRI single chamber pacemakers provides physicians with more options when determining the best treatment plan for their patients," said Prof. Juerg Schwitter, M.D., director of the CMR Center at the University Hospital Lausanne in Lausanne, Switzerland. "It's imperative that patients with pacemakers receive access to MRI scanning for any region of the body."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Advisa and Ensura SR MRI pacemakers deliver single chamber pacing engineered with the same SureScan technology used in other Medtronic MR-Conditional pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs), while adding features such as improved diagnostic information and storage, as well as a 35 percent improvement in battery longevity (when compared to the Adapta single chamber pacing system). The new systems include an Advisa or Ensura SR MRI device with any SureScan labeled lead, which must be used together to be considered MR-conditional. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"This approval allows single-chamber pacemaker patients two new options that allow them to have full-body MRI access with no scanning or positioning restrictions," said Pat Mackin, president of the Cardiac Rhythm Disease Management business and senior vice president at Medtronic. "Medtronic has remained committed to developing devices that are approved for MRI since our release of the world's first MR-conditional pacing system in 2008, and still today we offer the only pacemaker system FDA-approved for MRI scans positioned on any region of the body."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The Advisa and Ensura single chamber pacemakers are the latest addition to a growing number of Medtronic devices that are designed for MRI access including the Advisa MRI(TM) and Revo MRI(TM) dual chamber SureScan&#174; pacing systems, the Reveal LINQ(TM) Insertable Cardiac Monitoring (ICM) system and the SynchroMed&#174; II programmable drug infusion system which are available worldwide. In addition, the Evera MRI(TM) SureScan&#174; ICD systems and SureScan neurostimulation systems are available in Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In collaboration with leading clinicians, researchers and scientists worldwide, Medtronic offers the broadest range of innovative medical technology for the interventional and surgical treatment of cardiovascular disease and cardiac arrhythmias. The company strives to offer products and services that deliver clinical and economic value to healthcare consumers and providers around the world.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;About MedtronicMedtronic, Inc. (www.medtronic.com), headquartered in Minneapolis, is the global leader in medical technology - alleviating pain, restoring health and extending life for millions of people around the world. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Any forward-looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties such as those described in Medtronic's periodic reports on file with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Actual results may differ materially from anticipated results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - KKR &amp; Co LP said on Sunday it had decided to terminate a hedge fund that invested in stocks which the private equity firm had launched in 2011 after poaching a team of proprietary traders from investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The move shows some of the challenges that alternative asset managers still face in capitalizing on the retrenchment of banks from some investment activities that regulators and lawmakers cracked down on in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, KKR co-founders Henry Kravis and George Roberts had described the hiring of nine members of Goldman Sachs' proprietary trading group, led by Bob Howard, as an ideal fit with their objective of strengthening KKR's product offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The co-ordinated exodus of an entire team from Goldman Sachs remains to this day one of the most striking examples of the impact of the "Volcker rule," which limits the extent to which banks can bet on some investments with their own capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attributing the latest move to a lack of scale and a focus on other hedge fund products, a KKR spokeswoman said the New York-based firm had decided to close its KKR Equity Strategies fund and return its capital to investors, confirming an earlier report in the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, the former Goldman Sachs traders will be part of about a dozen people to leave KKR, according to a person familiar with the matter and not authorized to discuss such details publicly. Howard will now serve as senior adviser to KKR, the person added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched in August 2011, the KKR Equity Strategies fund had $510 million in assets as of the start of May, $337 million of which came from external investors and the rest from KKR and its investment staff. The fund had less than 20 external investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since inception, KKR Equity Strategies has reported an annualized return of around 5 percent, according to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund's liquidation leaves KKR with two other hedge funds that focus on credit investment and manage about $800 million in total. Prisma, a fund-of-hedge funds manager that KKR acquired in 2012, now has more than $10 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KKR also has a strategy of buying stakes in other hedge funds managers. Its first such deal came in 2013 with its acquisition of a 24.9 percent stake in Nephila, which makes natural catastrophe and weather risk-related investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the move reflects two key thrusts. First, management continues to migrate toward solutions, hedge fund stakes and hedge seedings to drive distributions... Second, we believe KES was not generating strong enough return on equity, particularly given the pro forma size of the balance sheet," Citigroup Inc analyst William Katz wrote in a note on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move should not adversely impact KKR's fee-related earnings and will free up some capital to get redeployed, Katz added.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KKR had $102.3 billion in assets under management as of the end of March, $60.5 billion of which was in private funds such as private equity and real estate, and about $30 billion in credit assets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm suffered another blow to its expansion plans in February when it disclosed it would liquidate two funds targeting individual, rather than institutional, investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investment firm that has partnered with KKR has since then registered a new fund with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that would allow accredited investors to invest as little as $10,000 in KKR's core business of buying and selling companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This version of the story corrects paragraph 7 to say 'KKR and its investment staff,' not 'KKR investment staff'; also corrects the registering party in paragraph 15 to 'an investment firm,' from 'KKR'.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Greg Roumeliotis in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - In a big gain for a regional
Texas firm, 3-year-old U.S. Capital Advisors hired five brokers
over the last two weeks from UBS AG's Wealth
Management Americas and JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, who
together managed a combined $500 million in client assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The four-person team from UBS, led by Todd Lavergne,
officially started Tuesday, May 27, while Amanda Ton, previously
of J.P. Morgan Securities, began May 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Capital Advisors' founder and CEO Patrick Mendenhall
called the hiring of Lavergne and his team, which includes Ryan
Ringuet, Aaron Geller, Nick Erwin and $3.2 million in annual
production, a "reunion," because they worked together at UBS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lavergne took over as the managing director of Mendenhall's
complex at UBS when Mendenhall left in 2009 to create U.S.
Capital Advisors. Lavergne led the complex for roughly a year
and a half before stepping down to go into full time production
at UBS, where he assembled his team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have always been friends (although) we competed when I
started this business and he was at UBS," Mendenhall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Capital Advisors is an independent firm with just under
100 employees focused on wealth management, capital markets,
energy consulting and public finance in Texas. It has two
additional offices in Dallas and Austin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ton was hired as a managing director and will also advise
clients in a move to expand U.S. Capital's client base of
medical professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ton spent 17 years at J.P. Morgan's branch at the Texas
Medical Center and will bring with her $300 million in assets
and a client base of top doctors and surgeons, Mendenhall said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She left JP Morgan in March amid allegations that she asked
her assistant to take part in certain company training programs
unrelated to securities, according to records with the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ton could not be reached for comment. US Capital Advisors'
general counsel Therese Surprenant said she carefully
scrutinized the allegations against Ton and found no reason to
be concerned about her hiring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman from J.P. Morgan declined to comment on Ton's
departure. UBS was not immediately available to comment.

fund in October 2015 and hand over the reins to John Linehan.
Rogers will remain the company's chief investment officer and

has appointed Declan Hegarty as general manager. Declan joined
JPMorgan in 2012. His responsibilities in corporate banking will

Siena (BMPS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE U.S. FEDERAL RESERVE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Federal Reserve has hired a former state insurance
commissioner to help it oversee non-bank financial firms that a
council of regulators identified for tougher scrutiny last year.
Thomas Sullivan, who led the Connecticut Insurance Department
from 2007 through 2010 and later worked at
PricewaterhouseCoopers, told Reuters he starts as a
senior adviser on June 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EURONEXT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pan-European exchange group, which is set to list on
three of its markets in the coming weeks, said it had hired Jos
Dijsselhof as chief operating officer. Dijsselhof, who was most
recently a general manager at Australia and New Zealand Bank
 in Singapore, will join Euronext on July 1, provided
that regulators sign off on the appointment, Euronext said in a
statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RENAISSANCE CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment bank, which is a unit of Russia-based

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Westlake, OH, June 3, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- RevoLaze, LLC announced today that Roy P. Disney has made an
investment in the laser technology firm and has joined the board
effective immediately, according to RevoLaze CEO Darryl Costin,
PhD. Mr. Disney's investment in RevoLaze was made through an
investment vehicle affiliated with Shamrock Holdings, Inc., the Roy
E. Disney family's investment company. Mr. Disney joins Mr. Bernard
Theisen from Lear Corporation, Darryl J. Costin, Sr., Darryl J.
Costin, Jr. and Kimberly L. Ripley on the RevoLaze board. Lear
Corporation acquired an interest in RevoLaze on June 27, 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RevoLaze globally commercializes high-speed, high-power laser
scribing technology unmatched in the world. The company's
eco-friendly processes offer 2500 watts of power with unparalleled
laser scan speeds exceeding 50 meters per second. With over 20
years of experience and knowledge in the industry, its licensees
can expect major benefits of cost reduction, throughput enhancement
and design flexibility. "&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demand for laser abrasion and patterned denim continues to
skyrocket," says Costin. "Our custom delivery systems are built for
any application. Also, we are excited to introduce our new Linear
Processing machine designed exclusively for textile roll goods.
It's the fastest moving laser on the planet, and we feel the future
of laser technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it wasn't just the manufacturing speed that attracted Roy
Disney's attention. "We appreciate working with companies that have
a special concern for our environment," says Shamrock President
Greg Martin. "There is a significant health risk associated with
the sandblasting of denim to create the worn look. Likewise, the
denim enzyme washing process produces environmental hazards.
RevoLaze's technology virtually eliminates both of these
maladies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laser technology developed and patented by the company was
also a key factor. "Textiles are manufactured all over the globe
today. A company needs absolute assurance that the laser technology
they are using to create their garments is properly licensed. With
29 patents worldwide, RevoLaze provides that comfort," says
Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is excited to see all the applications Linear Processing
can bring to the textile industry. "From replacing the enzyme
process to replicating expensive loom processes, and providing
patterned denim to the marketplace, RevoLaze technology is
literally just scratching the surface," says Disney. "We believe
the benefits of RevoLaze technology is compelling, both financially
and environmentally, and that companies will be eager to adapt this
technology sooner rather than later."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's precisely how Bernard Theisen, Vice President of Lear
Corporations' Global Trim Group, felt when he saw RevoLaze's
technology in action. Lear is one of the world's leading suppliers
of automotive seat systems. "The design possibilities and speed at
which production occurs are phenomenal. We are thrilled about our
partnership with RevoLaze and the customization opportunities it
affords," says Theisen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About RevoLaze, LLC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through a combination of unique digital software and
specifically designed material delivery systems, RevoLaze develops
the highest speed, highest power galvo driven laser machines in the
industry. With over 20 years of experience, and 29 patents granted
worldwide, RevoLaze offers its licensees unprecedented cost
reduction, throughput enhancement and design flexibility. To learn

straightforward - invest and act with integrity, responsibility,

The offering makes it possible for enterprises to overcome their biggest challenge in the adoption of continuous delivery -- deploying applications to consistent and predictable environments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficient software development and delivery drives competitive advantage and requires enterprises to release new products and features faster, more often, and with better quality and reliability. Enterprises achieving continuous delivery have a critical edge in this race as they can rapidly, reliably, and repeatedly push out software enhancements to customers at low risk and cost. Software can then be rapidly adapted based on user feedback, shifts in the market, and changes in business strategy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Automated build pipeline processes ensure that teams focus holistically on the practice of building software," wrote Sean Kenefick, research director at Gartner.&#160;"Maintaining an automated pipeline requires discipline and commitment, but the rewards include reducing deployment risks, increasing time to market and producing higher-quality software."1&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The adoption of continuous integration and deployment is a high priority for enterprises, however it is easier said than done," said Brian White, vice president of products at Skytap. "Automation of the delivery pipeline along with agile practices increases the flow of features into the pipeline, but the pipeline itself is constrained by a small number of static and typically contaminated test environments. The combination of Skytap and IBM UrbanCode Deploy enables the repeated deployment of applications to consistent and clean environments overcoming one of the biggest obstacles hindering increased velocity.&#160;At the end of the day, enterprises now can accelerate their delivery and drive more value for the business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Utilizing IBM UrbanCode Deploy within Skytap Cloud offers development and testing teams an easy and cost-effective solution for continuous delivery. Enterprises can now fully automate their deployment pipeline, including unit, functional and performance testing, and provision even the most complex enterprise applications in hours versus days. Skytap enables multiple environments to be available to the development and quality management teams to allow parallel development and testing to occur to dramatically increase the throughput and velocity.&#160;This can be fully automated with the Skytap Automation Pack for IBM UrbanCode Deploy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The combination of IBM UrbanCode Deploy and Skytap solutions drives rapid software delivery by enabling early and often testing," said Dan Berg, IBM Distinguished Engineer.&#160;"Skytap's Environments as a Service solves a key technical challenge of repeatable and reliable test environment setup for application deployments managed by IBM UrbanCode Deploy." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skytap customers can download the Ready for IBM Rational validated Skytap for UrbanCode Deploy Automation Pack from the Skytap library.

		&lt;p&gt;IT distributor SYNNEX and its CE division New Age Electronics continue to invest in the rapidly evolving home and office automation market &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Greenville, SC - June 3, 2014 - SYNNEX Corporation (NYSE: SNX), a leading distributor of IT products and services, announced that it has developed a newly enhanced and exclusive mobile app for INSTEON, creator of best-selling home automation and control technology, to be used on Microsoft Windows 8.1 and Windows Phone 8.1 devices. New Age Electronics, a division of SYNNEX Corporation, currently distributes INSTEON products to the retail channel. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The launch of the new mobile app complements the INSTEON product line and enables SYNNEX and New Age Electronics to provide commercial and retail customers with a cost-effective, cutting-edge mobile solution to monitor home and office automation. With the help of SYNNEX, INSTEON products are also now available from MicrosoftStore.com and will be available from Microsoft retail stores across the US in early July. The INSTEON mobile app is currently available for download on the Windows and Windows Phone Stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The difference between the number of investors who said they are bearish on U.S. long-dated Treasuries exceeded those who are bullish grew to its highest in eight years, according to a J.P. Morgan survey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A widening gap between those who are "short" long-dated U.S. government debt and those who are "long" belied the bond market rally in May when benchmark yields fell to 2.40 percent last week, which was an 11-month low. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Persistent demand for longer-dated bonds stemmed from worries that U.S. growth and inflation are falling short of the Fed's forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign demand also exacerbated the drop in U.S. yields as investors anticipate the European Central Bank might lower interest rates on Thursday to avert deflation in the euro zone, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of "short" investors exceeded the share of "long" investors by 29 percentage points, which was the highest since May 1, 2006, according to J.P. Morgan Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of "short" investors rose to 40 percent in the latest week ending June 2, up from 35 percent in the prior week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By holding fewer longer-dated Treasuries, investors reduce the duration or interest rate risk of their portfolios in anticipation of a market drop, which generally causes longer-dated bonds to generate bigger losses than shorter-dated debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conversely, longer-dated Treasuries produce higher returns than short-term debt in a market rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of "long" investors or those who said they held more longer-dated Treasuries than their benchmarks fell to 11 percent from 17 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-dated Treasuries were the top performing U.S. bonds in May as government bonds that mature in 20 years or longer earned a 3.02 percent total return, according to an index compiled by Barclays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The share of neutral investors, or those who said they are holding long-dated securities equal to their portfolio benchmarks, edged up to 49 percent from last week's 48 percent which was the lowest proportion since Oct. 25, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmark 10-year Treasuries yields rose more than 3 basis points to 2.568 percent early Tuesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Richard Leong Editing by W Simon)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;h1&gt;Microsoft Takes Over Enterprise Collaboration Leadership From Cisco&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;RENO, NV--(Marketwired - Jun 3, 2014) - &#160;New Q1 data from Synergy Research Group shows that Microsoft has finally caught up with Cisco and generated more revenue from its enterprise collaboration infrastructure activities in the quarter. Revenues from collaboration -- which includes enterprise voice, UC applications, telepresence, email software, collaborative workspace software and enterprise social networks -- were $5.4 billion in the quarter, with Microsoft's overall share passing the 21% mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total revenues for the quarter were down 1% year on year, as declines in enterprise voice and telepresence countered growth in other segments. On a rolling annual basis revenues reached $22.6 billion, up 1% from the preceding four quarters. Sequentially quarterly revenues were down 8%, reflecting a typical cyclical drop from a high in Q4. The largest three segments are enterprise voice, email software and UC applications, which in aggregate account for 78% of the Q1 market. The highest-growth segment is enterprise social networks, which experienced year-on-year growth of 34%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In Q1 Cisco revenue was impacted by softness in the enterprise voice and telepresence segments, issues which affected many vendors" said Jeremy Duke, Synergy Research Group's founder and Chief Analyst. "On the other hand, Microsoft has only a small presence in enterprise voice and is not active in telepresence, but is growing its share of the UC applications segment, holding its own in email software and growing strongly in the nascent enterprise social networks segment. Microsoft has been steadily increasing its influence in collaboration markets over the last five years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Synergy Research Group&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Synergy provides quarterly market sizing and segmentation data on enterprise collaboration and related markets, including vendor revenues by segment and by region.

			Transportation agency signs agreement for Microsoft Dynamics AX ERP 
      solution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tyler Technologies, Inc. (NYSE: TYL) has signed an agreement with the 
      San Francisco County Transportation Authority in San Francisco, 
      California, to implement Microsoft Dynamics&#174; 
      AX, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution with public 
      sector functionality that Tyler Technologies jointly developed with 
      Microsoft&#174;. The contract includes implementation and related 
      professional services, training and support.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      an authorized reseller of Microsoft Dynamics AX and provides software 
      support and other standard services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Transportation Authority selected Microsoft Dynamics AX to replace 
      its legacy financial and accounting software to increase the efficiency 
      of its operations and better support its complex business needs. The 
      Transportation Authority plans to leverage the functionality of 
      Microsoft Dynamics AX and to integrate paperless document management 
      throughout its business processes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Created in 1989, the Transportation Authority administers the city&#8217;s 
      half-cent transportation sales tax and is responsible for long-range 
      transportation planning and coordination of multiple transportation 
      funding sources. In these capacities, the Transportation Authority 
      oversees and assists in the delivery of capital improvements for San 
      Francisco&#8217;s roadway and public transportation networks. With more than 
      830,000 residents, San Francisco is the state&#8217;s fourth-largest city and 
      the only county-city consolidation in California.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Enterprise Cloud Marketplace Clients Can Access Sparked&#8217;s Retention 
      Radar to Reduce Customer Churn
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sparked (www.sparked.com) today 
      announced a partnership with IBM that brings the power of predictive 
      analytics-powered customer retention to the IBM Cloud marketplace. IBM 
      clients can now use the IBM Marketplace to access the full power of 
      Sparked&#8217;s Retention Radar software to reduce customer churn.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of IBM&#8217;s best in class ecosystem, Sparked is among a handful of 
      distinguished cloud service providers in the analytics category. The IBM 
      Cloud marketplace enables IBM&#8217;s enterprise clients, as well as business, 
      development and IT professionals, easy access to Sparked&#8217;s customer 
      retention solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sparked&#8217;s machine-learning powered analytics engine pinpoints why a 
      company&#8217;s customers stay or leave, who&#8217;s likely to leave next, and how 
      to keep them &#8211; showing the specific factors, behaviors and patterns that 
      drive churn and retention. On the basis of this analysis, Sparked helps 
      companies run interventions early in the customer lifecycle to prevent 
      attrition and enhance customer success.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Retention Radar analyzes several factors, including customer actions, 
      purchase history, customer support interactions, social media activity, 
      natural language processing, and sentiment analysis, to assess the 
      satisfaction level of individual customers and the likelihood of each 
      customer to discontinue use of a product or service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upon identifying customers likely to cancel their accounts, Retention 
      Radar individualizes, automates and optimizes the &#8220;Next Best Action&#8221; &#8211; a 
      specific, tailored action that companies can heed to keep the customer 
      engaged and retained. Based on deep analytics, these save tactics are 
      matched to each customer to identify the action with the highest 
      probability of retaining that specific customer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Sparked is excited to be among the early elite analytics vendors in 
      IBM&#8217;s cloud innovation hub,&#8221; said Sparked CEO and co-founder Ben Rigby. 
      &#8220;By enabling companies to easily aggregate all of their customer data 
      into an ingestion system that both organizes it and runs complicated 
      analysis to provide simple, clear insights, Retention Radar enables 
      companies to keep their customers and to increase customer lifetime 
      value.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IBM Cloud marketplace offers clients access to more than 100 SaaS 
      applications, IBM's BlueMix platform-as-a-service with its suite of 
      composable services, the powerful SoftLayer infrastructure-as-a-service, 
      and IBM's rich intellectual capital and deep industry expertise. This 
      single online destination containing a suite of cloud services delivers 
      a new buying experience that enables business professionals to deploy 
      new services faster, allows developers to build them with greater speed,

			Nitro Announces New Microsoft RMS Integration with Nitro Pro
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Nitro Pro with RMS Introduces User-Based File Security for Businesses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nitro, a leading provider of document productivity and collaboration 
      solutions, today announced a new integration with Microsoft RMS (Rights 
      Management Service) to provide enhanced security for document workflows. 
      Demonstrating Nitro&#8217;s continued commitment to document security, Nitro 
      Pro with RMS now enables users to protect and securely exchange digital 
      documents with anyone in their collaboration circle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft and Nitro&#8217;s increased investment in RMS helps enable the 
      secure sharing of all file types &#8211; including PDF and Microsoft Office 
      formats &#8211; on all devices. Nitro Pro with RMS protects at the file level, 
      leveraging encryption technology to ensure that only those with 
      permission can access your sensitive documents, whether they are inside 
      your organization or outside the firewall. Nitro Pro also offers several 
      additional security features including password and permissions 
      settings, certificate security based on public/private key security, and 
      basic encryption for sharing and tracking PDF documents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;From the desktop to the cloud, documents and how we share them can have 
      a significant impact on an organization&#8217;s success,&#8221; said Mimi Hoang, VP, 
      Product at Nitro. &#8220;The increasing flow of shared information has exposed 
      vulnerabilities in traditional document security, making it difficult to 
      control who can access sensitive files. Whether someone accidentally 
      forwards an email or a user has malicious intent, the end result is that 
      sensitive information can wind up in unintended hands. Providing users 
      with peace of mind and more control over who can access documents 
      irrespective of their destination, our integration of Microsoft RMS with 
      Nitro Pro means our customers can comfortably share digital documents as 
      intended between both employees and third parties.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key features of Nitro Pro with RMS include the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				PDF File Encryption &#8211; The Microsoft RMS integration encrypts 
        PDF files so that only those who have permission are granted access. 
        Each user identity is verified to ensure documents can only be 
        accessed and modified by authorized personnel within the internal 
        network or beyond the corporate firewall.
      
			
				SharePoint Compatibility &#8211; Nitro Pro with RMS can consume 
        protected PDF documents generated by SharePoint Secure Libraries.
      
			
				RMS Ecosystem Support &#8211; Nitro Pro with RMS allows users to open 
        and use files that other people have protected using RMS-supported 
        applications.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re thrilled that Nitro released its newest integration with 
      Microsoft RMS in their flagship desktop PDF product, Nitro Pro,&#8221; said 
      Dan Plastina, Group Program Manager for Microsoft Rights Management. 
      &#8220;Nitro Pro with RMS provides maximum document security to 
      user-permission workflows that hadn&#8217;t been previously addressed. By 
      putting the power to protect sensitive information in the hands of the 
      end-user, PDF files and documents can be secured whether shared 
      internally or with outside collaborators by requiring identity 
      verification before file access is granted.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Protecting sensitive information is a top priority for our customers, 
      and their feedback was the catalyst for developing this integrated 
      functionality with Microsoft,&#8221; said Sam Chandler, Nitro&#8217;s Founder and 
      CEO. &#8220;We&#8217;re delighted that Nitro Pro is now the easiest option for 
      organizations to extend RMS protection to their PDF files and broader 
      document workflows.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Simplicity, 
      Protections and Opportunity
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In Partnership with Leading Consumer Thought Leaders, Visa Creates 
      New Designation for Consumer Reloadable Prepaid Cards That Goes Beyond 
      Current Marketplace Requirements Related to Transparency, Benefits and 
      Fees
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), the leader in global payments, today announced a new 
      designation for consumer reloadable prepaid products in the US, aimed at 
      simplifying fees, improving consumer protections and creating 
      opportunities for cardholders to improve their financial health. The 
      designation was developed in conjunction with industry thought leaders 
      the Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) and The Pew 
      Charitable Trusts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Consumers have been confused by an often complex prepaid landscape,&#8221; 
      said Ryan McInerney, president, Visa Inc. &#8220;As a prepaid leader, we felt 
      it was important to go beyond current requirements in the marketplace 
      and bring transparency to this growing product area. This Visa 
      designation will signify a new level of simplicity, protection and 
      opportunity, enabling cardholders to confidently manage their spending 
      every day.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To qualify for the new Visa prepaid designation, prepaid programs must 
      meet a set of standards. Cards that meet these requirements will receive 
      a seal that will be visible on card packaging and materials. Features of 
      Visa&#8217;s new prepaid designation include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Simplified fees and transparent disclosures
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        A flat monthly fee that includes all basic day to day activities1. 
        Consumers will not be charged:

            Customer service fees

      &#8220;At Visa, we believe prepaid cards can play an integral role in a 
      consumer&#8217;s day-to-day financial matters,&#8221; said Cecilia Frew, head of US 
      prepaid products, Visa Inc. &#8220;Whether a consumer wants to use their 
      prepaid card as an account to direct deposit their paycheck and pay 
      bills, or as a companion card to help control spending, this designation 
      will clear the way for consumers to pick the prepaid product that is 
      right for them,&#8221; said Frew.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We applaud Visa&#8217;s efforts to raise the bar on quality in the prepaid 
      industry by building on our Compass Principles," said Jennifer Tescher, 
      president  CEO of CFSI. "Their efforts are vital because millions of 
      Americans are searching for tools to help them reduce financial 
      friction, and prepaid cards can be a valuable option. We look forward to 
      continuing to work with Visa to design and test new prepaid features and 
      options that enable consumers to spend, save, borrow and plan 
      effectively.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "More Americans are turning to prepaid cards as a way to manage money, 
      but Pew&#8217;s research shows that these cards should be made more consumer 
      friendly,&#8221; said Susan Weinstock, who directs consumer banking research 
      at The Pew Charitable Trusts. &#8220;Visa is taking an important step forward 
      by acknowledging the importance of clear disclosures and consumer 
      protections. It&#8217;s particularly encouraging that Visa is not allowing 
      overdrafts on these cards, in light of our research on consumer prepaid 
      card use.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa also aims to keep prepaid at the forefront of financial services 
      innovation. Thus, Visa will continue to work with industry thought 
      leaders on finding opportunities for consumers to improve their 
      financial health, whether through creative approaches to financial 
      education, new products to help consumers save, or ways for consumers to 
      safely build credit. As regulations, consumer needs and technology 
      evolve, Visa will revisit these standards with a commitment to 
      delivering more simplicity, protection and opportunity to consumers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We created this designation to help people easily choose a Visa prepaid 
      card that gives them more control over their money &#8211; anywhere, anytime &#8211; 
      without surprises,&#8221; said McInerney. &#8220;Through close partnership with our 
      clients, Visa will help lead the way on promoting these new standards, 
      while continuing to advance the prepaid industry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new designation is the latest example of Visa&#8217;s leadership in 
      payment industry standards. Earlier this year Visa announced the Prepaid 
      Clearinghouse Service, a new industry solution to identify and mitigate 
      prepaid card fraud. Visa is also working with other card networks to 
      introduce a global tokenization standard to enhance the security of 
      digital payments and simplify the purchasing experience when shopping on 
      a mobile phone, tablet, personal computer or other smart device. Visa is 
      also a founding member of the EMV coalition that seeks to ensure the 
      security and global interoperability of chip-based payment cards.

		&lt;h1&gt;Wellgreen Platinum Signs MOU for the Supply of Liquefied Natural Gas With Northern Lights Energy and With General Electric for LNG Power Generation and Electrical Equipment&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jun 4, 2014) - 
				Wellgreen Platinum Ltd. (TSX VENTURE:WG)(OTCQX:WGPLF) is pleased to announce that we have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) agreement with Northern Lights Energy, LLC. (Northern Lights Energy) for the potential supply of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Alaska to the Wellgreen PGM-Nickel-Copper project in Canada's Yukon Territory. The Company has also signed an MOU agreement with General Electric Canada (GE) for the potential supply by GE of LNG power generation equipment and services, which the Company expects would include GE's comprehensive electrical infrastructure technology for the mine processing equipment, transmission technology and control  automation equipment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these MOUs establish the framework for LNG supply and power generation to meet Wellgreen Platinum's goal of delivering cost effective and environmentally responsible energy for the Wellgreen project, where construction activities are anticipated to start as early as 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOU with Northern Lights Energy and the Interior Energy Project&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2013, the State of Alaska Legislature approved the Interior Energy Project to provide financing for the development of a natural gas liquefaction plant to be located on the North Slope of Alaska as part of a larger initiative to bring affordable, clean burning natural gas from Prudhoe Bay to the interior of Alaska. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2014, the AIDEA Board selected Colorado-based strategic consulting, engineering and construction firm MWH Global as its private sector partner for the Interior Energy Project and Northern Lights Energy was established as a special purpose vehicle to serve as the project company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the MOU with Northern Lights Energy is to establish a framework for delivery of LNG to the Wellgreen project consistent with the goals of the Interior Energy Project that requires that LNG from the project be supplied to certain, specified customers in Alaska on a priority and preferred basis. It is anticipated that the project, after it meets these preferred customers' needs, will have additional supplies of LNG that Wellgreen may purchase under the terms of the MOU. The parties will also work together to determine if there are opportunities to make Alaskan LNG available to provide clean and competitively priced power to communities in the Yukon along the Alaska Highway, such as the Kluane and White River First Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The MOU between Northern Lights Energy is beneficial not just for Wellgreen, but for Alaska," said Rick Adcock, Managing Director of Northern Lights Energy. "We look forward to working with the Wellgreen team as we move forward with our commitment to the Interior Energy Project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wellgreen Platinum's President  CEO, Greg Johnson, states, "We are very pleased with this agreement with Northern Lights Energy which fits Wellgreen Platinum's timelines and objectives of utilizing a cost effective and environmentally responsible source of energy for the Wellgreen project. We believe this supply of LNG may potentially bring additional benefits from the Interior Energy Project to both Alaskans and to Yukon communities along the Alaska Highway, which currently rely on more expensive and less environmentally friendly diesel for power generation. This agreement also demonstrates the opportunities for other infrastructure-related cross-border working relationships that can benefit communities in the Yukon and Alaska."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOU with General Electric Canada for LNG Power Generation and Electrical Equipment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wellgreen Platinum has also entered into an MOU with General Electric Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, GE would provide products and services for the Wellgreen project, including a complete power generation and transmission network for the project. GE is one of the largest companies in the world and a leading power and automation technology authority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE's products include a full suite of integrated power and automation components, including GE Jenbaucher natural gas generators, main substations, all applicable motors, drives, motor control centres and controls throughout the mine surface plants and underground. The two parties will also work together in the consideration of the design of control systems, substations and field bus connected devices, utilizing GE's technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look forward to partnering with Wellgreen Platinum to advance the Wellgreen project toward production," said David Willick - GE Mining Regional Commercial Director. GE has vast industry experience and a comprehensive array of automation and power offerings that enable us to provide the robust solutions required for these large scale projects. We recognize the importance of the Wellgreen project, not only to Wellgreen Platinum but to the local and territorial communities as well as to the global supply of key commodities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Sagman, COO of Wellgreen Platinum notes "Our agreement with GE has the potential to expedite development of the Wellgreen project as an efficient, safe and sustainable operation. In addition to their leading-edge technology, GE also has the capability to provide vendor financing packages, maintenance packages and opportunities to provide power generation solutions to the First Nations communities near the Wellgreen project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yukon Permitting Improvement Initiatives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 23, 2014, the Yukon Government announced initiatives to streamline the mine permitting process and establish clear timelines for internal review processes associated with mining applications. Premier Darrell Pasloski explained that revisions to the Waters Act regulation will "create greater certainty for mining proponents and the Water Board by establishing commonly understood timelines for both parties at the administrative review stage." The amendments set out the list of documents needed to make an application, a five-day timeline for the Water Board Secretariat to perform its initial administrative review, and a 30-day timeline for the Water Board Secretariat to perform its technical review before applications are considered by the full Water Board. "By establishing specific timelines for the Water Board Secretariat's internal review of water licence applications for mining projects, we are moving forward with our commitment to improve our licensing and permitting regime," Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Scott Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Wellgreen Platinum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wellgreen Platinum Ltd. is a Canadian mining exploration  development company focused on the acquisition and development of platinum group metals (PGM) projects in politically stable, mining-friendly jurisdictions. One of the largest undeveloped PGM-nickel-copper deposits outside southern Africa or Russia, our 100% owned flagship Wellgreen project located in Canada's mining-friendly Yukon Territory is 14 kilometres by all-weather road from the paved Alaska Highway leading to deep sea ports in Haines and Skagway, Alaska.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wellgreen Platinum Ltd. has an experienced management team with a track record of successful large scale project discovery, development, operations and financing and is focused on advancing Wellgreen towards production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quality Assurance, Quality Control: The technical information disclosed herein was prepared under the supervision of John Sagman, P.Eng., Wellgreen Platinum's Senior Vice President and Chief Operating Officer and a "Qualified Person" as defined in NI 43-101.

The Company has also signed an MOU agreement with General Electric Canada (GE) for the potential supply by GE of LNG power generation equipment and services, which the Company expects would include GE's comprehensive electrical infrastructure technology for the mine processing equipment, transmission technology and control  automation equipment.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together, these MOUs establish the framework for LNG supply and power generation to meet Wellgreen Platinum's goal of delivering cost effective and environmentally responsible energy for the Wellgreen project, where construction activities are anticipated to start as early as 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOU with Northern Lights Energy and the Interior Energy Project&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April 2013, the State of Alaska Legislature approved the Interior Energy Project to provide financing for the development of a natural gas liquefaction plant to be located on the North Slope of Alaska as part of a larger initiative to bring affordable, clean burning natural gas from Prudhoe Bay to the interior of Alaska.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2014, the AIDEA Board selected Colorado-based strategic consulting, engineering and construction firm MWH Global as its private sector partner for the Interior Energy Project and Northern Lights Energy was established as a special purpose vehicle to serve as the project company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purpose of the MOU with Northern Lights Energy is to establish a framework for delivery of LNG to the Wellgreen project consistent with the goals of the Interior Energy Project that requires that LNG from the project be supplied to certain, specified customers in Alaska on a priority and preferred basis. It is anticipated that the project, after it meets these preferred customers' needs, will have additional supplies of LNG that Wellgreen may purchase under the terms of the MOU. The parties will also work together to determine if there are opportunities to make Alaskan LNG available to provide clean and competitively priced power to communities in the Yukon along the Alaska Highway, such as the Kluane and White River First Nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The MOU between Northern Lights Energy is beneficial not just for Wellgreen, but for Alaska," said Rick Adcock, Managing Director of Northern Lights Energy. "We look forward to working with the Wellgreen team as we move forward with our commitment to the Interior Energy Project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wellgreen Platinum's President  CEO, Greg Johnson, states, "We are very pleased with this agreement with Northern Lights Energy which fits Wellgreen Platinum's timelines and objectives of utilizing a cost effective and environmentally responsible source of energy for the Wellgreen project. We believe this supply of LNG may potentially bring additional benefits from the Interior Energy Project to both Alaskans and to Yukon communities along the Alaska Highway, which currently rely on more expensive and less environmentally friendly diesel for power generation. This agreement also demonstrates the opportunities for other infrastructure-related cross-border working relationships that can benefit communities in the Yukon and Alaska."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOU with General Electric Canada for LNG Power Generation and Electrical Equipment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wellgreen Platinum has also entered into an MOU with General Electric Canada. Under the terms of the agreement, GE would provide products and services for the Wellgreen project, including a complete power generation and transmission network for the project. GE is one of the largest companies in the world and a leading power and automation technology authority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE's products include a full suite of integrated power and automation components, including GE Jenbaucher natural gas generators, main substations, all applicable motors, drives, motor control centres and controls throughout the mine surface plants and underground. The two parties will also work together in the consideration of the design of control systems, substations and field bus connected devices, utilizing GE's technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look forward to partnering with Wellgreen Platinum to advance the Wellgreen project toward production," said David Willick - GE Mining Regional Commercial Director. GE has vast industry experience and a comprehensive array of automation and power offerings that enable us to provide the robust solutions required for these large scale projects. We recognize the importance of the Wellgreen project, not only to Wellgreen Platinum but to the local and territorial communities as well as to the global supply of key commodities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Sagman, COO of Wellgreen Platinum notes "Our agreement with GE has the potential to expedite development of the Wellgreen project as an efficient, safe and sustainable operation.&#160;In addition to their leading-edge technology, GE also has the capability to provide vendor financing packages, maintenance packages and opportunities to provide power generation solutions to the First Nations communities near the Wellgreen project."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yukon Permitting Improvement Initiatives&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 23, 2014, the Yukon Government announced initiatives to streamline the mine permitting process and establish clear timelines for internal review processes associated with mining applications. Premier Darrell Pasloski explained that revisions to the Waters Act regulation will "create greater certainty for mining proponents and the Water Board by establishing commonly understood timelines for both parties at the administrative review stage." The amendments set out the list of documents needed to make an application, a five-day timeline for the Water Board Secretariat to perform its initial administrative review, and a 30-day timeline for the Water Board Secretariat to perform its technical review before applications are considered by the full Water Board.&#160;"By establishing specific timelines for the Water Board Secretariat's internal review of water licence applications for mining projects, we are moving forward with our commitment to improve our licensing and permitting regime," Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources Scott Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Wellgreen Platinum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wellgreen Platinum Ltd. is a Canadian mining exploration  development company focused on the acquisition and development of platinum group metals (PGM) projects in politically stable, mining-friendly jurisdictions.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Alnylam is a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics 
      based on RNA interference, or RNAi. The company is leading the 
      translation of RNAi as a new class of innovative medicines with a core 
      focus on RNAi therapeutics as genetic medicines, including programs as 
      part of the company&#8217;s &#8220;Alnylam 5x15TM&#8221; product strategy. 
      Alnylam&#8217;s genetic medicine programs are RNAi therapeutics directed 
      toward genetically defined targets for the treatment of serious, 
      life-threatening diseases with limited treatment options for patients

      treatment of genetic forms of mixed hyperlipidemia and severe 
      hypertriglyceridemia; ALN-AC3, an RNAi therapeutic targeting 
      apolipoprotein C-III (apoCIII) for the treatment of 
      hypertriglyceridemia; and other programs yet to be disclosed. As part of 
      its &#8220;Alnylam 5x15&#8221; strategy, as updated in early 2014, the company 
      expects to have six to seven genetic medicine product candidates in 
      clinical development - including at least two programs in Phase 3 and 
      five to six programs with human proof of concept - by the end of 2015.

			$1 
      Million Each for Submitting Inaccurate Blue Sheet Data
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Disciplinary Complaint Issued Against Wedbush Securities
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) today announced it 
      has censured and fined Barclays Capital Inc.; Goldman, Sachs  Co.; and 
      Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner  Smith, Inc., $1 million each for failing 
      to provide complete and accurate information about trades performed by 
      the firms and their customers, commonly known as &#8220;blue sheet&#8221; data, to 
      FINRA, the SEC and other regulators. In addition, FINRA issued a 
      complaint against Wedbush Securities, Inc., for failing to submit 
      complete and accurate blue sheets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Blue sheets provide regulators with detailed information about trades 
      performed by a firm and its customers, including the security&#8217;s name, 
      date traded, price, transaction size and parties involved. Regulators 
      use the data to identify trading anomalies and investigate potential 
      insider trading or other market manipulations. Federal securities laws 
      and FINRA rules require firms to provide this information to FINRA and 
      other regulators electronically upon request.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cameron Funkhouser, Executive Vice President and Head of FINRA&#8217;s Office 
      of Fraud Detection and Market Intelligence, said, &#8220;Blue sheets are 
      mission-critical to conducting reviews and investigations of suspicious 
      trading. When firms fail to submit timely and accurate blue sheet data, 
      it compromises the ability of every regulator to identify the 
      perpetrators of illegal insider trading and other market abuses. The 
      actions announced today are a reminder to firms about their fundamental 
      obligation to provide complete and accurate blue sheet data without 
      exception.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FINRA found the firms&#8217; violations included submissions that failed to 
      include some customer names and contact information, failed to include 
      some transactions, contained incorrect name and contact information for 
      some customers, or contained inaccurate details of the transactions. The 
      violations arose from problems with the firms&#8217; electronic systems used 
      to compile and produce blue sheet data. FINRA also found that the firms 
      failed to have in place adequate audit systems providing for 
      accountability of their blue sheet submissions. FINRA ordered the firms 
      to certify that they have conducted a comprehensive review of their 
      systems related to blue sheet submissions, and to certify that they have 
      established procedures reasonably designed to address and correct the 
      violations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each firm has a prior regulatory history involving the submission of 
      inaccurate blue sheet data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In settling these matters, Barclays, Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch 
      neither admitted nor denied the charges, but consented to the entry of 
      FINRA&#8217;s findings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Wedbush complaint is not yet adjudicated. Under FINRA rules, a firm 
      or individual named in a complaint can file a response and request a 
      hearing before a FINRA disciplinary panel. Possible remedies include a 
      fine, censure, suspension or expulsion from the securities industry; 
      disgorgement of gains associated with the violations; and payment of 
      restitution. The issuance of a disciplinary complaint represents FINRA&#8217;s 
      initiation of a formal proceeding in which findings as to the 
      allegations in the complaint have not been made, and does not represent 
      a decision as to any of the allegations contained in the complaint. 
      Because the complaint is unadjudicated, the respondents should be 
      contacted before drawing any conclusions regarding the allegations in 
      the complaint.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FINRA&#8217;s investigation was conducted by the Office of Fraud Detection and 
      Market Intelligence, and the Department of Enforcement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investors can obtain more information about, and the disciplinary record 
      of, any FINRA-registered broker or brokerage firm by using FINRA&#8217;s 
      BrokerCheck. FINRA makes BrokerCheck available at no charge. In 2013, 
      members of the public used this service to conduct 16.5 million reviews

      bring its hit franchise games to Microsoft&#8217;s rapidly expanding Windows 
      device ecosystem.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the deal, Kabam will deliver its lineup of hit games to 
      Windows tablets and phones over the next year, including Fast  
      Furious 6: The Game, Dragons of Atlantis: Heirs of the Dragon and 
      The Hobbit: Kingdoms of Middle-earth. Moving forward, Windows 
      users will be able to play future Kabam games in the same timeframe as 
      other platforms.

      platforms,&#8221; said Kent Wakeford, chief operating officer of Kabam.

      with 91 percent year-over-year gain in 2013. According to IDC&#8217;s mobile 
      phone forecast, Windows Phone stands to grow the fastest among the 
      leading smartphone operating systems with a predicted compound annual 
      growth rate for 2013-2018 of 28.1 percent, driven by a strong Nokia 
      device portfolio as well as the addition of nine new Windows Phone 
      partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Kabam is a leader in free-to-play games with a strong record of 
      delivering game experiences that people love,&#8221; said Steven Guggenheimer, 
      corporate vice president and chief evangelist, Developer eXperience and 
      evangelism, Microsoft Corp. &#8220;Bringing its existing franchise games as 
      well as future hit titles makes the Windows ecosystem even more robust. 
      In return Kabam will enjoy unmatched monetization opportunities, such as 
      our industry-leading 61 carrier billing connections in 36 markets.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Kabam is eager to take advantage of the increasing popularity of 
      Windows devices,&#8221; said Kabam Senior Vice President of Business 
      Development Mike DeLaet. &#8220;By combining unique Microsoft technologies and 
      merchandising opportunities with our robust games, Kabam and Microsoft 
      will drive new types of innovation that will attract new gamers 
      globally.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Terms of the partnership are not disclosed. However, the companies said 
      Microsoft will feature all new Kabam games and major updates, and Kabam 
      will include the Windows Store badge alongside other platform partners 
      in its marketing and promotion of Kabam games.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kabam has experienced massive growth since its founding as a games 
      company a little more than four years ago. The company now has more than 
      800 employees in offices throughout North America, Europe and Asia.

      Research and Markets: Global Network Analytics Market 2014-2018 with 
      Cisco, Danaher, HP, IBM, JDSU Uniphase  Procera Networks Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/tn78cf/global_network) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Network Analytics Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Network Analytics market will grow at a CAGR of 
      27.64% over the period 2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Network analytics solutions enable network managers to gain a deep 
      understanding of what is happening on their networks through improved 
      visibility and monitoring. Network analytics focuses on network and 
      equipment performance to enable mobile operators to identify network 
      issues in advance. With the help of network analytics solutions 
      operators can manage and enhance the user experience. Network analytics 
      solutions are primarily deployed in the following sectors: Telecom, 
      BFSI, Cloud Service Providers, and Healthcare.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Increasing adoption of cloud computing techniques in all sectors is 
      generating demand for network analytics solutions. The deployment of 
      network solutions predicts the readiness of the network to support cloud 
      computing, which, in turn, helps to prevent potential deployment issues 
      and infrastructure delays. Network analytics solutions provide analysis 
      of key attributes and identify core areas of network infrastructure that 
      require optimization; this analysis helps in mitigating business risks 
      and unanticipated costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, increased demand for network control and 
      optimization is one of the main drivers. Increased usage of mobile 
      devices and the growing access to app stores via mobile devices have 
      increased network traffic considerably. As network traffic is 
      increasing, the demand for network analytics solutions to manage the 
      traffic efficiently on a network has also gone up.

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, June 5 (Reuters) - Local bond underwriting and
mergers and acquisitions deals are likely to propel capital
markets activity in Brazil this year, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's top
executive in the country said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Such activity could help offset a tepid deal flow in a year
marked by the impact of slowing growth and a presidential
election.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Jos&#233; Berenguer, who is JPMorgan's senior
country officer in Brazil, "there are good opportunities for who
is looking for long-term opportunities, but in the meantime the
better options are debt capital markets and M" An improvement
in other markets segments such as equity offerings will also
depend on a better global outlook, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazilians elect a new president this October.

	"For the first time in the history of the cable industry, cable TV companies are dropping networks owned by a large content company.

	Viacom demanded such a large increase in monthly fees that the cable companies decided to stop carrying those channels. That is a big deal because it has never happened before," explained Gessner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PODGORICA (Reuters) - Customs officers in Montenegro have seized 250 kilograms of cocaine smuggled beneath a shipment of bananas, authorities said on Thursday, in what was described as the biggest drugs haul ever in the Adriatic republic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vladan Jokovic, the head of Montenegro's Customs Authority, said the cocaine was worth about 12.5 million euros ($17 million) and was seized on Wednesday in the southern port of Bar, a well known transit route for South American drugs heading to Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ship was carrying bananas from Ecuador to Montenegro's neighbor, Albania. Montenegro, a former Yugoslav republic of some 680,000 people, sits on a well-trodden route for drug smugglers trying to reach lucrative markets in western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The cocaine was found ... in a special compartment under the floor of a shipping container loaded with bananas," Jokovic told reporters, saying it was the biggest ever drugs haul in the country.

			Sutherland reaches milestone of providing free computer skills 
      training to 25,000 participants under Microsoft sponsored Community 
      Technology Center program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sutherland Global Services was recognized May 20, 2014, by Microsoft 
      Corp. at their annual Global Supplier Conference for achieving the 
      milestone of training 25,000 people through the Community Technology 
      Center (CTC) training program, a Microsoft YouthSpark program. 
      Sutherland&#8217;s participation in this program began in 2007. The mission of 
      CTC program is to provide free training in basic computer concepts and 
      skills for people in underserved communities. Every successful 
      participant receives a Microsoft Digital Literacy Certificate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In the first year of partnering with Microsoft on this program, we 
      served 1,200 people, seven years later more than 25,000 have completed 
      the program,&#8221; said Dan Lang, SVP Sutherland Global Services and Head of 
      Sutherland&#8217;s Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Board. &#8220;That&#8217;s 25,000 
      new skilled candidates, 25,000 improved career opportunities, and 25,000 
      lives changed. We are proud of our accomplishments together with 
      Microsoft and we look forward to the continued growth of the program in 
      the months and years to come.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The CTC program is a key initiative in Sutherland&#8217;s Corporate Social 
      Responsibility mission to strengthen the technical knowledge base of 
      local, underserved communities. The digital literacy curriculum consists 
      of course material and software provided by Microsoft and taught by 
      Sutherland trainers at Sutherland-equipped facilities. Participants 
      receive comprehensive learning under the guidance of experienced 
      trainers in classrooms fully equipped with multimedia enabled computers, 
      internet access, printers and digital teaching aids.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      in this and other press releases, in presentations, filings with the 
      Securities and Exchange Commission (&#8220;SEC&#8221;), reports to stockholders and 
      in meetings with investors and analysts. All statements in this press 
      release, other than statements of historical information provided 
      herein, may be deemed to be forward-looking statements and as such are 
      intended to be covered by the safe harbor for &#8220;forward-looking 
      statements&#8221; provided by PSLRA. These statements are based on 
      management&#8217;s analysis, judgment, belief and expectation only as of the 
      date hereof, and are subject to changes in circumstances and a number of 
      risks and uncertainties. Without limiting the foregoing, statements

      &#8220;projects&#8221; and other similar expressions are intended to identify 
      forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from 
      those expressed in, or implied or projected by the forward-looking 
      information and statements due to, among other things, health care 
      reform and other increased government participation in and taxation or 
      regulation of health benefits and managed care operations, including but 
      not limited to the implementation of the Patient Protection and 
      Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act 
      of 2010 (collectively, the "ACA") and related fees, assessments and 
      taxes; the company&#8217;s ability to successfully participate in California&#8217;s 
      Coordinated Care Initiative, which is subject to a number of risks 
      inherent in untested health care initiatives and requires the company to 
      adequately predict the costs of providing benefits to individuals that 
      are generally among the most chronically ill within each of Medicare and 
      Medi-Cal and implement delivery systems for benefits with which the 
      company has limited operating experience; the company&#8217;s ability to 
      successfully participate in the federal and state health insurance 
      exchanges under the ACA, which have experienced technical challenges in 
      implementation and which involve uncertainties related to the mix and 
      volume of business that could negatively impact the adequacy of our 
      premium rates and may not be sufficiently offset by the risk 
      apportionment provisions of the ACA; increasing health care costs, 
      including but not limited to costs associated with the introduction of 
      new treatments or therapies; our ability to reduce administrative 
      expenses while maintaining targeted levels of service and operating 
      performance; negative prior period claims reserve developments; rate 
      cuts and other risks and uncertainties affecting the company&#8217;s Medicare 
      or Medicaid businesses; the company&#8217;s ability to successfully 
      participate in Arizona&#8217;s Medicaid program; trends in medical care 
      ratios; membership declines or negative changes in our health care 
      product mix; unexpected utilization patterns or unexpectedly severe or 
      widespread illnesses; the timing of collections on amounts receivable 
      from state and federal governments and agencies, including collections 
      of amounts owed under the T-3 contract; litigation costs; regulatory 
      issues with federal and state agencies including, but not limited to, 
      the California Department of Managed Health Care, the Centers for 
      Medicare  Medicaid Services, the Office of Civil Rights of the U.S. 
      Department of Health and Human Services and state departments of 
      insurance; operational issues; changes in economic or market conditions 
      including a further decline in the economy; failure to effectively 
      oversee our third-party vendors; noncompliance by the company or the 
      company&#8217;s business associates with any privacy laws or any security 
      breach involving the misappropriation, loss or other unauthorized use or 
      disclosure of confidential information; impairment of the company&#8217;s 
      goodwill or other intangible assets; investment portfolio impairment 
      charges; volatility in the financial markets; liabilities incurred in 
      connection with the company&#8217;s divested operations; and general business 
      and market conditions. Additional factors that could cause actual 
      results to differ materially from those reflected in the forward-looking 
      statements include, but are not limited to, the risks discussed in the 
      &#8220;Risk Factors&#8221; section included within the company&#8217;s most recent Annual 
      Report on Form 10-K and subsequent Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed

			Global Microsoft Dynamics CRM partner wins award for innovation using 
      Microsoft CRM technologies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hitachi Solutions today announced it has won the 2014 Microsoft CRM 
      Partner of the Year Award. The company was honored among a global field 
      of top Microsoft Corp. partners for demonstrating excellence in 
      innovation and implementation of customer solutions based on Microsoft 
      technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the maturity of Microsoft Dynamics CRM and its partner ecosystem, 
      the competition was much more difficult today than it was in 2011 when 
      we last won CRM Partner of the Year Award. Although the competition is 
      much stronger this year, so are we,&#8221; said Mike Gillis, President and 
      Global Chief Operating Officer, Hitachi Solutions America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Hitachi Solutions&#8217; thriving Microsoft Dynamics CRM practice combined 
      with the Microsoft Dynamics CRM product expertise, market share, and 
      financial services industry focus of our newly acquired partner Customer 
      Effective positioned us as a frontrunner in this competition; however, I 
      think what really pushed us to the top is our passion for customers and 
      the infectious energy of our people.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

 (Recasts, adds detail on rising Asia M volumes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, June 5 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has named
John Kim as its new head of mergers and acquisitions (M) for
Asia ex-Japan and will relocate Christos Tomaras from London to
join that team, amid surging deal volumes in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim takes over from Richard Campbell-Breeden, who will
become vice-chairman of the investment banking division for Asia
Pacific ex-Japan, and chairman of M for the region, according
to a memo seen by Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that role Campbell-Breeden will focus more on advising
the investment bank's most important clients in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointments come as Asia Pacific M volumes have
surged almost 88 percent to $298 billion so far this year from a
year ago, according to Thomson Reuters data. That makes it the
best start to the year on record, surpassing 2008, the data
show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased activity has also pushed up the Asian share of
global M to 20.3 percent from 18.4 percent a year ago, the
data shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong, where Goldman Sachs is reinforcing its M team,
has been particularly busy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's CITIC Pacific Ltd in May announced a
landmark deal to buy $36 billion of assets from its state-owned
parent CITIC Group Corp, China's biggest and oldest financial
conglomerate..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next biggest Asian acquisition this year is Singaporean
state investor Temasek Holding's $5.6 billion purchase
of a 24.9 percent stake in Hong Kong's A.S. Watson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third largest also involves Hong Kong, with Singapore's
Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp buying Hong Kong's Wing
Hang bank in April for $4.95 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim, who was Goldman's co-country head of South Korea and
joined the firm in 2000, is moving to Hong Kong from Seoul, the
U.S.-based investment bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs confirmed the content of the memo.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc appointed Gregory Penner as vice chairman, showing again that the world's largest retailer is looking at younger executives to revive its fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The appointment of 44-year-old Penner puts him in a position to succeed Chairman Rob Walton, his 69-year-old father-in-law. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penner, who has been on Wal-Mart's board since 2008, is a general partner at Madrone Capital Partners, according to Wal-Mart's website. From 2002 to 2005, he was Wal-Mart's senior vice president and the chief financial officer of its Japan unit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement, made in Wal-Mart's annual shareholder meeting on Friday, comes at a time when the company's U.S. same-store sales are falling and it struggles to get beyond a bribery scandal at its Mexico unit that cost it more than $500 million since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart is also facing increasing dissent from its employees who, backed by unions, are demanding higher wages, better benefits and more full-time jobs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company appointed Doug McMillon, 47, as its chief executive in November to help stanch the fall in sales and improve its image following the Mexico scandal. He took the helm in February, replacing 64-year-old Mike Duke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart said on Friday it was doubling down on small-format stores, typically one quarter the size of its supercenters, to broaden its customer base and fend off aggressive rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which operates nearly 350 smaller stores, said it would build 200 more Neighborhood Market stores and 80-100 Wal-Mart Express stores this fiscal year, Wal-Mart U.S. business head Bill Simon said in the shareholder meeting.        There have been concerns about how Wal-Mart is dealing with its core low-income customer base, which has struggled with a cut in food stamps and higher gas prices, and online competition from Amazon.com.    The company also said it would move fast on investing in technology to boost sales in e-commerce, its fastest growing business.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move to appoint Penner as heir apparent highlights the Walton family's attempts to reinforce its control over the company founded by Rob Walton's father, Sam Walton. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Walton family controlled 51 percent of Wal-Mart as of April 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment aroused shareholder concerns about the company's indifference to growing criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some shareholders proposed the appointment of an independent chairman and sought disclosures on whether the company had recovered pay from executives involved in frauds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also sought transparency on whether the company was lobbying against a federal proposal to raise minimum wages. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These demands were voted down on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no chance a (shareholder) proposal will be approved given the controlling stake of the Walton family," CtW Investment Group analyst Michael Pryce-Jones told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pryce-Jones, however, said Wal-Mart would find it difficult to ignore shareholder concerns as its performance suffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CtW Investment works with pension funds who own 4 million shares of Wal-Mart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart's shares closed at $77.21 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Kirti Pandey and Don Sebastian)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects CEO Doug McMillon's age to 47 from 40 in paragraph 7)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Siddharth Cavale and Sruthi Ramakrishnan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 6 (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc appointed
Gregory Penner as vice chairman, showing again that the world's
largest retailer is looking at younger executives to revive its
fortunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment of 44-year-old Penner puts him in a position
to succeed Chairman Rob Walton, his 69-year-old father-in-law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penner, who has been on Wal-Mart's board since 2008, is a
general partner at Madrone Capital Partners, according to
Wal-Mart's website. From 2002 to 2005, he was Wal-Mart's senior
vice president and the chief financial officer of its Japan
unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement, made at Wal-Mart's annual shareholder
meeting on Friday, comes at a time when the company's U.S.
same-store sales are falling and it struggles to get beyond a
bribery scandal at its Mexico unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The scandal has cost the company more than $500 million
since 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart is also facing increasing dissent from its
employees who, backed by unions, are demanding higher wages,
better benefits and more full-time jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company appointed Doug McMillon, 47, as its chief
executive in November to help stanch the fall in sales and
improve its image following the Mexico scandal. He took the helm
in February, replacing 64-year-old Mike Duke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEEP IT IN THE FAMILY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move to appoint Penner as heir apparent highlights the
Walton family's attempts to reinforce its control over the
company founded by Rob Walton's father, Sam Walton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appointment aroused shareholder concerns about the
company's indifference to growing criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Walton family controlled 51 percent of Wal-Mart as of
April 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its annual meeting, some shareholders proposed the
appointment of an independent chairman and sought disclosures on
whether the company had recovered pay from executives involved
in frauds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also sought transparency on whether the company was
lobbying against a federal proposal to raise minimum wages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These demands were voted down at Friday's meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no chance a (shareholder) proposal will be approved
given the controlling stake of the Walton family," CtW
Investment Group analyst Michael Pryce-Jones told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pryce-Jones, however, said Wal-Mart would now find it more
difficult to ignore shareholder concerns as its performance
suffers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CtW Investment works with pension funds who own 4 million
shares of Wal-Mart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart's shares were little changed at $77.46 on Friday
afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;(Recasts with the venture statement)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ALMATY, June 6 (Reuters) - The troubled Kashagan oil
development has named an executive from U.S. firm Exxon Mobil
 to run the venture while also streamlining its
complicated structure in an attempt to fix the beleaguered $50
billion project offshore Kazakhstan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group said on Friday Stephane de Mahieu, an Exxon
secondee, had become managing director as of May 1, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, it denied a report in industry publication Nefte
Compass that Exxon would take over as operator of Kashagan
saying that instead all seven oil firms involved will be
effectively operators through a rejigged venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The appointment of an ExxonMobil secondee to managing
director does not mean that Exxon is taking over the
operatorship of North Caspian Sea Production Sharing Agreement,"
a spokesman for the venture Hans Wenck said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After delays and cost overruns, production at Kashagan - one
of the world's biggest finds of the past decades - finally
started last September but was halted in early October after the
discovery of gas leaks in the pipeline network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil output may not restart until early 2016, Kazakh
officials said in May, urging foreign partners to start
replacing leaky pipelines at the deposit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy's Eni was given the job of operating the
project in 2001. It later lost its role as the sole lead
operator following major delays and cost overruns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kashagan shareholders are Eni, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch
Shell, France's Total and Kazakh state oil
company Kazmunaigas, each with 16.8 percent, and Japan's Inpex
and China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) as junior
partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The seven firms will continue to oversee the managing
director.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But under the new scheme, the reformed joint venture, run by
the managing director, will be responsible for drilling, 
development and production at the same time, whilst in the past
those responsibilities were split in a complicated way between
Eni, Kazmunaigas, Shell and Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No changes to the production sharing agreement or the
project's ownership structure are envisioned as a result of the
planned transition, the venture said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Working "under one umbrella" means that workflows will be
more efficient, Wenck said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The field was meant to be producing 370,000 barrels per day
at the peak of the first phase which is likely to be achieved
only a few years after the field restart.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan's new solo head of its investment bank said he would be "laser focused" on reducing costs as the industry is likely to face a tough couple of years in terms of growing revenues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"For the next year or two the industry's top-line will probably struggle. The long-term trends are good, but in the short term we need to adjust to the new reality," said Daniel Pinto, London-based chief executive of the corporate and investment bank (CIB) at JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., the biggest U.S. bank by assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rivals including Barclays and UBS are in the process of shrinking their investment banks in a bid to slash costs, after a slump in trading revenues over the past year and tougher regulations are forcing banks to hold more capital and making some areas unprofitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pinto, who took sole charge of CIB in March after running it for two years with Michael Cavanagh, said there would be no big change in strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to be laser focused at looking at every item of cost, every item of capital and liquidity," he told Reuters on the sidelines of the Institute of International Finance's spring meeting. "In this environment, you need to be really efficient in every single thing you do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks have cut back less than European rivals and have won market share. While JPMorgan has retreated from physical commodities trading like some other banks, Pinto said JPMorgan's model was based on scale, a full product offer and global reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no doubt that everything banks do is more costly in terms of capital, controls, liquidity and everything. If you don't have the scale it's more difficult to absorb fixed costs.  Cutting parts of the business may not work - you may cut an area that's not profitable today, but a client will want to trade it the next quarter," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said savings can come from improving efficiency in processes, locations and technology, and compensation was likely to come down across the industry given banks' lower revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he added the bank would still be able to pay competitively and make good returns to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a people business, and in order to have the best you need to pay well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinto, 51, has spent his career at JPMorgan and companies the bank subsequently acquired. The Argentinian is seen, along with chief operating officer Matthew Zames, as a potential successor to CEO Jamie Dimon - who is one of the longest serving bank bosses but is not expected to step down any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISK APPETITE WANES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said on May 2 that second quarter revenue from bond and equity trading was on track to decline around 20 percent from a year ago, based on lower client activity. Analysts expect other banks to show a similar drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In general we are continuing with the same guidance," said Pinto, adding that investors' appetite for risk had been diminished by some big calls taken at the start of the year that went wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you start a year like that, you end up in a situation where risk appetite is low," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors misjudged bets earlier this year on U.S. growth due to the impact of bad weather, the performance of cyclical stocks, and a sharp bounce in some emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pinto said he was bullish on growth prospects for emerging markets, but JPMorgan's expansion in some countries may be slowed by the need to implement tougher controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; "In the short-term, until we are fully adjusted to consent orders, new controls and regulations, we have been going slower in certain countries," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's CIB business has 52,000 staff in 60 countries and made an underlying profit of $9.7 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had revenues of $24.7 billion last year, ranking first with a 13.4 percent share across the top 13 banks, according to consultancy Tricumen, compared to revenue of $29 billion in 2009 and a market share of 12.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its underlying return on equity across CIB was 17 percent last year and has been between 15 and 19 percent in each of the last four years, well ahead of most rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Sophie Walker)&lt;/p&gt;

      Non-GMO Foods: Global Market Perspective
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The global market for non-GMO foods and beverages, products made without 
      the use of any ingredients from genetically modified organisms (GMOs), 
      is in a period of intense change. In Europe, consumer rejection of foods 
      made using GMO ingredients has caused many of the leading international 
      food companies such as Unilever, Nestle, and Coca-Cola to introduce or 
      develop non-GMO versions of their products. Such giant international 
      food manufacturers are eager to please French, Italian, and other 
      European consumers who have made it clear they don't want GMO 
      ingredients in their food.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At the same time, many of these same companies and other food industry 
      giants, such as Pepsi and General Mills, have contributed millions of 
      dollars either directly or through their trade organization the Grocery 
      Manufacturers Association to the ongoing campaigns in the U.S. to 
      prevent mandatory labeling of foods with GMO ingredients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Throughout the world, at least 60 countries have adopted some type of 
      labeling that notifies consumers there is some percentage of GMO 
      ingredients present in the product, while around 130 countries have no 
      labeling regulation'at least for the present.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Packaged Facts' report Non-GMO Foods: Global Market Perspective looks at 
      the evolving situation in the worldwide market for non-GMO foods; the 
      actions being taken by key stakeholders, including consumers, farmers, 
      governments, and non-governmental organizations; as well as the trends 
      and developments of the products themselves. In addition, the report 
      provides an estimate of the global market for non-GMO foods and 
      beverages in 2012 and a projection for 2017.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2014 North America Effie Effectiveness Index rankings were revealed 
      last night at the 46th annual Effie Awards Gala in New York. 
      Starcom MediaVest Group was named both the most effective agency network 
      and individual agency office, the first time a media agency has topped 
      the North American Effie Index rankings since it was launched in 2011. 
      Its parent company, Publicis Groupe, was named the most effective 
      holding company. For the gala finale, Dove Real Beauty Sketches - 
      Winning back Dove Love for Unilever by Ogilvy Brasil and Edelman was 
      revealed as the North American Grand Effie winner (best in show) for the 
      2014 Effie Awards competition. PHD UK and Mindshare contributed to the 
      win.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since 1968, Effie Worldwide has honored marketing ideas that work. The 
      Effie Index identifies and ranks the marketing communications industry&#8217;s 
      most effective agencies, marketers and brands by analyzing finalist and 
      winner data from worldwide Effie Award competitions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the fourth consecutive year, Procter  Gamble is the most effective 
      marketer in North America. Dove is the most effective brand and 
      Cramer-Krasselt is most effective independently held advertising agency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The North American Grand Effie Award winner was deliberated by the Grand 
      Effie Jury. Finalists (the top scoring Gold Effie Award winners) 
      included the Grand Effie winner, along with Generation Know for 
      Kimberly-Clark&#8217;s U by Kotex by Ogilvy  Mather New York (with Geometry 
      Global, Organic, Inc., Marina Maher Communications and Mindshare), It's 
      Not Complicated for ATT by BBDO Atlanta and BBDO New York, (with 
      FleishmanHillard), Pantene Weather Program for Procter  Gamble 
      by Leo Burnett/Arc Worldwide and Starcom MediaVest Group (with Grey New 
      York and DeVries Global), Pedophile Deterrence Program for Thorn 
      by Goodby, Silverstein  Partners, Recalling 1993 for the New 
      Museum by Droga5 and ZzzQuil Sleep-Aid Launch for Procter  
      Gamble by Publicis Kaplan Thaler, (with Starcom MediaVest Group).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the Dove Real Beauty Sketches Effie entry, &#8220;only 4% of 
      women believe they are beautiful. How could Dove inspire to the other 
      96% to think differently? We discovered the barrier to her feeling 
      beautiful had fundamentally changed, and launched Dove Real Beauty 
      Sketches: a social experiment that introduced women to her inner critic, 
      proving they were more beautiful than they thought. It won back Dove 
      Love by lifting womens&#8217; esteem and drove $24 million incremental sales, 
      a 550% ROI, and $52 million in earned media-in under 5 months.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There were strong contenders for this year&#8217;s North American Grand Effie 
      Award, but the jury agreed that Dove Real Beauty Sketches seemed to have 
      it all,&#8221; said Judy John CEO and Chief Creative Officer Leo Burnett, 
      Canada and member of the 2014 Grand Effie Jury. &#8220;The work demonstrated 
      how the power of ideas can influence society and lift brands.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the 2014 North America Effie Effectiveness Index, the top 
      ranking most effective marketers are Procter  Gamble, Kimberly-Clark 
      and Unilever, while the highest ranked effective brands are Dove, U by 
      Kotex and IBM. The most effective advertising holding companies in North 
      America are: Publicis Groupe, WPP Group and Omnicom, and the most 
      effective agency networks are Starcom MediaVest Group, Ogilvy  Mather 
      and BBDO Worldwide. The three most effective agency offices are Starcom 
      MediaVest Group (Chicago), Ogilvy  Mather (New York), Leo Burnett/Arc 
      Worldwide (Chicago), and the most effective independent agencies are 
      Cramer-Krasselt, Droga5 and Wieden+Kennedy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "There are a number of familiar names in the winners list but what is 
      striking, and exciting, is to see&#160;a media company at the top of the 
      Effie Index. It's indicative of just how much our industry landscape has 
      changed,&#8221; said Carl Johnson, Effie Worldwide Chairman and Founding 
      Partner of Anomaly. &#8220;A brand&#8217;s success can be driven by any form of 
      marketing communications executed with excellence, whether that be all 
      things digital, PR, brand activations or even advertising!"
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Green Dot Supports Visa&#8217;s New Prepaid Card Designation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Company&#8217;s Industry-Leading Commitment to Transparency and Consumer 
      Protection Aligns with Visa&#8217;s New Guidelines for Reloadable Prepaid Cards
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Green Dot Corporation (NYSE:GDOT) today announced its support of Visa&#8217;s recently 
      announced designation for consumer reloadable prepaid products in 
      the U.S. The new designation is aimed at simplifying fees, improving 
      consumer protections and creating opportunities for cardholders to 
      improve their financial health. Green Dot Corporation is the largest 
      provider of reloadable prepaid debit cards in America with its products 
      sold in more than 90,000 retail locations nationwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Visa has chosen guidelines for their designation that align perfectly 
      with how Green Dot has always structured our fee plans,&#8221; said Steve 
      Streit, Green Dot&#8217;s Chairman and CEO. &#8220;We believe it's important for the 
      prepaid card industry to provide affordable, fair products with clear 
      and easy to understand fee disclosures. We applaud Visa's announcement 
      and hope to see the rest of the industry adopt these guidelines."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To qualify for the new Visa prepaid designation, prepaid programs must 
      meet a set of standards outlined by Visa that relate to simplified fees 
      and transparent disclosures as well as superior consumer protections. 
      Cards that meet these requirements will receive a seal that will be 
      visible on card packaging and materials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Green Dot issues and manages multiple prepaid card programs, including 
      the award-winning Green Dot Everyday Gold Prepaid Visa, which was named 
      &#8220;Best Card for Alternative Checking Account&#8221; in Card Hub&#8217;s 2013

      Research and Markets: Global Embedded Software Market 2014-2018 with 
      Enea AB, GreenHills Software Inc, Intel Corp, Microsoft Corp Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/bhdrn8/global_embedded) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Embedded Software Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Global Embedded Software market will grow at a CAGR of 8.79% 
      over the period 2013-2018
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Embedded software is computer programming written on computer chips that 
      is applied in real-time systems like teller machines, missiles, and 
      airplanes. Moreover, it is software which is combined or stored in 
      computer hardware or a peripheral device.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This software is usually developed for special-purpose hardware that 
      uses real-time operating systems such as LynxOS, VxWorks, Linux (with 
      patched kernel), ThreadX, Windows CE, Fusion RTOS, and Integrity. Once 
      embedded and implemented into hardware, the software cannot be altered 
      by a user.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the main drivers in this market is the increasing demand for 
      smartphones and tablets. Embedded software is used in the development of 
      microcontrollers and ICs. It provides users with additional 
      entertainment and communication features that are now the major buying 
      criteria for consumers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges confronting 
      this market is the issues related to data security and privacy. As a 
      large volume of data is digitized and enterprises have to deal with very 
      confidential data, data security and privacy issues are a challenge for 
      the vendors in the Global Embedded Software market.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil
 is in line to take over as operator of the giant
Kashagan field in an attempt to fix the beleaguered $50 billion
project offshore Kazakhstan, industry publication Nefte Compass
reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discussions are continuing but Exxon could be appointed as
soon as at the end of June, the newsletter quoted a senior
Kazakh official as saying. Exxon was not immediately available
for comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy's Eni was given the job of operating the
project in 2001. It later lost its role as the sole lead
operator following major delays and cost overruns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Production finally started last September but was halted in
early October after the discovery of gas leaks in the pipeline
network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil output may now not restart until early 2016, Kazakh Oil
and Gas Minister Uzakbai Karabalin said in May, urging foreign
partners to start replacing leaky pipelines at the deposit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could take another two-three years for the field to reach
the targeted plateau output of 370,00 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kashagan shareholders are Eni, Exxon Mobil, Royal Dutch
Shell, France's Total and Kazakh state oil
company Kazmunaigas, each with 16.8 percent, and Japan's Inpex
and China National Petroleum Corp. (CNPC) as junior
partners.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 9 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Asset Management
 has hired Christoph von Reiche from rival Goldman Sachs
Asset Management (GSAM) as head of Europe for its
institutional business, the company said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Von Reiche will take on a newly created role at the fund
management subsidiary and will split his time between London and
Frankfurt. He was previously head of GSAM's insitutional
business in Germany and Austria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan Asset Management, which has some $1.6 trillion of
assets under management, said von Reiche's experience would help
the company respond to a growing desire from clients to invest
in a broader range of asset classes.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, June 10 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp will
work with Chinese Internet security specialist Qihoo 360
Technology Co on mobile Internet and artificial
intelligence technology, state media reported, as the U.S.
software giant fights security concerns in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Qihoo on Monday signed a deal to "cooperate in
mobile Internet products" and "technology exchanges in
artificial intelligence", the official Xinhua news agency
reported, citing the Microsoft Search Technology Center Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tie-up with Qihoo, known for its security software,
mobile application store and search engine, comes as Microsoft
struggles with scrutiny from China's government and state-owned
businesses over the security of its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. technology companies are battling anti-American
sentiment in China. Firms like Microsoft, Apple Inc and
Google Inc have been accused by state media of working
with the U.S. government in cyber-espionage, with doubts raised
about their products' security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Qihoo declined to provide immediate comment on
the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has suffered a string of setbacks in China. Last
month, China's central government procurement office issued a
notice that new computers would not be allowed to have its
latest Windows 8 operating system installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State media have also pitched in, calling last week for
"severe punishment" for Microsoft and other tech firms for
acting as "lackeys" of the U.S. government. 
State broadcaster CCTV broadcast a special segment on Windows 8
which said the operating system was not secure and could be used
to access private data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft's Craig Mundie, former chief strategy
officer and now a senior adviser to the firm, met senior
officials from China's State Council Information Office (SCIO)
and discussed Internet security issues, according to the SCIO
website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paul Carsten; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled on Monday that children waiting with their parents for immigration visas must go to the back of the line once they reach the age of 21.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The court was divided 5-4 in deciding that only in limited circumstances does federal immigration law allow for children to retain their place in line after they become adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case concerns a program that allows people who are U.S. citizens or legal residents to sponsor relatives who live overseas. People often have to wait for years for approval of their visa applications and the number of visas available is capped each year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The litigation is unconnected to recent reports of unaccompanied children crossing the U.S. border illegally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court endorsed the federal government's interpretation of the law, which was that only children of permanent U.S. residents were eligible to keep their place in line once they reached the age of 21. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was brought by two groups of plaintiffs, including Rosalina Cuellar de Osorio, who was told in November 2005 that her family was at the front of the line to obtain visas to enter the United States from El Salvador. The family was told at the time that her son, Melvin, who had turned 21 just months earlier, would no longer be eligible. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court decided to hear the issue after the San Francisco-based 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in September 2012 that a broader category of visa applicants was eligible than had been argued by the administration of President Barack Obama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The five justices in the majority were split over which legal rationale to adopt. Justice Elena Kagan, who wrote the majority opinion, was joined in full by only Justices Anthony Kennedy and Ruth Bader Ginsburg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kagan wrote that when a statute is unclear, the court was required to defer to the interpretation offered by the government. Chief Justice John Roberts and Justice Antonin Scalia agreed with the judgment but offered a different rationale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who, like Kagan, was appointed by Obama, wrote in a dissenting opinion that the law was clearer than the majority suggested and that the case should have been decided with a "commonsense approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Scialabba v. de Osorio, U.S. Supreme Court, No. 12-930.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Howard Goller and Bernadette Baum)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, June 9 (Reuters) - Guard Capital Management, a
hedge fund start-up by two top traders formerly with Goldman
Sachs and Noble Group, is aiming to launch next month and has
hired at least four executives, one person with knowledge of the
matter said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hedge fund is being led by Leland Lim, who was the
co-head of macro trading for Asia Pacific ex-Japan at Goldman
Sachs Group Inc, and Allan Bedwick, the former head of
macro trading in Asia for Noble Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The launch comes as the first signs of recover in the
industry surfaces after six tough years for capital raising.
Asia-focused hedge funds added $20 billion in 2013, their first
asset growth in three years, according to data from AsiaHedge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hong Kong-based macro hedge fund has hired Matthew
Edwards from Grosvenor Capital Management as head of business
development, while Freda Chan, the former chief operating
officer of fund of hedge funds Vision Investment, has joined as
the head of operations, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bin Gao, a former BofA Merrill Lynch rates strategist, has
joined as head of strategy. Sean Giefing, who worked at Nomura
Holdings in London as well as hedge fund BlueCrest,
will head the trading team, the person added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The start-up capital of the fund was not immediately clear,
the person said, declining to be named as the matter remained
confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guard spokesman Matthew Edwards declined to comment on the
matter when asked by Reuters. The hedge fund is waiting for a
licence in Hong Kong to start operating.

U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Globalfoundries, which has its own plant in New York state

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM overtook Japan's Trend Micro Inc to become the world's No. 3 provider of security software last year, after acquiring cybersecurity firm Trusteer, according to market share data released on Tuesday by Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Symantec Corp and Intel Corp's McAfee retained their slots as the top two makers of security software in a market whose sales last year rose 4.9 percent to $19.9 billion (11.8 billion pounds), according to the annual survey by the Connecticut-based research firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's revenue from security software climbed 19 percent to $1.14 billion last year, Gartner said. In a deal announced last August, IBM paid close to $1 billion for Trusteer, whose products help businesses fight malicious software and cyber fraud, as part of an effort to boost its line of security offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Trend Micro's sales dropped 5.3 percent to $1.11 billion, according to the Gartner survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symantec's revenue fell 0.3 percent to $3.7 billion. The company replaced its CEO in March, marking the second time it has replaced its leader in two years as its board looks to stimulate revenue growth and its stock price. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McAfee's revenue rose 3.9 percent to $1.7 billion.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge has denied ExxonMobil Corp's  bid to dismiss a government lawsuit and instead ordered the oil giant to hand over documents going back decades on a pipeline that ruptured last year and inundated an Arkansas town with oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Kristine Baker ruled on Tuesday the company must hand over requested information on the entire 850-mile (1,370-km) Pegasus pipeline, which spilled about 5,000 barrels of crude oil in a residential neighborhood in Mayflower, Arkansas, in March 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also said ExxonMobil should speed up the handover of documents sought by the state's attorney general and the U.S. Department of Justice, which brought the case, and set a deadline of July 10.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had said it needed more time to go through millions of electronic and paper records to comply with requests from overlapping state and federal cases related to the spill. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The court understands the defendants have a large amount of discovery to produce. However, providing defendants an unduly long period of time to complete that discovery raises the possibility of prejudice to plaintiffs," Baker wrote.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon had argued it should only produce information going back to 2000, but Baker ordered the company release material dating back to 1988. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Baker rejected the oil company's motion to drop the suit brought by the state and federal government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkansas Attorney General Dustin McDaniel told Reuters the aim was to gather as much information as possible as the case heads toward trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 22 homes in Mayflower were evacuated after the oil slick swamped the town and nearby wetlands, flowing into a lake and the Arkansas River, the state claims in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arkansas is seeking civil penalties from the company for alleged violations of the federal Clean Water Act as well as state laws, claiming the oil spill contaminated land and waterways and potentially harmed public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil had no comment on the order, which the company has yet to fully review, spokesman Aaron Stryk said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. regulators said last year the leak in the nearly 70-year-old pipeline was likely caused by an original manufacturing defect. The 95,000-barrel-per-day pipeline is still shut down, Stryk said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA et al v. ExxonMobil Pipeline Company et al in the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Arkansas (Little Rock), No. 4:13-cv-00355-KGB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Mica Rosenberg; Editing by Howard Goller and Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;DALLAS, TX--(Marketwired - Jun 10, 2014) - 
				SoftLayer, an IBM Company, today unveiled Direct Link, a new service that allows customers to establish a dedicated network connection from their own IT infrastructure to the SoftLayer private network and cloud services. With faster and more consistent network performance, and higher data security, Direct Link brings customers new opportunities for creating hybrid-computing solutions that merge private infrastructure with the SoftLayer platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The power of a company's private infrastructure and internal applications increases exponentially when they are able to scale out onto the cloud. We have customers ranging from startups to enterprises, from SaaS providers to financial institutions that want to do just that," said Matt Chilek, chief technology officer for SoftLayer. "Direct Link helps them optimize their workloads and get more value out of their data. They can move both to and from SoftLayer as easily as if our bare metal and virtual servers and storage were part of their local area network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Services like Direct Link afford customers a broader range of options as they explore how to best leverage hybrid cloud," said Brad Casemore, IDC director of research, Data Center Networks. "Enterprises welcome choice and alternatives, and direct high-speed access can accommodate various hybrid workloads, while also offering use cases for backup, disaster recovery, and business continuity." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Direct Link consists of a physical, dedicated network connection from a customer's data center, office, or colocation facility to SoftLayer's data centers and private network through one of the company's 18 network Points of Presence (PoPs) around the world. These PoPs reside within facilities operated by SoftLayer partners including Equinix, Telx, Coresite, Terremark, Pacnet, InterXion and TelecityGroup, providing exceptional access for SoftLayer customers with infrastructure collocated in the same facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By eliminating the role of the public Internet for customers when connecting to the SoftLayer private network, Direct Link enables customers to completely control access to their infrastructure and services, the speed of their connection to SoftLayer, and how data is routed, providing:&lt;/p&gt;
			
				Higher network performance consistency and predictability
            
				Streamlined and accelerated workload and data migration
            
				Improved data and operational security

      Coca-Cola Celebrates a Summer of Sharing
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s summer campaign extends an invitation to America to &#8216;Share a 
      Coke.&#8217; For the first time in the U.S., Coca-Cola is personalizing the 
      sharing experience by swapping out some of its iconic logos on 20-ounce 
      bottles for 250 of the nation&#8217;s most popular names among teens and 
      Millennials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Across the Coca-Cola trademark &#8211; Coke&#174;, Diet Coke&#174; 
      and Coke Zero&#174; &#8211; the Company is inviting people to find their 
      name and the names of family, friends, colleagues, or even the names of 
      people they want to know better &#8230; and open a little extra happiness this 
      summer by sharing a Coke together.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola has been bringing people together for 128 years to create 
      moments of happiness,&#8221; said Stuart Kronauge, SVP, Sparkling Brands, 
      Coca-Cola North America. &#8220;Moments of happiness can define our lives. 
      They can be grand or intimate, shared or personal, fleeting or even 
      unassuming at times. We hope &#8216;Share a Coke&#8217; creates occasions between 
      people this summer where they can simply enjoy the moment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to first names featured on 20-ounce bottles, Coca-Cola, Diet 
      Coke and Coke Zero logos will give way to group names like &#8220;Family&#8221; and 
      &#8220;Friends&#8221; on 1.25- and 2-liter bottles, and 12-ounce cans will feature 
      colloquial nicknames like &#8220;BFF,&#8221; &#8220;Star,&#8221; &#8220;Bestie,&#8221; &#8220;Legend,&#8221; 
      &#8220;Grillmaster,&#8221; &#8220;Buddy&#8221; and &#8220;Wingman.&#8221; Eight-ounce glass bottle carriers 
      will also encourage &#8216;Share a Coke.&#8217; Coca-Cola Freestyle fountain 
      dispensers will also offer an option for sharing a little happiness this 
      summer. Fans who have the Coca-Cola Freestyle app on their mobile phone 
      can scan a QR code on the dispenser&#8217;s home screen, follow the prompts 
      and send a friend a coupon for a free 20-ounce Coke.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;ve seen the excitement &#8216;Share a Coke&#8217; has elicited around the world, 
      so we&#8217;re ecstatic to bring it to life here in the U.S. From baseball 
      games and barbeques, birthday and pool parties, to beach trips and 
      amusement park outings, we want to see how people &#8216;Share a Coke&#8217; and 
      we&#8217;re inviting them to share their stories with us in social media,&#8221; 
      said Jennifer Healan, Group Director, Integrated Marketing Content and 
      Design, Coca-Cola North America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Use the campaign&#8217;s hashtag, #ShareaCoke, to celebrate stories, share 
      photos and have a chance to be featured on Coca-Cola billboards across 
      the country and ShareaCoke.com gallery. Beginning June 12, fans can 
      experience the campaign online at www.shareacoke.com 
      by personalizing virtual bottles and sharing them with friends across 
      Facebook, tumblr, Twitter and Instagram. Website visitors also can find 
      out which names are available in-stores. For those unable to find 
      specific names on store shelves, &#8216;Share a Coke&#8217; will tour the nation 
      with more than 500 stops where people can customize a Coca-Cola mini can 
      (7.5-ounces) for themselves and a second can for someone special. 
      ShareaCoke.com will provide date and location information for the 
      cross-country tour.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The &#8216;Share a Coke&#8217; campaign will be supported through a nationwide 
      advertising and marketing campaign. This includes a nine-week flight 
      featuring all-new television commercials, cinema ads, social and digital 
      engagement, interactive/digital billboards and experiential activations 
      from coast to coast. For My Coke Rewards members, there are fun ways to 
      earn points, get rewards and &#8216;Share a Coke.&#8217;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The &#8216;Share a Coke&#8217; program was first introduced in Australia in 2012. 
      Since then, the Company has helped people &#8216;Share a Coke&#8217; &#8211; and a little 
      happiness &#8211; in over 50 countries around the world, including New 
      Zealand, Argentina, Brazil, South Africa, Great Britain, Turkey, 
      Germany, Spain and Chile.

		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;VSI's Post-Sales Field Service Management Solution Offers Real-Time, Sophisticated Integration With Microsoft Dynamics AX, Enabling Seamless Financial Data Exchange and Improved Business Operations&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI, OH--(Marketwired - Jun 10, 2014) -  Vertical Solutions, Inc. (VSI) announced today that its post-sales field service management solution, VServiceManagement&#8482;, has passed the Software Solution Test for Microsoft Dynamics AX, which is a major requirement for Certified for Microsoft Dynamics&#174; status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Certified for Microsoft Dynamics is Microsoft Corp.'s highest standard for partner-developed software. This certification represents a significant step in elevating the standard for partner-developed software solutions for industry-specific business applications. Solutions with a successful software test have demonstrated development quality and compatibility with the Microsoft Dynamics products. VeriTest, a service of Lionbridge, performed independent and rigorous testing on the solution's integration with Microsoft Dynamics. Vertical Solutions, Inc. has also earned the Microsoft Certified Partner designation with the ISV Competency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 R3 is built to deliver amazing experiences throughout an organization in a way that enables them to engage, connect, and interact with their customers and partners like never before," says Christian Pedersen, General Manager, Microsoft Dynamics AX. "It is great to see our partners such as VSI, build their Microsoft Dynamics AX practices and get certified with solutions that help businesses run agile operations that exceed customer needs and enable business growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As Industrial Equipment and other manufacturing companies look to add additional revenue streams to make up for slower sales, field service has become increasingly important in this sector. Large field sales organizations require a solution that is robust and offers customers integrated mobility options. Vertical Solutions' Field Service offering is an option our Microsoft Dynamics customers can consider as it gives them a rich set of features, integration with Microsoft Dynamics, and mobile capability," says Gilbert Garcia, Director US Dynamics Manufacturing Industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VSI's VServiceManagement&#8482; helps companies manage complex post-sales and field service environments efficiently, effectively, and profitably. The integration with Microsoft Dynamics AX enables companies to benefit from the native business logic and workflows of each system, yet share all service information with financial implications -- including entitlements, incurred costs, inventory, and invoicing -- in real time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to recent research from Gartner, Inc., the average reported time to return on investment (ROI) for field service applications is nine months.(1) Among the reasons cited in the research were technician efficiency, inventory management, faster invoicing, and customer satisfaction. When asked for the top three most-important reasons for selecting a vendor's field service solution, the ability to integrate to ERP was cited as the No. 1 reason the most. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Companies recognize that post-sales service management can strengthen operations, build tighter customer relationships, and enhance revenue opportunities. This integration between Microsoft Dynamics AX and VServiceManagement extends the value of both solutions," says Ron Wegmann, Sr., CEO, Vertical Solutions, Inc. "By achieving this important milestone, our joint customers can take their post-sales service operations to the next level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To build the integration, VSI used the Microsoft Application Integration Framework though VSI's VSM Connector, which enables VSM and Microsoft Dynamics AX to communicate and share data on a real-time basis using web services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Vertical Solutions, Inc.

			Chevron Increases Support for Niger Delta Partnership Initiative
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Five-year, $40 million grant brings Chevron support of economic 
      development and regional stability programs to $90 million since 2010
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) announced today that it is increasing 
      its support to the Niger Delta Partnership Initiative (NDPI) 
      Foundation. Chevron is committing an additional $40 million over five 
      years to expand a portfolio of programs and partnerships that have 
      successfully promoted economic development, improved the capacity of 
      civil society institutions, and helped reduced conflict in Nigeria&#8217;s 
      Niger Delta region since 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The additional funding brings the total social investment in NDPI to $90 
      million, the single largest in the corporation&#8217;s history.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Established in-part through a five-year, $50 million endowment by 
      Chevron in 2010, NDPI is a special purpose foundation designed to work 
      in partnership with other donors from the public and private sector, 
      creating dynamic, multi-stakeholder partnerships to collaboratively 
      support a range of projects designed to help reduce poverty and conflict 
      in the Niger Delta region.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron recognizes that our business is fundamentally linked to 
      economic prosperity, sustainable development and peaceful co-existence 
      in regions where we operate,&#8221; said Rhonda Zygocki, executive vice 
      president of Policy and Planning for Chevron Corporation. &#8220;The NDPI 
      partnership exemplifies Chevron&#8217;s approach to social investment and 
      further underscores the role the private sector can play in helping 
      build stronger, stable communities around the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This new financial commitment by Chevron, to be complemented by funding 
      from other donors and partners, will allow NDPI to continue building 
      upon its initial efforts to address the root causes of poverty and 
      conflict in the Niger Delta Region by expanding and scaling-up effective 
      partnerships and programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since 2010, NDPI has directly benefited more than 10,000 people in 
      Nigeria&#8217;s Niger Delta region, by creating more than 600 jobs and 
      supporting nearly 100 local businesses. The initiative has also trained 
      more than 5,500 local community members and development practitioners 
      and engaged 172 local partner organizations in the development and 
      implementation of its projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am extremely proud of what NDPI has accomplished since 2010,&#8221; said 
      Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and Latin America Exploration 
      and Production Company and chairman of the board of directors of the 
      NDPI Foundation. &#8220;There is, however, more work to do. This funding will 
      boost already successful efforts as the public and private sector 
      continue to work together to improve quality of life and create greater 
      prosperity in the region.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Partnering is at the core of what NDPI is all about,&#8221; said Dennis 
      Flemming, executive director of the NDPI Foundation. &#8220;Our goal is to 
      continue to engage partners from both the public and private sector 
      donor community to leverage this $40 million and enhance our projects in 
      ways that will create further substantive regional impact.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in this market is the 
      increasing focus on real-time decision making. The new generation of 
      business leaders and strategic decision makers require flexible 
      applications that can address complex and unpredictable business 
      decisions in real time. This is driving the demand for smart process 
      applications which offer collaborative business decisions in real time 
      as opposed to the traditional applications used for automation purposes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the operational issues stemming from the multi-vendor 
      approach. With the increasing number of vendors present in the market, 
      there is a growing complexity in the type of solutions being offered. 
      Moreover, organizations also face problems while integrating various 
      applications into a single solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A new trend being witnessed in the Global Smart Process Application is 
      the increasing demand for advanced analytics solutions is market. 
      Advanced analytics helps companies better understand the data generated 
      through various sources and use this understanding to gain insights into 
      consumer behavior. These insights help companies deal with a wide range 
      of areas that have significant potential to enhance operational success. 
      They also provide companies with a better understanding about why users 
      buy a particular application. Using these insights, companies can create 
      customer-driven marketing strategies by optimizing 
      advertisement-generated interactions. The top management in 
      organizations has also started using predictive and content analytics 
      for developing insights about the threats and customer preference.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;h1&gt;Arxan Application Protection Now Offered Through IBM&lt;/h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;New Layer of Security Provides Mobile Applications With Binary-Level Protection Against Hackers and Malware&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;BETHESDA, MD--(Marketwired - Jun 10, 2014) -  Arxan Technologies, the industry-leading provider of software security solutions that protect the App Economy today announced that Arxan's mobile application protection offerings will now be sold by IBM as part of its portfolio of security products. Arxan Application Protection for IBM Solutions&#8482; enables run-time protection, self-defense, and tamper-resistance inside mobile applications that run on all major platforms (including Apple iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Blackberry, and Tizen) by defending, detecting, and reacting to attacks and exploits. Enterprises and application developers are now able to leverage IBM's security solutions portfolio to build and keep applications secure with the seamless integration of App Hardening and Run-Time Protection into their mobile application security strategies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many leading application security consultancies and penetration testers recommend implementing protection against runtime manipulation and reverse engineering.&#160;Similar security advocacy is being echoed by respected analyst firms such as Gartner that states that, "for critical applications, such as transactional ones and sensitive enterprise applications, hardening should be used."1 Yet, according to OWASP (The Open Web Application Security Project), 86 percent of mobile apps that were tested lacked binary hardening, leaving them vulnerable to information disclosure and other exploits. This has led to OWASP identifying "Lack of Binary Protections" as part of its Top Ten Mobile Risks announcement in 2014.2 Moreover, recent research found that 78 percent of top mobile apps have been turned into hacked versions, showing how the hostile environment is now "the new normal" for un-protected apps.3&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to centralized web environments, mobile applications live "out in the wild," on a distributed, fragmented, and unregulated mobile device ecosystem. Binary code in mobile applications can be directly accessed, examined, modified, and exploited by attackers, if not properly protected. This new environment attracts a number of new threats that are addressed by Arxan's proprietary, binary-level "guard" technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Blocking hacking attacks on mobile applications requires a new layer of proactive security," said Mike Dager, CEO, Arxan Technologies. "Traditional application security practices alone, including safe coding practices, are no longer sufficient to protect mobile applications from these new binary vulnerabilities, as even flawless code can be reversed, modified, manipulated at run-time, or repackaged and distributed. With so much riding on pristine execution of applications, and so small a barrier for hackers to compromise the integrity and confidentiality of the applications, businesses are at significant risk for brand compromise, intellectual property loss or financial damage unless they include App Hardening and Run-Time Protection in their security approach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Arxan's App Hardening and Run-Time Protection serves a crucial role to protect applications from hackers and malicious exploits," said Caleb Barlow, Director of Application, Data and Mobile Security, IBM. "With the addition of Arxan, we offer clients a more integrated approach to security with a comprehensive solution portfolio from one vendor (IBM) to secure mobile applications. With IBM AppScan, we help clients build safe code during development and with Arxan, we help keep applications protected after their release and deployment out into the wild." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combination of IBM AppScan and Arxan, in particular, brings a unique 'Scan and Protect' strategy for mobile application security, thus enabling a consistent, scalable approach to securing sensitive applications holistically. Arxan Application Protection for IBM Solutions is available via IBM's standard customer purchasing programs, such as IBM Passport Advantage, through IBM sellers and business partners. Arxan Application Protection support will be provided by IBM (through its first-line support offering, IBM Elite Support) and Arxan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arxan Application Protection for IBM Solutions is available from IBM in two versions:  &lt;/p&gt;
			
				The "Consumer and ISV" version is for protecting external-facing applications, such as business-to-consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) applications, as well as packaged software applications produced by independent software vendors (ISVs)
            
				The "Enterprise Internal" version is for protecting internal-facing applications for employees and contractors of an enterprise (B2E applications)

More information is available here.&#160;A short video that provides additional information about the application risks and solution is provided here. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABOUT ARXAN TECHNOLOGIES
				Arxan protects the App Economy from attacks in distributed or untrusted environments with the world's strongest and most deployed application protection products. Among today's diverse computing platforms, mobile and tablet apps and packaged or embedded software are all exposed to hacking attacks such as reverse-engineering, tampering, insertion of malware/exploits, repackaging, fraud, intellectual property theft, and piracy. Arxan's unique patented Guarding technology enables sensitive or high-value applications to proactively guard their own integrity by defending, detecting, alerting, and reacting to hacking attacks through a risk-based, customized protection. Arxan's self-defending and tamper-proof applications are deployed on more than 300 million devices by leading Fortune 500 organizations in high-tech, ISV, financial services, digital media, gaming, healthcare, and other industries.

&lt;p&gt;June 10 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp plans to nearly
double its donation to Nigerian social projects over the next
five years, part of a choreographed plan to improve the local
economy and bolster the company's supply chain in the African
country, its second-largest source of crude oil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chevron is donating $40 million to the Niger Delta
Partnership Initiative (NDPI), a nonprofit it helped form in
2010 with $50 million in seed money. The second round of funding
will make NDPI the largest recipient of Chevron donations in the
company's history, executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NDPI works with local organizations in the Niger River
Delta to help cull HIV transmission rates, teach cassava farmers
marketing techniques and connect catfish breeders with feed
suppliers, among other projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The militant group Boko Haram, which is trying to create an
Islamic state in northern Nigeria and recently kidnapped more
than 200 girls, has had little effect on southern Nigeria and
the Delta, executives and analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, criminal gangs have stolen oil and kidnapped
residents for more than a decade in the Delta, risks that
Chevron and Royal Dutch Shell, the largest foreign oil
company in Nigeria, have had to address.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our objective is for peace in the Delta. And the best way
we can contribute to peace, in our view, is the way we're
participating in NDPI," said Rhonda Zygocki, Chevron's executive
vice president of policy and planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has pumped oil in Nigeria, Africa's largest energy
producer, for more than 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, the company pumped more crude oil in Nigeria than
any other country in which it operates besides the United
States, the second year in a row the country has held such
import for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's production, part of a partnership with Nigeria's
state-controlled oil company, has more than doubled in the past
seven years to 268,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day,
according to regulatory filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The NDPI operates in nine Nigerian states along the Gulf of
Guinea, though it is headquartered in the capital of Abuja, in
the country's geographic center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using the Chevron donation, NDPI finds small charities on
the ground and partners with them on various issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example, the nonprofit gave $59,978 to Forward Africa in
2011 for a project designed to help residents of Nigeria's Imo
and Abia states get more involved in local government. Forward
Africa contributed $5,672 of its funds for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While NPDI works with local banks to obtain financing for
some Nigerian projects, it tries to encourage local markets to
thrive without Chevron's influence, said Dennis Flemming, NDPI's
director&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We try not to distort a market when we do something here,"
Flemming said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron and foundation staff acknowledged that donations to
communities in areas where the company operates are expected,
though they said it is not part of a quid pro quo arrangement to
obtain access to energy reserves.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will work with Chinese Internet security specialist Qihoo 360 Technology Co (QIHU.N) on mobile Internet and artificial intelligence technology, state media reported, as the U.S. software giant fights security concerns in the country.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Qihoo on Monday signed a deal to "cooperate in mobile Internet products" and "technology exchanges in artificial intelligence", the official Xinhua news agency reported, citing the Microsoft Search Technology Center Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tie-up with Qihoo, known for its security software, mobile application store and search engine, comes as Microsoft struggles with scrutiny from China's government and state-owned businesses over the security of its products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. technology companies are battling anti-American sentiment in China. Firms like Microsoft, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google Inc (GOOGL.O) have been accused by state media of working with the U.S. government in cyber-espionage, with doubts raised about their products' security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Qihoo declined to provide immediate comment on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has suffered a string of setbacks in China. Last month, China's central government procurement office issued a notice that new computers would not be allowed to have its latest Windows 8 operating system installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State media have also pitched in, calling last week for "severe punishment" for Microsoft and other tech firms for acting as "lackeys" of the U.S. government. [ID:nL3N0OL0TT] State broadcaster CCTV broadcast a special segment on Windows 8 which said the operating system was not secure and could be used to access private data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft's Craig Mundie, former chief strategy officer and now a senior adviser to the firm, met senior officials from China's State Council Information Office (SCIO) and discussed Internet security issues, according to the SCIO website.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Paul Carsten; Editing by Kenneth Maxwell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc director Rajat Gupta has failed to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to delay the June 17 start of his two-year prison term while he pursues an appeal of his insider trading conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, also a former global managing director of the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co, had asked the country's highest court for permission to stay free during his appeal, after the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on May 30 denied him the same request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who handles emergency applications from the 2nd Circuit, on Wednesday denied Gupta's request to stay out of prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full 2nd Circuit has yet to decide whether to rehear Gupta's appeal of his conviction, which a three-judge panel of that court upheld on March 25. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Naftalis, a partner at Kramer Levin Naftalis &amp; Frankel who represented Gupta, declined to comment. Seth Waxman, a WilmerHale partner and former U.S. solicitor general, is also among Gupta's lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 65, is the highest-ranking corporate official to be convicted in the government's multi-year probe of insider trading in the hedge fund industry.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Manhattan federal jury in June 2012 convicted him of passing tips about Goldman, including news about its results and a $5 billion investment from Warren Buffett, to his friend Raj Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund firm.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In appealing his conviction, Gupta is challenging the use of wiretap evidence and the jury instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta's lawyers have said the appeal is likely to result in a reversal of the conviction and a new trial.    The trial judge, Jed Rakoff, has agreed to recommend that Gupta be assigned to a medium-security prison in Otisville, New York, about 70 miles (113 km) northwest of New York City.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison term after his 2011 insider trading conviction, in a case also built with wiretap evidence.

Rajaratnam, founder of the Galleon Group hedge fund firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In appealing his conviction, Gupta is challenging the use of
wiretap evidence and the jury instructions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta's lawyers have said the appeal is likely to result in
a reversal of the conviction and a new trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial judge, Jed Rakoff, has agreed to recommend that
Gupta be assigned to a medium-security prison in Otisville, New
York, about 70 miles (113 km) northwest of New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison term after his 2011
insider trading conviction, in a case also built with wiretap
evidence. He is appealing his conviction to the Supreme Court.

      Dolby Atmos screens have been installed or committed to in more than 40 
      countries with more than 150 exhibitor partners. More than 120 films

      with Dolby Atmos sound since the first film debuted in June 2012.

&lt;p&gt;June 11 (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
director Rajat Gupta has failed to persuade the U.S. Supreme
Court to delay the June 17 start of his two-year prison term
while he pursues an appeal of his insider trading conviction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta, also a former global managing director of the
consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co, had asked the country's highest
court for permission to stay free during his appeal, after the
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on May 30 denied
him the same request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who handles emergency
applications from the 2nd Circuit, on Wednesday denied Gupta's
request to stay out of prison.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department is spending some of the $13 billion JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co agreed to pay to settle claims stemming from mortgage misdeeds to speed up similar punishments against other lenders, possibly including Bank of America Corp and Citigroup, according to people familiar with the matter. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;U.S. Attorney's offices that have been among the most active in probing banks over the toxic loans they bundled into mortgage securities and sold to investors have received funds to hire new civil prosecutors, the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Attorneys in New Jersey, Colorado and the Eastern District of California, based in Sacramento, are among those most experienced in pursuing the probes, the people said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The increased activity is a sign that President Barack Obama is trying to follow through on his 2012 pledge to hold more banks accountable for their role in the housing crisis, after prosecutors faced criticism for little high-profile action.&#160;Attorney General Eric Holder has also expressed a desire to wrap up more of mortgage securities-related cases this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; "There is a widespread recognition that the banks have not yet been held fully accountable for their origination practices and the harm that did to borrowers, investors and the American economy in general," said Don Hawthorne, a partner with Axinn, Veltrop &amp; Harkrider in New York who has represented clients in mortgage-backed securities litigation.&#160;&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Justice Department's portion of the JPMorgan settlement went to the U.S. Treasury, but the department can keep up to three percent of money it collects for other federal agencies to use for certain purposes. The DOJ settlement with JPMorgan also resolved lawsuits from other agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to Bank of America and Citigroup, the government has been investigating other banks, including Royal Bank of Scotland, Credit Suisse AG, and Goldman Sachs Group Inc, people familiar with the investigations said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; In the wake of the government's landmark settlement against JPMorgan last year to resolve probes into shoddy mortgage securities, authorities may reach settlements with both Bank of America and Citigroup this summer over similar charges, people familiar with the matter said. The JPMorgan settlement included about $4 billion to resolve claims from the Federal Housing Finance Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bank of America has discussed paying about $12 billion, with more than $5 billion of that going to help struggling borrowers, to resolve a range of federal and state probes, according to people familiar with the talks. That would be on top of the $6.3 billion the bank has already paid to resolve claims from the FHFA. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Justice Department suggested a $17 billion settlement in the latest round of negotiations and did not view Bank of America's most recent offer as a serious one, one of the people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters could not determine the range of penalties Citigroup is potentially facing, but one analyst estimated the bank could face a settlement of about $5 billion, including about $2 billion in consumer relief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; Bank of America spokesman Lawrence Grayson declined to comment on the investigations and negotiations. Representatives of Goldman, Citigroup, RBS and Credit Suisse declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the Justice Department and U.S. Attorney offices in New Jersey, Colorado and Sacramento declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As&#160;part of the effort to accelerate the probes, the Justice Department is also spreading the work among offices with experience in similar cases, and in some situations reassigning cases.&#160;An investigation into Goldman Sachs, for example, was moved from the U.S. Attorney's office in Philadelphia to Sacramento, which had worked on the JPMorgan case, according to two people familiar with the matter. Representatives of both of those offices declined comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;MERRILL PROBE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; The negotiations between Bank of America and the Justice Department, fueled by a threatened lawsuit against Merrill Lynch from civil prosecutors in New Jersey, have yielded back-to-back meetings in the past two weeks, one source said, though no meetings have yet been scheduled after the bank's latest offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Attorney's office in New Jersey is drafting its complaint against Merrill, though does not have specific plans to file it yet, the person said.  Bank of America agreed to acquire Merrill at the height of the 2008 financial crisis, along with some of its liabilities. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The probes date to 2012, when Obama directed the Justice Department to create a task force to investigate the packaging and sale of home loans. After earlier inquiries fizzled, the Justice Department took a more systematic approach, issuing more than a dozen subpoenas in early 2012 to financial institutions.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Civil fraud inquiries into banks including Citigroup and Merrill Lynch were prioritized, sources said. Holder took an active interest in the investigations, receiving regular briefings on developments.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three U.S. Attorney offices divided the investigations into Bank of America and its units, with Los Angeles examining Countrywide, Charlotte taking on Bank of America itself, and New Jersey leading the probe of Merrill Lynch, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; A magistrate judge earlier this year recommended dismissing a lawsuit the U.S. Attorney's office in Charlotte brought against the bank over fraud in the sale of mortgage securities, and a federal district judge considered the recommendation at a Wednesday hearing, a ruling in which could give the bank leverage in negotiations.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The talks also include the U.S. Attorney's office in Brooklyn, which has been investigating whether the bank properly submitted mortgage loans for government insurance provided by the Federal Housing Administration, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; That probe has focused on loans the bank made after May 2009, since Bank of America paid about $500 million in 2012 to resolve liability over loans it sold earlier than that. Mortgage originations plunged in the aftermath of the 2007-2009 financial crisis, however, and it's unclear how much liability the bank faces through that inquiry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Justice Department's negotiations are being led by its No. 3 official, Tony West, who oversees the agency's civil efforts. Bank of America's team includes Meyer Koplow of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen &amp; Katz and the bank's general counsel Gary Lynch, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman's office is also involved in negotiations, according to a person familiar with the talks. Schneiderman is one of four co-chairs of the working group that is coordinating the investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His office also advised the bank months ago that it planned to recommend an action against Merrill Lynch, according to a February filing from the bank. A spokesman for Schneiderman declined comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The negotiations do not include a separate civil mortgage fraud case brought by the U.S. Attorney's office in Manhattan, which convinced a jury last October that the bank was liable for fraud through loans sold by its Countrywide unit. The government has asked for more than $2 billion in penalties but a judge has yet to rule on that request.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;ADVERTISING FOR ATTORNEYS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; Several U.S. Attorney offices including the Eastern District of California, which handled the JPMorgan investigation, recently advertised for new attorneys to work on its civil mortgage fraud enforcement cases and other types of fraud on the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A spokeswoman for U.S. Attorney Benjamin Wagner in Sacramento declined to comment on specific hires but said that the working group "has been very supportive" of the office. "We are currently in the process of evaluating our needs and determining how additional resources could best be utilized," the spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160; A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Loretta Lynch's office in Brooklyn said it's also in the process of hiring new assistant U.S. attorneys but declined to discuss their roles.&#160;The new resources suggest the government may pursue cases tied to the financial crisis for several more years, and reflect the amount of work necessary to move the complicated cases across the finish line, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But observers say the government must do more than force big penalties, and should enforce standards and adequate disclosures for borrowers and investors, which some argue does not seem to be a priority. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Even if we look at these settlements as punitive, we cannot look at them as corrective," said Joshua Rosner, managing director of Graham Fisher &amp; Co., a New York based independent consultancy. "If you don't fix the system going forward, you may have extracted monies, but you haven't done anything to ensure this doesn't happen again in the future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (additional reporting by Peter Rudegeair in New York.

      time. At secondary and higher education levels, tablets reduce the need 
      for a student to refer to a lot of textbooks for each subject. Moreover, 
      with the increasing number of applications being developed specifically 
      for the Education sector, teachers can engage students with interesting 
      educational applications. Hence, students will find the learning process 
      exciting and motivating. This will help increase interactivity between 
      students and teachers, which will in turn enhance the learning process 
      for the student.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The need for creative and innovative learning is one of the major 
      drivers in this market. Educational institutions are in the process of 
      adopting best practices in delivering creative, innovative, and quality 
      education through the use of computing devices. This has resulted in a 
      focused approach toward the global integration of various educational 
      institutions, thereby enabling them to share their knowledge base and 
      resources to promote interaction among students and teachers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major challenges confronting this market is the low levels of 
      education among students. Many students lack the basic level of 
      computing and technological skills required to use ICT. Lack of funds is 
      one of the main reasons why many educational institutions are not able 
      to provide basic ICT infrastructure.

			X-Chem Enters into Multi-Target Collaboration with Pfizer Inc.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      -- Goal to Establish Novel Small Molecule Leads Using X-Chem&#8217;s Discovery 
      Engine Fueled by its Proprietary Library of More Than 100 Billion 
      DNA-encoded Compounds --
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      X-Chem, Inc., a privately held biotechnology company applying its 
      cutting-edge lead discovery capabilities to the generation of novel 
      small molecule therapeutics, today announced a multi-target 
      collaboration with Pfizer Inc. The collaboration is focused on the 
      potential development of several programs for the treatment of 
      inflammatory and orphan diseases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the agreement, X-Chem is applying its discovery 
      engine, which leverages a high diversity, proprietary DNA-encoded small 
      molecule library to seek the identification of novel leads for the 
      Pfizer programs. Pfizer has an exclusive option to license any compounds 
      generated in the course of the collaboration. The financial terms of the 
      agreement were not disclosed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The use of ultra-large and highly diverse DNA-encoded small molecule 
      libraries has emerged as a novel technology with potential to generate 
      leads for difficult targets of high importance,&#8221; said Tony Wood, Senior 
      Vice President, Worldwide Medicinal Chemistry, Pfizer. &#8220;At Pfizer we are 
      keen to explore new technologies that may help expand our pipeline of 
      innovative medicines and are pleased to initiate this collaboration with 
      X-Chem to access their innovative lead generation approach.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the ongoing expansion of X-Chem&#8217;s library, informatics 
      capabilities, and screening expertise, we continue to identify lead 
      molecules to challenging, high value therapeutic targets,&#8221; said Rick 
      Wagner, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of X-Chem. &#8220;Our vision is to 
      enable breakthroughs in the treatment of diseases with high unmet 
      medical need by partnering our lead discovery engine with leaders in the 
      pharmaceutical industry such as Pfizer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Through a series of strategic research collaborations, and repeated 
      success at reaching collaboration goals and licensing programs to our 
      partners, X-Chem has demonstrated its ability to structure and execute 
      partnerships that bring significant value to both parties,&#8221; said Diala 
      Ezzeddine, Ph.D., Chief Business Officer of X-Chem.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About the X-Chem Drug Discovery Platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Due to the size and diversity of the library, X-Chem has the potential 
      to discover multiple series of novel, potent and selective lead 
      compounds at an accelerated rate of success against a wide range of 
      targets, including some that previously failed using conventional 
      screening methods. A number of proprietary innovations in library 
      design, screening methodology and bioinformatics underlie the strong 
      performance of the platform. A key advancement was a library synthesis 
      process that enables addition of the DNA tag using chemical methods, as 
      exemplified in the following publication by X-Chem scientists: 
      Litovchick A, Clark MA, Keefe AD. Universal strategies for the 
      DNA-encoding of libraries of small molecules using the chemical ligation 
      of oligonucleotide tags. Artificial DNA: PNA  XNA; 5 (1) e27896 1 &#8211; 11 
      (2014). X-Chem&#8217;s approach to library design allows for additional 
      chemical reactions to become useable in DNA-encoded library synthesis. 
      Together, these developments have the potential to result in a much 
      greater repertoire of diversity for small molecules, which cover a range 
      of categories, including fragment molecules, small molecular weight 
      heterocyclic compounds, and macrocyclic structures. This diverse 
      library, combined with a heightened ability to detect active molecules, 
      has yielded a robust process that has been highly successful against 
      targets categorized as difficult or intractable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About DNA Encoding
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The X-Chem drug discovery engine is based on a library generated by 
      iterative combinatorial synthesis of small molecules tethered to DNA 
      tags which record the synthetic history of the small molecule. Every 
      small molecule in the library has a unique DNA barcode attached to it. 
      The library is screened as a mixture using affinity-based binding to a 
      target of interest. Certain rare molecules in the library that bind to 
      the target can be &#8220;fished out,&#8221; while the rest of the molecules wash 
      away. DNA sequencing methods are then used to detect molecules that are 
      enriched when bound to the target. The diverse nature of the library 
      produces multiple families or clusters of related molecules that bind to 
      the target, forming a basis for emergent structure-activity 
      relationships. Structure-activity relationships are typically used by 
      medicinal chemists to guide iterative chemical maturation of a lead 
      molecule into a drug. Based on the synthetic history encoded in the DNA 
      sequence information, molecules are then made without the DNA tag 
      attached, and tested for activity in conventional assays.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Announces Over 10 Abstracts for XELJANZ&#174; (Tofacitinib 
      Citrate) in Rheumatoid Arthritis to be Presented at the European League 
      Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2014 Annual Meeting

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced today that over 10 abstracts have been accepted 
      for presentation at the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) 2014 
      Annual Meeting (June 11-14, Paris, France), seven of which are focused 
      on further characterizing the safety profile of XELJANZ (tofacitinib 
      citrate) in treating moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis. 
      Notably, an abstract titled, &#8220;Integrated safety analysis of tofacitinib 
      in rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials with a cumulative exposure of 
      12,664 patient-years,&#8221; will be presented as an oral abstract session 
      (OP0154) on June 13, 2014 at 11:30 a.m. CEST. This analysis describes 
      safety data for XELJANZ in patients from the integrated rheumatoid 
      arthritis clinical trial database, which is based on cumulative exposure 
      in Phase 2, Phase 3, and open-label long-term extension studies. The 
      analysis includes 5,671 patients with a median exposure of 2.4 years 
      including more than 500 patients followed for greater than four years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer is proud to showcase our commitment to the ongoing study of 
      XELJANZ, with a focus on further establishing its benefit:risk profile 
      in rheumatoid arthritis, a disease which affects more than 23 million 
      people worldwide,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Romano, Global Medicines Development 
      Lead for the Pfizer Global Innovative Pharmaceutical business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ is now approved in more than 20 countries for the treatment of 
      patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who had 
      an inadequate response to existing therapies. Most recently, Health 
      Canada approved XELJANZ 5 mg twice daily in combination with 
      methotrexate for reducing the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis 
      in adult patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid 
      arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to 
      methotrexate. In cases of intolerance to methotrexate, physicians may 
      consider the use of XELJANZ as monotherapy. Regulatory applications for 
      XELJANZ for the treatment of moderately to severely active rheumatoid 
      arthritis remain under review in more than 35 additional countries. In 
      Europe, XELJANZ is approved in Russia, Switzerland and Turkey, and 
      Pfizer is working on next steps to re-file an application with the 
      European Medicines Agency (EMA).
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Safety findings observed in the overall rheumatoid arthritis program for 
      XELJANZ include serious and other important infections, including 
      tuberculosis and herpes zoster; malignancies, including lymphoma; 
      gastrointestinal perforations; decreased neutrophil and lymphocyte 
      counts; liver enzyme elevations; and lipid elevations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common serious adverse events were serious infections. The most 
      commonly reported adverse events were upper respiratory tract 
      infections, headache, diarrhea and nasopharyngitis.

      Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) 
      inhibitor. XELJANZ is used to treat adults with moderately to severely 
      active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well. 
      XELJANZ may be used as a single agent or in combination with MTX or 
      other non-biologic disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Use 
      of XELJANZ in combination with biologic DMARDs or potent 
      immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine and cyclosporine is not 
      recommended. The recommended dose is 5 mg twice-daily (BID).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in people with 
        Hepatitis B or C.
      
			
        XELJANZ is not for people with severe liver problems.
      
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in children.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				XELJANZ can lower the ability of the immune system to fight 
        infections. Some people have serious infections while taking XELJANZ, 
        including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, 
        or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died 
        from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for 
        TB before starting XELJANZ, and monitor them closely for signs and 
        symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should 
        not start taking XELJANZ if they have any kind of infection unless 
        their healthcare provider tells them it is okay.
			
			
				XELJANZ may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the 
        way the immune system works. Malignancies were observed in clinical 
        studies of XELJANZ.
			
			
        The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to 
        initiating XELJANZ in patients with chronic or recurrent infection; 
        who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of a serious or 
        an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of 
        endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions 
        that may predispose them to infection.
      
			
        Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation 
        (e.g., herpes zoster), was observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ.
      
			
        Use of live vaccines should be avoided concurrently with XELJANZ. 
        Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines 
        prior to initiating XELJANZ therapy.
      
			
        Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to 
        prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain 
        white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr 
        virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
      
			
        Some people taking XELJANZ get tears in their stomach or intestines. 
        This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal 
        anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. 
        Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have 
        fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away, or a change in 
        bowel habits. XELJANZ should be used with caution in patients who may 
        be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients 
        with a history of diverticulitis).
      
			
        XELJANZ can cause changes in certain lab test results including low 
        blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in 
        cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before 
        starting patients on XELJANZ and while they are taking XELJANZ, to 
        check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important 
        to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ treatment 
        because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results.
      
			
        Use of XELJANZ in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not 
        recommended.
      
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become 
        pregnant or are pregnant.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is not known if XELJANZ will harm an unborn baby. To monitor the 
      outcomes of pregnant women exposed to XELJANZ, a registry has been 
      established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients and pregnant 
      women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to 
        breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare 
        provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ or breastfeed. They 
        should not do both. [BEGIN TEXT BOX]

        In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the 
        liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ. Healthcare 
        providers may do blood tests before and during treatment with XELJANZ.
      
			
        Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common 
        cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, 
        sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis).

			About Rheumatoid Arthritis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease 
      that typically affects the hands and feet, although any joint lined by 
      the synovial membrane can be affected.1 RA causes a range of 
      symptoms, including stiffness and swelling in the joints,2 
      particularly those in the hands, feet and knees.1 Although 
      the exact cause of RA is unknown,1 it is considered to be an 
      autoimmune disease, because the immune system in people with RA mistakes 
      the body&#8217;s healthy tissues for a threat and attacks them.1 Some 
      people are at increased risk of developing RA, including people with a 
      family history of RA, smokers and women.3 Three times as many 
      women are affected by RA compared to men.2 RA affects 
      approximately 23.7 million people4 worldwide and 1.6 million 
      people in the United States.5,6 It can develop at any time 
      during adulthood, but it usually occurs between 40 and 70 years of age.2

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co expects global retail sales from its 10-month-old Infinity video game to reach $1 billion even as rivals also combine physical toys with video games, Jimmy Pitaro, president of the company's interactive unit, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Disney launched Infinity in August to help turn around its interactive gaming unit, which lost $1.4 billion from fiscal year 2008 to 2013. In an overhaul in March, the division laid off about one-quarter of the workforce, cut the number of games it develops and focused its advertising more on the fast-changing mobile market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A month ago, Disney reported global retail sales of $550 million for Infinity. Sales of the game helped the interactive unit post a $14 million profit for the quarter that ended in March, its third consecutive quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will be a billion-dollar franchise," Pitaro said of Infinity in an interview on Wednesday at the E3 video game conference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney spokeswoman said the company expects Infinity's global retail sales will cross that threshold with the upcoming launch of the game's next version, "Disney Infinity 2.0: Marvel Super Heroes." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that Pitaro's projection was "just the beginning of what we expect it to do. This is a long-term game franchise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infinity lets users play with characters from Disney and Pixar films such as Anna and Elsa from "Frozen," Captain Jack Sparrow from "Pirates of the Caribbean" and Lightning McQueen from "Cars." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2.0 version that will be launched in the fall brings in Marvel heroes such as Captain America, Iron Man and Spider-Man.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infinity competes with Activision Blizzard Inc's "Skylanders" franchise that first successfully introduced the concept of toys coming to life on screen when placed on an electronic base.    Since its launch in October 2011 until the end of 2013, "Skylanders" has surpassed $2 billion in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This week at E3, Nintendo Co Ltd announced it would release "amiibo" toys of characters such as Mario with a chip that activates them in games when placed on the GamePad controller of its Wii U console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney also plans more mobile "Star Wars" games before its scheduled December 2015 release of the seventh movie in the classic sci-fi series, Pitaro said. Disney also has a multi-year licensing deal with Electronic Arts Inc to develop a different line of "Star Wars" games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Lisa Richwine and Malathi Nayak; Edited by Ronald Grover, Richard Chang and Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Alison Frankel&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As inevitably as thunder follows lightning, shareholder class actions follow deal announcements. Debate has been raging for years now about whether shareholders derive any real benefits from the resolution of these cases, with judges increasingly skeptical about awarding big fees to plaintiffs lawyers who win only enhanced disclosures in deal documents. For defendants, the upside of settlements is more obvious: They obtain global releases of shareholder claims related to the transactions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or do they? On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs and Bain Capital agreed to pay a combined $121 million ($54 million from Bain, $67 million from Goldman) to resolve antitrust class action claims that they and several other private equity defendants cheated shareholders in eight companies acquired in private equity LBOs by colluding to depress acquisition prices. According to Patrick Coughlin of Robbins Geller Rudman  Dowd, who is one of the lead lawyers in the antitrust case, the beneficiaries of the Bain and Goldman settlements will include shareholders who previously released claims against the private equity funds in shareholder MA class action settlements.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bain and Goldman, along with their fellow antitrust defendants  Blackstone, TCG, KKR, TPG and Silverlake  had argued in a motion in January that shareholder releases in the original MA cases should preclude certification of a class of onetime shareholders injured by their supposed conspiracy to depress LBO prices. It was a pretty creative argument, based on a ruling in the collusion case that shareholders who sold stock in the various LBO deals could not introduce evidence from those transactions against defendants they released from liability in MA settlements. That patchwork of evidence, the defendants contended, meant that the collusion case did not meet commonality and typicality standards for class actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for the antitrust class countered in a brief last March that the defendants misread the evidentiary ruling and ignored the courts previous holding that releases in the MA cases do not cover claims of an overarching conspiracy. Class counsel Craig Wildfang of Robins, Kaplan, Miller  Ciresi told me Thursday that the defendants MA releases argument against class certification was a complete red herring that didnt meet the laugh test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Both he and Coughlin said that defendants in antitrust conspiracies face joint and several liability for their misconduct, so it doesnt really matter that certain class members released some unrelated claims against certain defendants. This is a conspiracy, said Coughlin. Once theres enough evidence you joined the conspiracy, (everything) is coming in. Coughlin said that the settlements with Bain and Goldman are proof that the defendants dont have much faith that their previous MA releases will preclude class certification. Youve got two very sophisticated entities paying out more than $100 million, he told me. This isnt like a $4- or $5-million settlement.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;True, but for defendants like Goldman and Bain, even $100 million probably isnt material. They also faced unusual risk from the class certification ruling in this case: The judge who presided over the case for much of its six-year history, Edward Harrington, has already issued summary judgment decisions, so if the defendants lose on class certification, theyre headed for a trial of the plaintiffs multibillion-dollar claims, which can be trebled under antitrust law. Bain and Goldman probably figured that the price of a settlement would skyrocket if they lost on class certification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The MA release issue remains alive before U.S. District Judge William Young of Boston, who took over the case in December. All of the other defendants except for Silverlake have obtained releases from shareholders in MA suits stemming from one or more of the eight deals at issue in the collusion litigation, so the releases could still be an impediment to class certification, Wildfangs laugh test notwithstanding.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The case has a November 2014 trial date, which means the class certification decision will be coming soon (assuming that the rest of the defendants dont settle). Then well really know how much protection defendants can expect from shareholder releases in MA class actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman counsel Richard Pepperman of Sullivan  Cromwell declined to comment. Bain counsel Craig Primis of Kirkland  Ellis referred my call to a Bain representative who declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Phillips Chemical Announces Mechanical Completion and 
      Start-Up of World&#8217;s Largest 1-Hexene Plant
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP (Chevron Phillips Chemical) 
      announced today the successful commissioning and start-up of the world&#8217;s 
      largest on-purpose 1-hexene plant. With worldwide supply capabilities, 
      the 1-hexene unit is capable of producing 250,000 metric tons 
      (551,000,000 lbs.) per year and will enjoy significant advantages in 
      infrastructure, feedstock availability and operational knowledge by its 
      placement in the existing Cedar Bayou Chemical Complex in Baytown, Texas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron Phillips is committed to being a consistent and reliable 
      supplier for our customers,&#8221; said Mitch Eichelberger, general manager of 
      Normal Alpha Olefins and Polyalphaolefins for Chevron Phillips Chemical. 
      &#8220;With the start-up of this plant, we will enable our customers to expand 
      their businesses and meet the growing worldwide demand for 1-hexene 
      comonomers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our investment to expand 1-hexene production is due in part to Texas&#8217; 
      growth as a major international hub for the petrochemical industry and 
      the increased supply of competitive feedstocks in the U.S. from the 
      development of shale resources,&#8221; said Pete Cella, CEO of Chevron 
      Phillips Chemical. &#8220;Only five years ago, the expectation was that the 
      U.S. would become a significant net importer of ethylene derivatives. 
      Now the U.S. is expecting to become a major exporter of ethylene 
      derivatives, including 1-hexene, able to compete with any producing 
      region in the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new plant is the third plant to utilize Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s 
      proprietary selective on-purpose 1-hexene technology, which produces 
      comonomer grade 1-hexene from ethylene with exceptional product purity. 
      1-hexene is a critical component used in the manufacture of 
      polyethylene, a plastic resin commonly converted into film, plastic 
      pipe, detergent bottles, and food and beverage containers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The proven technology is already successfully used at Qatar Chemical 
      Company Ltd.&#8217;s (Q-Chem) facility in Mesaieed, Qatar, and at the Saudi 
      Polymers Company plant in Al Jubail, Saudi Arabia. Both of these 
      facilities are joint ventures of wholly-owned subsidiaries of Chevron 
      Phillips Chemical Company LLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Within the next two weeks, the U.S. Supreme Court&#160;is expected to rule in a major case that could make it much harder for shareholders to band together against public companies in securities fraud class actions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the court rules in favor of Halliburton (HAL.N) and against a group of shareholders, then the oilfield services company won't be the only business to gain. A handful of other major companies would also likely reap immediate benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those companies, including drug makers Merck &amp; Co Inc (MRK.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), banks HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) and Regions Financial Corp (RF.N), and casino company Las Vegas Sands Corp (LVS.N), are defendants in shareholder lawsuits that have been granted class action status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decision setting a higher bar for class actions would not end the lawsuits, but it would allow these defendants to file briefs demanding that shareholders have to again seek court approval for the status - and this time under a new, tougher standard. If they fail to get that approval, the cases would effectively end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2013, settlements were reached in 67 cases totaling $4.8 billion, according to Cornerstone Research. A ruling in the oil company's favor in Halliburton v. Erica P. John Fund could save other businesses facing pending class actions hundreds of millions of dollars collectively. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around 200 shareholder class actions are filed every year alleging that misleading statements and material omissions made by companies and their executives caused a stock&#8217;s share price to drop. Nearly 400 shareholder securities class actions are  pending in various stages of litigation, according to data gathered by the Stanford Law School Securities Class Action Clearinghouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But only a relatively small number of the pending cases have been granted class action status. In each instance, a judge must determine at a certification hearing whether the status is appropriate. One consideration is whether the people in the class have common issues or merely related ones. To be a class, they must have common issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'FRAUD ON THE MARKET'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Class certification is a critical stage in shareholder class actions because it puts pressure on defendants to settle by increasing the liability they face.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Generally, the larger the class size, the more damages a company faces and the more that plaintiffs' lawyers can make. Law firms can receive as much as a third of the settlement in attorneys' fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case before the Supreme Court, Halliburton is seeking to overturn a 1988 decision, Basic v. Levinson, which adopted the &#8220;fraud on the market theory.&#8221; Under the theory, a defendant's material misrepresentation that affects the price of publicly traded securities is presumed to have been relied on by a purchaser who suffered a loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That theory assumes public information about a company is known to the market and plaintiffs do not have to show that they relied on a specific misrepresentation, only that they purchased shares before the truth came out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the case against Halliburton, shareholders alleged it understated asbestos liabilities while overstating both  revenues in its engineering and construction business and the benefits of its merger with Dresser Industries. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court has several options, including leaving intact Basic v. Levinson to maintain the status quo. At the other extreme, it could overturn Basic v. Levinson - and so doom securities class actions by requiring plaintiffs to show they relied on misinformation when they purchased securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A third option would be to find a middle ground that would require plaintiffs to show that the misrepresentation had a significant effect on the stock price but that would not overturn Basic. During oral arguments, some of the justices appeared to signal that the middle option would be their preference. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The middle option would still be a win for the defendant corporations by creating more hurdles for shareholders to clear before being allowed to sue as a group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck is facing one of the largest pending shareholder cases that already has class action status. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in 2005, alleges that the company made misleading statements about its painkiller drug Vioxx, which the company withdrew from the market in 2004 over concerns that it increased the risk of heart attacks and strokes. The plaintiffs alleged that after Merck disclosed the problems with Vioxx, its market capitalization shrunk by billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January 2013, U.S. District Judge Stanley Chesler of New Jersey certified a class of individuals and entities who purchased Merck securities from May 21, 1999, to Sept. 29, 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HALT IN THE PROCEEDINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreshadowing the potential impact of the Halliburton decision, a lawyer for Merck in November asked a federal judge in New Jersey to put a halt to proceedings in the case pending the outcome of the Supreme Court decision in Halliburton. The lawyer said the plaintiffs&#8217; case rested squarely on the fraud on the market theory and that part of the case would likely have to be re-litigated following the Halliburton decision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court denied the request. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merck and an attorney for the plaintiffs had no comment on the potential impact of Halliburton on the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC could also benefit from the Supreme Court&#8217;s ruling. The bank is appealing a $2.46 billion judgment against one of the company&#8217;s units, formerly known as Household International Inc. The plaintiffs alleged that Household was engaged in systemic predatory lending and that it misrepresented the credit quality of its loan portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judgment, entered by a federal judge in Chicago last year, was the largest ever following a securities fraud class action trial, according to the plaintiffs&#8217; law firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On appeal to the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, lawyers for HSBC are seeking an order vacating the judgment and sending the case back to the district court. In a brief filed in February, HSBC said that if the Supreme Court jettisons Basic&#8217;s presumption of reliance on a misrepresentation, a class status review "will be beyond question.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is facing a trial later this year over allegations made by shareholders that it fraudulently misrepresented the safety of its Celebrex and Bextra pain-relieving drugs. The lawsuit covers investors who bought Pfizer stock between Oct. 31, 2000, and Oct. 19, 2005, a period in which the company's share price fell by roughly half and its market value tumbled by well over $100 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and the plaintiffs agreed to delay the trial until after the Halliburton decision. In a letter to the court, Pfizer said it believed that after the Halliburton decision, it &#8220;may be necessary to revisit class certification or other pre-trial motion practice.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today announced the CLOV project in 
      Angola started up on schedule and is expected to reach daily production 
      capacity of 160,000 barrels in the coming months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CLOV is the fourth major development hub of Total-operated Block 17, 
      after Girassol, Dalia and Pazflor. An ExxonMobil affiliate has a 20 
      percent working interest in CLOV, which will produce oil from the four 
      fields of Cravo, Lirio, Orquidea and Violeta at water depths ranging 
      from 3,600 feet to 4,593 feet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Block 17, along with Esso Angola-operated Block 15, in which the 
      company has a 40 percent working interest, are the most productive 
      blocks in Angola,&#8221; said Neil Duffin, president of ExxonMobil Development 
      Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CLOV, located 87 miles offshore Luanda, includes 34 wells and eight 
      manifolds connected by 112 miles of subsea pipelines to a floating 
      production storage and offloading vessel and
			crude oil offloading 
      terminal.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 1,000-foot-long, 197-foot-wide vessel can store up to 1.8 million 
      barrels of oil. Natural gas produced at CLOV will be exported through a 
      subsea pipeline to an Angola liquefied natural gas plant in Soyo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CLOV produces two types of oil from the Miocene and Oligocene geological 
      horizons. Miocene oil is more viscous than Oligocene oil and required a 
      subsea multiphase pump system for transportation to boost co-mingled 
      fluid and enhance oil recovery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The project was completed with more than 10 million hours performed by a 
      local workforce to complete fabrication and assembly of the storage and 
      offloading vessel in Angola. The water treatment module, a critical 
      component of the vessel, was built and installed in Angola, a first for 
      the country. The project also provided training programs for local 
      personnel and played a part in enhancing the country&#8217;s socio-economic 
      development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;CLOV is another indication of ExxonMobil&#8217;s commitment to Angola, where 
      we have been involved for about 20 years,&#8221; Duffin said. &#8220;ExxonMobil 
      continues to evaluate additional development opportunities in the 
      country.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sonangol is the concessionaire for Block 17. Total has 40 percent 
      interest, Statoil has 23.33 percent, and BP has 16.67 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil affiliates&#8217; Angola interests also include 15 percent of the 
      Kaombo project, located in southeast area of Block 32, which launched 
      development of six fields in April. Production in Block 15 from Kizomba 
      Satellite Phase 1 started in 2012 and Phase 2 project development is 
      underway with production startup targeted for 2015.

			&lt;p&gt;Paris, June 12, 2014&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Nexity launched today an issuance of bonds convertible into and/or exchangeable for new or existing shares (OCEANE) due January 1, 2020 (the "Bonds") in an initial nominal amount of &#8364; 156 521 759.90, which may be increased up to a maximum nominal amount of &#8364; 179 999 991.38 in the event of the full exercise of the over-allotment option of 15 per cent. granted to the Global Coordinator acting on behalf of the Joint Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners, exercisable at the latest on June 16, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The net proceeds of the issuance of the Bonds will be used for general corporate purposes of the Company and, if applicable, the financing or refinancing of acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Nexity set the final terms of the issuance after a private placement in and outside France. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The par value of each Bond has been set at 43.34 euros, representing an issue premium of 35 per cent. over Nexity's reference share price[1] on the regulated market of NYSE Euronext in Paris ("Euronext Paris").&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Bonds will bear interest at an annual nominal rate of 0.625 per cent., payable semi-annually in arrears on January 1 and July 1 of each year (or on the following business day if this date is not a business day) and the first interest payment will be made on January 1, 2015 on a pro rata temporis basis (or on the following business day if such date is not a business day). &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Bonds will be issued at par on June 19, 2014, the expected settlement date of the Bonds, and redeemed at par on January 1, 2020. The Bonds will entitle their holders to receive new and/or existing Nexity shares at a ratio of one share per one Bond, subject to subsequent adjustments. Under certain conditions, the Bonds may be redeemed prior to maturity at the option of Nexity. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The Bonds will be offered only by way of a private placement in France and outside France (but not in the United States of America, Canada, Australia or Japan) to persons referred to in Article L. 411-2-II of the French Code mon&#233;taire et financier, without a public offering in any country (including France).&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;The date of issue and settlement and delivery of the Bonds is expected to be June 19, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;An application for the listing of the Bonds on Euronext Paris will be made. A listing prospectus will be prepared to list the Bonds on Euronext Paris and will be subject to the approval (visa) of the Autorit&#233; des march&#233;s financiers (the "AMF"). &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;This issuance is lead-managed by Cr&#233;dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank acting as Global Coordinator and with Cr&#233;dit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, J.P. Morgan Securities plc and Natixis as Joint Lead Managers and Joint Bookrunners.&lt;/p&gt;

			NUVISAN Pharma Services Selects ALPHADAS to Accelerate Clinical 
      Development Processes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ALPHADAS Chosen to Replace Existing System at Phase I Unit in Germany
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Instem, a leading provider of IT 
      solutions to the global early development healthcare market, 
      announced today that NUVISAN Pharma Services (&#8220;NUVISAN&#8221;) has purchased 
      the ALPHADAS&#174; 
      clinical trials software solution suite for deployment in its Phase I 
      unit located in Neu-Ulm, Germany.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NUVISAN is a fully integrated contract research organization providing

      industry. For over 30 years, NUVISAN has been assisting their clients in 
      bringing safe and effective pharmaceutical products to market through 
      its complete spectrum of services and the long-standing experience of 
      their staff.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following a competitive evaluation of commercial software systems and 
      vendors, NUVISAN selected Instem&#8217;s ALPHADAS software suite based on its 
      ability to support their clinical development team&#8217;s specific needs 
      through flexible configurations, the ability to integrate with other 
      support systems through the unit and for Instem&#8217;s rapid deployment 
      services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to improving processes at their Phase I unit, ALPHADAS will 
      be integrating with NUVISAN&#8217;s central lab operations resulting in 
      enhanced quality and consistency while simultaneously improving 
      efficiencies and saving time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Following a thorough evaluation of several software solutions, and 
      after visiting with clients of each vendor under consideration, it was 
      clear that ALPHADAS by Instem would not only be replacing our existing 
      system, but was the one solution that would truly be providing us with 
      the platform we need to help our clients succeed,&#8221; comments James 
      Dickinson, Head of NUVISAN&#8217;s Phase I unit. &#8220;In addition to the 
      technology, Instem is a well-respected, stable organization offering 
      NUVISAN true subject matter expertise by staff that have run Phase I 
      labs themselves. Bringing more than just software to us was an essential 
      driver behind our decision and we are looking forward to a quick and 
      efficient rollout of their system.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      BioTime, Inc. (NYSE MKT: BTX) today announced that Pedro Lichtinger has 
      been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer of its subsidiary 
      Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. (&#8220;Asterias&#8221;), effective June 9, 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Asterias was created by BioTime to acquire Geron Corporation&#8217;s 
      clinical-stage stem cell therapeutic assets. The company&#8217;s work centers 
      on the development of therapeutics derived from stem cells capable of 
      becoming all of the cell types in the human body to fight disease, a 
      process known as pluripotency. Together, Asterias and BioTime have the 
      largest intellectual property portfolio of any company in the 
      pluripotent stem cell field with over 600 patents and patent 
      applications worldwide covering key therapeutic targets derived from 
      each of the three primary germ layers that give rise to all cells in the 
      human body. Asterias&#8217; lead clinical programs are its AST-OPC1 cell 
      therapeutic for spinal cord injury, which recently received clinical 
      trial funding support through an award of $14.3 million by the 
      California Institute for Regenerative Medicine (&#8220;CIRM&#8221;), and its 
      AST-VAC2 allogeneic dendritic cell cancer immunotherapy platform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Pedro has the ideal mix of skills to lead Asterias in the next stage of 
      its growth," said Michael D. West, Ph.D., BioTime&#8217;s CEO. "His experience 
      in shepherding medicines through clinical and regulatory processes to 
      commercialization will be invaluable as Asterias moves forward with its 
      plans to bring two of its product candidates into clinical trials. Pedro 
      is also a seasoned business leader and manager whose long track record 
      in building businesses and business alliances speaks for itself. &#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am excited to be working with Asterias&#8217; talented employees, whose 
      hard work and incredible talent have been responsible for the rapid 
      advancement of a number of promising treatments,&#8221; said Mr. Lichtinger. 
      &#8220;The pluripotent stem cell technology platform is rapidly emerging into 
      the clinic with a focus on major unmet medical needs that have limited 
      or no cures available. Asterias&#8217; two most advanced clinical programs 
      have the potential to significantly improve patient outcomes and I am 
      delighted to be a part of this effort.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Lichtinger has served as a director of BioTime since August 2009, 
      during which time he has helped to guide its development as a leader in 
      the field of regenerative medicine. Reflecting his new role at Asterias, 
      Mr. Lichtinger has been nominated for election to the Asterias Board of 
      Directors at the company&#8217;s upcoming annual meeting, and will not stand 
      for reelection to the BioTime Board of Directors at BioTime&#8217;s upcoming 
      annual meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since April, Dr. West, BioTime&#8217;s longtime CEO, has also served as 
      President and CEO of Asterias. With the appointment of Mr. Lichtinger as 
      CEO, Dr. West will continue to be a member of the Board of Asterias and 
      will resume his position as Vice President &#8211; Technology Integration at 
      Asterias, while continuing as BioTime&#8217;s CEO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Lichtinger has some 35 years of executive leadership experience in 
      the pharmaceutical industry. Previously, he was president and CEO of 
      Optimer Pharmaceuticals, a role that he held from May 2010 to February 
      2013. There, he led the successful registration and commercialization of 
      DIFICID&#174; (fidaxomicin). Before joining Optimer, Mr. Lichtinger held a 
      series of top management positions at Pfizer over a 25-year career, 
      including serving as president of Pfizer&#8217;s Global Primary Care Unit, 
      where he oversaw $23 billion in revenue and was responsible for a 
      development budget in excess of $800 million including a portfolio of 66 
      projects. He also led Pfizer&#8217;s European operations as president of that 
      group encompassing 27 countries and all Pfizer medicines, and previously 
      headed Pfizer&#8217;s Global Animal Health business. In these roles, Mr. 
      Lichtinger oversaw the successful development, commercialization, and 
      alliances of numerous drugs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Before joining Pfizer, Mr. Lichtinger was an executive at Smith Kline 
      Beecham, where he was senior vice president of the company&#8217;s European 
      animal health unit and previously held multiple other executive roles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Lichtinger serves on the Board of Directors of Laboratorios Sanfer, 
      SA de CV, the largest Mexican pharmaceutical company, which is partly 
      owned by General Atlantic, a leading global growth equity investment 
      firm. Mr. Lichtinger, an American born in Mexico, speaks four languages. 
      He holds an MBA from the Wharton School of Business and an engineering 
      degree from the National University of Mexico. He and his wife, 
      Iracilda, passionately support the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and 
      the Brazil Foundation.

			About Asterias
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Asterias Biotherapeutics (&#8220;Asterias&#8221;) is a biotechnology company focused 
      on the emerging field of regenerative medicine. Asterias core 
      technologies center on stem cells capable of becoming all of the cell 
      types in the human body, a property called pluripotency. Asterias plans 
      to develop therapies based on pluripotent stem cells to treat diseases 
      or injuries in a variety of medical fields, with an initial focus on the 
      therapeutic applications of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells (AST-OPC1) 
      and antigen-presenting dendritic cells (AST-VAC1 and AST-VAC2) for the 
      fields of neurology and oncology respectively. AST-OPC1 was tested for 
      treatment of spinal cord injury in the world&#8217;s first Phase 1 clinical 
      trial using human embryonic stem cell-derived cells. Asterias plans to 
      seek FDA clearance to reinitiate clinical testing of AST-OPC1 in spinal 
      cord injury this year, and is also evaluating its function in 
      nonclinical models of multiple sclerosis and stroke. AST-VAC1 and 
      AST-VAC2 are dendritic cell-based vaccines designed to immunize cancer 
      patients against telomerase, a protein abnormally expressed in over 95% 
      of human cancer types. AST-VAC2 differs from AST-VAC1 in that the 
      dendritic cells presenting telomerase to the immune system are produced 
      from human embryonic stem cells instead of being derived from human 
      blood.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In October of 2013, Asterias acquired the cell therapy assets of Geron 
      Corporation. These assets included INDs for the clinical stage AST-OPC1 
      and AST-VAC1 programs, banks of cGMP-manufactured AST-OPC1 drug product, 
      cGMP master and working cell banks of human embryonic stem cells, over 
      400 patents and patent applications filed worldwide including broad 
      issued claims to fundamental platform technologies for the scalable 
      growth of pluripotent stem cells and compositions of matter for several 
      hESC-derived therapeutic cell types, research cell banks, customized 
      reagents and equipment, and various assets relating to the AST-VAC2 
      program and preclinical programs in cardiology and orthopedics.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      development of a number of new therapeutic products. BioTime&#8217;s 
      therapeutic and research products include a wide array of proprietary PureStem&#174; 
      progenitors, HyStem&#174; 
      hydrogels, culture media, and differentiation kits. BioTime is 
      developing Renevia&#8482; (a HyStem&#174; product) as a

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CRUZ Bolivia (Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon got an unusual treat for his 70th birthday on Friday when the president of Bolivia, Evo Morales, presented him with a cake made with coca leaves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The UN chief was in Santa Cruz, Bolivia for a meeting this weekend of the G77 group of countries to discuss measures for reducing poverty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca is used to make cocaine but host Morales, a former coca farmer, has long defended its legal use as an "ancestral rite" for tea, sweets and medicines, going so far as to pull coca leaves out of a small plastic bag during a UN anti-drug meeting in Vienna in 2012 and chew on a wad of them. People in the Andean region also traditionally chew on coca leaf as a source of energy or as an antidote to altitude sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Bolivian people will never forget your visit," Morales told Ban on Friday in front of hundreds gathered for the presentation of the cake and a traditional Bolivian jacket.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ban was effusive in his thanks but stopped short of publicly taking a bite of the "torta de coca" or of endorsing Morales' position on the controversial leaf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Bolivian people have a big, broad heart ... and great wisdom," Ban said. "You have lived for thousands of years in harmony with nature."    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs banned coca leaf in 1961 along with cocaine, heroin, opium and morphine, and in 2012 Bolivia withdrew from it to protest the criminalization of the chewing of coca leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequently the UN granted Bolivia a special dispensation recognizing the traditional practice as legal in Bolivia and Bolivia was re-admitted to the convention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country's condition for rejoining met resistance from 15 countries, including the United States and the rest of the G8 group of industrial nations, but in order to block Bolivia's re-admission a full third of its signatories, or  63 countries, needed to object.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolivia is the world's biggest cocaine producer after Peru and Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Hugh Bronstein; Additional reporting by Enrique Pretel; Editing by James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced that its subsidiary, 
      Chevron Global Energy Inc., has sold its 25 percent non-operated 
      interest in a producing oil concession in southern Chad and the related 
      export pipeline interests to the Republic of Chad for approximately $1.3 
      billion. The sale closed June 13.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This sale demonstrates our focus on strategically managing our 
      portfolio to maximize the value of our global upstream businesses,&#8221; said 
      George Kirkland, vice chairman of Chevron Corporation.

      &#8220;These assets have played a significant role for Chevron in Africa for 
      the past 14 years,&#8221; said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and 
      Latin America Exploration and Production Company. &#8220;They have been a 
      profitable part of our portfolio for many years. The combination of 
      current market conditions and the size of the assets relative to our 
      portfolio make this an ideal time for a divestiture.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction includes the sale of the Chevron subsidiary&#8217;s interests 
      in seven fields in Chad&#8217;s Doba Basin, which in 2013 had an average net 
      daily crude oil production of about 18,000 barrels. The sale also 
      includes the Chevron subsidiary&#8217;s approximate 21 percent non-operated 
      interest in a pipeline system that transports crude oil to the coast of 
      Cameroon as well as associated marine facilities.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - The world's biggest would-be drugs merger hit a wall last month but speculation about smart ways that Pfizer could yet seal a deal with AstraZeneca remains intense.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Even as talks fell apart last month, some in Pfizer's camp remained optimistic the transaction could be revived - and certain AstraZeneca advisers have not ruled out renewed talks. Under British takeover law, the UK firm can approach Pfizer at the end of August to discuss a sweetened bid, or Pfizer can try again in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the most obvious method for Pfizer to win AstraZeneca around might seem to be more cash, some hedge funds think the U.S. firm could structure payouts by tying them to the performance of key AstraZeneca drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A so-called contingent value right, or CVR, was a winning formula for Sanofi in its 2011 battle for Genzyme and the tradeable product - promising additional payouts once future benchmarks are hit - has been used in several other drug industry deals when the two sides could not agree on price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An enriched cash:equity mix as well as a CVR component to bridge the ... valuation gap between the two management teams may see the deal agreed upon on a friendly basis," said analysts at Jefferies this week, predicting an 80 percent probability of AstraZeneca inviting Pfizer back after an enforced cooling-off period ends in late August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNWIELDY OPTION?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where CVRs have worked before, they have typically been tied to one particular drug upon which buyers and sellers could not agree a price - such as Genzyme's multiple sclerosis drug Lemtrada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applying a CVR to AstraZeneca, then, could be tough, given the number of new drugs in its pipeline and the time needed to prove their value: Debate about the UK company's valuation centres on a wide range of experimental drugs in cancer, respiratory disease and other areas, for which it has made sales forecasts stretching as far as 2023.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Who wants to own a CVR for 10 years?" said Dan Mahony, a fund manager at Polar Capital, who built up his stake in AstraZeneca last year and doubts the idea would be attractive to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I&#8217;m not sure a CVR would necessarily work in this situation. You&#8217;d end up with something that is a really long-dated option - and anything that is illiquid and doesn&#8217;t really trade is always a bit of a pain in the neck."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In order to cover itself against the risk of a new drug not working out, Pfizer would have to construct any CVR around a number of very different assets ranging from new cancer drugs like MEDI4736 and AZD9291 to benralizumab for asthma to diabetes and heart drugs, suggested Mark Clark, an analyst at Deutsche Bank - a nice idea, but "probably too unwieldy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Pfizer was cash-strapped then it might be a sensible way to work through the difficulties &#8211; but it&#8217;s not cash-strapped and it seems overly complex," Clark said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORE CASH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would be far simpler for Pfizer instead to bump up the cash element in its 55 pounds-a-share offer - rejected as inadequate - and meet the 58.85 pounds that AstraZeneca has indicated is the minimum at which it might recommend a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many healthcare bankers not involved in the bid predict Pfizer will be back - not least because no other target both complements the U.S. company's product range and offers the same potential for tax and cost benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio suggested as much this week - and pushed AstraZeneca shares higher - when he told a Goldman Sachs healthcare conference that talks about a deal had fallen down simply over price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a word it was price," D&#8217;Amelio said. "Any other issues that were raised during the negotiations, during the conversations, I think we were able to adequately, effectively address those."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since AstraZeneca also raised deep-seated concerns about execution risks and British politicians whipped up a storm over job cuts, D'Amelio's comments were taken as a sign that Pfizer sees such problems as manageable. D'Amelio stressed that he could not speculate on whether Pfizer would return or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK takeover rules prohibit any re-engagement for three months from May 26 - and what happens after that will depend on how AstraZeneca's drug research fares in the meantime and what happens to its shares - a strong run on the stock could push it out of Pfizer's reach. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, the newsflow for AstraZeneca has been good, with promising data on new cancer drugs and no competition yet to its blockbuster heartburn medicine Nexium in the U.S. market due to problems at generic supplier Ranbaxy - a factor that could allow it to beat its current targets for 2014 earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Sophie Walker)&lt;/p&gt;

industry deals when the two sides could not agree on price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An enriched cash:equity mix as well as a CVR component to
bridge the ... valuation gap between the two management teams
may see the deal agreed upon on a friendly basis," said analysts
at Jefferies this week, predicting an 80 percent probability of

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MALVERN, Pa., June 13, 2014 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals Corporation (Nasdaq:TLOG) ("Company") today announced that it will host a conference call and live audio webcast on Monday, June 16, 2014 at 08:00 a.m. Eastern Time with Dr. Marc Pellegrini, Laboratory Head, Infection and Immunity Division, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia. Dr. Pellegrini will review preclinical studies indicating the potential for broad applicability of TetraLogic's lead compound, birinapant, in models of infectious disease, including Hepatitis B. The Company will also discuss future planned clinical activities, including a Phase 1 clinical trial of birinapant in patients with chronic Hepatitis B infection, which the Company intends to commence in late 2014 and for which Dr. Pellegrini will play a key leadership role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	To access the conference call, please dial (888) 734-0328 (U.S.) or (678) 894-3054 (International) using the Conference ID 61183614. The conference call will be webcast via the Investor Relations page on the Company's website at www.tlog.com. Approximately two hours following the live event, a webcast replay of the conference call will be accessible on the Company's website; the webcast replay will be available for 30 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute is Australia's oldest medical research institute. It is home to almost 750 researchers who are working to understand, prevent and treat diseases including infectious diseases, cancers and immune disorders. It is located in Parkville, Melbourne, and is closely associated with The University of Melbourne and The Royal Melbourne Hospital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About Birinapant&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Birinapant (TL32711) is a potent, bivalent SMAC mimetic that binds with differential affinity to multiple members of the IAP family including cIAP1, cIAP2, XIAP, and ML-IAP. Birinapant is differentiated from other SMAC mimetics in that it results in the selective degradation of cIAP1 bound to TRAF-2 in the TNF receptor complex, sparing non-TRAF-2 bound cIAP1. This unique IAP antagonism profile of birinapant may result in the improved tolerability and therapeutic index observed with this agent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About TetraLogic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	TetraLogic is a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on discovering and developing novel small molecule therapeutics in oncology and infectious diseases. TetraLogic has two clinical-stage product candidates in development: birinapant and suberohydroxamic acid phenyl ester (SHAPE). Birinapant is currently being tested in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials for hematological malignancies and solid tumors. SHAPE is entering Phase 2 trials for early-stage CTCL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 13 (Reuters) - British independent oil producer
EnQuest has agreed to take over ExxonMobil's 
share in the Malaysian Seligi oil field and the associated
production sharing contract.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acquisition, which is subject to regulator approval,
will give EnQuest a 50 percent stake in the field which it will

&lt;p&gt;ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran could contemplate cooperating with its old adversary the United States on restoring security to Iraq if it saw Washington confronting "terrorist groups in Iraq and elsewhere", Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rouhani, a pragmatist who has presided over a thaw in Iran's relations with the West, also said Tehran was unlikely to send forces to Iraq but stood ready to provide help within the framework of international law. Baghdad has not requested such assistance, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shi'ite Muslim Iran has been alarmed by the seizure this week of several major northern Iraqi towns by Sunni Islamist insurgent forces and their sweep southward to within an hour's drive of Baghdad, and not far from the Iranian border.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We all should practically and verbally confront terrorist groups," Rouhani told a news conference broadcast live on state television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Tehran would work with Washington in tackling the advances by Sunni insurgents in Iraq, he replied: "We can think about it if we see America starts confronting the terrorist groups in Iraq or elsewhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fighters of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) are bent on recreating a mediaeval caliphate spanning territory they have carved out in fragmenting Iraq and Syria, where it has exploited a power vacuum in the midst of civil war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior Iranian official told Reuters earlier this week that Tehran, which has strong leverage in Shi'ite-majority Iraq, may be ready to cooperate with Washington in helping Baghdad fight back against the jihadist ISIL rebels. (Full Story)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The official said the idea of cooperating with the Americans was being discussed within the Tehran leadership. For now, according to Iranian media, Iran will send advisers and weaponry, although probably not troops, to boost Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NOT SENDING TROOPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Iran has never dispatched any forces to Iraq and it is very unlikely it will ever happen," Rouhani told Saturday's news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western diplomats suspect Iran has in the past sent some of its Revolutionary Guards, a hardline force that works in parallel with the army, to train and advise the Iraqi army or its militia allies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interior Minister Abdolreza Rahmani Fazli, quoted by Fars news agency, said: "Supporting the Iraqi government and nation doe not mean sending troops to Iraq. It means condemning terrorist acts and closing and safeguarding our joint borders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Washington, U.S. President Barack Obama said he was reviewing military options, short of sending combat troops, to help Iraq repel the insurgency but warned any U.S. action must be accompanied by an Iraqi government effort to bridge divisions between Shi'ite and Sunni communities. (Full Story)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials said there were no contacts going on with Iran over the crisis in Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rouhani said he was not aware of any American plans for Iraq or whether Washington wanted to help Baghdad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the Iraqi government and nation ask for our help, we will review it. So far there has not been such a request," he added. "We are ready to help in the framework of international regulations and laws."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rouhani said "terrorist groups" were getting financial and political backing and weaponry from some regional countries and some powerful Western states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He named no countries, but was alluding in part to Sunni Gulf Arabs who Iran suspects has funnelled support to ISIL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where did ISIL come from? Who is funding this terrorist group? We had warned everyone, including the West, about the danger of backing such a terrorist and reckless group."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gulf Arab governments deny any role in backing ISIL, noting that the group has long battled Saudi Arabia's allies among other Sunni rebel factions in Syria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi Arabia last month designated ISIL a terrorist organisation, conveying its concern that young Saudis hardened by battle could come home to target the ruling Al Saud royal family - as happened after earlier wars in Afghanistan and Iraq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Parisa Hafezi; Writing by William Maclean; Editing by Gareth Jones)&lt;/p&gt;

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Preliminary Ratings to JPMCC 2014-INN
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) is pleased to announce the assignment of 
      preliminary ratings to the JPMCC 2014-INN transaction (see ratings list 
      below). JPMCC 2014-INN is a CMBS single borrower transaction that is 
      collateralized by a $635.0 million, floating rate loan that was 
      originated by JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association. The loan has an 
      initial two year term with three, one-year extension options. Proceeds 
      from the mortgage loan, along with $205.0 million of mezzanine financing 
      and approximately $208.0 million of new cash equity contributed by the 
      loan sponsor, were used to facilitate the acquisition of the majority 
      interest in a portfolio of 47 hospitality assets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loan is secured by the borrowers&#8217; fee simple interests in 46 
      hospitality properties and leasehold interest in one hospitality 
      property. The properties consists of 36 extended-stay properties 
      (74.6%), nine limited-service properties (20.6%) and two full-service 
      properties (4.8%) located in 30 different MSAs in 16 states. The 
      properties are operated under flags including Residence Inn by Marriott 
      (30 properties, 60.8%), Hyatt House (five properties, 13.0%), Hampton 
      Inn (five properties, 9.8%), Courtyard by Marriott (three properties, 
      7.2%), Westin (one property, 3.7%), Sheraton Four Points (one property, 
      3.6%), Sheraton (one property, 1.1%) and TownePlace Suites by Marriott 
      (one property, 0.8%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction included a detailed evaluation of the 
      properties&#8217; cash flows using our CMBS Property Evaluation Guidelines, 
      and the application of our CMBS Single Borrower  Large Loan Rating 
      Methodology. For the purposes of our analysis, we determined KBRA net 
      cash flow (KNCF) for each asset, and applied KBRA capitalization rates 
      to each property&#8217;s KNCF to determine property value. KBRA Adjusted this 
      value to give partial credit for the upfront capital improvement 
      reserves in the amount of $80.25 million that were funded into a reserve 
      account at loan origination. The weighted average variance to the 
      issuer&#8217;s NCF was 1.1%, and the weighted average value variance to each

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The city of Miami has sued JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, accusing the bank of predatory mortgage lending in minority neighborhoods that allegedly caused a wave of foreclosures during the last decade's housing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed on Friday in federal court in Florida, said the country's largest bank engaged in a continuous practice of discriminatory mortgage lending since at least 2004, violating the U.S. Fair Housing Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After issuing high-cost loans to minorities in the years before the housing crisis, JPMorgan later refused to refinance the loans on the same terms as it extended to whites, leading to defaults and foreclosures, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit came just weeks after the city of Los Angeles filed similar claims against JPMorgan, seeking to recoup damages for lost tax revenue and increased city services needed in blighted neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Miami City Attorney's claims are baseless and stand contrary to our long record of providing affordable housing to low- to moderate-income families across the region," JPMorgan spokesman Jason Lobo said. The bank will defend itself against the claims, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of America Corp also face lawsuits by Los Angeles and Miami for allegedly giving minorities home loans they could not afford, resulting in massive defaults. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks have contested the claims, saying they have records as responsible lenders. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among major cities, Miami has led the country in foreclosures, and JPMorgan's practices contributed to its problems, Friday's lawsuit alleged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loans in predominantly minority neighborhoods in Miami were about 4.6 times more likely to result in foreclosure than loans in neighborhoods with a majority of white residents, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miami is still being damaged because of the services needed to combat unsafe and dangerous conditions, crime and even gang activity at foreclosed properties, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo and Citigroup recently lost bids to have their lawsuits tossed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the city of Miami did not immediately return a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares fell 0.2 percent to $56.91. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is City of Miami v JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, U.S. District Court, Southern District of Florida, No 14-cv-22205&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Will Dunham and Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 16 (Reuters) - Britain is overhauling its visa
system to make it easier for Chinese tourists and businesses to
visit the country, interior minister Theresa May said on Monday,
marking the start of a visit by Chinese Premier Li Keqiang.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li arrived in London on Monday for a three-day official
visit which includes an audience with Queen Elizabeth and is
aimed at putting aside a recent history of political tension and
building closer trade and commercial ties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keen to tap into the spending power of tourists from China's
expanding middle class and encourage businesses from the world's
second-largest economy to deal with Britain, the Home Office
announced a streamlined application process for Chinese visitors
and a service to grant them visas within 24 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The number of Chinese people coming to Britain to visit and
do business is soaring ... these changes will ensure it is
easier than ever before to visit the UK," May said in a speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing had criticised the previous application process for
being overly lengthy, bureaucratic and opaque.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China is the number one luxury spender worldwide, making up
29 percent of the total global luxury spend in 2013, a December
report by consultancy firm Bain &amp; Company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending by Chinese tourists in Britain is expected to surge
over the 1 billion pound mark by 2017, an increase of 84 percent
from 2013 levels, a report commissioned by Barclays said in May.
It highlighted increased spending by foreign holidaymakers as a
source of growth for the British economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following a successful pilot scheme with tour operators, all
business and tourism visitors will be able to use a single form
to process their visa application for Britain and for a Schengen
visa, which allows access to 26 European countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with concerns about immigration top of Britons' concerns
heading into a 2015 general election, May reiterated that
Britain had no intention of joining the Schengen scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FINANCIAL CENTRE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The visa announcement was welcomed by the City of London
Corporation, which represents London's financial centre. London
wants to become an offshore hub for trading in China's currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"London cannot afford to fall behind its main rivals in the
business and financial sectors such as Luxembourg, Frankfurt and
Paris," the corporation's policy chairman Mark Boleat said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China Construction Bank , China's
second-largest lender, confirmed on Monday it has been selected
by the Chinese government to become the clearing authority for
London renminbi trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within the next six months Chinese visitors will also be
able to travel to the UK if they have an Irish visitor visa, and
vice versa, the Home Office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's national tourism agency, VisitBritain, said
196,000 Chinese visitors came to the country in 2013, spending
an average 2,508 pounds ($4,200) each - four times the overall
average spend by foreign visitors to Britain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research by the UK Chinese Visa Alliance, a group led by
luxury and retail firms which campaigns for easier access to
visas, showed difficulty obtaining visas was the reason most
commonly cited by tour operators for not organising more tours

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A day before he is scheduled to begin serving a two-year prison sentence for insider trading, former Goldman Sachs Group Inc director Rajat Gupta asked a federal appeals court to reduce a $13.9 million civil penalty and shorten his lifetime ban from serving as an officer of a public company.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Gupta&#8217;s lawyer, Seth Waxman, told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York that the penalty was excessive given that Gupta separately was ordered to pay $6 million in restitution to Goldman Sachs and $5 million in criminal fines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But David Lisitza, a lawyer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said the $13.9 million penalty was appropriate given the brazen nature of Gupta&#8217;s actions, even though he did not personally profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;This is the insider trading case of our century so far,&#8221; he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 65, was convicted in June 2012 of passing confidential tips he heard at Goldman board meetings to his friend, former hedge fund manager and billionaire Raj Rajaratnam. Rajaratnam, the founder of Galleon Group, is serving an 11-year prison term for insider trading.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta is set to report to federal prison on Tuesday, the same day that Rajaratnam&#8217;s younger brother, Rengan, goes on trial in New York on insider trading charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel of the 2nd Circuit previously denied Gupta&#8217;s appeal of his conviction; he has asked the full circuit to rehear his argument. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, also the former global managing director of the consulting firm McKinsey &amp; Co, is the highest-ranking corporate official to be convicted in the government&#8217;s insider trading probe that has convicted 81 people at trial or through guilty pleas since August 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff in Manhattan federal court oversaw Gupta&#8217;s criminal trial as well as a parallel civil case brought by the SEC that led to the $13.9 million fine and the ban.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sentencing Gupta to prison, Rakoff said he was unlikely to commit similar crimes in the future. But Rakoff nevertheless later imposed the lifetime ban that the SEC sought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxman, a former U.S. solicitor general, argued on Monday that Rakoff had essentially come to opposite conclusions based on the same facts, prompting Circuit Judge Barrington Parker to ask Lisitza how the same judge could make a "180-degree" turn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lisitza responded that the risk of recidivism necessary to lock someone &#8220;in a cage&#8221; was different than that required to "keep him out of the boardroom."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Gupta was dealt a setback on Monday when the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear Rajaratnam&#8217;s appeal of his own conviction.&#160;Both men objected to the government&#8217;s use of wiretaps against them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Joseph Ax; Editing by Noeleen Walder, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 16 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co 
has been sued by the city of Miami, accusing the bank of
predatory mortgage lending in minority neighborhoods that
allegedly caused a wave of foreclosures during the last decade's
housing crisis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed on Friday in federal court in Florida,
said the country's largest bank engaged in a continuous practice
of discriminatory mortgage lending since at least 2004,
violating the U.S. Fair Housing Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After issuing high-cost loans to minorities in the years
before the housing crisis, JPMorgan later refused to refinance
the loans on the same terms as it extended to whites, leading to
defaults and foreclosures, the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit came just weeks after the city of Los Angeles
filed similar claims against JPMorgan, seeking to recoup damages
for lost tax revenue and increased city services needed in
blighted neighborhoods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Miami City Attorney's claims are baseless and stand
contrary to our long record of providing affordable housing to
low- to moderate-income families across the region," JPMorgan
spokesman Jason Lobo said. The bank will defend itself against
the claims, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo &amp; Co, Citigroup Inc and Bank of
America Corp also face lawsuits by Los Angeles and Miami
for allegedly giving minorities home loans they could not
afford, resulting in massive defaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks have contested the claims, saying they have
records as responsible lenders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among major cities, Miami has led the country in
foreclosures, and JPMorgan's practices contributed to its
problems, Friday's lawsuit alleged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loans in predominantly minority neighborhoods in Miami were
about 4.6 times more likely to result in foreclosure than loans
in neighborhoods with a majority of white residents, the lawsuit
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miami is still being damaged because of the services needed
to combat unsafe and dangerous conditions, crime and even gang
activity at foreclosed properties, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo and Citigroup recently lost bids to have their
lawsuits tossed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the city of Miami did not immediately return
a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is City of Miami v JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Florida, No 14-cv-22205

&lt;p&gt;(Adds details, Exxon quotes, context)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, June 16 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil's Chief
Executive Rex Tillerson affirmed his commitment to doing
business with Russia on Monday with a speech at a high-profile
industry conference in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western governments have urged global firms to avoid such
appearances as they impose sanctions on Russian business leaders
over Russia's annexation of Crimea and its actions in eastern
Ukraine, where pro-Russian armed rebels are seeking secession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May, several Western energy bosses attended the St
Petersburg International Economic Forum, saving it from failure
as top executives from banks and other firms stayed away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the years ahead, we look forward to tapping advantages
... in the Far East of Russia..., unlocking new supplies of oil
and natural gas in the Kara Sea and beyond," Tillerson told the
World Petroleum Congress in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BP CEO Bob Dudley, who attended the St Petersburg
forum, told reporters on the sidelines of the Moscow congress
that BP "continues to work and do business as usual" in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While BP holds a 19.75 percent stake in Russian
state-controlled oil giant Rosneft, Exxon works with
Rosneft mostly through joint ventures, including one to explore
the Arctic Kara Sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin, who has been targeted personally
with sanctions, said this month that the start of that
exploration could be brought forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has a stake in the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project, and
has agreed to help Russia develop unconventional oil resources
such as shale oil as output from its conventional fields in
Siberia declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEOs of Norway's Statoil, France's Total
 and China National Petroleum Corp (CNPC) were among
those expected to attend the Moscow conference.

      Index Report for Advanced Analytics
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hurwitz  Associates&#160;today announced the findings of The Hurwitz Victory 
      Index Report for Advanced Analytics. Designed as a market research 
      assessment tool, The Hurwitz Victory Index highlights the diverse uses 
      for advanced analytics technology and the vendors who make those 
      applications possible. Some current uses of advanced analytics include 
      predicting customer behavior and preferences, sales and industry 
      forecasting, predicting failures in machinery, and predicting and 
      reducing fraud. The Hurwitz Victory Index Report for Advanced Analytics 
      examines the top trends for end users to consider and analyzes 10 
      vendors across four key dimensions: vision, viability, validity and 
      value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the first quarter of 2014, Hurwitz  Associates surveyed more than 
      465 advanced analytics users and conducted in-depth qualitative 
      interviews with 30 organizations across industries including 
      manufacturing, banking, insurance, retail, professional sports, and 
      government agencies. The survey covered business and technical benefits 
      as well as the challenges of different analytics platforms.

        Most users are happy with their current analytics platform &#8211; 60% rate 
        their vendors&#8217; breadth and depth of statistical functionality as 
        excellent.
      
			
        Customers have a growing expectation that business users, such as a 
        chief marketing officer (CMO) or account executive, can access 
        insights from analytics without the help of a data scientist or 
        statistician. Vendors are creating more business friendly offerings, 
        however, there is still work to be done &#8211; only 45% of respondents 
        rated their analytics platform as excellent for business users, while 
        nearly 60% rated it excellent for data scientists and statisticians.
      
			
        There is explosive growth of the use of the programing language R, and 
        users are having great success with its capabilities. While R is 
        becoming pervasive within organizations and in academia, it is still 
        viewed as a tool for data scientists and statisticians. Of the R users 
        who participated in the survey (40 users), 25% ranked it as below 
        average for ease of use, and 33% ranked it below average for its 
        ability to support business users.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The advanced analytics market is experiencing significant growth, and 
      we expect interest in this technology to increase dramatically over the 
      next several years. As companies recognize the positive impact of 
      analytics on one aspect of their business, they are rapidly applying 
      advanced analytics to business challenges across the enterprise,&#8221; said 
      Daniel Kirsch, report co-author and Senior Analyst with Hurwitz  
      Associates. "We see an increasing number of emerging players developing 
      innovative solutions to tap into this market, and we expect some of 
      these new companies with deep technology roots will be acquired.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			What is Advanced Analytics?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Companies use advanced analytics to discover patterns and anomalies in 
      large volumes of data and then use this insight to predict the outcomes 
      of future events and interactions. Advanced analytics is also used for 
      optimization and complex event processing and analysis. With advanced 
      analytics, your organization can adjust its plans and strategies to 
      become more competitive, minimize potential risk and optimize 
      decision-making in real time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "At Hurwitz  Associates we take pride in providing a holistic view of 
      the value and benefit of important technologies. We assess not just the 
      technical capability of the technology but its ability to provide 
      tangible value to the business," said Judith Hurwitz, President of 
      Hurwitz  Associates. "The Victory Index will serve as a critical guide 
      for those looking to adopt technologies that can deliver the competitive 
      edge needed to succeed in today's dynamic business environment."

			Montrium Demonstrates Microsoft&#8217;s Continued Commitment to Compliance 
      in the Azure Cloud for Life Sciences
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			MONTREAL, Canada. June 16th, 2014 &#8211; 
      Today Montrium, 
      Regulatory  Compliance Specialists announced the release of the first 
      round of annual updates to the Qualification 
      Guidelines for Microsoft&#8217;s cloud solutions Microsoft Azure and 
      Microsoft Office 365. The recent updates, undertaken by Montrium&#8217;s 
      expert compliance team, demonstrate the continued commitment that 
      Microsoft&#8217;s cloud services have when addressing the necessary regulatory 
      requirements for Life Science organizations in maintaining compliance in 
      the cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new release of these documents sees alignment and additional detail 
      surrounding qualification deliverables recommended by GAMP within the IT 
      Infrastructure  Compliance Good Practice Guide. Microsoft is the only 
      leading cloud provider who is listed in the Gartner Magic Quadrant as a 
      leader in both Platform as a Service (PaaS) and Infrastructure as a 
      Service (Iaas). In addition, Microsoft is the only 
      major cloud provider to receive public 
      validation from all 28 national Data Protection Authorities that 
      regulate companies with operations in the European Union (Article 
      29 Letter).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our aim with the qualification guidelines was to provide industry with 
      an evolving set of documents that would allow Life Science companies to 
      reference the necessary controls and formulate a solid strategy for 
      compliance in the cloud,&#8221; said Michael 
      Zwetkow, Vice-President Operations and Cloud Compliance SME at 
      Montrium. &#8220;In the latest update, we looked at the feedback we received 
      from key industry figures on the initial guideline and adapted the 
      documents to provide further clarification on the audited controls and 
      qualification deliverables.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft&#8217;s approach to providing qualified cloud platforms for Life 
      Science organizations is to provide system documentation and 
      certifications across a wide range of standards, such as ISO27001, 
      SSAE16 SOC 1 and 2, HIPAA/HITECH and others, to enable customers and 
      partners to qualify Microsoft&#8217;s cloud platforms. This qualification 
      guideline helps Microsoft&#8217;s customers and partners build and deploy 
      validated applications that meet regulatory requirements, including FDA 
      21 CFR Part 11 for Electronic Records and Electronic Signatures and 
      Eudralex Volume 4 - Annex 11 Computerized Systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In our continuing effort to provide information around regulatory 
      compliance within our cloud services, we felt it integral to demonstrate 
      the ongoing work that is being done to allow Life Science companies to 
      leverage qualified cloud solutions that address the necessary regulatory 
      requirements,&#8221; said Gabor Fari, Director of Business Development and 
      Strategy for Life Sciences at Microsoft. &#8220;Our approach to the update of 
      these documents was to look at the annual certification audit reports as 
      well as the industry feedback we received, and how these items could be 
      addressed through further clarification and additional documentation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Montrium is a leading provider of cloud-based SaaS applications 
      specifically engineered for the Life Sciences industry. Through the 
      deployment of our Montrium 
      Connect solutions for Document  Quality Management in the Microsoft 
      Azure cloud, we have the ability to offer new opportunities for 
      accessing regulated applications at a lower cost and in a shorter time 
      frame, whilst ensuring regulatory compliance and data integrity.

    &lt;/p&gt;

      The resin from the polyethylene units will be used for a variety of

      The engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) phase of the two

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) director Rajat Gupta on Tuesday began serving his two-year prison term for insider trading, and lost his challenge to a $13.9 million civil penalty and permanent ban from acting as a public company officer.&lt;/p&gt;

U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who hears emergency appeals from the 2nd Circuit, last week denied his request to stay free on bail while he appeals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison sentence, and is also being housed at Devens.

&lt;p&gt;By Joseph Ax and Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 director Rajat Gupta on Tuesday began serving his
two-year prison term for insider trading, and lost his challenge
to a $13.9 million civil penalty and permanent ban from acting
as a public company officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta, 65, reported to FMC Devens, a medical facility and
satellite camp in Ayer, Massachusetts about 40 miles (64 km)
northwest of Boston, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Prisons said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former global managing director of the McKinsey &amp; Co
consulting firm began his term as the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals separately rejected his claim that the fine and officer
ban imposed in a separate U.S. Securities and Exchange Commision
civil case was excessive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A three-judge panel of that court concluded that U.S.
District Judge Jed Rakoff, who oversaw the criminal and civil
cases, acted within his discretion in imposing that punishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seth Waxman, an attorney for Gupta, did not immediately
respond to a request for comment on the ruling. SEC spokesman
John Nester declined to make an immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A jury convicted Gupta in June 2012 of passing confidential
information he learned from Goldman board meetings, including a
crucial investment from Warren Buffett, to Raj Rajaratnam, the

million in restitution to Goldman and pay a $5 million fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rakoff imposed the officer ban in the civil case despite
finding at the criminal sentencing that Gupta was unlikely to
commit future crimes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Waxman had argued to the 2nd Circuit that Rakoff's positions
were inconsistent, but the appeals court said the standard in a

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 17 (Reuters) - Former Goldman Sachs Group Inc
 director Rajat Gupta on Tuesday lost his challenge to a
$13.9 million civil penalty and a permanent ban from acting as
an officer for a public company, the same day he was scheduled
to begin serving a two-year prison sentence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a brief order, the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals
rejected Gupta's claim that the penalty and ban were excessive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal jury convicted the 65-year-old in June 2012 of
passing confidential information he learned from Goldman board
meetings to Raj Rajaratnam, the former billionaire and founder
of the Galleon Group hedge fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam is serving an 11-year prison sentence. His
younger brother, Rengan, a former Galleon portfolio manager,
went on trial on Tuesday in New York on charges that he engaged
in an insider trading scheme with his brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta was sentenced to a two-year prison sentence as well as
$6 million in restitution to Goldman and a $5 million fine as a
result of his criminal conviction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission also filed a
parallel civil action against Gupta, leading to a $13.9 million
penalty and a lifetime ban from acting as a public company's
officer. Gupta had appealed the civil sanctions as unwarranted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta's attorney, Seth Waxman, did not immediately respond
to a request for comment on Tuesday. An SEC spokesman declined
to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who oversaw both the
criminal and civil cases, had found Gupta was unlikely to commit
future crimes at his criminal sentencing but nevertheless
imposed a permanent ban in his civil case. On Monday, Waxman had
argued to the 2nd Circuit that Rakoff's positions were
inconsistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a unanimous three-judge panel said on Tuesday that the
standard in a criminal context was different from that in a
civil case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta was scheduled to report to federal prison on Tuesday.
He previously lost an appeal of his conviction before a panel of
judges at the 2nd Circuit but has asked the full court to rehear
the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission v.
Gupta, 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 13-3062.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Leading Multichannel Cloud Contact Center Integration with Microsoft 
      Dynamics CRM Unified Service Desk will Deliver Unrivaled New 
      Capabilities for Cloud-based Contact Centers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			LiveOps, 
      Inc., the global leader in cloud contact center and customer service 
      solutions, today announced the launch of the LiveOps for Microsoft 
      Dynamics CRM. LiveOps for Microsoft Dynamics CRM will integrate with 
      Microsoft Dynamics CRM Unified Service Desk to deliver multichannel 
      cloud contact center functionality. Unified Service Desk was released as 
      part of the Microsoft Dynamics CRM Spring 2014 release. This solution 
      embodies the vision shared by both companies of connecting brands with 
      customers via innovative technology and channels to deliver amazing 
      customer experiences.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Eighty-nine 
      percent of consumers believe it is important to be able to 
      communicate with brands on any channel and still receive the same 
      quality and efficiency of response,&#8221; said Jujhar Singh, general manager 
      of program management, Microsoft Dynamics CRM. &#8220;We designed Microsoft 
      Dynamics CRM Unified Service Desk to provide a unified experience for 
      agents to deliver efficient and effective interactions across all 
      channels. Further, Unified Service Desk serves as a powerful platform 
      for leading vendors and partners to showcase their customer service 
      solutions. Our work with LiveOps will help deliver on our vision of 
      enabling businesses to deliver amazing customer experiences across all 
      channels.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LiveOps will offer voice and web chat capabilities to complement 
      advanced, multichannel, social cloud contact center capabilities 
      delivered by Microsoft Dynamics CRM Unified Service Desk. This CTI 
      integration with Microsoft Dynamics CRM, recently named a leader in the 
      2014 Gartner Magic Quadrant for CRM Customer Engagement Center, further 
      enhances the solution&#8217;s customer service capabilities by giving agents 
      access to integrated contact center applications, as well as empowering 
      managers to monitor and optimize inbound and outbound customer 
      interactions to improve key metrics for customer satisfaction and agent 
      productivity. The solution will provide a complete, integrated contact 
      center solution that enables agents to manage every customer interaction 
      for faster and better resolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Customers want to use a breadth of communication channels for customer 
      service,&#8221;1 writes Kate Leggett, principal analyst, Forrester 
      Research, in a recent Forrester blog post. In an earlier post, she 
      states, &#8220;Companies must understand their customers&#8217; communication 
      channel preferences and&#8230;choose technology ecosystems that provide the 
      business agility and flexibility to meet customer channel demands today 
      and in the future.&#8221;2
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LiveOps for Microsoft Dynamics CRM provides features and functionality 
      that enable brands to better connect with customers across traditional 
      and mobile voice channels. With features such as screen pop, call 
      control, embedded phone and chat panel, on-screen click-to-dial, 
      integrated call recording and LiveOps&#8217; award-winning multichannel 
      routing, agents are able to deliver personalized customer experiences 
      and first contact resolution, while increasing productivity, reducing 
      costs and maximizing customer relationship management (CRM) investments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This new solution embodies the vision and force of two cloud leaders to 
      deliver exceptional customer experiences,&#8221; said Marty Beard, chairman 
      and CEO, LiveOps. &#8220;Through our own innovation in cloud technology, we 
      are able to extend the value of Microsoft Dynamics CRM Unified Service 
      Desk. In doing so, we are expanding the army of super agents who work to 
      achieve first contact resolution across all channels. In turn, customers 
      will receive a better experience and brands will see an increase in 
      customer lifetime value. Together, LiveOps and Microsoft are leading a 
      new wave of customer experience management that leverages real-time 
      social and multichannel interactions, resulting in customer experiences 
      that are out of this world.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and rival Swiss drugmaker Novartis AG on Tuesday said they had asked U.S. regulators to approve their vaccines to prevent meningitis infections in people aged 10 to 25.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The companies are pushing for FDA approval of their respective vaccines following recent widely publicized outbreaks of the dangerous infectious disease at Princeton University and at the University of California at Santa Barbara (UCSB).   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vaccines from both companies, which have been in development for years, are designed to protect against the B strain of the meningococcal bacterium, which causes about 40 percent of U.S. meningitis infections each year and which current vaccines do not protect against. Different vaccines are already available to protect against other strains of the bacterium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis' new product against the B strain, called Bexsero, has been approved in 34 countries, including the European Union and Canada, since last year. And under a special designation from the FDA, Novartis provided nearly 30,000 doses of Bexsero to students and staff at Princeton and to UCSB in order to help control their outbreaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's experimental product, named rLP2086, is being evaluated in more than 20,000 participants. Analysts are expecting it to generate annual sales of more than $500 million by 2020, if it is approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both vaccines have been granted "breakthrough therapy" designations from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, meaning they are deemed likely to show big improvement over existing products and deserve more intensive FDA feedback on how to efficiently develop them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meningitis is spread through coughing and exchanges of saliva, and people living in dormitories or other crowded living quarters are especially at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bacterial meningitis can cause the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord to swell. The most severe cases can result in death, hearing loss, brain damage, kidney disease or require the amputation of limbs.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N) was named top pan-European equity brokerage for a second straight year at the annual Thomson Reuters Extel Awards on Tuesday, while JPMorgan Asset Management won best fund manager for the fifth year in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The awards, which were handed out in a ceremony at London's Guild Hall, are significant badges of honor in the industry as they are based on the votes of thousands of industry insiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong votes can secure bragging rights for winning firms and, for highly rated individuals, can result in lucrative job offers and pay rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a repeat of 2013's results, Bank of America Merrill Lynch scooped the prize for leading pan-European brokerage in equity and equity-linked research, ahead of 12-time winner UBS (UBSN.VX). Morgan Stanley (MS.N) remained in third place. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management (JPM.N) was joined in the top three in the best fund manager category by Wellington Management and Fidelity Worldwide Investment, which last year placed fifth and fourth respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among individual prize winners was Andrew Wood of Sanford C. Bernstein, who for the eighth consecutive year took home the trophy for leading pan-European equity analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management's Peter Lawrence reclaimed the title of top fund management individual from Philip Guest of UBS Global Asset Management, who came second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC's (HSBA.L) Niels Pecriaux climbed nine places to finish third in that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLG Partners was for the second straight year named top hedge fund, with Tudor Capital in second. Moore Capital Management jumped from sixth to third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The awards also cover companies' investor relations teams. Germany's Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) took the top spot, followed by Swiss drugmaker Roche (ROG.VX) and French media and telecoms group Vivendi (VIV.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Extel awards are based on a survey conducted by Thomson Reuters between the end of March and early May.

&lt;p&gt;* BoA Merrill Lynch top pan-European equity brokerage&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* JPMorgan voted best fund management firm&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* GLG Partners wins leading hedge fund prize&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Clare Hutchison&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 was named top pan-European equity brokerage for a second
straight year at the annual Thomson Reuters Extel Awards on
Tuesday, while JPMorgan Asset Management won best fund manager
for the fifth year in a row.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The awards, which were handed out in a ceremony at London's
Guild Hall, are significant badges of honour in the industry as
they are based on the votes of thousands of industry insiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong votes can secure bragging rights for winning firms
and, for highly rated individuals, can result in lucrative job
offers and pay rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a repeat of 2013's results, Bank of America Merrill Lynch
scooped the prize for leading pan-European brokerage in equity
and equity-linked research, ahead of 12-time winner UBS
. Morgan Stanley remained in third place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management was joined in the top
three in the best fund manager category by Wellington Management
and Fidelity Worldwide Investment, which last year placed fifth
and fourth respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among individual prize winners was Andrew Wood of Sanford C.
Bernstein, who for the eighth consecutive year took home the
trophy for leading pan-European equity analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management's Peter Lawrence reclaimed the
title of top fund management individual from Philip Guest of UBS
Global Asset Management, who came second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSBC's Niels Pecriaux climbed nine places to finish
third in that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLG Partners was for the second straight year named top
hedge fund, with Tudor Capital in second. Moore Capital
Management jumped from sixth to third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The awards also cover companies' investor relations teams.
Germany's Deutsche Telekom took the top spot,
followed by Swiss drugmaker Roche and French media and
telecoms group Vivendi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Extel awards are based on a survey conducted by Thomson
Reuters between the end of March and early May. This year
attracted a record level of participation, with more than 16,000
individuals from around 6,300 brokerages, fund managers,
research houses and major European companies taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WeConvene, a web-based platform that allows the investment
community access to companies, said on Monday it had agreed to
acquire Extel from Thomson Reuters in a deal expected
to close by the end of June. No financial details were
disclosed.

			Wintergreen Urges Coca-Cola to Address Conflicts Amid Buyout 
      Speculation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Citing its concern about possible conflicts of interest at The Coca-Cola 
      Company (NYSE:KO) amid media speculation that 3G Capital and Berkshire 
      Hathaway may be planning a transaction to take Coca-Cola private, 
      Wintergreen Advisers today released the following letter. It is 
      addressed to the independent directors who chair Coca-Cola&#8217;s Audit, 
      Compensation, and Governance Committees and urges them to address these 
      conflicts and take steps to exercise their fiduciary duty with regard 
      for all shareholders.

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dear Ms. Lagomasino and Messrs. Greenberg and Nunn:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Events over the past few months, leading up to and after the annual 
      meeting of Coca-Cola shareholders, have given rise to grave concerns at 
      Wintergreen Advisers regarding potential conflicts of interests at 
      Coca-Cola. I am writing to you, in your roles as chairs of the 
      Compensation, Audit, and Governance Committees, respectively, to urge 
      you and your fellow Board members to address the current and potential 
      conflicts that we identify below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wintergreen&#8217;s specific and most recent concern stems from speculation in 
      the U.S. and Brazilian media that Berkshire Hathaway, your largest 
      shareholder, and 3G Capital, a private equity firm, may be planning a 
      transaction to take Coca-Cola private.1 Media reports express 
      the view that Berkshire's and 3G's recent joint acquisition of Heinz may 
      serve as the blueprint for such a transaction. Additionally, Warren 
      Buffett has stated that the Heinz deal &#8220;created a partnership template 
      that may be used by Berkshire in future acquisitions of size&#8221;2 
      and stated at Berkshire&#8217;s 2014 shareholders meeting that "we haven&#8217;t 
      bought Coca-Cola, yet.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As you may recall, the Heinz deal took place quickly, in part because 
      there was no &#8220;go-shop&#8221; period in which Heinz could solicit competing 
      offers and potentially increase the purchase price. In addition, Heinz 
      agreed to a $750 million termination fee, which is about three times 
      greater than if there had been a typical go-shop provision.3 
      All of this combined to make the deal &#8220;unusual&#8221; and the Heinz Board 
      subsequently negotiated only with Berkshire and 3G.4 As 
      adviser to longtime shareholders of Coca-Cola, we are concerned that a 
      similar type of sweetheart, insider deal for Coca-Cola could, in our 
      opinion, significantly undervalue Coca-Cola and irreparably harm 
      Coca-Cola shareholders. Since Berkshire is Coca-Cola's largest 
      shareholder, owning greater than 9% of the outstanding shares, and 
      Warren Buffett's son Howard serves as a Director of both Coca-Cola and 
      Berkshire Hathaway, we believe our concerns are valid.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      None of Coca-Cola, Berkshire or 3G has publicly commented on the 
      accuracy of these media reports. However, the possibility of a 
      Berkshire-3G bid puts both Warren Buffett's curious silence and 
      subsequent abstention regarding the Coca-Cola 2014 Equity Plan that he 
      thought was "quite excessive" and the Coca-Cola Board&#8217;s machinations to 
      win shareholder approval of the excessive Plan, seemingly at any cost, 
      in a worrisome context.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the Plan, a buyout could trigger a change-of-control provision, 
      immediately vesting equity awards granted to Coca-Cola&#8217;s top management 
      and its Board members. In addition, the Plan removed a 5% cap on awards 
      to any individual, potentially allowing Coca-Cola to front-load awards. 
      As a result of these provisions, stock and options worth hundreds of 
      millions of dollars at today's share price that would otherwise be paid 
      out over a period of several years could vest overnight. If such a deal 
      were completed today, Coca-Cola Chairman and CEO Muhtar Kent alone would 
      stand to reap a nine-figure pay day. Coca-Cola's and Berkshire's failure 
      to meaningfully address concerns regarding the Plan and the way it was 
      adopted raise significant questions about whether passing the Plan was a 
      pay off for Mr. Kent's acquiescence in going along with a future 
      acquisition of Coca-Cola.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Regardless of whether the Coca-Cola Board considers this accelerated 
      vesting a feature or an oversight of the Plan, we are concerned that it 
      incentivizes the Board and Mr. Kent to sell Coca-Cola, regardless of the 
      price. In addition, in a "going-private" transaction, the buyers (here, 
      potentially Berkshire and 3G) seek to pay the lowest possible price for 
      the target company, whereas it is in the best interests of the 
      shareholders to receive the highest premium possible. We remind the 
      Coca-Cola Board members that in a potential buyout situation, they have 
      a fiduciary duty to shareholders to obtain the highest price reasonably 
      available, regardless of whether they have competing personal interests.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In our opinion, any proposed transaction should be reviewed and priced 
      by an independent committee of the Coca-Cola Board with the assistance 
      of respected outside counsel and advisers. At a minimum, we believe 
      there should be a go-shop period in which Coca-Cola solicits multiple 
      bids and creates a truly competitive process in order to obtain the 
      highest reasonable price for shareholders. Given the extent of the 
      potential conflicts of interest and the events over the past few months, 
      we expect nothing less.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, the Coca-Cola Board should consider heading off a potential 
      bid by undertaking an immediate restructuring plan of its own under a 
      new management team. We believe there is a great deal of additional 
      value within Coca-Cola that a new management team could quickly unlock 
      by running Coca-Cola more efficiently and on behalf of its true owners, 
      the shareholders. We are concerned by current management&#8217;s recent track 
      record of acquiring short-term growth at lofty valuations, such as the 
      recent Keurig Green Mountain Inc. acquisition, rather than focusing on 
      long-term growth and profitability at Coca-Cola&#8217;s core brands and 
      products. Additional such deals will only dilute the enormous value of 
      Coca-Cola&#8217;s existing brands and distract management from the task of 
      restoring Coca-Cola to organic growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since Coca-Cola filed its 2014 Proxy Statement and subsequently muscled 
      through the controversial Equity Plan, there are now more questions than 
      answers. It increasingly appears to us that there are substantial 
      conflicts of interests, extensive governance issues and perhaps plans to 
      take Coca-Cola private. This is extremely troubling and is exacerbated 
      by Coca-Cola's failure to address these legitimate concerns. The 
      shareholders deserve prompt and complete answers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) is launching its first exchange-traded fund on Tuesday as the Wall Street bank's asset management business makes its debut in the $1.8 trillion U.S. exchange-traded fund arena.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The JPMorgan Diversified Return Global Equity ETF (JPGE.P) is set to start trading Tuesday on the NYSE Arca under the ticker "JPGE." The launch brings J.P. Morgan Asset Management, a long-time mutual fund provider, into a fast-growing ETF market dominated by asset managers including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), State Street Corp (STT.N) and Vanguard Group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While J.P. Morgan has exchange-traded notes, JPGE is the firm's first ETF - funds that hold a basket of securities and trade on an exchange like stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bob Deutsch, Global Head of ETFs for J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said he sees the ETF as an extension of the firm's mutual fund business. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"First and foremost, it's part of our mutual fund product line," Deutsch said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm's long-term focus is to build out an active ETF business that builds on its background as an active manager. While the first slated ETFs are in equities, Deutsch said the firm plans to expand into other asset classes. "We're working on a broad pipeline that does cut across asset classes," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new ETF will track the FTSE Developed Diversified Factor Index, a part of FTSE's broader Global Diversified Factor Index Series, which the firm developed with FTSE. The index uses a "multi-factor" approach that selects securities based on relative valuation, price momentum, low volatility and size, rather than traditional weighting by market-capitalization. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such strategies, which straddle the line between active and passive management, have been dubbed "strategic" or "smart" beta by the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsch said he expects financial advisers, as well as institutional clients to use the ETF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P.

		&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, CA--(Marketwired - Jun 17, 2014) - 
				InsideView, a pioneer in CRM Intelligence, today announced that it is introducing new capabilities to Microsoft Dynamics CRM through its Insights, powered by InsideView feature, (formerly Social Insights). Microsoft Dynamics CRM Insights users are now able to post important news articles and company trigger events into their Yammer feeds within Microsoft Dynamics CRM, enabling work teams to communicate and collaborate more naturally and efficiently about events affecting their prospects and customers, without leaving the solution. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October of last year, InsideView and Microsoft signed a strategic OEM agreement to include InsideView for Sales&#8482; with Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online. The partnership made InsideView for Sales available to users of Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online at no additional charge. It was included in all Professional licenses in the U.S. and Canada, and was originally known as Social Insights, powered by InsideView. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our partnership with Microsoft Dynamics has helped to evolve CRM beyond sales workflow and management reporting to give sales people the dynamic information they need to be more effective," said Umberto Milletti, CEO of InsideView. "The continued evolution and improvement of the offering reaffirm the strength and success of our partnership as we continue to innovate and provide the essential company and contact information needed by our customers." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Insights is powered by the InsideView CRM Intelligence&#8482; platform and provides Microsoft Dynamics CRM Online users accurate company and contact data, relevant news and social insights, and an extensive network of professional connections that can be leveraged during the marketing and selling process to be relevant, sell smarter and grow faster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Custom Watchlists and automatic alerts keep sales and marketing professionals abreast of news and events that affect their accounts and give them contextual information so they can make the most of every call or customer visit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accurate company and contact data can be automatically synchronized with account, lead and contact profiles in the CRM system, keeping records up to date and accurate as people and companies change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The combination of Microsoft Dynamics CRM and InsideView has been incredibly powerful for our users," said Fred Studer, general manager at Microsoft Dynamics. "Expanding Insights to include Yammer posts gives users one more way to get valuable customer insights directly inside their CRM system rather than constantly switching applications." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To maximize the value users get from Insights, InsideView now offers complimentary bi-monthly training sessions.

			2014 U.S. Equity Greenwich Share and Quality Leaders Revealed
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are tied 
      for the number-one spot among brokers, with trading shares of 8.3%&#8211;8.5% 
      in U.S. Equity Trading for combined high-touch and low-touch cash equity 
      commissions with U.S.-based institutions as of early Q1 2014. Morgan 
      Stanley and Credit Suisse round out the top five with identical market 
      shares of 7.8%. These firms are the 2014 
      Greenwich Share Leaders in U.S. Equity Trading.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In U.S. equities the main priority is getting paid for what you 
      deliver,&#8221; says Greenwich Associates consultant Jay 
      Bennett. &#8220;By maintaining their trading share in trading, some of the 
      bulge bracket banks are now punching above their weight class in terms 
      of their research presence. On the other hand, mid-sized brokers and 
      research specialists that are now being paid in large part through CSAs 
      must be careful that they are being adequately compensated for their 
      research.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the increasingly important category of U.S. Equity Algorithmic 
      Trading, the top position is held jointly by Credit Suisse, Goldman 
      Sachs and Morgan Stanley, which are used for algo trading by 60%&#8211;64% of 
      institutional investors. J.P. Morgan, UBS and Bank of America Merrill 
      Lynch round out the 2014 
      Greenwich Share Leaders in U.S. Equity Algorithmic Trading, tied 
      with market penetration scores of 48%&#8211;51%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Citi is the clear leader in North American Portfolio Trading, with a 
      trading share of 10.5%, followed by three banks&#8212;Bank of America Merrill 
      Lynch, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley&#8212;tied with shares of 9.2%&#8211;9.7%, 
      and then Barclays, Deutsche Bank and Credit Suisse, which are tied with 
      shares of 8.2%-8.6%. These firms are the 2014 
      Greenwich Share Leaders in U.S. Equity Portfolio Trading.

      Greenwich Associates asks institutional portfolio managers, analysts and 
      traders participating in our annual research program to rate the quality 
      of service and products they receive from individual brokers. In U.S. 
      Equity Research and Analyst Service, J.P. Morgan and Sanford C. 
      Bernstein receive top scores and are the 2014 Greenwich Quality Leaders 
      among institutional portfolio managers and Sanford C. Bernstein claims 
      that title alone among institutional analysts.

			&lt;p&gt;Cloud Service Provider (CSP) Project Hosts Is on Track to Be the First Vendor to Deliver SaaS-Based FedRAMP Authorization for Microsoft PPM, CRM and SharePoint Solutions&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SUNNYVALE, CA--(Marketwired - Jun 17, 2014) - Project Hosts, the leading provider of Custom Cloud hosting for Microsoft PPM, SharePoint and CRM, announced today that it has achieved "readiness" status by the FedRAMP Joint Authorization Board to undergo the FedRAMP SaaS authorization process for its private cloud solutions for U.S. Government agencies.&#160;As a Cloud Service Provider (CSP), Project Hosts is on track to be the first vendor to deliver SaaS-level FedRAMP authorization for Microsoft Project Server, Dynamics CRM and SharePoint private clouds.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, Project Hosts delivers private cloud solutions for government agencies on a FedRAMP authorized Platform as a Service (PaaS).&#160;In this next phase of the FedRAMP process, Project Hosts will achieve an Authority To Operate (ATO) as a Cloud Service Provider (CSP) for Software as a Service (SaaS), making the company eligible to do business with any government agency seeking cloud hosting services for Microsoft Project and Portfolio Management (PPM), Customer Relationship Management (CRM) or SharePoint clouds.&#160;For FedRAMP approved vendors visit: http://cloud.cio.gov/fedramp/in-process
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By becoming FedRAMP authorized at the SaaS level for Microsoft PPM, CRM and SharePoint, we are removing a huge IT burden and expense for any government agency that elects to host these solutions on a FedRAMP PaaS authorized environment," said Scott Chapman, CEO and Co-Founder of Project Hosts, Inc. "A FedRAMP SaaS-level authorization means that we have already implemented the hundreds of additional security controls required for a government cloud, thus relieving them from having to do so."&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FedRAMP is a U.S. government-wide program that provides a standardized approach to security assessment, authorization and continuous monitoring for cloud products and services. The program was developed to significantly reduce the effort and expense that would be incurred by government agencies to achieve high-level standards for securing government data. Designed as an "approve once, deploy many" program, authorized Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) would attain a provisional Authority To Operate (ATO) and provide cloud services for many agencies.&#160;Government agencies can then select an authorized CSP in an effort to save taxpayer expense on government IT infrastructure and cloud applications.&#160;The JAB is the primary governance group of the FedRAMP program, consisting of the chief information officers of the Department of Defense, the Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. General Services Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FedRAMP program supports the U.S. government's "Cloud-First" initiative to enable U.S. federal agencies to use managed service providers that enable cloud computing capabilities. The FedRAMP program is designed to comply with the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA).&#160;Government agencies will be required to use FedRAMP authorized cloud services beginning this (2014) year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About Project Hosts: Project Hosts, Inc. is the worldwide leader in Custom Cloud hosting of Microsoft Project and Portfolio Management (PPM), CRM and SharePoint SaaS solutions.&#160;Government Agencies, leading enterprises and medium-sized businesses rely on Project Hosts to deliver all of the benefits of a private cloud, such as a dedicated solution architecture, advanced application integration, customized security, and real-time business intelligence reporting, but without all the costs and complexities.&#160;Many of our customers report their solutions and users are up and running in one-half (1/2) the time, and at one-half (1/2) the cost as compared to similarly configured on premise environment or self-managed cloud.&#160;www.projecthosts.com -- info@projecthosts.com&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Announces Submission of Biologics License Application to the 
      FDA for Investigational Meningococcal B Vaccine
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that it has submitted a Biologics 
      License Application (BLA) to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
      for bivalent recombinant LP2086 (rLP2086), the company&#8217;s vaccine 
      candidate for the prevention of invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria 
      meningitidis serogroup B in 10 to 25 year olds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each year, approximately 500,000 cases of meningococcal disease occur 
      worldwide due to N. meningitidis.1 The majority of 
      invasive meningococcal disease cases worldwide can be attributed to five N. 
      meningitidis serogroups (A, B, C, W-135 and Y).2 Disease 
      caused by N. meningitidis serogroup B has been estimated at 
      between 20,000 and 80,000 cases per year globally.3 In 2012, 
      approximately 40 percent of cases in the U.S. were due to meningococcal 
      disease caused by serogroup B.4 Despite the availability of 
      antibiotic treatment, between 10 and 15 percent of patients with 
      meningococcal disease die and 11 to 19 percent of those who survive are 
      afflicted with long-term disabilities, such as brain damage, hearing 
      loss, learning disabilities or limb amputations.5 There is 
      currently no meningococcal B vaccine approved for use in the United 
      States.2,6
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The BLA submission for bivalent rLP2086 marks an important step toward 
      our goal of helping to protect adolescents and young adults against this 
      difficult to diagnose and often deadly disease,&#8221; said Dr. Emilio Emini, 
      senior vice president of Vaccine Research and Development for Pfizer 
      Inc. &#8220;There is an urgent public health need to help prevent 
      meningococcal B disease through vaccination, and we will continue to 
      work closely with the FDA in our efforts to advance our vaccine 
      candidate.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The FDA has a 60-day filing review period to determine whether the BLA 
      is complete and acceptable for filing. Pfizer will communicate the 
      agency&#8217;s decision.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About rLP2086
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer&#8217;s investigational meningococcal B vaccine targets LP2086, or 
      factor H binding protein, which is found on the surface of the 
      meningococcal B bacterium.7 The gene for factor H binding 
      protein is present in more than 1,800 meningococcal B isolates studied 
      by Pfizer researchers.7,8 The vaccine contains two 
      recombinant versions of the LP2086 antigen, one representative for each 
      of the two known genetic subfamilies of the antigen.9
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer is conducting a global clinical development program for bivalent 
      rLP2086, which includes both Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials evaluating more 
      than 20,000 participants, approximately 14,000 of whom will receive the 
      investigational vaccine.10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17 The Phase 3 
      program began in November 2012 with the initiation of a large scale 
      safety study. Additional immunogenicity and safety studies are also 
      ongoing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The FDA granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for bivalent rLP2086 in 
      March 2014 based, in part, on data from clinical trials studying the 
      safety and immunogenicity of bivalent rLP2086.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Clinical data from a Phase 2 study published in the Lancet Infectious 
      Diseases in 2012 showed the investigational bivalent rLP2086 vaccine 
      induced bactericidal antibodies in healthy adolescents aged 11 to 18 
      years that were broadly active against meningococcal B bacteria.18 
      Safety data from the study also showed the vaccine had an acceptable 
      safety profile in this healthy adolescent study population and supported 
      the further evaluation of the vaccine in Phase 3 studies.18
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, in two Phase 2 studies presented at the Annual Meeting of 
      the European Society for Paediatric Diseases (ESPID) in May 2014, 
      bivalent rLP2086 was found to elicit bactericidal responses against 
      diverse meningococcal serogroup B test strains.19,20
		&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL, June 17 (Reuters) - Samsung Everland Inc has chosen
Daewoo Securities, Citigroup, JPMorgan 
and Woori Investment &amp; Securities to advise on its
listing, two sources with knowledge of the matter on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of the four, Daewoo was chosen as lead advisor, one of the
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Everland, a key holding firm within the sprawling Samsung
Group that some analysts value at around 8 trillion won ($7.86
billion), said earlier this month it would likely complete its 
listing by the first quarter of 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sources, who had direct knowledge of the advisors'
presentation processes, were not authorized to speak to media
about the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's listing is seen as a cornerstone amid a flurry
of recent asset transfers between Samsung units that analysts
say are part of steps to hand over ownership of the group to the
son and daughters of 72-year-old Samsung Electronics 
Chairman Lee Kun-hee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Samsung Everland spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 1017.8000 South Korean won)

The industry's first 256GB USB form factor SSD drive, manufactured by PNY, addresses a rapidly developing need for trusted mobility solutions that transform almost any laptop or desktop into a trustworthy workspace. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the launch of this product, SPYRUS's high-capacity live drive provides contractors, remote workers, and telecommuters with a complete operating environment that includes extensive storage capacity for development tools and large datasets that create "personal cloud-like" data analytics. The new 256GB bootable drives retain all the capabilities of their respective 32GB, 64GB, and 128GB Windows To Go versions and feature superior security defense of the operating system, documents, and identity credentials from tampering and theft with layered hardware and software encryption depending on the particular model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"PNY is proud to partner with SPYRUS to manufacture this new high capacity Windows To Go drive. We believe that it meets the burgeoning market demand for secure higher capacity data storage" said Bob Stone, SVP of Operations for PNY. "Our extensive USA manufacturing and support facilities for flash-based products in Parsippany, New Jersey, can meet the global demand forecasted for bootable live drives and SSDs. SPYRUS customers can depend on our years of experience shipping millions of reliable devices to enterprises and consumers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Technical leadership, hardware security, optional onboard FIPS 140-2 Level 3 PKI capabilities, ultra-high performance, and the new features of Windows 8.1 make SPYRUS 256GB drives the choice for high-capacity Windows To Go platforms," said Tom Dickens, SPYRUS COO. "By utilizing the new high-capacity drives, corporations may finally realize significant cost savings by repurposing employee-owned or corporate legacy computers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WorkSafe and WorkSafe Pro live drives provide a made-in-USA, trusted Windows 8.1 end point for network access and simultaneously protect enterprise networks with multi-factor authentication using smart card digital certificates. These drives are an industry first in a family of live drives that embed FIPS 140-2 Level 3 hardware smart card chips to provide tamper-proof digital certificates for authentication and encryption. WorkSafe Pro adds AES-256 XTS hardware encryption for the highest assurance applications. Enterprises can leverage their investment in public key and smart card infrastructures, extending their trusted foundation for smart card login, VPN access, secure email, and authenticated online collaboration. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SPYRUS ToughBoot&#8482; loader, digitally signed by Microsoft, mitigates against hacking attacks during the boot sequence when using the UEFI Secure Boot available on newer computers. If any tampering or malfunction of hardware or firmware is detected, the boot process will not continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portable Workplace and Secure Portable Workplace offer Secured by SPYRUS&#8482; patented encryption technology in a USB 3.0 Windows To Go drive that runs a full version of Microsoft&#174; Windows 8 at SSD speeds. Secure Portable Workplace protects the operating system and user data with AES-256 XTS hardware encryption. Because of extensive built-in self-checks and proven military-grade encryption, Secure Portable Workplace can withstand the most sophisticated attempts to gain access to information on the device. SPYRUS patented technology enforces on-the-fly integrity validation to enable fast and secure boot-up and enhance the user experience without suffering the performance or vulnerability penalties incurred by other bootable products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secure Portable Workplace was designed to meet strong FIPS 140-2 Level 3 certification requirements and implements US Government-approved, next-generation cryptographic algorithms to protect the device, the data, and the operating system. "There is no other portable storage device booting Windows To Go on the market today with stronger security than what SPYRUS offers," adds Dickens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new 256GB high-capacity drives maintain compatibility with the optional SPYRUS Enterprise Management System (SEMS). Combining a Microsoft public key with a smart card-enabled ecosystem and SPYRUS security applications extends a true end-to-end security approach for enterprise smart card and PKI infrastructure to mobile users. With SEMS device management, enterprise administrators can centrally register, block/unblock, revoke, set policies, audit, and "kill" SPYRUS Windows To Go drives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Related Links

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today the publication of two-year 
      results from the ORAL Start study in the June 19 issue of The New 
      England Journal of Medicine. ORAL Start is a 24-month Phase 3 study 
      in patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid arthritis who 
      had not previously received methotrexate. The study showed that XELJANZ 
      (tofacitinib citrate) 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, as monotherapy (e.g., 
      taken without methotrexate), inhibited the progression of structural 
      damage and reduced the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and 
      was statistically significantly superior to methotrexate on these 
      measures at Month 6 (primary endpoint) and at all measured time points 
      up to 24 months. XELJANZ is not indicated in patients who had not 
      previously received methotrexate. The safety profile of XELJANZ in the 
      ORAL Start study was consistent with that seen previously in the 
      clinical development program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the United States, XELJANZ 5 mg tablets are indicated for the 
      treatment of adults with moderately to severely active rheumatoid 
      arthritis who have had an inadequate response or intolerance to 
      methotrexate. XELJANZ may be used alone or in combination with 
      methotrexate or other non-biologic, disease-modifying antirheumatic 
      drugs (DMARDs). Use of XELJANZ in combination with biologic DMARDs or 
      potent immunosuppressants, such as azathioprine and cyclosporine, is not 
      recommended. The recommended dose is a 5 mg pill taken twice daily.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This study showed that XELJANZ taken by itself was statistically 
      significantly superior to methotrexate in measures of clinical, 
      radiographic and functional efficacy rheumatoid arthritis outcomes, and 
      these results were sustained over two years,&#8221; said lead investigator Roy 
      M. Fleischmann, MD, professor, Metroplex Clinical Research Center, 
      Dallas, Texas. &#8220;These results also add to the information on the 
      efficacy and safety of XELJANZ as monotherapy.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ORAL Start study was a 24-month Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, 
      controlled trial in which 956 patients with moderately to severely 
      active rheumatoid arthritis who had not previously received methotrexate 
      were randomized to receive XELJANZ 5 mg or 10 mg twice daily or to 
      methotrexate dose-titrated over 8 weeks to 20 mg weekly. As previously 
      announced, both doses of XELJANZ met the study&#8217;s co-primary efficacy 
      endpoints: reduction of progression of radiographic measures of disease 
      as measured by average change from baseline in van der Heijde modified 
      Total Sharp Score (mTSS)[0.18 and 0.04 (both P0.001) for XELJANZ 5 mg 
      and 10 mg twice daily, respectively, versus 0.84 for methotrexate], and 
      clinical response as measured by ACR70 response rates, a measure of at 
      least 70% reduction in signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis [25.5% 
      and 37.7% for XELJANZ 5 mg and 10 mg twice daily, respectively (both 
      P0.001), versus 12.0% for methotrexate], at Month 6. ORAL Start also 
      evaluated improvement in physical function as measured by mean change 
      from baseline in the Health Assessment Questionnaire Disability Index 
      (HAQ-DI)[-0.83 and -0.94 (both P0.001) for XELJANZ 5 mg and 10 mg 
      twice-daily, respectively, versus -0.58 for methotrexate], at Month 6. 
      These results were sustained at all measured time points up to 24 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The six- and 12-month radiographic data from this study were recently 
      added to the XELJANZ U.S. label (February, 2014) as part of an FDA 
      approved label update.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The publication of the ORAL Start data in The
			New England 
      Journal of Medicine marks the sixth Phase 3 study in the XELJANZ 
      clinical program to be published in a major medical journal,&#8221; said Dr. 
      Steven Romano, Global Medicines Development Lead for the Pfizer Global 
      Innovative Pharmaceutical business. &#8220;The publication of all of the 
      completed XELJANZ Phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis clinical studies in such 
      respected publications speaks to the significance and clinical relevance 
      of the data for XELJANZ.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The safety profile of XELJANZ in the ORAL Start study was consistent 
      with that seen previously in the clinical development program. The 
      incidence of adverse events, serious adverse events and discontinuations 
      due to adverse events were similar across groups. Most adverse events 
      were mild or moderate and the most frequently reported adverse events in 
      all groups were infections. Herpes zoster (shingles) occurred in 4.0% of 
      patients on XELJANZ and 1.1% of patients on methotrexate. Confirmed 
      malignancies developed in five patients treated with XELJANZ and one 
      patient treated with methotrexate. XELJANZ was associated with increases 
      in average serum creatinine and lipid levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			XELJANZ U.S. Label Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      XELJANZ is a prescription medicine called a Janus kinase (JAK) 
      inhibitor. XELJANZ is used to treat adults with moderately to severely 
      active rheumatoid arthritis in which methotrexate did not work well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in people with 
        Hepatitis B or C.
      
			
        XELJANZ is not for people with severe liver problems.
      
			
        It is not known if XELJANZ is safe and effective in children.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				XELJANZ can lower the ability of the immune system to fight 
        infections. Some people have serious infections while taking XELJANZ, 
        including tuberculosis (TB), and infections caused by bacteria, fungi, 
        or viruses that can spread throughout the body. Some people have died 
        from these infections. Healthcare providers should test patients for 
        TB before starting XELJANZ, and monitor them closely for signs and 
        symptoms of TB and other infections during treatment. People should 
        not start taking XELJANZ if they have any kind of infection unless 
        their healthcare provider tells them it is okay.
			
			
				XELJANZ may increase the risk of certain cancers by changing the 
        way the immune system works. Malignancies were observed in clinical 
        studies of XELJANZ.
			
			
        The risks and benefits of treatment should be considered prior to 
        initiating XELJANZ in patients with chronic or recurrent infection; 
        who have been exposed to tuberculosis; with a history of a serious or 
        an opportunistic infection; who have resided or traveled in areas of 
        endemic tuberculosis or endemic mycoses; or with underlying conditions 
        that may predispose them to infection.
      
			
        Viral reactivation, including cases of herpes virus reactivation 
        (e.g., herpes zoster), was observed in clinical studies with XELJANZ.
      
			
        Use of live vaccines should be avoided concurrently with XELJANZ. 
        Update immunizations in agreement with current immunization guidelines 
        prior to initiating XELJANZ therapy.
      
			
        Some people who have taken XELJANZ with certain other medicines to 
        prevent kidney transplant rejection have had a problem with certain 
        white blood cells growing out of control (Epstein Barr 
        virus-associated post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder).
      
			
        Some people taking XELJANZ get tears in their stomach or intestines. 
        This happens most often in people who also take nonsteroidal 
        anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), corticosteroids, or methotrexate. 
        Patients should tell their healthcare provider right away if they have 
        fever and stomach-area pain that does not go away, or a change in 
        bowel habits. XELJANZ should be used with caution in patients who may 
        be at increased risk for gastrointestinal perforation (e.g., patients 
        with a history of diverticulitis).
      
			
        XELJANZ can cause changes in certain lab test results including low 
        blood cell counts, increases in certain liver tests, and increases in 
        cholesterol levels. Healthcare providers should do blood tests before 
        starting patients on XELJANZ and while they are taking XELJANZ, to 
        check for these side effects. Normal cholesterol levels are important 
        to good heart health. Healthcare providers may stop XELJANZ treatment 
        because of changes in blood cell counts or liver test results.
      
			
        Use of XELJANZ in patients with severe hepatic impairment is not 
        recommended.
      
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to become 
        pregnant or are pregnant.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is not known if XELJANZ will harm an unborn baby. To monitor the 
      outcomes of pregnant women exposed to XELJANZ, a registry has been 
      established. Physicians are encouraged to register patients and pregnant 
      women are encouraged to register themselves by calling 1-877-311-8972.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Patients should tell their healthcare providers if they plan to 
        breastfeed or are breastfeeding. Patients and their healthcare 
        provider should decide if they will take XELJANZ or breastfeed. They 
        should not do both.
      
			
        In carriers of the hepatitis B or C virus (viruses that affect the 
        liver), the virus may become active while using XELJANZ. Healthcare 
        providers may do blood tests before and during treatment with XELJANZ.
      
			
        Common side effects include upper respiratory tract infections (common 
        cold, sinus infections), headache, diarrhea, and nasal congestion, 
        sore throat, and runny nose (nasopharyngitis).

			About Rheumatoid Arthritis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic, inflammatory autoimmune disease 
      that typically affects the hands and feet, although any joint lined by 
      the synovial membrane can be affected.1 RA causes a range of 
      symptoms, including stiffness and swelling in the joints,2 
      particularly those in the hands, feet and knees.1 Although 
      the exact cause of RA is unknown,1 it is considered to be an 
      autoimmune disease, because the immune system in people with RA mistakes 
      the body&#8217;s healthy tissues for a threat and attacks them.1 Some 
      people are at increased risk of developing RA, including people with a 
      family history of RA, smokers and women.3 Three times as many 
      women are affected by RA compared to men.2 RA affects 
      approximately 23.7 million people4 worldwide and 1.6 million 
      people in the United States.5,6 It can develop at any time 
      during adulthood, but it usually occurs between 40 and 70 years of age.2

			Melissa Bean Named Chair of Midwest for JPMorgan Chase
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) announced today that it has appointed former 
      U.S. Rep. Melissa Bean as Chair of its Midwest business. In this role, 
      Bean will be the firm&#8217;s Senior Executive across its businesses and 
      functions in the region &#8211; focusing on building and strengthening the 
      firm&#8217;s business and brand in the Midwest United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Most recently, Bean was President and CEO of the Executives Club of 
      Chicago, a 100-year-old business forum of CEOs and senior executives of 
      local companies. Previously, she served three terms as a Member of the 
      U.S. House of Representatives from the 8th District of 
      Illinois and was a leader on the House Financial Services and Small 
      Business Committees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said: &#8220;Melissa is a 
      proven business and civic leader with deep roots in the Midwest, which 
      makes her exceptionally well-suited to help us continue to serve 
      customers, businesses and communities in this very important region.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Doug Petno, CEO of the company&#8217;s Commercial Banking business, added, 
      &#8220;We&#8217;ve been serving the Midwest region for more than 150 years and we 
      are fortunate to have a leader join us with strong ties to the local 
      business community, government officials and residents. Melissa&#8217;s 
      perseverance, hard work and integrity will be a perfect complement to 
      our executives and bankers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among her other responsibilities, Bean will help recruit top talent in 
      the region, oversee the firm&#8217;s charitable contribution budget, 
      coordinate public affairs initiatives, maintain strategic partnerships, 
      and continue important relationships with regional elected officials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Before Congress, Bean managed and consulted high tech organizations for 
      more than 20 years. In 1995, she founded SRI, which specialized in sales 
      channel optimization to Fortune 1000 high tech clients. Prior to that, 
      she managed sales organizations at Dataflex, SynOptics, Motorola/UDS, 
      and Arrow Electronics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bean is a member of The Chicago Network, The Chicago Club, and The 
      University Club of Chicago, and is Vice Chair of the Board for One 
      Million Degrees (formerly the Illinois Education Foundation). She 
      regularly keynotes at business and academic conferences and is on the 
      World Business Chicago Steering Committee for Economic Growth and Jobs, 
      started by Mayor Emanuel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      She received her Bachelor of Arts in Political Science and Doctor of 
      Humane Letters, Honoris Causa, from Roosevelt University.

&lt;p&gt;(Adds quote and context)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, June 18 (Reuters) - Russia moved to prevent the U.S.
payment card firms Mastercard and Visa quitting
Russia by pledging to reduce the size of the deposit required
for them to operate in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New rules imposed on foreign card companies following
Western sanctions over Ukraine required the payment operators to
deposit collateral with the central bank worth two days of their
average processing volume in Russia, in eight quarterly
instalments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both companies considered quitting Russia after President
Vladimir Putin signed the rules into law in early May, but said
they would stay after officials showed a willingness to relax
the requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the lower house of parliament, the State Duma,
began discussing amendments to soften the law. First Deputy
Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov said the deposit payment would be
"significantly reduced".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect that the actions we are taking will calm the
situation with Visa and Mastercard," he said. "We will do
everything to make sure they keep their activities here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analysts estimated in a report in May that
Visa and Mastercard would be required to post around $1.9
billion and $1 billion in total collateral, respectively, once
the rules take effect.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts noted that Russia accounts for less than 4
percent of both companies' respective global revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard both declined comment.

&lt;p&gt;CAIRO (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) expects to start production in five new factories in Egypt and Pakistan over the next 18 months, seeing double-digit percentage growth in sales for both markets this year, its Middle East and North Africa president told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. soft drinks maker's investment is a particular boost for Egypt, which is desperate to attract foreign direct investment after three years of political and economic turmoil that has seen its foreign currency reserves shrink and budget deficit swell to around 14 percent of GDP last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Egypt is going to be one of our key anchor countries," Curt Ferguson said on Wednesday, citing the country's large and growing population as a big positive. "For sure the other key anchor will be Pakistan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of a $500 million investment plan announced for Egypt in March, Coca-Cola will start constructing a new juice plant in 6th of October city near Cairo next year in a joint $100 million dollar project with Saudi Arabia's Aujan Coca-Cola Beverages Company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $500 million will be spent over the next three years, Ferguson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The beverage group is in talks to buy a plot of land between Cairo and Alexandria to build a plant for sparkling drinks and water which should go online next year, Ferguson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rest of the $500 million will be used to increase production at existing plants such as its concentrate factory in Cairo, the only one of its kind in the Middle East, and to cover capital spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Egypt, the company wants to redevelop production lines and keep distributing tens of thousands of Coca-Cola branded fridges to small supermarkets every year. Just to keep its business ticking over, Coca-Cola needs to spend more than $75 million a year in the country on such costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Cairo concentrate plant exports more than 30 percent of its produce and Coca-Cola wants to double exports from this facility within about three years, Ferguson said, sipping a can of coke light in the regional headquarters in Cairo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked about recent tax increases in Egypt, Ferguson said Coca-Cola could live with the tax rates and understood Egypt's need to increase its revenues, but added lower taxes and clear, well-organized economic reforms would help investors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Business needs certainty," he said, listing recent presidential elections as helping stability in the country. "The clearer, the easier, the lower the tax rate, you're going to attract the most investment. It's that easy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXPANSION BEYOND EGYPT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surpassing Egypt for its sales growth, Pakistan will see three new plants open in the next 18 months in Karachi, Multan and Islamabad to serve the domestic market with sparkling drinks such as Coke, Fanta and Sprite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We watch the needle in Pakistan and almost every month we red-line on what our capacity is," Ferguson said, adding he expected sales growth of around 20 percent in Pakistan this year. "We're just scratching the surface there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola has also purchased land in the Palestinian Gaza Strip for a bottling factory for which it has already paid $20 million and which should go online in the first quarter of 2015, Ferguson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company hopes U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry might open the Gaza plant, Ferguson said, adding the group had received all necessary permits from Israel, which has imposed a blockade on the Gaza Strip. Kerry has not visited the Gaza Strip since becoming Secretary of State.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further expanding into the region, Coca-Cola has started building its first factory in Qatar for $40 million, to be finished before an expected surge in demand for the 2022 soccer World Cup in the desert country. "It's us and nine stadiums," Ferguson joked of the construction. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Mark Potter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch was named top pan-European equity brokerage for a second straight year at the annual Thomson Reuters Extel Awards on Tuesday, while JPMorgan Asset Management won best fund manager for the fifth year in a row.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The awards, which were handed out in a ceremony at London's Guild Hall, are significant badges of honour in the industry as they are based on the votes of thousands of industry insiders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Strong votes can secure bragging rights for winning firms and, for highly rated individuals, can result in lucrative job offers and pay rises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a repeat of 2013's results, Bank of America Merrill Lynch scooped the prize for leading pan-European brokerage in equity and equity-linked research, ahead of 12-time winner UBS. Morgan Stanley remained in third place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management was joined in the top three in the best fund manager category by Wellington Management and Fidelity Worldwide Investment, which last year placed fifth and fourth respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among individual prize winners was Andrew Wood of Sanford C. Bernstein, who for the eighth consecutive year took home the trophy for leading pan-European equity analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Asset Management's Peter Lawrence reclaimed the title of top fund management individual from Philip Guest of UBS Global Asset Management, who came second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Niels Pecriaux, of GLG Partners, climbed nine places to finish third in that category.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GLG Partners was for the second straight year named top hedge fund, with Tudor Capital in second. Moore Capital Management jumped from sixth to third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The awards also cover companies' investor relations teams. Germany's Deutsche Telekom took the top spot, followed by Swiss drugmaker Roche and French media and telecoms group Vivendi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Extel awards are based on a survey conducted by Thomson Reuters between the end of March and early May. This year attracted a record level of participation, with more than 16,000 individuals from around 6,300 brokerages, fund managers, research houses and major European companies taking part.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WeConvene, a web-based platform that allows the investment community access to companies, said on Monday it had agreed to acquire Extel from Thomson Reuters in a deal expected to close by the end of June. No financial details were disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story has been refiled to correct in paragraph eight to show Pecriaux works for GLG Partners, not HSBC)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer, which failed last month in a $118 billion bid to buy AstraZeneca, said on Wednesday it had signed a deal with French biotech Cellectis to develop immunotherapy drugs in cancer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The news sent shares in Cellectis surging 50 percent higher, valuing the company, which was founded in 1999, at around 195 million euros ($264 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boosting the body's immune system to fight tumours is a hot area for drug research and was one of the factors that attracted Pfizer to Britain's AstraZeneca - along with the potential to cut costs and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology used by Cellectis involves reprogramming immune system cells to hunt out cancer and represents a different approach to that used by drugs under development at AstraZeneca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French company's research is still at an early stage but it hopes to start clinical trials in 2015, initially with a drug for leukaemia that it has already partnered with unlisted pharmaceuticals group Servier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new deal, Cellectis will receive an upfront payment from Pfizer of $80 million, as well as funding for research costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French biotech firm will also be eligible to get development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $185 million per Pfizer product, plus tiered royalties on any eventual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has exclusive rights to develop products against 15 biological targets for fighting cancer it selects, while another 12 targets can be selected by Cellectis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Pfizer will buy a stake of about 10 percent in Cellectis through newly issued shares at 9.25 euros each. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellectis is developing Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell, or CAR-T, immunotherapies using engineered cells from a single donor for use in multiple patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This so-called allogeneic approach is in contrast to other autologous technologies that rely on engineering a patient's own T-cells and the aim is to make it possible to treat cancer using a standardised, off-the-shelf therapeutic product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's research head Mikael Dolsten said he believed that combining the French group's skills with Pfizer's experience in developing cancer drugs would create "a world-class partnership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellectis said it expected to open a site in the United States to work more closely with scientists at Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis currently leads the field in CAR-T drug development, with autologous products in clinical trials for leukaemia, lymphoma, mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swiss drugmaker highlighted the potential of such treatments in fighting tumours both in the blood and solid organs in a presentation to investors on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Pravin Char and Jane Merriman)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds details on rival Novartis research, more on technology,
Cellectis valuation)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Ben Hirschler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 18 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer, which
failed last month in a $118 billion bid to buy AstraZeneca
, said on Wednesday it had signed a deal with French
biotech Cellectis to develop immunotherapy drugs in
cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news sent shares in Cellectis surging 50 percent higher,
valuing the company, which was founded in 1999, at around 195
million euros ($264 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boosting the body's immune system to fight tumours is a hot
area for drug research and was one of the factors that attracted
Pfizer to Britain's AstraZeneca - along with the potential to
cut costs and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology used by Cellectis involves reprogramming
immune system cells to hunt out cancer and represents a
different approach to that used by drugs under development at
AstraZeneca.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French company's research is still at an early stage but
it hopes to start clinical trials in 2015, initially with a drug
for leukaemia that it has already partnered with unlisted
pharmaceuticals group Servier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new deal, Cellectis will receive an upfront
payment from Pfizer of $80 million, as well as funding for
research costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French biotech firm will also be eligible to get
development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up
to $185 million per Pfizer product, plus tiered royalties on any
eventual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has exclusive rights to develop products against 15
biological targets for fighting cancer it selects, while another
12 targets can be selected by Cellectis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Pfizer will buy a stake of about 10 percent in
Cellectis through newly issued shares at 9.25 euros each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellectis is developing Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell, or
CAR-T, immunotherapies using engineered cells from a single
donor for use in multiple patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This so-called allogeneic approach is in contrast to other
autologous technologies that rely on engineering a patient's own
T-cells and the aim is to make it possible to treat cancer using
a standardised, off-the-shelf therapeutic product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's research head Mikael Dolsten said he believed that
combining the French group's skills with Pfizer's experience in
developing cancer drugs would create "a world-class
partnership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellectis said it expected to open a site in the United
States to work more closely with scientists at Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Novartis currently leads the field in CAR-T drug
development, with autologous products in clinical trials for
leukaemia, lymphoma, mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Swiss drugmaker highlighted the potential of such
treatments in fighting tumours both in the blood and solid
organs in a presentation to investors on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.7383 Euros)

			Visa Everywhere Travel Report: International Travelers to Brazil 
      Spent $27M on Visa Accounts During Opening Weekend of 2014 FIFA World 
      Cup BrazilTM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Visa cardholders increase spending in Brazil by 73 percent year 
      over year; Visitors from the United States, the United Kingdom and 
      France Account for Greatest Economic Impact
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), the leader in global payments, today released the Visa
			Everywhere Travel Report for the 2014 FIFA World Cup Brazil, 
      which analyzes travel data and cross border spend on all Visa products, 
      including credit, debit and prepaid payment cards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the four-day opening period of the tournament (June 12 - June 15, 
      2014), Visa found that international visitors spent more than US$27M on 
      their Visa accounts. This represents a 73 percent increase over the same 
      four-day period in 2013, and 47 percent more when compared to the 
      opening four-day period of the Confederations Cup (June 15 &#8211;June, 18 
      2013), where travelers spent nearly US$18.5M.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visitors from the United States, followed by the United Kingdom, France, 
      and Mexico represented the largest overall tourist spend in Brazil 
      during the four-day period. On Saturday, June 14, 2014 alone 
      international travelers to Brazil spent more than US$10.7M using Visa 
      products. This was the highest tourist spend day in the country in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These numbers reflect the significant impact that mega sporting events 
      like the World Cup can have in boosting local commerce in host market 
      economies,&#8221; said Ruben Osta, Visa Inc. country manager, Brazil. &#8220;This 
      positive trend aligns with Brazil&#8217;s expectation that more than 600,000 
      international travelers may visit the country during this event -- 
      ultimately boosting the country&#8217;s economy.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Travelers from ten countries made up 65 percent of the total spend in 
      Brazil, with four countries -- Australia (+675%), Colombia (+418%), 
      Mexico (+204%) and United Kingdom (+101%) --showing triple-digit 
      increases compared to spend during the same four-day period in 2013.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co was again ranked the top investment bank by revenue in the first quarter with $5.9 billion, according to a new survey published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a repeat of the previous year's results, the U.S. bank came ahead of rivals Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Citi, which all tied for second place, according to industry analytics firm Coalition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley finished sixth, while Barclays and Credit Suisse came joint seventh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coalition, which only gives revenue figures for the top-ranked bank in categories including equities and advisory, said that JPMorgan's investment banking revenue in the first quarter fell by almost 15 percent from $6.9 billion in the same period last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most investment banks have seen trading revenues slump over the past year amid a low interest rate environment and tougher regulations requiring them to hold more capital, which have driven down returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number are reducing their operations and cutting jobs as a result. Barclays said last month 7,000 jobs are to go at its investment bank and the head of investment banking at JPMorgan, Daniel Pinto, recently told Reuters that the bank would be "laser-focused" on cost cutting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coalition said turnover at JPMorgan's fixed income, commodities and currencies (FICC) division was $3.2 billion in the January to March period, down by more than a quarter from the previous year. The figure was enough to keep it in the top spot in Coalition's league table in FICC, alongside Deutsche Bank and Citi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also came joint first for equities revenues with fellow U.S. bank Morgan Stanley, earning $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Bank of America Merrill Lynch came out on top in advisory.

&lt;p&gt;June 18 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer, which
failed last month in a $118 billion bid to buy AstraZeneca
, said on Wednesday it had signed a deal with French
biotech Cellectis to develop immunotherapy drugs in
cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boosting the body's immune system to fight tumours is a hot
area for drug research and was one of the factors that attracted
Pfizer to Britain's AstraZeneca - along with the potential to
cut costs and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new deal, Cellectis will receive an upfront
payment of $80 million, as well as funding for research costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The French biotech firm will also be eligible to get
development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up
to $185 million per Pfizer product, plus tiered royalties on any
eventual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has exclusive rights to develop products against 15
biological targets for fighting cancer it selects, while another
12 targets can be selected by Cellectis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Pfizer will buy a stake of about 10 percent in
Cellectis through newly issued shares at 9.25 euros each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cellectis is developing so-called Chimeric Antigen Receptor
T-cell, or CAR-T, immunotherapies using engineered cells from a
single donor for use in multiple patients.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Cellectis (Paris:ALCLS) today announced that 
      they have entered into a global strategic collaboration to develop 
      Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapies in the field of 
      oncology directed at select targets. Cellectis&#8217; CAR-T platform 
      technology provides a proprietary, allogeneic approach (utilizing 
      engineered T-cells from a single donor for use in multiple patients) to 
      developing CAR-T therapies that is distinct from other autologous 
      approaches (engineering a patient&#8217;s own T-cells to target tumor cells).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer has exclusive rights to pursue 
      development and commercialization of CAR-T therapies, in the field of 
      oncology, directed at a total of fifteen targets selected by Pfizer. 
      Both companies will work together on preclinical research and Pfizer 
      will be responsible for the development and potential commercialization 
      of any CAR-T therapies for the Pfizer-selected targets. In addition, the 
      agreement provides for a total of twelve targets selected by Cellectis. 
      Both companies will work together on preclinical research on four 
      Cellectis-selected targets and Cellectis will work independently on 
      eight additional targets. Cellectis will be responsible for clinical 
      development and commercialization of CAR-T therapeutics for the 
      Cellectis-selected targets. Pfizer has right of first refusal to the 
      four Cellectis-selected targets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cellectis will receive an upfront payment of $80 million, as well as 
      funding for research and development costs associated with 
      Pfizer-selected targets and the four Cellectis-selected targets within 
      the collaboration. Cellectis is eligible to receive development, 
      regulatory and commercial milestone payments of up to $185 million per 
      Pfizer product. Cellectis is also eligible to receive tiered royalties 
      on net sales of any products that are commercialized by Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, Pfizer will be entering into an equity agreement to 
      purchase approximately 10% of the Cellectis capital through newly issued 
      shares at 9.25 Euro per share, pending Cellectis shareholder approval. 
      Approval by two-thirds of the votes cast by voting Cellectis 
      shareholders is required for the issuance. Shareholders of Cellectis 
      representing 52.8% of its voting rights have already undertaken to vote 
      in favor of the issuance.&#160;In the event the sale of equity is not 
      approved by the Cellectis shareholders, Pfizer has the option to 
      terminate the collaboration agreement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cellectis expects to open a site in the United States to work more 
      closely with scientists at Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We believe our CAR-T platform technology has the potential to offer a 
      real advantage over other approaches to T-cell receptor engineering and 
      this collaboration with Pfizer is an important step towards realizing 
      the full potential of this technology in harnessing the body&#8217;s own 
      immune system to fight cancer,&#8221; said Andre Choulika, PhD, Chairman and 
      Chief Executive Officer at Cellectis. &#8220;This alliance provides access to 
      Pfizer&#8217;s state-of-the-art therapeutic development capabilities and 
      provides a unique opportunity to advance this innovative work with the 
      goal of developing best-in-class CAR-T therapeutics. We look forward to 
      working closely with the team at Pfizer on researching and developing 
      novel CAR-T therapies that could potentially change the way cancer is 
      treated.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      immunotherapies is built upon Cellectis&#8217; advanced genome editing and 
      cell engineering capability and Pfizer&#8217;s cutting-edge biotherapeutic 
      cancer therapy platform," said Mikael Dolsten, MD, PhD, President of RD 
      at Pfizer. "Combining the innovation and scientific expertise of

			About CAR-Ts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Allogeneic CAR-Ts are &#8220;off-the-shelf&#8221; products which have the potential 
      to be industrialized and thereby standardized, with consistent 
      pharmaceutical release criteria, over time and from batch to batch. Each 
      potential future patient may thus be treated by immediately receiving a 
      single dose of a standard product with consistent quality. In addition, 
      it is expected that such allogeneic products may be shipped in advance 
      and would be accessible to any cancer center in the world without the 
      need to invest in a local CAR-T processing facility.

      Platform Technology to Develop Immunotherapies Against Select Targets in 
      the Field of Oncology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) and Cellectis (Paris:ALCLS) today announced that 
      they have entered into a global strategic collaboration to develop 
      Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell (CAR-T) immunotherapies in the field of 
      oncology directed at select targets. Cellectis&#8217; CAR-T platform 
      technology provides a proprietary, allogeneic approach (utilizing 
      engineered T-cells from a single donor for use in multiple patients) to 
      developing CAR-T therapies that is distinct from other autologous 
      approaches (engineering a patient&#8217;s own T-cells to target tumor cells).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer has exclusive rights to pursue 
      development and commercialization of CAR-T therapies, in the field of 
      oncology, directed at a total of fifteen targets selected by Pfizer. 
      Both companies will work together on preclinical research and Pfizer 
      will be responsible for the development and potential commercialization 
      of any CAR-T therapies for the Pfizer-selected targets. In addition, the 
      agreement provides for a total of twelve targets selected by Cellectis.

      Fitch Upgrades Six Classes of JPMCC 2004-C2
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has upgraded six classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp., commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates, series 2004-C2. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upgrades reflect an increase in credit enhancement from loan paydown 
      primarily from loan payoffs, as the transaction has paid down $690.3 
      million since Fitch's last rating action. Despite high credit 
      enhancement the upgrades were limited given interest shortfalls that had 
      previously reached class D before they were subsequently recovered, as 
      well as the high percentage of the pool in special servicing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 13.1% of the remaining pool; expected losses of 
      the original pool total 2.3%, including $12 million (1.1% of the 
      original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Of the original 134 
      loans, 19 remain; Fitch has designated 12 loans (45.1%) as Fitch Loans 
      of Concern, which includes eight specially serviced loans (42.3%). 
      Remaining loan maturities are concentrated in 2014 and 2019 comprising 
      of 46.7% and 34.9% of the pool balance, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the May 2014 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been reduced by 90.2% to $101.2 million from $1.03 billion 
      at issuance. Per the servicer reporting, one loan (1.9%) in the trust is 
      currently defeased. As of the May 2014 distribution date, interest 
      shortfalls were affecting classes H through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is the real estate owned 
      135,004 square foot retail center, Tower Plaza Retail Center (11.6% of 
      the pool balance), located in Temacula, CA. The property experienced 
      cash flow issues due to occupancy declines in 2009 when the grocery 
      anchor vacated the property. The asset was transferred to the special 
      servicer in February 2012 for payment default and the special servicer 
      completed the foreclosure process in March 2014. The property's 
      occupancy is currently 74% which is an improvement from the 2010 low of 
      57%. The special servicer is evaluating options before determining the 
      disposition strategy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to expected losses is collateralized by a 
      139,534 sf retail property located in Slidell, LA. The property is 
      shadowed anchored by Target and has experienced cash flow and occupancy 
      issues when the local economy struggled during the last recession. 
      Economic activity has subsequently stabilized and the property's 
      occupancy was 80% with a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 1.5x at 
      year end 2013. The property transferred to the special servicer in March 
      2014 when it was apparent that the loan would not pay off at its April 
      2014 maturity date. The special servicer notes indicate that a full 
      pay-off is expected.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to expected losses is the specially 
      serviced loan, Woodforest Square, a 44,399 sf retail center located in 
      Houston, TX. The property reported year end 2013 occupancy of 68% and 
      DSCR of 1.22x. The loan was transferred to the special servicer in 2012 
      after one of the loan guarantors filed for bankruptcy protection. The 
      sponsor issues are expected to prevent the loan from refinancing by the 
      July 2014 maturity date and the special servicer continues to evaluate 
      workout options.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings of classes C through E have Stable Outlooks due to high 
      credit enhancement. Classes D and E will remain at 'A' due to previously 
      incurred interest shortfalls in accordance to the May 28, 2014 Fitch 
      report 'Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in Global Structured 
      Finance Transactions'. Classes F through J also have Stable Outlooks; 
      despite the increasing credit enhancement, upgrades are not warranted 
      due to the high amount of specially serviced loans and increasing 
      overall concentrations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch upgrades the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$3.1 million class C to 'AAAsf' from 'AAsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$9.1 million class E to 'Asf' from 'BBBsf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11.6 million class F to 'BBBsf' from 'BBB-sf'; Outlook Stable from 
      Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$7.8 million class G to 'BBBsf' from 'BBsf'; Outlook Stable from 
      Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11.6 million class H to 'BBsf' from 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable from 
      Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.5 million class J to 'Bsf' from 'CCCsf'; assigned Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch also affirms the following classes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$24.6 million class D at 'Asf'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.2 million class K at 'CCCsf'; RE 100%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.6 million class L at 'CCsf'; RE 75%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$3.9 million class M at 'Csf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.6 million class N at 'Csf'; RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.6 million class P at 'Csf'; RE: 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The class A-1, A-2, A-3, A-1A, B, RP-1, RP-2, RP-3, RP-4, and the RP-5 
      certificates have paid in full. Fitch does not rate the class NR 
      certificate. Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only 
      class X certificate.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) new chief executive, Satya Nadella, likes to boast that Bing is growing and powers 30 percent of the Internet search market, making it a worthy competitor to Google Inc (GOOGL.O).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But within the advertising and research industries that measure and manage search as a business, Microsoft's strength  is an open question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figures quoted by Microsoft, which include searches by partner Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), are much higher than the rate at which people actually click on the links that a search returns, according to new studies by industry researchers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new search data calls into question Bing's effectiveness for advertisers. It also lends support to the argument from some investors that Microsoft should sell Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been in the Internet search business since 1998, and Bing - five years old this month - is its latest and most intense effort to unseat market leader Google. The company initially assumed that its world-class engineers and the sheer scale of its Windows user base would sweep away competitors, but Google has not relinquished any share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To measure its progress in the search business, Microsoft prefers to cite market share numbers from comScore, which established itself as the prime source for Internet data a decade ago, when reliable numbers were hard to come by, and has long been considered the gold standard. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ComScore said Google sites had 67.6 percent of U.S. searches in May, compared with Microsoft's 18.8 percent and Yahoo's 10 percent, which are both powered by Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ComScore bases its calculations on desktop computer Internet searches by about a million anonymous people in the United States. It does not measure searches on mobile phones or tablets, which are dominated by Google, but it does count searches within the big MSN and Yahoo portals, factors which help explain why Bing has such a significant share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLICKS COUNT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But advertisers are less interested in searches than what users do with search results. They want traffic to their sites; they care what search result links users click and what sites they visit. In recent years, technology has made that behavior much easier to track.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clicks are important because they tell us how well we are capturing (search users') demand, and of course advertisers pay based on clicks," said Jason Hartley, group media director at search marketing firm 360i, whose clients include brands such as  Coca-Cola and Verizon. ComScore data "can lead you down the wrong path, or it doesn't give you as much insight as you'd like," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A study published last month by Conductor, a company that advises marketers on how to stand out in Web searches and social media, showed Google accounted for 85 percent of traffic to websites from search engines, with only 5 percent from Bing and 7 percent from Yahoo. The study was based on 100 million visits to 63 websites from clicks on search links - not counting ads - including from mobile devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland-based StatCounter, which gets data from more than 3 million websites, found Google accounted for 80 percent of search engine-supplied U.S. traffic in the last three months, Bing 10 percent and Yahoo 8 percent. Search marketing firm Define Media Group came up with similar figures based on 1.4 billion visits from search engines so far this year to 125 websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advertisers make the same point with their spending: web marketing firm IgnitionOne estimates that Google gets about 77 percent of web search ad dollars against 23 percent for Yahoo/Bing. Design software maker Autodesk told Reuters that it generally splits search ad spending 80/20 in favor of Google with its "significantly larger pool of users". &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The does not mean comScore's data is faulty. Rather, many in the search industry say it doesn't measure what advertisers and website owners want to know, the web traffic generated by a search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their current methodology is likely to mislead those who take it at face value," said Rand Fishkin, a well-known pioneer in the search engine optimization field and co-founder of search advisory firm Moz. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ComScore stands by its figures. Vice President of Marketing Andrew Lipsman said the data is not designed to measure where Web traffic goes, only the searching behavior of consumers.

It added that it is committed to Bing, which is a core part of Microsoft's game console Xbox and its coming voice assistant on Windows phone. Bing also powers other companies' sites and devices, including Apple Inc's Siri and soon Apple(AAPL.O) desktop search. Bing is integrated into translation features on Facebook and Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft search advertising revenue rose 38 percent last quarter, helped by higher prices and more searches, it said in its last quarterly report, without disclosing dollar figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's online services unit, which includes Bing, lost more than $14 billion in Bing's first four years, including the cost of a failed acquisition. Last year, Microsoft put Bing in a new reporting group so its financial performance is obscured, but many on Wall Street assume Bing is still losing money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Craig Beilinson, director of consumer communications at Microsoft, said it "continues to gain traction" as a standalone search engine and powering other companies' products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Bing has grown, that improvement has come mostly at the expense of Yahoo, according to comScore figures.

than Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google loves the fact that anybody other than Google looks
like they are doing better," said Danny Sullivan, longtime

"It's a very handy tool for them to go out and say you don't
need to be regulating us, look, the market's strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Yahoo declined comment on the comScore data.

      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs, Series 3393Z Trust
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns the following ratings to the Puttable Tax-Exempt 
      Receipts (PUTTERs) and Derivative Inverse Tax-Exempt Receipts (DRIVERs) 
      of the J.P. Morgan PUTTERs/DRIVERs Trust series listed below:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --PUTTERs, Series 3393Z 'AA/F1', Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --DRIVERs, Series 3393Z 'AA', Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term 'AA', Stable Outlook ratings assigned to the series 3393Z 
      PUTTERs and series 3393Z DRIVERs are based on the ratings that Fitch has 
      assigned to the Board of Regents, Texas State University System revenue 
      financing system revenue bonds, series 2008 (rated 'AA', Stable Outlook) 
      that have been deposited in the series 3393Z trust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term 'F1' rating assigned to the series 3393Z PUTTERs is based 
      on the liquidity facility provided by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. (rated 
      'A+/F1', Stable Outlook). The 'F1' rating assigned to the PUTTERs will 
      expire on March 15, 2015, the expiration date of the liquidity facility, 
      unless such date is extended or earlier terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The short-term rating assigned to the PUTTERs reflects the short-term 
      rating that Fitch maintains on the bank providing liquidity support and 
      will be adjusted upward or downward in conjunction with the short-term 
      rating of the bank, and, in some cases, the long-term rating of the 
      underlying bonds deposited in the trust. The long-term ratings assigned 
      to the PUTTERs and DRIVERs are exclusively tied to the creditworthiness 
      of the underlying bonds deposited in the trust and will reflect all 
      changes to that rating.

			&lt;p&gt;VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA--(Marketwired - Jun 19, 2014) - 
			&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Editors Note: There is a photo accompanying this press release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;British Columbia, Canada is an example of what diverse peoples can achieve when they work together, joined together in a common purpose. BC Canada will celebrate the 150th anniversary of Confederation in 2017. British Columbians in Canada are also proud of their country and its achievements with other nations such as India. Together Canada has developed partnerships and friendships with India which emerged from the immigration and cultural exchange in areas of religion, economy, and immigration policy. Canada is a prosperous and safe country whose promise is limited only by imagination; a place where people from around the world live in harmony; a federation united at home and respected abroad. Indo-Canadians, one of the drivers of job creation and economic growth through their innovations, investments, skills, traditions and values is the result of this partnership. Together steering the economy of the province, the British Columbia Peoples Party is committed to delivering on the important issues that matters most to Indo-Canadians. This includes enhancing Canada's role as an ambassador to building safe and secure communities within the world stage, such as the Indo-Canadian partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was in Vancouver, B.C. where East Indians first arrived in the Koma Gata Maru Ship. At the time B.C. charged a head tax on the Chinese. Both the Provincial and Federal Governments have apologised for the "Dark History of 100 years". Now comes a new chapter in our history where Canadians must continue to forge new opportunities for our younger generation in order to build a fair society and a stronger economy at home and abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On behalf of the British Columbia Peoples Party and as Founder President, Vikram Bajwa, I invite you to Vancouver BC, Canada, to join us at the United Nations General Assembly, New York USA, on September 28th, 2014. I also formally request to eliminate the visa restrictions for Indo-Canadian Sikhs - 187 Indo-Canadian Sikhs, the majority of them residing in our province of British Columbia, Canada, whose grand fathers and mothers were freedom activists and torch bearers for the Freedom Movement of India. These pioneers are well documented in Home Minister of India records, helping to usher in a new era of goodwill and friendship, between India and British Columbia, Canada."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BCPP will advocate to the Prime Minister of India urging him to grant India's non-resident community, residing in Canada, blanket clearance, so that they can go to India and visit their family, such as aging parents and relatives as well as visiting holy site such as the Golden temple Amritsar, Haridawar and Varanasi. "Your wise decision will go a long ways with reciprocation from the second generation of Indo-Canadians in British Columbia" said Sukhdev Dhillon, member BCPP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BCPP strongly feels that the leadership by the Prime Minister of India can improve issues of brain drain of skill, partnerships in energy and resources in India with Indo-Canadians living in British Columbia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About BCPP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British Columbia Peoples Party exists to build and safeguard a fair, free and open society, in which we seek to balance the fundamental values of liberty, equality, community and multiculture, and in which no one shall be enslaved by race, poverty, ignorance or conformity, granted in British Columbia, under the Canadian Charter. The primary purpose of BCPP (Party) is to field candidates for elections to the British Columbia Legislative Assembly and play an important role, for your voice to be heard in Victoria B.C., to formulate changes to make British Columbia a better place on Earth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We champion the freedom, dignity and well-being of individuals, we acknowledge and respect their right to freedom of conscience and their right to develop their talents to the fullest. We aim to disperse power, to foster diversity and to nurture creativity. We believe that the role of the province is to enable all citizens to attain these ideals, to contribute fully to their communities and to take part in the decisions which affect their lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We look forward to hearing and servicing the citizens of British Columbia! We strive to enable everyone with the same basic rights, so that they can live together in peace and develop their full potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To view the photo accompanying this press release, please visit the following link:

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - General Electric (GE.N) outlined an updated offer to buy French engineering group Alstom's (ALSO.PA) power and grid businesses on Thursday that will include two 50:50 joint ventures in grid and renewables, and a global nuclear and steam alliance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;GE said its valuation for Alstom remains unchanged and that the deal would immediately boost the U.S. company's earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The alliance will retain and strengthen France's presence in the energy business and reinforce Alstom Transport. It creates jobs, establishes headquarters decision-making in France and ensures that the Alstom name will endure," GE Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE added that the 50:50 nuclear alliance would see the government holding a preferred share giving it veto and other governance rights over issues related to security and technology of nuclear plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by James Regan; Editing by Mark John)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;June 19 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on
Thursday it has started construction on a new chemical plant in
Baytown, Texas, and begun expanding a nearby plant, part of a
plan to use shale-derived natural gas to make plastics and other
material.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Baytown plant, known within the industry as a cracker,
will be able to produce 1.5 million tonnes of ethylene per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the largest U.S. producer of natural gas, is
simultaneously expanding a Mont Belvieu plant to be able to
process the ethylene into polyethylene. Polyethylene, a basic
plastic, is used to make bags, bottles and other common consumer
goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company spokeswoman declined to provide the precise cost
of the multi-billion dollar project, describing it as
proprietary information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon estimates the Houston-area projects will require about
10,000 workers to construct and create 4,000 jobs in the local
economy. About 350 permanent jobs will be created at the plant,
Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas production in the United States has spiked in
the past five years thanks to the development of shale
formations in Texas, Pennsylvania and other states. Exxon and
other major chemical producers, including Dow Chemical Co
, have responded to the trend by announcing plans to
build massive new chemical plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's plant, one of the first to break ground, is expected
to be online by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bechtel, Linde, Mitsui Engineering &amp; Shipbuilding
 and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries have been
awarded contracts for various phases of the projects.

			Global Solar Installations Leader CBD Energy Validates Goldman 
      Estimates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CBD Energy Limited (NASDAQ: CBDE) validates the assertions of Goldman 
      Sachs&#8217; analyst Brian Lee that the U.S. residential solar sector will see 
      dramatic growth over the next two years, as reported in the financial 
      press on June 17. CBD Energy Limited is a diversified clean energy 
      company and leading provider of residential and commercial/utility-scale 
      solar installations worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;During the several weeks leading up to our recent equity offering and 
      uplisting to NASDAQ on June 13, 2014, our management team has been 
      intensively meeting with institutional investors and thought leaders in 
      the solar industry. We found optimism about the prospects for 
      residential solar adoption in the U.S. to be high and Mr. Lee&#8217;s 
      estimates for the growth in U.S. solar installations consistent with the 
      views other industry followers shared with us,&#8221; said CBD Managing 
      Director Gerry McGowan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In articles about the Goldman research, estimates of compound annual 
      growth for U.S. rooftop solar installation volume through 2016 were 
      reported to top 40%. Mr. Lee was quoted as stating that the U.S. 
      residential solar is &#8220;one of the more compelling growth verticals 
      globally in the solar sector&#8221; and that it is in the midst of &#8220;a 
      transformative shift that is both early and potentially highly 
      value-accretive for companies involved in the downstream segment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In light of Mr. Lee&#8217;s robust forecast for growth in solar in the U.S. 
      residential and commercial markets, CBD has clearly entered the U.S. 
      market at an auspicious time. Having successfully completed more than 
      17,000 residential installations in Australia, CBD recently began 
      exclusively offering residential solar installations in the U.S. under 
      the widely recognized Westinghouse&#174; Solar brand. Our systems include a 
      20-year warranty and are offered with innovative financing to deliver 
      exceptional value and security to our customers over the long term,&#8221; Mr. 
      McGowan concluded.

&lt;p&gt;A New York state judge on Friday significantly narrowed the evidence the Manhattan district attorney can use in its case against a former Goldman Sachs computer programmer accused of stealing secret code from the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 20 (Reuters) - A New York state judge on
Friday significantly narrowed the evidence the Manhattan
district attorney can use in its case against a former Goldman
Sachs computer programmer accused of stealing secret code from
the bank.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;State Supreme Court Justice Ronald Zweibel, in Manhattan, 
held that prosecutors cannot use as evidence a laptop and other
physical evidence the FBI had obtained in an earlier federal
action against the former programmer, Sergey Aleynikov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zweibel also held that the district attorney's office cannot
introduce statements that Aleynikov made before he was read his
Miranda rights when the FBI arrested him in 2009, as there was
no probable cause for the arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no doubt that these statements must also be
suppressed as the fruit of the poisonous tree as a result of
defendant's illegal arrest," Zweibel wrote in a 71-page ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was initially charged by federal prosecutors, who
accused him of stealing trading code from Goldman Sachs Group
Inc in 2009 as he prepared to join a high-frequency
trading startup firm in Chicago. He was found guilty in 2010,
but a federal appeals court in New York later overturned the
verdict, saying that federal corporate espionage laws did not
cover Aleynikov's alleged illegal activity. Aleynikov was
released after spending nearly a year in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August 2012, Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. 
charged Aleynikov with two felonies under New York state law:
unlawful use of secret scientific material and unlawful
duplication of computer related material.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The evidence included the laptop, a flash drive and
computers the FBI seized in its search of Aleynikov and his
home, which they later gave to Vance's office after Aleynikov's
federal conviction was overturned. Zweibel said that it was
"improper" of the FBI to give the evidence to the district
attorney's office even after Aleynikov requested that the
property be returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This constituted an unauthorized seizure and retention of
defendant's property that was unreasonable under the
circumstances," Zweibel wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zweibel denied Aleynikov's motion to suppress statements he
made to the FBI after he was read his Miranda rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Aleynikov's lawyer, Kevin Marino, said
Zweibel's decision gutted the district attorney's case and was
"another important step on Sergey Aleynikov's long journey to
complete vindication."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan district attorney's office declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Zweibel denied Aleynikov's motion to dismiss the
case, saying Aleynikov did not show that the charges brought by
Vance amounted to double jeopardy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was featured in author Michael Lewis's book "Flash
Boys" earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is People v. Aleynikov, New York State Supreme
Court for New York County, No. 04447/2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bernard Vaughan; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Borrower Concentration Risk: Approximately 12% of the pool consists of 
      borrowers with more than one mortgage loan, half of which have more than 
      two mortgage loans in the subject pool. The two highest borrower 
      exposures have 10 and 11 loans in the pool and account for 1% and 1.7%, 
      respectively. Due to the considerable borrower exposure, additional 
      deterministic tests were performed and are reflected in Fitch's expected 
      loss levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Exclusive 15-Year Mortgages: The collateral pool consists of 15-year 
      fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) to borrowers with very strong credit 
      profiles, low leverage and substantial liquid reserves. Third-party 
      loan-level due diligence was performed on 100% of the pool, and Fitch 
      believes the results of the review generally indicate strong 
      underwriting controls. Fitch's probability of default (PD) for 15-year 
      FRMs is lower than that for loans with 30-year terms to reflect the 
      positive selection associated with borrowers who select the higher 
      payment, which results in faster amortization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High Geographic Concentration: The pool's primary concentration risk is 
      California, where 49% of the properties are located. In addition, 57% of 
      the properties are located in the pool's top five metropolitan 
      statistical areas (MSA) in California, New York and Illinois. The pool 
      has significant regional concentrations, which resulted in an additional 
      penalty of approximately 16% to the pool's lifetime default expectation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Extraordinary Expense Adjustment: Extraordinary expenses will be taken 
      out of available funds but not accounted for in the contractual interest 
      owed to the bondholders. This construct can result in principal and 
      interest shortfalls to the bonds starting from the bottom of the capital 
      structure. To account for this risk, Fitch adjusted the credit 
      enhancement (CE) upward by 25 bps for the class A bonds, 20 bps for 
      classes B-1 and B2 and 10 bps for classes B-3 and B-4.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nonfull Representation and Warranty Framework: While the transaction 
      benefits from JPMCB (rated 'A+'/'F1' with a Stable Outlook by Fitch) and 
      FRB (rated 'A-'/'F1'; Stable Outlook) as representation and warranty 
      (rep and warranty) providers for approximately 93% of the pool, Fitch 
      believes the value of the rep and warranty framework is diluted by the 
      presence of qualifying and conditional language in conjunction with 
      sunset provisions, which reduces lender breach liability. While the 
      agency believes the high credit quality pool and clean diligence results 
      mitigate these risks, Fitch considered the weaker framework in its 
      analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Market Value Decline Sensitivity: Fitch considered further market value 
      decline (MVD) sensitivities, in addition to those generated by its 
      sustainable home price (SHP) model. These scenarios aligned Fitch's 
      'Asf' sustainable MVD (sMVD) assumptions with peak-to-trough MVDs 
      experienced during the housing crisis through 2009. The sensitivity 
      analysis, which was factored into Fitch's loss expectations, resulted in 
      applying an sMVD of 16% from 19%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After Fitch determines credit ratings through a rating stress scenario 
      analysis, additional sensitivity analyses are considered. The analyses 
      provide a defined stress sensitivity to demonstrate how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs than that assumed at issuance as well as a 
      defined sensitivity that demonstrates the stress assumptions required to 
      reduce a rating by one full category, to non-investment grade, and to 
      CCCsf'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In its analysis, Fitch considered additional sMVD stress assumptions to 
      those generated by the SHP model. These supplementary scenarios 
      reflected base case sMVDs that aligned Fitch's 'Asf' sMVD stress 
      assumptions with peak-to-trough MVDs experienced in the U.S. during the 
      recent financial crisis (2007 - 2009). This is consistent with Fitch's 
      view as described in its U.S. RMBS Loan Loss Model Criteria (dated 
      December 2013, available on its website at www.fitchratings.com) 
      which associates the recent national housing recession and related 
      performance observations with an 'Asf' stress. The result of this 
      sensitivity analysis was included in the consideration of the loss 
      expectations for this transaction. The sensitivity analysis resulted in 
      a base sMVD of 16.1%, compared with the model projected 18.9%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes 
      MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in addition to the model projected 18.9% for 
      this pool. The analysis indicates there is some potential rating 
      migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model projection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch also conducted defined rating sensitivities, which determine the 
      stresses to MVDs that would reduce a rating by one full category, to 
      non-investment grade, and to 'CCCsf'. For example, additional MVDs of 
      5%, 23% and 42% would potentially reduce the 'AAAsf' rated class down 
      one rating category, to non-investment grade, and to 'CCCsf', 
      respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's stress and rating sensitivity analysis are discussed in the 
      presale report titled ' J.P. Morgan Mortgage Trust 2014-2', dated June 
      2014, which is available on Fitch's web site, www.fitchratings.com.

      Trust 2014-2 (JPMMT 2014-2), a jumbo prime RMBS transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mortgage pool backing JPMMT 2014-2 is comprised of 544 first-lien 
      mortgage loans with an aggregate principal balance of $303,748,213 as of 
      the cut-off date. The mortgage pool consists entirely of fully 
      amortizing fixed-rate loans, 98% of which have 15-year maturities with 
      the remaining having 13 to 14-year maturities. The pool is characterized 
      by substantial borrower equity in each mortgaged property, as evidenced 
      by the weighted average LTV (62%) and CLTV (64%). The weighted average 
      credit score of the mortgage pool is 767, which is within the prime 
      mortgage range.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction included a loan-level analysis of the 
      mortgage pools using our Residential Mortgage Default and Loss Model, 
      together with a review of the key transaction parties, results of loan 
      file reviews performed by independent third party firms and review of 
      the legal structure and key documentation. This analysis is further 
      described in our U.S. RMBS Rating Methodology.

		&lt;p&gt;The Directors of Alstom expressed their satisfaction that the productive exchanges established with the French State had resulted in a business proposal that not only addresses the interests of Alstom and of its stakeholders, but also provides assurances in connection with concerns expressed by the French State.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;GENERAL ELECTRIC OFFER&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;GE would acquire, as previously announced, the Thermal Power, Renewable Power and Grid Sectors, as well as corporate and shared services (the Energy Transaction) for a fixed and unchanged price representing an Equity Value of &#8364;12.35bn and an Enterprise Value of &#8364;11.4bn.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the updated offer, following completion of the Energy Transaction, Alstom and GE would establish joint ventures in Grid and Renewable Power.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In Grid, each company would hold a 50% stake in a global business combining Alstom Grid and GE Digital Energy. In Renewables, each company would hold a 50% stake in Alstom's Off-shore Wind and Hydro businesses.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In addition, Alstom and GE would create a 50/50 Global Nuclear and French Steam alliance, which would include the production and servicing of the "Arabelle" steam turbine equipment for nuclear power plants, as well as Alstom's steam turbine equipment and servicing for applications in France. In addition, the French State would hold a preferred share giving it veto and other governance rights over issues relating to security and nuclear plant technology in France.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The investment by Alstom in these Energy related alliances represents ca. &#8364;2.5bn, assuming these companies are debt-free, cash-free. The terms of these alliances include usual shareholders agreements with standard governance and liquidity rights.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Finally, GE proposes the creation of a global alliance in which GE would sell Alstom 100% of its signaling business, with sales of ca. US$500m in 2013 and 1,200 employees, and the companies would sign multiple collaboration agreements including a service agreement for GE locomotives outside of the United States, RD, sourcing and manufacturing and commercial support in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The ad hoc committee of independent directors reviewed the transaction proposed by GE with the assistance of its financial and legal advisors. The financial expert appointed to advise the Board has concluded that the financial consideration offered by GE to Alstom is fair from a financial point of view. The legal advisor appointed to advise the Board has concluded that GE's offer appears, from a legal point of view, favorable to the company, particularly in light of the fact that it provides for a fixed and final purchase price, does not require representations and warranties and, with the updates proposed by GE, addresses adequately the French State's concerns. The Board, acknowledging unanimously the strategic and industrial merits of this offer, has decided to issue a positive recommendation of this offer, authorizing Mr. Patrick Kron, in his capacity of Chief Executive Officer of Alstom, to engage in the next step of the process, with the information and consultation of the competent works councils within the Alstom group.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SIEMENS AND MITSUBISHI HEAVY INDUSTRIES PROPOSAL&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Further, the Board of Directors, with the assistance of the ad hoc committee and its legal and financial advisors, reviewed the proposal received from Siemens and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, as presented to the ad hoc committee on June 16, 2014, and its improved proposal received on June 20, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Under the terms of the improved proposal, Siemens would acquire Alstom's gas business for an equity consideration of &#8364;4.3bn, a &#8364;400m improvement versus the initial proposal. MHI would buy a 40 percent equity stake in the combined steam, grid and hydro business of Alstom through one single holding company, for a consideration of &#8364;3.9bn. In addition, Siemens would offer to enter into an up to 50/50 Joint Venture with Alstom in Signaling and Mobility Infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;After review, the Board has unanimously determined that this proposal does not adequately address the interests of Alstom and of its stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;NEXT STEPS&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Completion of the GE transaction will be subject to works council consultation and merger control and other regulatory clearances, including French Foreign Investment authorisation. In accordance with the AFEP-Medef code, the final approval of the transaction will be submitted to the shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Should this offer be approved and completed, Alstom would refocus on its fully owned Transport activities and on its Energy alliances with GE. Alstom would use the proceeds of this transaction to strengthen its Transport business, to invest in its Energy alliances, to pay down its debt and return cash to its shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Patrick Kron, Chairman and CEO of Alstom, commented: "The combination of the very complementary Energy businesses of Alstom and GE would create a stronger entity, best placed to serve customers globally and invest in people and technology over the long run. Alstom would be associated to this ambitious combination through the Energy alliances. Alstom Transport, a solid leader with a large portfolio of technologies and a worldwide presence in a dynamic market, would be further strengthened through the acquisition of GE's signaling business as well as a far-reaching rail alliance with GE."&lt;/p&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;Conference call&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Alstom will hold a conference call for analysts  investors on Monday June 23 at 08:30AM (CET). The call will also be available live on Alstom's website : www.alstom.com (listen only mode).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms IBM's IDRs at 'A+/F1'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of International Business 
      Machines Corporation (IBM) as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF) at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR at 'F1';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper (CP) rating at 'F1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's action affects approximately $54 
      billion of debt, including IBM's undrawn $10 billion credit facility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings and Outlook reflect IBM's:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Strong company profile primarily supported by i) significant revenue 
      market share in information technology (IT) services (No.1), servers 
      (No.3), enterprise software (No.1) and external storage (tied for No.3); 
      ii) solid recurring revenue (49%) from IT services, software and 
      financing that mitigates revenue and profit volatility; and iii) highly 
      diversified revenue base by offering, customer, industry and geography 
      (65%+ revenue outside U.S.).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Strong financial flexibility due to i) robust internal liquidity with 
      a significant cash position ($9.7 billion) and $8.4 billion of post 
      dividend free cash flow (FCF) in the latest 12 months (LTM) ended March 
      31, 2014; ii) solid external liquidity with an undrawn $10 billion 
      revolving credit facility (RCF) due 2018 and ready access to capital 
      markets; iii) strong credit protection metrics despite the recent 
      increase in core debt; and iv) roughly $30 billion of finance 
      receivables (58% short-term and 58% considered investment grade).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Well-executed management strategy, including i) ability to identify 
      early trends that present significant higher margin, long-term growth 
      opportunities and reposition investment priorities, both organic and 
      inorganic, to capitalize on these opportunities (i.e. analytics); ii) 
      consistent and sizable investments in RD (6% of revenue) to develop 
      innovative differentiated solutions that leverage IBM's entire portfolio 
      of offerings and command higher profit margins; iii) core competency in 
      identifying and integrating strategic acquisitions; iv) track record of 
      strengthening strategic focus and profitability by divesting low margin 
      businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating concerns center on:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Risk of core debt (non-financing) increases to achieve financial 
      and/or business objectives (i.e. IBM's 2015 EPS target of at least $20), 
      such as sizable debt-financed share repurchases and/or acquisitions, 
      resulting in a material reduction of credit protection measures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch notes IBM maintains significant incremental debt capacity at the 
      current credit ratings. Core leverage was 0.6x at March 31, 2014 despite 
      a material increase in core debt in the first quarter to front load 
      share repurchases in 2014. Fitch expects the pace of share repurchases 
      will significantly moderate through 2014, resulting in gross share 
      repurchases below the nearly $14 billion spent in 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Increasing pace of cloud adoption will likely pressure the growth 
      rates for certain of IBM's traditional businesses, particularly 
      traditional software and infrastructure outsourcing business. IBM's 
      ability to capture emerging opportunities across cloud, analytics, 
      mobile and social, particularly solutions with higher customer value, is 
      critical to achieving revenue growth and at least maintaining 
      profitability. Fitch believes slower industry growth for traditional IT 
      products and services could lead to more aggressive pricing in the 
      absence of long-term industry consolidation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term, which 
      could pressure FCF and financial flexibility in the absence of 
      commensurate growth in profitability. This could necessitate further 
      increases in core debt to fund acquisitions and/or share repurchases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --IBM's dependence on mainframe (System Z) refresh cycles to maintain 
      profitability in the Systems and Technology Group (STG) due to IBM's 
      underperforming storage business excluding solid state arrays, weak 
      industry demand for UNIX-based Power servers as more and increasingly 
      diverse workloads are performed on low-cost x86 industry standard 
      servers (ISS).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Declining demand for UNIX-based Power systems also adversely affects the 
      profitability of STG's microelectronics business, which designs and 
      manufactures the Power microprocessors used in Power servers. The 
      decline in UNIX server demand also carries negative longer-term revenue 
      and margin ramifications for IBM's support services and financing 
      businesses relating to Power servers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      STG profitability will benefit from the successful sale of IBM's x86 
      business to Lenovo, which is expected to close in the second half of 
      2014, assuming regulatory approval. IBM's x86 business generated $4.6 
      billion of revenue and was essentially breakeven on a pre-tax income 
      basis in 2013. Fitch projects STG gross margin will expand to the 
      mid-40% range in 2015 compared with 34.2% in 2013, benefitting from the 
      x86 divestiture and likely new mainframe cycle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The long-term threat to highly profitable mainframe demand and 
      associated operating system software (zOS) from converged ISS solutions. 
      IBM's gross profit dollars from mainframes were flat on a compound 
      annual growth rate (CAGR) basis in the past 10 years, exemplifying the 
      resiliency and evolution of the platform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes the company's lack of a strategic rationale to maintain a 
      higher rating at the expense of financial flexibility required for 
      acquisitions or shareholder-friendly activities limits further positive 
      rating actions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings may be downgraded in the event of:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --A shift to more aggressive financial policies. Sustained core leverage 
      in excess of 1.25x may result in negative rating actions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Greater than anticipated revenue erosion and/or profitability 
      pressures within IBM's traditional recurring core franchises that are 
      not offset by growth in strategic imperatives, resulting in a material, 
      sustained deterioration in credit protection metrics.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM has strong financial flexibility and liquidity supported by 
      approximately $9.7 billion of cash and equivalents as of March 31, 2014 
      and an undrawn $10 billion RCF expiring on Nov. 10, 2018. Liquidity is 
      further supported by strong and consistent annual FCF, which was 
      approximately $8.4 billion in the LTM ending March 31, 2014. Fitch 
      expects IBM's FCF will exceed $10 billion in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects IBM to continue to use FCF for acquisitions, particularly 
      in the software and services industries, share repurchases, albeit at a 
      decreased rate in the second half of 2014, and dividend payments to 
      shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The underfunded status of IBM's worldwide defined benefit (DB) pension 
      plans was negative $6.2 billion (94% funded) at year-end 2013, 
      significantly improved from negative $14.4 billion (86% funded) in 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Excluding unfunded nonqualified DB pension plans, the funded status of 
      IBM's U.S. and worldwide plans at year-end 2013 was 109% and 102%, 
      respectively. In 2014, IBM is required to make legally mandated 
      contributions of $600 million to its international DB plans. This 
      compares with approximately $500 million actually contributed in 2013. 
      The amount of the 2014 pension contribution is very manageable given the 
      amount and consistency of IBM's cash flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes IBM has more than ample liquidity to satisfy its 
      longer-term legally mandated pension funding requirements (estimated at 
      approximately $3.3 billion through 2018). This estimate could increase 
      due to more frequent re-measurement of funded status in certain non-U.S. 
      countries and the performance of financial markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total debt was $43.9 billion as of March 31, 2014 consisting of $9.3 
      billion of short-term debt and $34.7 billion of long-term debt. Fitch 
      estimates $28.3 billion (65%) of total debt is attributable to IBM's 
      global financing business with the remaining debt attributable to core 
      (non-financing) operations. IBM has long-term debt maturities of 
      approximately $2.4 billion in the remainder of 2014 and $4.1 billion in 
      2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the purpose of financial evaluation, Fitch analyzes IBM's core 
      business and financing activities separately, since they are capitalized 
      differently and have dissimilar cash flow characteristics. IBM Global 
      Finance (IGF) accounted for nearly 11% of IBM's pre-tax earnings in 
      2013. This, however, represents the largest component of IBM's balance 
      sheet, constituting approximately 24% of total assets and 27% of total 
      liabilities as of March 31, 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total leverage as of March 31, 2014 increased to approximately 1.7x from 
      1.3x at March 31, 2013, and interest coverage decreased to 24.4x from 
      26.5x in the prior 12-month period. Core leverage increased to 0.6x from 
      0.3x and interest coverage increased to 61.8x from 58x, respectively. 
      Fitch expects total leverage to decrease to 1.5x by the end of 2014, 
      nearly flat compared with year end 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The main purpose of IGF is to facilitate clients' acquisition of IBM 
      systems, software and services by providing financial and capital 
      management solutions. IGF has a solid long-term operating record, 
      provides strategic advantages to IBM in terms of attracting and 
      retaining customers by delivering total solutions. IBM also generates an 
      annuity-like revenue stream associated with multi-year leases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IGF's primary focus on IBM's products and clients mitigates some risks 
      associated with financing via a deep knowledge of its client base and 
      clear insight into the solutions being financed. Asset quality metrics 
      have remained relatively solid as a result of the relatively 
      conservative underwriting culture and strong risk management 
      capabilities. IGF's capitalization remains solid for the rating category 
      and leverage levels continue to hover near management's target of 7x.

      Research and Markets: Global SME Big Data Market 2014-2018 with HP, IBM, 
      Oracle  Teradata Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/wl52bk/global_sme_big) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      SME Big Data Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global SME Big Data market will grow at a CAGR of 42.94 percent over 
      the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Big data solutions include a wide range of hardware, software, and 
      services required for processing and analyzing structured and 
      unstructured data that is too big for traditional data processing tools 
      to manage. These data are generated by various sources such as mobile 
      devices, digital repositories, and enterprise applications and range in 
      size from terabytes (10^12 bytes) to petabytes (10^15 bytes) and even 
      exabytes (10^18 bytes). Due to the considerably large size of big data, 
      it is difficult for SMEs to manage and analyze the data using existing 
      traditional data processing tools. Big data solutions are being used for 
      a wide range of applications such as conversation analysis in social 
      networking websites, fraud management in the BFSI sector, and disease 
      diagnosis in the Healthcare sector. Due to the increasing need for big 
      data solutions, the Global SME Big Data market is expected to witness 
      rapid growth during the forecast period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Many large enterprise computing vendors frequently acquire companies to 
      equip themselves with the latest big data technologies. Large enterprise 
      software vendors also target pure-play big data vendors and small 
      companies whose major customers are SMEs to expand their customer base 
      and tap the huge potential in the SME segment. IBM acquired many 
      analytics companies such as DemandTec Inc., Varicent Software, Tealeaf 
      Technology Inc., Kenexa Corp., and Vivisimo Inc. in 2012. In 2013, it 
      acquired several more big data analytic companies such as StoredIQ Inc., 
      Star Analytics Inc., and The Now Factory.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2011, Hewlett-Packard acquired the major pure-play vendor Vertica for 
      US$350 million and EMC acquired Greenplum Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Also, Aster Data Systems Inc. was acquired by Teradata Corp. in 2011, 
      Oracle Corp. acquired Datanomic Ltd., Endeca Technologies Inc., 
      ClearTrail Technologies Pvt Ltd., and DataRaker Inc. Through 
      acquisitions, large enterprise computing vendors are trying to enhance 
      their capabilities to deliver a comprehensive big data solution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, the need to improve business process efficiency 
      and productivity is one of the factors driving the growth of the Global 
      SME Big Data market. Big data solutions improve the efficiency of 
      business processes and provide up-to-date information, and shorten the 
      decision making process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the lack 
      of awareness about the capability of big data technology. SMEs are often 
      ignorant of the benefits of big data solutions and do not invest in them.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 23 (IFR) - Goldman Sachs will start marketing a
new type of bond transaction this Wednesday that straddles asset
categories and features an unusual triple-recourse structure, as
it seeks to take advantage of investors' demand for Triple A
rated assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The so-called Fixed Income Global Structure Collateral
Obligation (FIGSCO) issuer is a joint venture between Goldman
Sachs and Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance and will provide investors
with a triple recourse if things turn sour.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the structure, investors will have recourse to the
pool of assets backing the trade, as well as having an unsecured
claim against Goldman Sachs and Mitsui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This triple-recourse mechanism makes the transaction akin to
a covered bond issue, where investors have a claim against the
assets and the issuer and, indeed, covered bond investors will
be among the targeted roadshow audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to diversify Goldman's funding
sources and the outright pricing level is expected to be
competitive with senior funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal has been structured in response to a lack of supply
of Triple A rated assets and net negative covered bond supply.
The programme size being set up is 10bn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays, Credit Agricole-CIB, Natixis, Goldman Sachs and
UBS will hold investor meetings running from Wednesday until
July 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while the transaction uses some covered bond technology,
it does not have all the bells and whistles traditionally
attached to the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no legal framework; the assets would not be
eligible for a cover pool as defined by European regulation; the
bonds will unlikely be repo-eligible at the ECB; nor will they
likely count for the Liquidity Coverage Ratio. They will
probably have a 20% risk-weighting and be treated as Triple A
corporate exposure under Solvency 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRIPLE A WITH A SPREAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal could offer buyers a much more attractive spread
than a sovereign trade, while filling a supply gap in the
covered bond primary market, according to a FIG syndicate
banker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an interesting trade, especially if you look at
what's going on in the world," he said. "This will offer value
and we expect the big liquidity books to get on board."
On the negative side, the deal may require more knowledge than a
plain Triple A trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been here before: Triple A with a spread," the
banker said, "which is why the roadshow will be extremely
important and investors will have to do their homework."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another banker said the complex nature of the trade was a
negative. 
"They clearly want to leverage the success of covered bonds, but
the complexity alone is negative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The S Triple A is achieved thanks to a total return swap
provided on it by Goldman Sachs Mitsui Marine Derivative
Products, or GS MMDP, a joint venture with strong credit
ratings. For some, this has echoes of the much maligned CDO
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the deal's collateral cashflow is likely to come
from a variety of securities from Goldman Sach's long-term
funding operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is no disclosure yet, but that could mean the
collateral could include bonds, derivatives and loan assets,
which sources away from the deal say resembles something between
a structured covered bond and a CDO structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIGSCO would be more dynamic than a typical covered bond
pool, though, as assets would be marked to bid on a daily basis
and topped up to keep overcollateralisation above 5%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More collateral will be added to the pool if the existing
securities decline in value. A reputable international asset
monitor will be tasked with assessing the valuation of the pool
on a monthly basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The items would not be disclosed line by line, but investors
would be informed of the type of assets, the country of origin,
the proportion of fixed and FRN assets and the level of
concentration risk.

&lt;p&gt;VIENNA, June 23 (Reuters) - Cultivation of coca bushes in
Bolivia fell around 9 percent last year to its lowest level
since 2002, an annual survey in the world's biggest cocaine
producer after Peru and Colombia showed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The joint survey by the United Nations and Bolivia cited
eradication efforts by the government for the decline in the
cultivation of the leaf used to make cocaine. The agency
forecast a further reduction as part of a strategy by the
government to reduce surplus output and fight drug trafficking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decline confirms a downward trend over the last three
years, during which period coca cultivation dropped by 26
percent," Antonino De Leo, the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime
(UNODC) representative in Bolivia, said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N. said in a statement that Bolivia was on track to
cut the area of coca cultivation to 20,000 hectares by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The area under cultivation in 2013 was around 23,000
hectares, down from 25,300 a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolivia's President Evo Morales, a former coca farmer, has
long defended its legal use as an "ancestral rite" for tea,
sweets and medicines. On June 13, Morales presented the United
Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon with an unusual treat for
his 70th birthday - a cake made with coca leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People in the Andean region traditionally chew on coca leaf
as a source of energy or as an antidote to altitude sickness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The UN Convention on Narcotic Drugs banned coca leaf in 1961
along with cocaine, heroin, opium and morphine. Bolivia withdrew
from the convention in 2012 Bolivia it to protest against the
criminalization of the chewing of coca leaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Subsequently the UN granted Bolivia a special dispensation
recognising the traditional practice as legal in Bolivia and
Bolivia was re-admitted to the convention.

      Junction Solutions Upgrades the Royal Canadian Mint to Microsoft 
      Dynamics AX 2012
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Junction Solutions, a leading provider of vertical market-specific 
      on-premise and on-demand software applications and services for the 
      manufacturing, distribution, retail and life sciences sectors, announced 
      the completion of an ERP upgrade to Microsoft Dynamics AX 2012 for the 
      Royal Canadian Mint.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Royal Canadian Mint is a world-class provider of branded investment, 
      collectible and secure payment products and services with facilities in 
      Ottawa and Winnipeg, as well as a boutique location in Vancouver. As a 
      for-profit corporation, it produces circulation and non-circulation 
      coins and manages the domestic coinage system in addition to the 
      production and marketing of bullion and related refinery products and 
      services.&#160;The Royal Canadian Mint also produces foreign coinage and 
      offers storage, assaying and refining services, and as a multi-channel 
      retailer, operates brick-and-mortar stores, a call center, and an online 
      storefront to sell its products worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The successful project consisted of a complex upgrade from Microsoft 
      Dynamics AX 4 to a customized version of Dynamics AX 2012 that had to 
      account for the Royal Canadian Mint&#8217;s discrete, process and lean 
      manufacturing functions. Additionally, Junction Solutions layered in 
      modules to support the retail operations, refinery production, and 
      precision financial tracking of the Mint&#8217;s $3.4 billion business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We look forward to moving our business toward future goals with 
      improved speed and efficiencies across our manufacturing and retail 
      business operations using Dynamics AX 2012,&#8221; said Greg Smith, CIO, Royal 
      Canadian Mint. &#8220;Junction Solutions implemented a sophisticated and 
      robust ERP solution that provides unique capabilities to our business in 
      sales, manufacturing and refining.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Royal Canadian Mint was an early adopter of Dynamics AX and is a 
      long-standing customer with Junction Solutions,&#8221; said Debby Smith, 
      vice-president of Customer Relations, Junction Solutions. &#8220;The company&#8217;s 
      leadership continues to focus on using technology to drive its business 
      forward. We are honored to be their long-term technology partner and 
      look forward to helping them meet their complex business requirements 
      and future business goals.&#8221;

			JPMorgan Chase  Co. Announces Expansion of Intensive Academic and 
      Social Enrichment Program for Young Men of Color in New York, Chicago 
      and Los Angeles
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Fellowship Initiative offers comprehensive support to high school 
      students to help them achieve personal and professional success
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Former Secretary of State General Colin Powell and former New York 
      City Mayor Michael Bloomberg join Jamie Dimon for announcement today
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. today announced the expansion of The 
      Fellowship Initiative (TFI) to Chicago and Los Angeles along with a 
      new, larger class of Fellows in New York City. The Fellowship 
      Initiative, first launched in New York City in 2010 as a multi-year 
      pilot developed by JPMorgan Chase, enrolls young men of color in a 
      comprehensive, hands-on enrichment program that includes academic, 
      social and emotional support at a critical juncture in their lives to 
      help them achieve personal and professional success.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Many young men of color from economically-distressed communities do not 
      have access to the educational opportunities and support systems they 
      need to succeed. It is well-recognized that Black and Latino students in 
      New York City, Chicago and Los Angeles graduate from high school at 
      rates well below those of their non-minority peers. At a minimum, future 
      employability requires a high school degree, but real economic 
      opportunity involves much more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These young men need access to high quality education and positive role 
      models in and outside the classroom,&#8221; Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO 
      of JPMorgan Chase  Co., will say today during an event with 
      former Secretary of State General Colin Powell and former New York City 
      Mayor Michael Bloomberg announcing the program expansion. &#8220;We want to 
      raise their expectations for what they can achieve in life &#8211; and give 
      them the tools for academic and personal success. The Fellowship 
      Initiative is a smart investment in their individual futures and the 
      future of our country.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Beginning in 2010, JPMorgan Chase launched a pilot in New York City to 
      see if the right combination of intensive academic and leadership 
      training could help young men of color complete their high school 
      education and gain admission to top colleges and universities. The pilot 
      demonstrated that with a comprehensive enrichment program, these 
      students were able to rise to the challenge, work hard and expand their 
      personal and economic horizons.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;America&#8217;s continued strength depends on our young people getting the 
      education and support they need to succeed in an increasingly 
      competitive world,&#8221; said General Colin Powell. &#8220;At America's 
      Promise, we launched GradNation to help raise the national average 
      on-time high school graduation rate to 90 percent by 2020. By focusing 
      intensively on young men of color and providing hands-on mentorship and 
      support in high school and college, JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Fellowship 
      Initiative is an excellent example of the commitment our country needs 
      to preserve the long-term success of our nation. I am pleased to be on 
      President Obama's &#8216;My Brother's Keeper&#8217; task force, which is also 
      complimented by the JPMorgan Chase Fellowship Initiative.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Helping young Black and Latino men overcome the obstacles they face is 
      an urgent challenge that has been too long ignored,&#8221; said former New 
      York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. &#8220;In New York City, we created a 
      public-private partnership called the Young Men&#8217;s Initiative to confront 
      the challenge head-on.&#160;We need more civic-minded companies and 
      organizations to step up and join this work, and I congratulate JPMorgan 
      Chase for being a leader in this effort and for making a real difference 
      in the lives of young men of color in our city.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 24 Fellows who completed the three-year pilot starting in their 
      sophomore year of high school reported elevated academic goals, career 
      aspirations and life-changing personal growth. Each of these Fellows who 
      completed the pilot program graduated from high school on-time, gained 
      admission to a four-year college program and, collectively, received 
      scholarships and grants totaling $8.4 million. More than half were the 
      first in their family to attend college.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We need to do more to ensure that young men of color are not left 
      behind,&#8221; said Dalila Wilson-Scott, President of the JPMorgan Chase 
      Foundation. &#8220;One of the most important lessons we learned during The 
      Fellowship Initiative pilot in New York City was that students respond 
      positively to commitment. They were able to unlock their overall 
      potential when they had sustained access to academic and social supports 
      alongside mentoring.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fellowship Initiative in Chicago, Los Angeles and New York City will 
      include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Academic training and project-based learning throughout the school 
        year and summer;
      
			
        Leadership and entrepreneurship training;
      
			
        One-on-one mentorship with JPMorgan Chase employees;
      
			
        College tours and college preparation workshops;
      
			
        SAT prep coursework; and
      
			
        Team-building events.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fellows will also receive support services and coaching through 
      college, as well as opportunities for summer internships at JPMorgan 
      Chase. In addition, their families will participate in educational 
      workshops about the college application process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase is recruiting 120 students &#8211; 40 students in each city &#8211; 
      to participate in the program. Recruiting began in May, and students who 
      are enrolled in the program will begin orientation in July and the full 
      program in October. The Fellowship Initiative will begin with a week on 
      college campuses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Fellowship Initiative is a program that addresses the current state 
      of crisis young men of color are facing, which is arguably the most 
      urgent and prevalent social issue in American society,&#8221; said Dariel 
      Vasquez, a Fellow from the New York City pilot program. &#8220;TFI 
      provided me both the professional and academic development I desperately 
      needed to become successful in high school and in college. The program 
      practically put me a year ahead of my peers. TFI gave me exposure to a 
      world I didn't even know existed and prepared me to successfully 
      navigate through any obstacles that may present themselves. It goes 
      without saying that I wouldn't be here today had it not been for 
      programs like TFI.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Other Notable Statements of Support for The Fellowship Initiative
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The JPMC Fellowship Initiative is exactly what the President&#8217;s call to 
      action through My Brother&#8217;s Keeper is all about: creating powerful 
      mentorship and fellowship opportunities for young men of color,&#8221; said U.S. 
      Secretary of Education Arne Duncan. &#8220;Programs like these are 
      catalysts for success in college and careers, building pathways to 
      opportunity for our nation&#8217;s most vulnerable youth, who are too often 
      left out of the mainstream workforce.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As the largest school district in the nation, we know that programs 
      like the JPMorgan Chase Fellowship Initiative provide invaluable 
      academic and social supports to our young men of color,&#8221; said New 
      York City Mayor Bill de Blasio. &#8220;I&#8217;m thrilled that The Fellowship 
      Initiative is expanding in New York City giving additional students a 
      chance to reach their individual potential and graduate high school 
      prepared for success in college and career.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In Chicago, our goal is 100% college-ready, 100% college-bound for 
      every child, and that is what The Fellowship Initiative achieves for 
      these young men who participate,&#8221; said Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel.

			Telerik&#174;, 
      a global end-to-end provider of application development tools and 
      solutions for building cross-platform and mobile applications, today 
      announced a significant expansion of its Boston office. Located in 
      Waltham, Mass., the 24,000 square foot space will support the company&#8217;s 
      rapid growth in the area with more than 180 seats. Currently, there are 
      nearly 100 employees located in the Waltham office, which is actively 
      hiring at an average of 10 jobs per month, particularly for positions 
      within the company&#8217;s sales, marketing and demand generation departments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2013 alone, venture capital firms invested nearly $1.5 billion in 
      companies located in Boston proper and more than $55 million in 
      technology suburbs like Waltham, according to the National Venture 
      Capital Association.1 &#8220;Expanding our Boston presence is a 
      strategic next step in increasing our U.S. and global market share,&#8221; 
      said Derek Langone, EVP, global sales. &#8220;It&#8217;s no secret that Boston is a 
      booming technology hub and it continues to be a perfect spot for our 
      U.S. headquarters. The wealth of technology-focused universities, along 
      with a vibrant entrepreneurial community, young talent, innovation and 
      high energy are all key components of the types of talent Telerik is 
      looking for as it reinforces our &#8216;pay-it-forward&#8217; culture.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Telerik first launched the Boston office back in 2006, and was the 
      company&#8217;s first foray in the U.S. market. The company has showed 
      continued growth since that time and, over the last few months, Telerik 
      has made several key hires in the Boston area including the appointment 
      of Derek Langone to executive vice president of global sales, and KC 
      Lincoln to vice president of demand generation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Enterprises worldwide leverage Telerik tools, which empower more than 
      450 of the Fortune 500&#174; to create compelling experiences 
      across web, mobile and desktop applications. The office expansion and 
      additions of Langone and Lincoln further exemplify the company&#8217;s 
      commitment to its go-to-market strategy for development industry 
      dominance. Langone, Lincoln and their Boston teams are responsible for 
      further embedding Telerik Platform across the enterprise, as well as 
      establishing new footholds in emerging market segments wishing to 
      elevate their cross-platform mobile presence.

&lt;p&gt;(Updates with more quotes)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Orhan Coskun&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANKARA, June 23 (Reuters) - U.S. oil firm ExxonMobil 
is in talks with state-run Turkish Petroleum Corporation over a
venture to explore for shale gas in the country's southeast and
northwest regions, a Turkish energy official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon held talks with TPAO in 2012 to over a partnership in
shale, but the negotiations were inconclusive. Turkish officials
say talks have since advanced and are likely to result in an
agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ExxonMobil is coming to Turkey to partner up with TPAO,"
Selami Incedalci, the head of the energy ministry's General
Directorate of Petroleum Affairs, said late on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said ExxonMobil was interested in onshore opportunities
in the southeast and Thrace, in northwestern Turkey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Turkey wants to reduce its annual energy bill of around $60
billion and is developing domestic resources including nuclear,
coal, solar and wind energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With domestic gas consumption rising, and its location
well-placed to supply international markets, major exploitable
reserves could be a game changer for Turkey's economy and highly
lucrative for whoever finds them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors from the United States, Europe and Canada are also
interested in Turkey's shale gas and oil, Incedalci said, adding
that the Ministry was planning to hold talks with potential
investors in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell is also drilling for shale gas in
the region around the southeastern city of Diyarbakir, while
Canadian firm TransAtlantic Petroleum is also active in the
region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Estimates of how big Turkey's shale gas reserves are vary
wildly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One energy official said data from some international bodies
suggested Turkey could have a massive 20 trillion cubic metres
(cbm) of total reserves. Another industry expert said proven
reserves so far stood at just 6-7 billion cbm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That compares with U.S. Energy Intelligence Administration's
(EIA) assessment of 7,299 trillion cubic feet of estimated shale
gas reserves in the United States, among the world's top
producers of the commodity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Orhan Coskun, Writing by Humeyra Pamuk; Editing

      Continuing its commitment to workforce readiness and helping underserved 
      youth obtain the skills necessary to build lasting careers, JPMorgan 
      Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) today announced a commitment of $5 million over 
      the next two years to summer youth employment initiatives across the 
      U.S. This commitment expects to fund summer jobs for more than 4,000 
      teenagers and young adults as well as learning opportunities in the 
      fields of science, technology, engineering, arts and math for 20,000 13- 
      to 24-year-olds. The firm&#8217;s employees will also volunteer their time 
      with nonprofit partners to provide financial capability coaching 
      sessions and introductory coding skills training to participating youth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is prioritizing youth employment 
      as one of the key issues for her work at the Clinton Foundation, 
      announced JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Commitment to Action at the 2014 Clinton 
      Global Initiative America meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Great American companies are committing to expanding training, hiring, 
      and mentoring youth, and to encourage other businesses to step up as 
      well,&#8221; said Former Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton. &#8220;JPMorgan Chase 
      will invest $5 million over the next two years to fund 4,000 summer jobs 
      in 14 cities and to offer work readiness opportunities to another 20,000 
      young people.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Peter L. Scher, Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate 
      Responsibility for JPMorgan Chase, joined Secretary Clinton in Denver 
      for the announcement. Scher said, &#8220;Ensuring that young people have the 
      skills they need to succeed is a national priority. JPMorgan Chase is 
      proud to work with the Clinton Foundation, city leaders and nonprofit 
      partners to train and employ our youth. Investing in skills is the right 
      thing for their future and for the future of our country.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2014, the firm is working with mayors, nonprofit organizations and 
      other private sector employers in 14 cities &#8211; Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, 
      Jacksonville, Jersey City, Los Angeles, Louisville, Miami, Milwaukee, 
      New York City, Oakland, San Francisco, Seattle and St. Louis &#8211; to engage 
      youth during their summer break to help expand employment among young 
      adults and provide opportunities for at-risk youth to develop skills 
      that will put them on a career pathway.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I appreciate JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s support and participation in the Mayor&#8217;s 
      Intern Fellows Program,&#8221; Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said.&#160;&#8220;Together 
      we&#8217;re helping our children learn and build a r&#233;sum&#233; to take out into the 
      world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;JPMorgan Chase continues to be a great partner in Detroit's turnaround 
      by investing in our community and in our youth,&#8221; said Detroit Mayor Mike 
      Duggan. &#8220;By providing meaningful summer work for&#160;1,000 Detroit students 
      this year and next, JPMorgan Chase&#160;will provide them a great opportunity 
      to get&#160;started on a real&#160;career path. This will be a significant&#160;boost 
      to&#160;our commitment to provide summer jobs to 5,000 Detroit students&#160;next 
      summer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are investing in the future success of San Francisco&#8217;s young people 
      by providing more than 7,000 jobs and paid internships for them this 
      summer with a special focus on serving low-income and disadvantaged 
      youth,&#8221; said San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee. &#8220;I thank JPMorgan Chase for 
      joining me on Summer Jobs Plus as we invest in the future success of our 
      City&#8217;s youth this summer and beyond.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Several programs will focus on providing skills-based jobs, internships 
      and learning opportunities for teenagers and young adults in their 
      respective cities and continue beyond the summer months. These programs 
      will expose youth to careers early on, connect them to growth sectors, 
      help them obtain marketable skills and teach them how to manage their 
      finances. Below are a few examples of programs JPMorgan Chase is 
      supporting in 2014:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Summer 
        of Learning and Earning will provide more than 215,000 
        opportunities for Chicago&#8217;s youth, ages 14-24, including 22,000 
        skill-building jobs and internships and interactive learning 
        activities in libraries, schools, museums and cultural institutions, 
        colleges and universities, and community-based programs, as well as 
        through self-paced, online modules.
      
			
				Mayor&#8217;s 
        Intern Fellows Program in Dallas will place more than 300 public 
        high school students in summer positions at some of the city&#8217;s top 
        health, technology and energy companies and nonprofits &#8211; three of the 
        area&#8217;s highest-growth sectors. Now in its seventh year, the Mayor&#8217;s 
        office and Education is Freedom will have placed 1,050 students in 
        internships across industry sectors, including technology, healthcare, 
        law, accounting, business, education, the nonprofit sector, 
        advertising/marketing/public relations, engineering, banking, 
        manufacturing and hospitality, by the end of this summer.
      
			
				Grow 
        Detroit&#8217;s Young Talent will provide 1,000 Detroit youth, ages 
        14-24, employment readiness training and six weeks of paid summer work 
        experiences with area employers. The program was created by the 
        Detroit Youth Employment Consortium in 2009 to address high rates of 
        unemployment among Detroit&#8217;s teen and young adult populations &#8211; 
        unemployment estimated at more than 50 percent. The program has grown 
        each year, providing more than 5,000 Detroit youth with paid summer 
        work experiences since 2009.
      
			
        United Way of Northeast Florida&#8217;s Summer 
        Youth Employment Program will provide 140 students in Jacksonville 
        with a six-week paid internship at top organizations, helping them 
        acquire high-demand skills, gain access to mentors and coaches, and 
        build their resumes. Youth will also participate in a financial 
        management simulation lab, which will help them learn how to manage 
        their paycheck and personal finances.
      
			
				Los 
        Angeles Summer of Learning will bring together a coalition of 
        public, private and nonprofit partners and offer education programs 
        and activities through the city&#8217;s parks, libraries, schools, museums 
        and cultural institutions. The curriculum will offer learning 
        opportunities in science, technology, engineering, arts and math, as 
        well as a work-readiness pathway geared towards the skills needed to 
        succeed in the modern economy.
      
			
        Three nonprofits in New York City, PENCIL, 
        Futures 
        and Options, and Virtual 
        Enterprises International, will create and sponsor a total of 140 
        paid internships for underserved high school students. PENCIL will 
        also provide career readiness training to an additional 130 students. 
        Program participants will be introduced to career opportunities, 
        motivated to pursue higher education, and equipped with skills to 
        succeed in the workforce.
      
			
				Summer 
        Jobs+ will connect 7,000 disconnected and at-risk youth (ages 
        14-24) with paid jobs, internships and job training initiatives in the 
        private sector and San Francisco City departments. Since it started in 
        2012, Summer Jobs+ has placed more than 12,000 youth in paid summer 
        jobs and internships. This year, the program expands to include 
        placing individuals in employment and training opportunities beyond 
        the summer.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      To further complement summer youth employment, JPMorgan Chase is 
      supporting the expansion of the Consumer Federation of America&#8217;s America 
      Saves First-time 
      Workers Program. This program will help young workers establish good 
      financial habits as they start earning their first paychecks. 
      Participants will learn how to set up direct deposit, establish savings 
      goals and receive relevant financial education.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This commitment to youth employment is in addition to the five-year, 
      $250 million global economic opportunity initiative, New 
      Skills at Work, launched in late 2013. New Skills at Work 
      is a global workforce readiness and demand-driven training initiative. 
      It aims to address the skills gap that exists across many industries, 
      such as healthcare and advanced manufacturing, where not enough trained 
      workers have the skills needed to fill available jobs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Research and Markets: Global Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Market 
      2014-2018 with SAP, Oracle, Sage Group, Infor  Microsoft Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/4kgqsn/global_enterprise) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Market 2014-2018" report to 
      their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global ERP market is comprised of many software modules, and each of 
      these modules is crucial for a particular business operation. These 
      modules include product management, manufacturing, financial management, 
      customer management, supplier management, project management, and HRM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increasing influence of social networking sites, such as Facebook, 
      Twitter, and LinkedIn, allows ERP vendors to introduce social networking 
      in businesses that help employees to interact with customers. The 
      linkage of ERP software with social media gives employees a richer 
      understanding of the end-customer, making customer interaction more 
      personal. The use of social tools within ERP software also increases the 
      degree of integration between co-workers, which in turn improves the 
      quality of information captured about customers. Moreover, inspired by 
      the Apple Application Store, SAP has introduced the ERP Application 
      Store. SAP has also added the ability for customers and partners to buy 
      and resell its Business One ERP software for smaller companies through 
      the store. Vendors such as SAP, NetSuite Inc., and Microsoft are 
      actively building application stores to provide smartphone access to ERP 
      data. ERP is being affected by mobility and the propagation of 
      smartphone apps and is focusing more on building out an ecosystem of 
      apps that will run with native functionality on both iPhone and Android.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one of the major drivers in the market is the 
      increasing demand for SaaS-based ERP software from SMEs. The pay-per-use 
      payment model of SaaS-based ERP is in synchronization with the business 
      objectives of SMEs, which has led to its increased adoption among them. 
      With SaaS-based ERP, the initial cost of implementation is minimal and 
      the customer pays according to the usage. Hence, the total cost of 
      ownership decreases to a great extent resulting in an increasing demand 
      from SMEs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges in this 
      market is the large number of open-source ERP vendors. With 
      technological developments, several open-source solutions have emerged, 
      posing stiff competition for commercial ERP systems. Open-source 
      software can be downloaded and run in all platforms. As the purchasing 
      and licensing costs of the commercial ERP systems are high, micro and 
      small-scale enterprises and individual users prefer open-source 
      products, which are freely available on the internet. Thus, the presence 
      of open-source ERP systems poses a threat to the Global ERP market.

&lt;p&gt;SANTO DOMINGO (Reuters) - The percentage of cocaine flowing to the United States through the Caribbean has more than tripled in the past three years, an Obama administration official said on Tuesday, adding weight to claims that criminal organizations are shifting back to a route they abandoned years ago.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 16 percent of drugs entered the United States through the islands, up from 5 percent in 2011, said William Brownfield, assistant Secretary of State for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs, during a conference call with reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That percentage would correlate to roughly 47 tons of cocaine. While that does not compare with the drug flow through Central America and Mexico, it has U.S. officials concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;I do not wish to suggest that the amount of product flowing through the Caribbean even remotely approaches the levels of Central America and Mexico,&#8221; Brownfield said. &#8220;The disturbing thing is the trend line. The trend line has us correctly concerned,&#8221; he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug shipments originate in Colombia and Venezuela and travel by "go-fast" boats and cargo ships to the islands, with Hispaniola, the island shared by the Dominican Republic and Haiti, serving as the most sought-after transshipment point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Dominican authorities seized nearly 10 tons of cocaine, topping the record amount it captured just a year earlier, according to the Attorney General&#8217;s office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in smuggling provides fresh evidence of the Obama administration&#8217;s forecast that the U.S.-Mexican counter-drug efforts would push drug traffickers back to the Caribbean, which served as the principal route for Colombia&#8217;s infamous Medellin cartel in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration in 2010 launched the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative, a regional security plan focused on cutting down on drug shipments. The State Department said it has committed more than $260 million to the initiative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But traffickers are becoming bolder, sending huge amounts of cocaine, often more than a ton at a time, officials said. Budget cuts have also left authorities increasingly ill-prepared to interdict the shipments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;Because of asset shortfalls, we&#8217;re unable to get after 74 percent of suspected maritime drug trafficking. I simply sit and watch it go by,&#8221; Marine General John F. Kelly said in a March Senate hearing. Kelly heads the Miami-based U.S. Southern Command, responsible for Latin America and the Caribbean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by David Adams and Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

      of June 24, 2014. Fitch does not expect to rate the $59,912,885 
      non-rated class, and the $74,302,885 interest-only class X-D.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The certificates represent the beneficial ownership in the trust, 
      primary assets of which are 73 loans secured by 84 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.26 billion as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were contributed to the trust by JPMorgan 
      Chase Bank, National Association; Barclays Bank PLC; MC-Five Mile 
      Commercial Mortgage Finance LLC; Starwood Mortgage Funding II LLC; and 
      RAIT Funding, LLC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch reviewed a comprehensive sample of the transaction's collateral, 
      including site inspections on 73.6% of the properties by balance, cash 
      flow analysis on 74.4%, and asset summary reviews on 74.4% of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction has a Fitch stressed debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) 
      of 1.13x, a Fitch stressed loan-to-value (LTV) of 108.5%, and a Fitch 
      debt yield of 9.47%. Fitch's aggregate net cash flow represents a 
      variance of 7.3% to issuer cash flows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Leverage: This transaction has higher leverage than other recent 
      Fitch-rated fixed-rate deals. The pool's Fitch LTV of 108.5% is higher 
      than the 2013 average of 101.6%. Excluding the credit opinion loan, the 
      pool's Fitch LTV is 110.3%. The pool's Fitch DSCR of 1.13x is below the 
      2013 average of 1.29x, although reflective of higher average mortgage 
      rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pool Concentration: The pool is diverse by loan size and sponsor as 
      compared to average transactions from 2013, as evidenced by a loan 
      concentration index (LCI) of 305 and sponsor concentration index (SCI) 
      of 391. Also, the 10 largest loans represent 45.5% of the total pool 
      balance, which is lower than the average 2013 top 10 concentration of 
      54.5%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Below-Average Amortization: Three of the top 10 loans are full-term 
      interest-only. As such, the pool has a significantly above-average 
      proportion of interest-only loans (24.3% of the pool balance versus the 
      2013 average of 17.1%) and above-average concentration of partial 
      interest loans (48.1% versus the 2013 average of 34%). The pool is 
      scheduled to amortize 9.81% prior to maturity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Credit Opinion Loan: The third largest loan in the pool, Miami 
      International Mall (4.7%), has a Fitch credit opinion 'BBB-sf' on a 
      stand-alone basis. The loan is collateralized by a super-regional mall 
      in Miami, FL. This loan participation is a $60 million, non-controlling 
      pari passu portion of a $160 million loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For this transaction, Fitch's net cash flow (NCF) was 6.6% below the 
      most recent NOI (for properties that a recent NOI was provided, 
      excluding properties that were stabilizing during this period). 
      Unanticipated further declines in property-level NCF could result in 
      higher defaults and loss severities on defaulted loans, and could result 
      in potential rating actions on the certificates. Fitch evaluated the 
      sensitivity of the ratings assigned to JPMBB 2014-C21 certificates and 
      found that the transaction displays average sensitivity to further 
      declines in NCF. In a scenario in which NCF declined a further 20% from 
      Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 'A-sf' 
      could result. In a more severe scenario, in which NCF declined a further 
      30% from Fitch's NCF, a downgrade of the junior 'AAAsf' certificates to 
      'BBBsf' could result.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The master servicer will be Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, 
      rated 'CMS1-' by Fitch. The special servicer will be Midland Loan 
      Services, Inc., rated 'CSS1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Criteria Application
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch property-level cash flow analysis, modeling assumptions, and 
      application of Fitch mortgage constants and cap rates were generally 
      consistent with Fitch Research on 'Criteria for Analyzing Multiborrower 
      U.S. Commercial Mortgage Transactions,' dated Aug. 7, 2013, available on 
      Fitch's website at www.fitchratings.com. 
      Updates to the published criteria were applied as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      -- For non-pari passu full-term IO conduit loans in this transaction, 
      the FC-DSCR is weighted 33.3% FT-DSCR and 66.7% FK-DSCR. In addition, 
      amortization credit has been increased for all amortizing loans. This 
      criteria update is based on recent regression testing which demonstrated 
      a more significant difference in the performance of amortizing versus 
      interest-only loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      -- The confidence interval for the 'AAAsf' rating category has been 
      increased from 99.990% to 99.995% and the confidence interval for the 
      'AAsf' rating category has been decreased from 99.920% to 99.880%. This 
      criteria update is based on an examination of tranche thickness and 
      implied loss coverage multiples as they compare to other structured 
      finance sectors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An updated version of the Criteria for Analyzing Multiborrower U.S. 
      Commercial Mortgage Transactions containing a detailed description and 
      examples of the updates mentioned above is anticipated to be published 
      in June 2014. The presale report is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'.

      Research and Markets: Global Managed Security Services Market 2014-2018 
      with ATT, Dell, IBM, Symantec  Verizon Communications Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/q6qqx4/global_managed) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Managed Security Services Market 2014-2018" report to their 
      offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Global Managed Security Services market will grow at a CAGR of 
      16.52% during the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers is the need to improve the quality of 
      protection. Because of the increase in the frequency of attacks, 
      organizations are implementing managed security services that help in 
      monitoring and providing better protection. The quality of protection 
      can also be enhanced by outsourcing security responsibilities to MSSPs 
      that have core expertise in this field. Hence, more end-users are 
      adopting managed security services, a trend which is propelling the 
      growth of the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the various advantages of adopting cloud services such as lower 
      cost and ease of installation and operations, SMEs prefer cloud services 
      to other security service offerings. Also, even large enterprises that 
      are already using CPE-based managed security services are switching to 
      the cloud model. Thus, seeing the increasing demand for and increased 
      popularity of cloud-based offerings, many vendors in the Global Managed 
      Security Services market are offering cloud-based services. For 
      instance, specialized cloud service providers such as MessageLabs (part 
      of Symantec), Postini (acquired by Google Inc.), and Zscaler provide 
      in-the-cloud security.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges faced by the 
      market is the high cost of implementation. Despite the potential 
      benefits, certain organizations refrain from investing in managed 
      security services because of the high costs associated with it. Also, 
      there are certain hidden costs involved in the maintenance of managed 
      security services. This will make end-users reluctant to adopt them, 
      thus affecting the growth of the market.

      Networks, NEC, NetApp, Rittal  Schneider Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/253dkb/data_center) 
      has announced the addition of the "Data 
      Center Market in Singapore 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Data Center market in Singapore will grow at a CAGR of 11.50% over 
      the period 2013-2018.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the major drivers is the rapid growth in digital content being 
      transmitted across enterprise networks. Increasing digital content 
      requires increased computational capacity and storage capacity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Energy efficiency and data center performance are gaining higher 
      importance in the working of any data center facility. Those data center 
      service providers and enterprises having their own data center 
      facilities are facing various restrictions and regulations imposed by 
      the regulatory authorities on maintaining minimum performance levels in 
      the facilities. The data center facilities are being equipped with 
      precision air conditioning equipment and high-performance computing 
      equipment which consumes lower power and delivers high-performance 
      computing. Many data center monitoring and management solutions are also 
      being incorporated as part of the data center facility, which enables 
      the network administrators to optimize the performance of the entire 
      facility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the high 
      cost of labor that is affecting the operational costs associated with 
      data center facilities. Singapore is a small nation and is currently 
      experiencing very high labor costs. Further, the country is also 
      experiencing a very high rate of inflation that is leading to higher 
      expenditure on establishing and maintaining the facilities.

      Research and Markets: China Color Cosmetics Market 2014-2018 with L'Oral 
      SA, Mary Kay, Procter  Gamble  Shiseido Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/9tsnx4/color_cosmetics) 
      has announced the addition of the "Color 
      Cosmetics Market in China 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Color Cosmetics market in China can be segmented into four 
      divisions: Skin Cosmetics, Lip Cosmetics, Eye Cosmetics, and Nail 
      Cosmetics. These are categories for which specific color cosmetics are 
      manufactured.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The penetration of online retailing in China has opened new growth 
      prospects for color cosmetics vendors. Online retail stores are gaining 
      popularity as they offer the convenience of shopping without time or 
      location constraints. They also enhance interactivity between buyers and 
      sellers. Sellers are able to communicate considerable information about 
      their products through this channel, while simultaneously achieving 
      cost-efficiency and ease of distribution. There are various mediums such 
      as online agents or retail portals, company owned websites, and B2C 
      platforms through which color cosmetics are available to consumers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, one main driver is the improving quality of 
      life for Chinese consumers. Consumers' growing disposable incomes and 
      adoption of western lifestyles has led to increasing spending on color 
      cosmetic products, thereby driving sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that the impact of stringent government

      customers a specialized drink that complements the flavor of their 
      southwestern, made-to-order meals.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The sleek, stylish fountains are touch screen operated, enabling 
      consumers to select from more than 100 regular and low-calorie beverage 
      brands &#8211; including more than 70 diet , low-calorie and caffeine-free

      and sparkling beverages that, prior to the arrival of Coca-Cola 
      Freestyle, were not available in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates J.P. Morgan Taxable HFA Trust, Series 2014-1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned the following rating to one class of 
      certificates issued by J.P. Morgan Taxable HFA Trust, series 2014-1:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$28,666,756 class A certificates 'AAAsf', Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction represents a pass-through of all proceeds received in 
      respect of the underlying mortgage revenue bond (MRB) owned by the 
      trust. The rating is based on the credit quality of the MRB.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Proceeds from the certificate issuance were used to purchase the MRB 
      issued by the Indiana Housing and Community Development Authority 
      (IHCDA). The MRB is collateralized by Ginnie Mae (GNMA) and Fannie Mae 
      (FNMA) securities. The MRB is rated 'AAA' by Fitch based on the GNMA and 
      FNMA guarantee of full and timely payment of principal and interest on 
      its securities. The GNMA guarantee is backed by the rating of the U.S. 
      treasury, which carries the sovereign rating of the United States of 
      America (rated 'AAA/F1+' by Fitch). The FNMA guaranty is not backed by 
      the U.S. treasury, however, the FNMA rating is linked is currently 
      linked to the U.S. sovereign rating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Payments on the certificates will be made monthly and will consist of 
      interest and principal payments received from the underlying MRB. The 
      underlying MRB pays a coupon of 4.050%. The certificates will receive 
      interest equal to 4.00% per annum. The transaction is structured to 
      pass-through all interest and principal proceeds after paying a 0.050% 
      (p.a.) trustee fee and any extraordinary expenses that are incurred. 
      Extraordinary expenses incurred by the trustee are capped at $150,000 
      per year, and any excess extraordinary expense amount incurred by the 
      trustee is to be paid the following year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction relies, to a lesser extent, on a series of 
      counterparties to perform particular roles, including the trustee (U.S. 
      Bank National Association; rated 'AA-/F1+', Outlook Stable by Fitch) and 
      the bank at which the certificate account is established (also U.S. Bank 
      National Association). All distributions from the underlying MRB are 
      deposited into the certificate account where they are held un-invested 
      and are subsequently withdrawn by the trustee prior to each payment 
      date. The certificate account is a segregated account held in trust for 
      the benefit of the certificate holders. In its role as both issuer 
      account bank and trustee, U.S. Bank National Association satisfies the 
      eligibility criteria described in Fitch's 'Counterparty Criteria for 
      Structured Finance and Covered Bonds'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction is established as a grantor trust for federal income tax 
      purposes. Each beneficial owner of the certificates will be treated for 
      federal income tax purposes as owning an undivided interest in each 
      asset held in the trust. To the extent interest on the underlying MRBs 
      is subject to federal income taxation, the portion thereof received by 
      each beneficial owner of a certificate will also be subject to federal 
      income taxation. Fitch has received and reviewed legal opinions 
      addressing the true sale of the underlying MRBs to the trust, the 
      classification of the trust as a grantor trust for federal income tax 
      purposes, and the enforceability of the transaction documents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Any rating action on the underlying MRB will directly affect the rating 
      of the certificates. The MRB rating is currently linked to the U.S. 
      sovereign rating, any rating action on the U.S. sovereign rating will 
      directly affect the rating of the certificates. Further, should Fitch's 
      view of the strength of government support for FNMA be reduced or 
      downgraded, the rating of FNMA may be delinked from the U.S. sovereign 
      rating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The CUSIP for the underlying IHCDA MRB is 454807AE8. For additional

      Research and Markets: IT Market in Canada 2014-2018 with Cisco Systems 
      Inc, Hewlett-Packard Co., IBM Corp, Microsoft Corp Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/7v72tg/it_market_in) 
      has announced the addition of the "IT 
      Market in Canada 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IT Market in Canada can be segmented into three divisions: Hardware. 
      Software and IT Services. The report also covers the IT spending across 
      key end-user segments. The report also discusses the IT spending by the 
      key regions in Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Many factors drive the growth of the IT market in Canada. One such 
      driver is the increased government initiatives to support the IT market 
      in the country. For instance, in Ottawa, most major government offices 
      have adopted cloud computing solutions. Institutions in other parts of 
      Canada are expected to follow suit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Canada lags behinds the US and other advanced markets in cloud 
      computing. More SMBs are adopting cloud-based technologies compared to 
      large companies, especially in the Government sector and Healthcare and 
      BFSI industries because of the minimal IT personnel and infrastructure 
      requirement. However, even though SMBs understand the long-term benefits 
      of cloud computing, only a few have adopted it because of the high costs 
      associated with shifting to cloud-based technology such as moving data 
      to the cloud, network bandwidth costs, multiple vendor application 
      integration costs, and software testing costs. Some benefits of cloud 
      computing include increased flexibility of IT processes, economies of 
      scale, accessibility to data anytime and anywhere, and low IT 
      infrastructure spending.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 25 (Reuters) - U.S prosecutors in Manhattan
unsealed an indictment on Wednesday against two men they said
participated in a ring of information-sharing that led to
illegal trading in a technology company acquired by IBM 
in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Daryl Payton Jr. and Benjamin Durant III were arrested on
Wednesday morning, a spokesman for the Federal Bureau of
Investigation said. Each faces five counts of securities fraud
and one count of conspiracy to commit securities fraud,
according to the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters could not reach the two men for comment because they
were in federal custody. Their lawyers could not immediately be
identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three people have already admitted to sharing and trading on
secret information provided by a corporate lawyer working on
IBM's purchase of the software maker SPSS Inc in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Court filings show that prosecutors tacked Wednesday's
indictment onto the earlier case, in which the lawyer shared
information about the SPSS deal with his friend, Trent Martin,
an analyst working for the Royal Bank of Scotland, who
in turn told his roommate, Thomas Conradt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conradt and another trader at his firm, Euro Pacific Capital
Inc of Westport, Connecticut, bought call options on SPSS before
IBM's bid was announced. Martin, Conradt and the other trader,
David Weishaus, pleaded guilty to charges related to the trades
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payton and Durant were also working for Euro Pacific at the
time of the trading, according to public records kept by the
Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. FINRA records show that
they left Euro Pacific Capital at the same time the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission informed the firm it was
investigating the two men for options trades they made. The firm
is not named in the indictment, which describes it as
"Securities Trading Firm-1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's indictment said Conradt tipped Durant and Payton
to the SPSS deal and the two bought call options on SPSS. Euro
Pacific's compliance department noticed the trades and opened an
internal investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked how he came to trade in SPSS stock, Durant said
he had heard about SPSS while researching investment
opportunities on Fidelity.com, according to the indictment.
Payton said he had heard about the stock from Durant. They then
refused to answer further questions about the trades and were
fired, according to the indictment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is US v. Benjamin Durant and Daryl Payton, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 12-cr-00887.

			Vioguard Procures Patent Portfolio from Microsoft 
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vioguard LLC (www.vioguard.com) 
      announced that it has finalized a patent sale agreement with Microsoft 
      Corporation (MSFT).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The agreement included the sale of two U.S. patents for sterilizing 
      surfaces on input devices by Microsoft to Vioguard. The patents are for 
      disinfecting surfaces such as computer keyboards, touchscreens and 
      miscellaneous input devices. The specific terms of the agreement are 
      confidential.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The acquisition of these patents allows Vioguard to broaden our lead in 
      the ultraviolet disinfection arena," said Laurance Ranta, President and 
      Chief Executive Officer of Vioguard. &#8220;We are pleased to enter into this 
      agreement with Microsoft.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vioguard's keyboard uses high power germicidal ultraviolet light, 
      otherwise known as UV-C, at 254 nm wavelength. The keyboard uses UV-C 
      lamps with a reflector and diffuser to distribute the light evenly. 
      Based on published data, this level of UV-C will kill more than 99.99% 
      of harmful microorganisms such as MRSA, mold, and other contaminants 
      within seconds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Transformative technologies, such as those involved here, are made 
      possible by a patent system that incentivizes innovation and research,&#8221; 
      said Nick Psyhogeos, general manager, associate general counsel, IP 
      licensing of the Innovation and Intellectual Property Group at 
      Microsoft. &#8220;We&#8217;re pleased to sell these patents to Vioguard as they 
      bring their UVC solution to the market."

		&lt;h1&gt;The SmartMetric Case in the Federal Circuit Court Against Defendants, MasterCard International and Visa Inc for Claimed Patent Infringement of a SmartMetric Issued Patent Is to Be Heard on August 8, 2014&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Jun 25, 2014) - SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCQB: SMME) -- The Federal Circuit Court has scheduled hearing of the patent infringement case, SmartMetric vs MasterCard International and Visa Inc. for August 8th, 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric is seeking a ruling from the Court that both MasterCard and Visa have and are currently infringing the SmartMetric issued patent that covers data cards that are inserted into readers that then cause an automatic connection to a network.&#160;SmartMetric is claiming that the new EMV chip cards used and introduced into the United States by Visa and MasterCard are such data cards that are described in the SmartMetric patent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"SmartMetric is welcoming its case being heard in August and is looking forward to the panel of three Judges, who are all expert in patent law, examining the facts of the SmartMetric case against the payments card companies, Visa and MasterCard," said the President  CEO&#160;Chaya Hendrick.&#160;"SmartMetric is also seeking the Court to find that the defendants,&#160;Visa and MasterCard,&#160;be held liable to pay a royalty to SmartMetric of 25% of the economic benefit flowing from the use of the SmartMetric technology calculated on the value of fraud reduction from the use of the new EMV chip cards," she added.&#160;Earlier Court filings have put the patent infringement claim against Visa Inc and MasterCard International at $13.4 Billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric is a publicly traded technology company that has added a fingerprint scanner built inside EMV payment credit and debit chip cards thereby creating a second layer biometric authentication protection in defending against card fraud. The company is now actively marketing its technology to card issuing financial institutions around the world. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About SmartMetric, Inc. 
				SmartMetric, Inc. is a technology company that designs and engineers its own advanced products utilizing the company's expertise in miniaturizing electronics.

		&lt;h1&gt;Get the Level of Identity Management Your Campus NEEDS for Microsoft(R) Office 365&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;BEDFORD, NH--(Marketwired - Jun 25, 2014) - Today, PistolStar, Inc. announced the integration of its PortalGuard product with Office 365. This integration will give administrators the power to choose the level of convenience and security they desire for their students and faculty while accessing Office 365, including:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-Self Service Password Reset (SSPR)
        -Single Sign-on (SSO)
        -Two-factor Authentication&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With PortalGuard integrated with Office 365, schools now get the level of identity management they need. Gregg Browinski, CTO of PistolStar, Inc., comments on the level of identity management and security with PortalGuard: "Using Office 365 guarantees 99.9% uptime for your campus email infrastructure, but this benefit is moot if students forget their passwords and can't login. Federating Office 365 with a local ADFS instance can allow SSO but this just pushes a 'forgotten password' scenario further back to the desktop login and still lacks stronger two-factor authentication or self-service password reset options." Browinski continues, "Swapping PortalGuard in place of ADFS in this architecture can provide standards-based web SSO and highly flexible SSPR from a single, tightly integrated, brandable, login interface."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using PortalGuard's SSPR, students and faculty are given the power to reset their passwords from the web or desktop, reducing help desk calls and increasing ROI. SSO streamlines the login and reduces the barriers to access; with just a single login, the students and faculty gain access to all of their authorized applications, including: Blackboard, Moodle, Canvas, Banner, Google Apps, and Office 365. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PortalGuard provides you with the level of identity management your campus needs.

      jobs, with a focus on career pathways

		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Continuing its commitment to workforce readiness and helping underserved 
      youth obtain the skills necessary to build lasting careers, JPMorgan 
      Chase  Co. (NYSE:JPM) today announced a commitment of $5 million over 
      the next two years to summer youth employment initiatives across the 
      U.S. This commitment expects to fund summer jobs for more than 4,000 
      teenagers and young adults as well as learning opportunities in the 
      fields of science, technology, engineering, arts and math for 20,000 13- 
      to 24-year-olds. The firm&#8217;s employees will also volunteer their time 
      with nonprofit partners to provide financial capability coaching 
      sessions and introductory coding skills training to participating youth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is prioritizing youth employment 
      as one of the key issues for her work at the Clinton Foundation, 
      announced JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Commitment to Action at the 2014 Clinton 
      Global Initiative America meeting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Great American companies are committing to expanding training, hiring, 
      and mentoring youth, and to encourage other businesses to step up as 
      well,&#8221; said Former Secretary Hillary Rodham Clinton. &#8220;JPMorgan Chase 
      will invest $5 million over the next two years to fund 4,000 summer jobs 
      in 14 cities and to offer work readiness opportunities to another 20,000 
      young people.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Peter L. Scher, Executive Vice President and Head of Corporate 
      Responsibility for JPMorgan Chase, joined Secretary Clinton in Denver 
      for the announcement. Scher said, &#8220;Ensuring that young people have the 
      skills they need to succeed is a national priority. JPMorgan Chase is 
      proud to work with the Clinton Foundation, city leaders and nonprofit 
      partners to train and employ our youth. Investing in skills is the right 
      thing for their future and for the future of our country.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2014, the firm is working with mayors, nonprofit organizations and 
      other private sector employers in 14 cities &#8211; Chicago, Dallas, Detroit, 
      Jacksonville, Jersey City, Los Angeles, Louisville, Miami, Milwaukee, 
      New York City, Oakland, San Francisco, Seattle and St. Louis &#8211; to engage 
      youth during their summer break to help expand employment among young 
      adults and provide opportunities for at-risk youth to develop skills 
      that will put them on a career pathway.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I appreciate JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s support and participation in the Mayor&#8217;s 
      Intern Fellows Program,&#8221; Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said.&#160;&#8220;Together 
      we&#8217;re helping our children learn and build a r&#233;sum&#233; to take out into the 
      world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;JPMorgan Chase continues to be a great partner in Detroit's turnaround 
      by investing in our community and in our youth,&#8221; said Detroit Mayor Mike 
      Duggan. &#8220;By providing meaningful summer work for&#160;1,000 Detroit students 
      this year and next, JPMorgan Chase&#160;will provide them a great opportunity 
      to get&#160;started on a real&#160;career path. This will be a significant&#160;boost 
      to&#160;our commitment to provide summer jobs to 5,000 Detroit students&#160;next 
      summer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are investing in the future success of San Francisco&#8217;s young people 
      by providing more than 7,000 jobs and paid internships for them this 
      summer with a special focus on serving low-income and disadvantaged 
      youth,&#8221; said San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee. &#8220;I thank JPMorgan Chase for 
      joining me on Summer Jobs Plus as we invest in the future success of our 
      City&#8217;s youth this summer and beyond.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Several programs will focus on providing skills-based jobs, internships 
      and learning opportunities for teenagers and young adults in their 
      respective cities and continue beyond the summer months. These programs 
      will expose youth to careers early on, connect them to growth sectors, 
      help them obtain marketable skills and teach them how to manage their 
      finances. Below are a few examples of programs JPMorgan Chase is 
      supporting in 2014:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Summer 
        of Learning and Earning will provide more than 215,000 
        opportunities for Chicago&#8217;s youth, ages 14-24, including 22,000 
        skill-building jobs and internships and interactive learning 
        activities in libraries, schools, museums and cultural institutions, 
        colleges and universities, and community-based programs, as well as 
        through self-paced, online modules.
      
			
				Mayor&#8217;s 
        Intern Fellows Program in Dallas will place more than 300 public 
        high school students in summer positions at some of the city&#8217;s top 
        health, technology and energy companies and nonprofits &#8211; three of the 
        area&#8217;s highest-growth sectors. Now in its seventh year, the Mayor&#8217;s 
        office and Education is Freedom will have placed 1,050 students in 
        internships across industry sectors, including technology, healthcare, 
        law, accounting, business, education, the nonprofit sector, 
        advertising/marketing/public relations, engineering, banking, 
        manufacturing and hospitality, by the end of this summer.
      
			
				Grow 
        Detroit&#8217;s Young Talent will provide 1,000 Detroit youth, ages 
        14-24, employment readiness training and six weeks of paid summer work 
        experiences with area employers. The program was created by the 
        Detroit Youth Employment Consortium in 2009 to address high rates of 
        unemployment among Detroit&#8217;s teen and young adult populations &#8211; 
        unemployment estimated at more than 50 percent. The program has grown 
        each year, providing more than 5,000 Detroit youth with paid summer 
        work experiences since 2009.
      
			
        United Way of Northeast Florida&#8217;s Summer 
        Youth Employment Program will provide 140 students in Jacksonville 
        with a six-week paid internship at top organizations, helping them 
        acquire high-demand skills, gain access to mentors and coaches, and 
        build their resumes. Youth will also participate in a financial 
        management simulation lab, which will help them learn how to manage 
        their paycheck and personal finances.
      
			
				Los 
        Angeles Summer of Learning will bring together a coalition of 
        public, private and nonprofit partners and offer education programs 
        and activities through the city&#8217;s parks, libraries, schools, museums 
        and cultural institutions. The curriculum will offer learning 
        opportunities in science, technology, engineering, arts and math, as 
        well as a work-readiness pathway geared towards the skills needed to 
        succeed in the modern economy.
      
			
        Three nonprofits in New York City, PENCIL, 
        Futures 
        and Options, and Virtual 
        Enterprises International, will create and sponsor a total of 140 
        paid internships for underserved high school students. PENCIL will 
        also provide career readiness training to an additional 130 students. 
        Program participants will be introduced to career opportunities, 
        motivated to pursue higher education, and equipped with skills to 
        succeed in the workforce.
      
			
				Summer 
        Jobs+ will connect 7,000 disconnected and at-risk youth (ages 
        14-24) with paid jobs, internships and job training initiatives in the 
        private sector and San Francisco City departments. Since it started in 
        2012, Summer Jobs+ has placed more than 12,000 youth in paid summer 
        jobs and internships. This year, the program expands to include 
        placing individuals in employment and training opportunities beyond 
        the summer.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      To further complement summer youth employment, JPMorgan Chase is 
      supporting the expansion of the Consumer Federation of America&#8217;s America 
      Saves First-time 
      Workers Program. This program will help young workers establish good 
      financial habits as they start earning their first paychecks. 
      Participants will learn how to set up direct deposit, establish savings 
      goals and receive relevant financial education.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This commitment to youth employment is in addition to the five-year, 
      $250 million global economic opportunity initiative, New 
      Skills at Work, launched in late 2013. New Skills at Work 
      is a global workforce readiness and demand-driven training initiative. 
      It aims to address the skills gap that exists across many industries, 
      such as healthcare and advanced manufacturing, where not enough trained 
      workers have the skills needed to fill available jobs.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Research and Markets: Global Storage Software Market 2014-2018 with EMC 
      Corp., IBM Corp., NetApp Inc.  Symantec Corp Dominating
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/whqh86/global_storage) 
      has announced the addition of the "Global 
      Storage Software Market 2014-2018" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Several factors drive the growth of the Global Storage Software market, 
      one of which is the rise in demand for storage virtualization. 
      Virtualization enables additional features and better functionality 
      within a storage system. Virtualization and categorized storage 
      solutions together allow an organization to strategically coordinate and 
      manage their business applications within the storage infrastructure. 
      Storage virtualization allows non-disruptive data migrations and storage 
      partitioning to confine different workloads.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Storage software is an effective tool used by enterprises to improve the 
      control and management of storage hardware devices and networks. Storage 
      software comprises all software products that are used for efficient 
      data management and data storage in the enterprise infrastructure. 
      Storage software can be used for device management, data transmission, 
      data security, data recovery, backup, and retrieval of data. 
      Organizations are increasingly investing in storage software because of 
      the increasing number of servers, branches, and data they need to 
      manage. In addition, storage software also supports the duplication and 
      copying of data as soon as it is created or downloaded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Enterprise storage infrastructure has flash memory storage because of 
      its plug-and-play feature. Enterprises implement arrays of hot-spare 
      disks, which allow storage disks to be plugged in and out as and when 
      required. This feature enables easier and faster scalability of the 
      network storage infrastructure. The use of flash storage segments also 
      simplifies the archiving of enterprise data. In addition, a flash 
      storage software has an inbuilt feature that automatically backs up data 
      at regular intervals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the report states that one of the major challenges is the lack 
      of structured storage infrastructure. Huge volumes of data are stored by 
      enterprises and used as and when required. This data is important during 
      the decision making processes. However, the lack of structured 
      infrastructure can lead to financial losses for organizations.

			General Electric Company to Be Lead Research Sponsor at New 
      University of Notre Dame Technology Center
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The University of Notre Dame, along with GE and four other public 
      entities, are collaborating on a $36 million project to create a unique 
      research and testing center to advance the technology of gas turbine 
      engines used for jet aircraft, power generation plants, and the oil and 
      gas industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GE has committed $13.5 million over the next five years to fund research 
      at the Notre Dame Turbomachinery Facility, which was unveiled today in 
      South Bend, Indiana. The GE industrial operations to be involved in gas 
      turbine research and testing at the new center are Aviation, Power  
      Water, Oil  Gas, and Global Research.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Construction on the 25,000-square-foot center, to be located at the 
      city&#8217;s Ignition Park, will begin this summer, with completion slated for 
      March 2015. The university-staffed center, which features five new test 
      bays for compressor and turbine rig testing, is expected to be fully 
      operational in July 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The center will allow GE&#8217;s industrial businesses to simulate full-scale 
      engine operating environments,&#8221; said Rick Stanley, vice president and 
      chief technologist for GE&#8217;s Power  Water business, and himself, a Notre 
      Dame graduate. &#8220;The important rig testing we will do at the center 
      builds upon GE&#8217;s already strong and longstanding technical relationship 
      with the university. For years, GE has turned to Notre Dame for top 
      technical talent.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Approximately 450 Notre Dame graduates are employed across GE&#8217;s 
      businesses. Over the past decade, GE&#8217;s industrial businesses have 
      already conducted about $10 million in research and testing at Notre 
      Dame.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since 2003, Notre Dame&#8217;s current Turbomachinery Laboratory has 
      collaborated with industry and government to advance gas turbine engine 
      technologies. The new Turbomachinery Facility will expand this effort by 
      testing engine components at pressures and temperatures higher than any 
      at current U.S. university facilities. Notre Dame will use the new 
      facility to advance current working relationships with both government 
      sponsors and all manufacturers of gas-turbine engines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Notre Dame will contribute $7.5 million to the project. In addition to 
      GE, other contributors include: the city of South Bend with matching 
      funds exceeding $4.4 million, the state of Indiana, through the Indiana 
      Economic Development Corp., which is providing $2.6 million for training 
      and an Industrial Development grant; Great Lakes Capital, which is 
      providing approximately $6 million to construct the facility; and AEP, 
      which will build a substation, valued at $2 million, to provide the 
      considerable power needed to operate the facility&#8217;s multiple test cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      When fully operational, the new facility will provide about 60 new jobs 
      to directly operate the facility. An additional 60 jobs are expected 
      through the growth of local suppliers to support the facility&#8217;s need for 
      precision manufactured components. At full operation, research 
      expenditures generated through work conducted at ND Turbo are expected 
      to exceed $15 million annually.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades 3 Classes of JPMC 2003-CIBC6
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded three classes and affirmed eight classes of 
      JP Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMC) commercial 
      mortgage pass-through certificates series 2003-CIBC6. A detailed list of 
      rating actions follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades to classes F through H are the result of interest 
      shortfalls currently affecting these classes as well as the continued 
      risk of interest shortfalls should additional loans transfer to the 
      special servicer. Current interest shortfalls are predominantly related 
      to the $3 million Essex Centre loan which had approximately $715,000 in 
      property protection advances (PPAs) from a modification while with the 
      special servicer. The loan has since transferred back to the master 
      servicer; however, approximately $465,000 in PPAs has been recouped in 
      May and June 2014 and, per the master servicer, the remaining $250,000 
      will be recaptured in July 2014. Fitch will not assign or maintain 
      'AAAsf' or 'AAsf' ratings for bonds that it believes have a high level 
      of vulnerability to interest shortfalls and will generally only consider 
      'Asf' or 'BBBsf' ratings for bonds that are not expected to incur 
      interest shortfalls. See 'Criteria for Rating Caps and Limitations in 
      Global Structured Finance Transactions', dated May 28, 2014, for more 
      details.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although these classes have high credit enhancement due to amortization 
      and loan payoffs, several larger loans are underperforming and may 
      transfer to the special servicer. As limited upcoming paydown is 
      expected due to many loans' longer terms, additional interest shortfalls 
      may affect these classes in the future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations are based sufficient credit enhancement to support the 
      current ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch modeled losses of 15% of the remaining pool, including $13 million 
      (1.2% of the original pool balance) in realized losses to date. Fitch 
      has designated 11 loans (61.4%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which 
      includes three specially serviced assets (14.8%). As of the June 2014 
      distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal balance has been 
      reduced by 88.8% to $119.5 million from $1.06 billion at issuance. Per 
      the servicer reporting, three loans (7.3% of the pool) are defeased. 
      Interest shortfalls are currently affecting classes F through NR. Of the 
      original 128 loans, only 21 remain. Of the non-specially serviced 
      assets, no loans are scheduled to mature until 2017.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to expected losses is secured by a 102,310 
      square foot (SF) suburban office property located in Cherry Hill, NJ 
      (5.6% of the pool). The property experienced cash flow issues when its 
      largest tenant, Campbell Soup Co. (previously 30% of the net rentable 
      area [NRA]), vacated at its lease expiration. The loan transferred to 
      special servicing in January 2013 for imminent maturity default, 
      followed shortly thereafter by the maturity of the loan in May 2013 
      without repayment. The lender completed foreclosure in September 2013 
      and the property is now real estate owned (REO). Occupancy was reported 
      at 28% as of April 2014. The special servicer is working to lease up the 
      vacant space and stabilize the property prior to disposition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to expected losses is secured by a 231,242 
      SF suburban office building located in Southfield, MI (5% of the pool). 
      The loan transferred to special servicing in March 2013 for imminent 
      maturity default, followed shortly thereafter by the maturity of the 
      loan in May 2013 without repayment. The servicer had reported that the 
      borrower indicated difficulty in obtaining take-out financing due to the 
      property's low occupancy, which was 71% as of September 2013, as well as 
      poor market conditions for Detroit. The servicer is pursuing foreclosure 
      as well as evaluating borrower proposals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rating Outlooks on classes C through H are Stable due to increasing 
      credit enhancement and continued paydown. The Rating Outlook on class J 
      is Negative as the class may be subject to a downgrade if there is 
      further deterioration to the pool's cash flow performance and/or a 
      decrease in value of the specially serviced loans. Additional downgrades 
      to the distressed classes (those rated below 'B') are expected as losses 
      are realized.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades the following classes and removes them from Rating 
      Watch Negative:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$10.4 million class F to 'Asf' from 'AAsf'; assigns Stable Outlook;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$13 million class G to 'BBBsf' from 'Asf'; assigns Stable Outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades the following class and revises the Rating Outlook as 
      indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$15.6 million class H to 'BBsf' from 'BBBsf'; Outlook to Stable from 
      Negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes and assigns Recovery Estimates (RE) 
      as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$25.9 million class C at 'AAAsf'; Outlook Stable;

		&lt;/h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;MILWAUKEE, WI--(Marketwired - Jun 26, 2014) - Cloud-based communications provider, CorvisaCloud, LLC., today announced that it is investing in ManyWho, a San-Francisco-based cloud workflow company that helps businesses build powerful enterprise applications on multiple platforms. CorvisaCloud will also embed ManyWho's workflow technology into its CorvisaOne&#8482; contact center software products and platform, giving organizations an easy-to-use yet sophisticated communications tool that enhances and standardizes customer experiences across the board. Salesforce.com is also an investor in ManyWho. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CorvisaCloud's investment in ManyWho comes on the heels of $30 million in funding from Novation Companies, Inc. (OTCQB: NOVC). The funding is earmarked for expanding CorvisaCloud's sales, marketing and operational development efforts. The partnership with ManyWho will allow CorvisaCloud to invest in an innovative technology that complements its platform offering. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were looking at other investors but felt CorvisaCloud's leadership, culture and vision were a great match," said Steve Wood, co-founder and CEO of ManyWho. "We're excited to be partnering with CorvisaCloud not only in the investment capacity but also as an integrated partner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The integration of ManyWho's workflow technology will allow CorvisaCloud to provide dynamic call scripting to its customers to increase flexibility, efficiency and better meet customers' needs.&#160;The technology will offer call center agents a more visual and automated approach to engaging with customers, helping organizations to deliver information quickly and efficiently while creating a more personal experience for each customer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After looking at similar products, we believe ManyWho's technology is the best in the market in terms of sophistication and ease of use and we see strong growth potential," said CorvisaCloud President Matt Lautz. "We feel their product and vision will further extend the customization capabilities offered by our open platform and also help us to more effectively deliver on specific call scripting features that our customers want."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ManyWho technology will be embedded directly in the CorvisaOne contact center product suite and development platform and can be used to seamlessly create dynamic call scripts that can be shared across the organization to standardize service techniques. Once built, call center agents will be automatically prompted with questions and workflow models in real time to deliver the appropriate information to customers and achieve maximum productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ManyWho makes it easy for organizations to build workflow applications using drag and drop flow diagrams. The platform enables the use of these workflow applications across mobile, tablet, web, portal and desktop devices. The result is that customers of the ManyWho platform can focus on automating their workflows without worrying about the underlying systems architecture needed to support them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About CorvisaCloud
        CorvisaCloud brings customer success to the heart of every business interaction through our cloud-based communications software platform and consulting services. We help businesses work smarter, save money, and make customers happier...and with our passion for service, we make getting there an enjoyable experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, June 26 (Reuters) - Couchbase, a company that
helps companies deal with the vast troves of data scattered
around the Internet, said on Thursday it raised $60 million,
further enabling it take on incumbents such as Oracle Corp
 and Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The company, whose name is a combination of related
technologies known as CouchDB and Membase, helps companies store
data in a way that makes it work better with cutting-edge
applications and other Internet innovations. Those are the
task-specific software programs that increasing numbers of
consumers use multiple times each day, often on theit mobile
phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of database system developed by Couchbase, known
as NoSQL, is displacing older types of database systems such as
Oracle's MySQL and Microsoft SQL. The newer systems offer more
flexibility than the older ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending around NoSQL technology, including on software
development, license fees, and hardware, should reach $3.4
billion by 2020, according to consultancy Market Research Media
Ltd, up from less than $1 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Couchbase competitors include MongoDB, which has raised $231
million from venture firms such as Union Square and Sequoia
Capital, and DataStax, which has raised $84 million from backers
such as Meritech Capital and Lightspeed Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New backers in Couchbase's latest funding round include
WestSummit, whose partner Raymond Yang will join Couchbase's
board, and Accel Growth. Another family of funds from Accel had
previously invested in Couchbase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Existing investors include Adams Street Partners, Ignition
Partners, Mayfield Fund, and North Bridge Venture Partners.
Couchbase has raised $115 million since its founding in 2009,
and counts businesses such as music service Beats and retailer
Wal-Mart Stores Inc among its customers.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The 'AAAsf' rating on the senior certificates reflects the 5.55% 
      subordination provided by the 2.55% class B-1, 1.15% class B-2, 0.85% 
      class B-3, 0.40% class B-4 and 0.60% class B-5. The $1,823,213 class B-5 
      certificates will not be rated by Fitch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch's ratings reflect the high quality of the underlying collateral, 
      the clear capital structure and the high percentage of loans reviewed by 
      third party due diligence companies. In addition, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. 
      will act as the master servicer and U.S. Bank Trust N.A. will act as the 
      trustee for the transaction. For federal income tax purposes, elections 
      will be made to treat the trust as one or more real estate mortgage 
      investment conduits (REMICs).

		&lt;p&gt;
      This transaction includes the use of Pentalpha Surveillance LLC 
      (Pentalpha) as representation  warranties (RW) breach reviewer for the 
      benefit of the trust. The securities administrator will instruct 
      Pentalpha to review any loan that satisfies the review trigger. 
      Pentalpha will review the loan using the breach determination review 
      procedures outlined in the transaction documents to identify failures 
      with respect to one or more of the breach determination procedures. If a 
      failure exists, Pentalpha will determine whether or not the failure is 
      material, based on materiality conditions outlined in the transaction 
      documents. Pentalpha will then provide the final results of its review 
      and determination to the securities administrator.

      JPMMT 2014-2 will be J.P. Morgan Mortgage Acquisition Corp.'s second 
      transaction of prime residential mortgages in 2014. The certificates are 
      supported by a pool of prime 15-year fixed-rate fully amortizing 
      mortgage loans. The aggregate pool included loans originated from First 
      Republic Bank (55.1%), J.P. Morgan Chase Bank (38.2%) and other various 
      mortgage lending institutions, each of which contributed less than 5% to 
      the transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the cut-off date, the aggregate pool consisted of 544 loans with a 
      total balance of $303,748,213; an average balance of $558,361; a 
      weighted average original combined loan-to-value ratio (CLTV) of 63.7%, 
      and a weighted average coupon (WAC) of 3.7%. Rate/Term and cash out 
      refinances account for 33.5% and 38% of the loans, respectively. The 
      weighted average original FICO credit score of the pool is 767. 
      Owner-occupied properties comprise 62.9% of the loans. The states that 
      represent the largest geographic concentration are California (49%), New 
      York (10.8%) and Texas (7.5%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Borrower Concentration Risk: Approximately 12% of the pool consists of 
      borrowers with more than one mortgage loan, half of which have more than 
      two mortgage loans in the subject pool. The two highest borrower 
      exposures have 10 and 11 loans in the pool and account for 1% and 1.7%, 
      respectively. Due to the considerable borrower exposure, additional 
      deterministic tests were performed and are reflected in Fitch's expected 
      loss levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Exclusive 15-Year Mortgages: The collateral pool consists of 15-year 
      fixed-rate mortgages (FRMs) to borrowers with very strong credit 
      profiles, low leverage and substantial liquid reserves. Third-party 
      loan-level due diligence was performed on 100% of the pool, and Fitch 
      believes the results of the review generally indicate strong 
      underwriting controls. Fitch's probability of default (PD) for 15-year 
      FRMs is lower than that for loans with 30-year terms to reflect the 
      positive selection associated with borrowers who select the higher 
      payment, which results in faster amortization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      High Geographic Concentration: The pool's primary concentration risk is 
      California, where 49% of the properties are located. In addition, 57% of 
      the properties are located in the pool's top five metropolitan 
      statistical areas (MSA) in California, New York and Illinois. The pool 
      has significant regional concentrations, which resulted in an additional 
      penalty of approximately 16% to the pool's lifetime default expectation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Extraordinary Expense Adjustment: Extraordinary expenses will be taken 
      out of available funds but not accounted for in the contractual interest 
      owed to the bondholders. This construct can result in principal and 
      interest shortfalls to the bonds starting from the bottom of the capital 
      structure. To account for this risk, Fitch adjusted the credit 
      enhancement (CE) upward by 25 bps for the class A bonds, 20 bps for 
      classes B-1 and B2 and 10 bps for classes B-3 and B-4.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nonfull Representation and Warranty Framework: While the transaction 
      benefits from JPMCB (rated 'A+'/'F1'; Stable Outlook) and FRB (rated 
      'A-'/'F1'; Stable Outlook) as representation and warranty (rep and 
      warranty) providers for approximately 93% of the pool, Fitch believes 
      the value of the rep and warranty framework is diluted by the presence 
      of qualifying and conditional language in conjunction with sunset 
      provisions, which reduces lender breach liability. While the agency 
      believes the high credit quality pool and clean diligence results 
      mitigate these risks, Fitch considered the weaker framework in its 
      analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Market Value Decline Sensitivity: Fitch considered further market value 
      decline (MVD) sensitivities, in addition to those generated by its 
      sustainable home price (SHP) model. These scenarios aligned Fitch's 
      'Asf' sustainable MVD (sMVD) assumptions with peak-to-trough MVDs 
      experienced during the housing crisis through 2009. The sensitivity 
      analysis, which was factored into Fitch's loss expectations, resulted in 
      applying an sMVD of 16% from 19% in its base case analysis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITIES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After Fitch determines credit ratings through a rating stress scenario 
      analysis, additional sensitivity analyses are considered. The analyses 
      provide a defined stress sensitivity to demonstrate how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs than that assumed at issuance as well as a 
      defined sensitivity that demonstrates the stress assumptions required to 
      reduce a rating by one full category, to non-investment grade, and to 
      CCCsf'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In its analysis, Fitch considered additional sMVD stress assumptions to 
      those generated by the SHP model. These supplementary scenarios 
      reflected base case sMVDs that aligned Fitch's 'Asf' sMVD stress 
      assumptions with peak-to-trough MVDs experienced in the U.S. during the 
      recent financial crisis (2007 - 2009). This is consistent with Fitch's 
      view as described in its U.S. RMBS Loan Loss Model Criteria (dated 
      December 2013, available on its website at www.fitchratings.com) 
      which associates the recent national housing recession and related 
      performance observations with an 'Asf' stress. The result of this 
      sensitivity analysis was included in the consideration of the loss 
      expectations for this transaction. The sensitivity analysis resulted in 
      a base sMVD of 16%, compared with the model projected 19%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another sensitivity analysis was focused on determining how the ratings 
      would react to steeper MVDs at the national level. The analysis assumes 
      MVDs of 10%, 20%, and 30%, in addition to the model projected 19% for 
      this pool. The analysis indicates there is some potential rating 
      migration with higher MVDs, compared with the model projection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch also conducted defined rating sensitivities, which determine the 
      stresses to MVDs that would reduce a rating by one full category, to 
      non-investment grade, and to 'CCCsf'. For example, additional MVDs of 
      5%, 23% and 42% would potentially reduce the 'AAAsf' rated class down 
      one rating category, to non-investment grade, and to 'CCCsf', 
      respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* 1bn issue to be backed by asset-backed securities&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Deal expected to achieve lower funding cost for Goldman
Sachs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Complex nature of the trade seen as a deterrent for
investors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Helene Durand and Anil Mayre&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 27 (IFR) - In a move some could see as a return
to the bad old days of structured credit, Goldman Sachs is
hoping to sell a highly complex transaction that blurs the lines
between covered bonds and securitisations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, which could arrive as early as next week, is
backed by a portfolio that includes a variety of asset-backed
bonds. That may prove controversial as some will feel it
resembles the kind of CDO transaction blamed by many for
contributing to the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US bank began a roadshow this week for the so-called
Fixed Income Global Structured Collateral Obligation (FIGSCO)
2014-01, through Barclays, Credit Agricole, Natixis, UBS and its
own investment banking unit. According to S, the deal is
expected to be a 1bn seven-year trade, from a 10bn programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a pure investment bank, Goldman Sachs does not originate
mortgages typically used for covered bonds or RMBS deals. But it
does originate other assets that it is looking to fund more
cheaply while terming out its debt profile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, convincing investors to look through the layers of
complexity could prove difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a highly customised transaction with many moving
parts, which will be much less liquid than covered bonds covered
by a legal framework," said Dierk Brandenburg, a senior bank
credit analyst at Fidelity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The collateral is of poor quality and one is relying on the
support structure that is in turn very complex with multiple
support mechanisms."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A fund manager echoed this view, saying he had yet to figure
out whether he could actually invest in the bonds and which fund
in his portfolio it would fit in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a sense of deja vu and this looks like some of the
deals we saw before the financial crisis, which had the same
total return swaps construct, although I may be too harsh and
would have to look more closely at the structure," the fund
manager said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some say that the deal, which is in part aimed at covered
bond investors, might not work with those buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have seen the likes of Commerzbank do these structured
SME covered bonds or NIBC use the pass-through structure, but
while the transactions got done, we also saw that for many
covered bond investors moving away from the strict covered bond
legal framework is quite a stretch," a banker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal will not fit in the covered bond legal framework
because the assets would not be eligible for a cover pool as
defined by European regulations. The bonds are also unlikely to
be repo-eligible at the ECB; nor will they be likely to count in
calculating a bank's liquidity coverage ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They will probably have a 20% risk-weighting and be treated
as Triple A corporate exposure under Solvency II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FILLING A GAP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Goldman Sachs is hoping to fill a void in the
market where covered bond issuance is dwindling and there are
fewer Triple A rated assets. The trade would be expected to come
at a more attractive spread than a simple Triple A bond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an interesting trade, especially if you look at
what's going on in the world," said another banker. "This will
offer value and we expect the big liquidity books to get on
board."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the negative side, the deal requires more knowledge and
credit work than a plain Triple A trade. "We have been here
before: Triple A with a spread," the banker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Market sources say potential buyers may be convinced to look
past the portfolio composition in view of the techniques used to
construct the security package.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal benefits from a total return swap from Goldman
Sachs Mitsui Marine Derivative Products, rated Triple A by S,
which in turn is guaranteed by Goldman Sachs and Mitsui Sumitomo
Insurance. The TRS matches all the income associated with the
assets over the life of the deal with the payments due on the
bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors have a claim against GSMMDP. If that claim fails,
they then have an unsecured claim against Goldman Sachs and
Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assets will be marked daily on an actual price, rather
than a model basis, and at the price at which they would have to
be sold. This pricing is also checked by an external party and
the lower of the two prices is taken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And more collateral will be added if the existing securities
decline in value as there is a minimum 5% overcollateralisation
requirement. In addition, the TRS matches asset and liability
returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT'S IN THERE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some market players the deal resembles a structured
covered bond, in that it has a line of recourse to the
underlying assets and the issuer in the event things turn sour,
but for others it smells like a collateralised debt obligation.
The portfolio could, according to sources away from the deal, be
backed predominantly by asset-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An illustrative pool cut shows a 35% exposure to RMBS, 20%
consumer ABS, 20% aviation bonds, 0.3% CLOs and 24% unsecured
corporate issues, according to sources away from the trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By currency, the breakdown of the pool might be weighted
towards US dollars at 40%, followed by euros with 24%, sterling
with 20% and Australian dollars with 15%. By country, the US
could account for 30%, followed by the UK and Portugal with 20%
each, Australia with 15% and the Gulf with 10%.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb's oral anticoagulant Eliquis has been recommended for wider use in Europe, boosting prospects for an important drug to both U.S. companies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;European Medicines Agency (EMA) experts recommended that Eliquis, also known as apixaban, should be approved for treating deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism, as well as for preventing recurrent cases, the drugmakers said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two conditions occur when a clot blocks the flow of blood in a deep vein - usually in the lower leg, thigh or pelvis - or in blood vessels in the lungs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eliquis is already approved for reducing the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation, a form of irregular heartbeat common among the elderly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new approval will help Eliquis to compete with Xarelto, a similar drug from Bayer and Johnson &amp; Johnson, as well as other rivals in the nascent field.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) launched what it hopes will be the most successful private effort to date to crack down on cyber crime by moving to disrupt communications channels between hackers and infected PCs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The operation, which began on Monday under an order issued by a federal court in Nevada, targeted traffic involving malicious software known as Bladabindi and Jenxcus, which Microsoft said work in similar ways and were written and distributed by developers in Kuwait and Algeria. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is the first high-profile case involving malware written by developers outside of Eastern Europe, according to Richard Domingues Boscovich, assistant general counsel of Microsoft's cybercrime-fighting Digital Crimes Unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have never seen malware coded outside Eastern Europe that is as big as this. This really demonstrates the globalization of cybercrime," said Boscovich, whose team at Microsoft has disrupted nine other cybercrime operations over the past five years, all of which it believes originated in Eastern Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it would take days to determine how many machines were infected, but noted that the number could be very large because Microsoft's anti-virus software alone has detected some 7.4 million infections over the past year and is installed on less than 30 percent of the world's PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The malware has dashboards with point-and-click menus to execute functions such as viewing a computer screen in real time, recording keystrokes, stealing passwords and listening to conversations, according to documents filed in U.S. District Court in Nevada on June 19 and unsealed Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The malware was purchased by at least 500 customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boscovich said the developers marketed their malware over social media, including videos on YouTube and a Facebook page. They posted videos with techniques for infecting PCs, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONDAY'S OPERATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court order allowed Microsoft to disrupt communications between infected machines and Reno, Nevada-based Vitalwerks Internet Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boscovich said about 94 percent of all machines infected with the two viruses communicate with hackers through Vitalwerks servers. Criminals use Vitalwerks as an intermediary to make it more difficult for law enforcement to track, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court ordered the registries that direct Internet communications to send suspected malicious traffic to Microsoft servers in Redmond, Washington, instead of to Vitalwerks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an operation that begins Monday, Boscovich said, Microsoft will filter out communications from PCs infected with another 194 types of malware also being filtered through Vitalwerks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitalwerks said Microsoft's actions have disrupted service for millions of Internet users.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Vitalwerks and (operational subsidiary) No-IP have a very strict abuse policy. Our abuse team is constantly working to keep the No-IP system domains free of spam and malicious activity," spokeswoman Natalie Goguen said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not accused Vitalwerks of involvement in any cybercrime, though it alleges the company failed to take proper steps to prevent its system from being abused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just want them to clean up their act, to be more proactive in monitoring their service," Boscovich said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Richard Chang, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

some 7.4 million infections over the past year and is installed
on less than 30 percent of the world's PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The malware has slick dashboards with point-and-click menus
to execute functions such as viewing a computer screen in real
time, recording keystrokes, stealing passwords and listening to
conversations, according to documents filed in U.S. District
Court in Nevada on June 19 and unsealed Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The malicious software was purchased by at least 500
customers, who are identified in the court documents as John
Does 1 to 500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boscovich said the developers blatantly marketed their
malware over social media, including videos on Google Inc's
 YouTube and a Facebook page. They posted instructional
videos with techniques for infecting PCs, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONDAY'S OPERATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court order allowed Microsoft to disrupt communications
between infected machines and a Reno, Nevada, firm known as
Vitalwerks Internet Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boscovich said about 94 percent of all machines infected
with the two viruses communicate with hackers through Vitalwerks
servers. Criminals use Vitalwerks as an intermediary to make it
more difficult for law enforcement to track them down, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The court ordered the registries that direct Internet
communications to send suspected malicious traffic to Microsoft
servers in Redmond, Washington, instead of letting it go on to
Vitalwerks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vitalwerks spokeswoman Natalie Goguen said she had no
immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the operation that began on Monday, Boscovich said,
Microsoft will filter out communications from PCs infected with
another 194 types of malware that are also being filtered
through Vitalwerks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not accused Vitalwerks of involvement in any
cybercrime, though it alleges that the company failed to take
proper steps to prevent its system from being used for such
activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We just want them to clean up their act, to be more
proactive in monitoring their service," Boscovich said in an
interview.

			Chevron Phillips Chemical to Expand Alpha Olefins Capacity at Cedar 
      Bayou Plant
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP (Chevron Phillips Chemical) is 
      pleased to announce it received Board of Directors approval and obtained 
      the necessary environmental permit from the Texas Commission on 
      Environmental Quality (TCEQ) to expand normal alpha olefins (NAO) 
      production capacity at its Cedar Bayou plant in Baytown, Texas. This 
      investment will provide an additional 100,000 metric tons per year of 
      capacity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Construction completion is anticipated in July, 2015. Houston-based SB 
      Engineers and Constructors Ltd. will execute the engineering, 
      procurement and construction, and expects to support up to 600 jobs 
      during the construction phase. The project will utilize Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical&#8217;s proprietary NAO technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This investment decision reflects Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s strategy 
      to leverage North American shale gas development by continuing to grow 
      our U.S. based Olefins and Polyolefins footprint,&#8221; said Mark Lashier, 
      Executive Vice President of Olefins and Polyolefins.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NAOs and its derivatives are used extensively as polyethylene 
      co-monomers, synthetic motor oils, lubricants, automotive additives and 
      in a wide range of specialty applications. &#8220;We are committed to being a 
      consistent and reliable supplier of high quality alpha olefins,&#8221; said 
      Mitch Eichelberger, General Manager of Normal Alpha Olefins and 
      Polyalphaolefins. &#8220;This expansion exemplifies our strong commitment to 
      the alpha olefins business, and meeting the growing demand of our 
      customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Phillips Chemical has recently announced the construction of a 
      world-scale ethylene cracker in Baytown, Texas, two world-scale 
      polyethylene reactors in Old Ocean, Texas and the start-up of the 
      world&#8217;s largest 1-hexene facility in Baytown. The 1-hexene plant, 
      capable of producing up to 250,000 metric tons, is co-located with this 
      expansion project at the Cedar Bayou plant. The two plants will enjoy 
      great synergy as they both share the same infrastructure and workforce 
      talent.

			Kathy Giusti, Founder and CEO of the Multiple Myeloma Research 
      Foundation (MMRF), Becomes Executive Chairman of the MMRF Board of 
      Directors; Walter Capone becomes President and CEO
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) today announced that 
      Kathy Giusti, Founder and CEO of the MMRF and the Multiple Myeloma 
      Research Consortium (MMRC), will become the Executive Chairman of the 
      MMRF Board of Directors. Dana LaForge, who served as Board Chairman for 
      ten years, will continue to serve on the MMRF Board. Walter Capone will 
      assume the role of President and Chief Executive Officer, reporting to 
      Kathy Giusti.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to Giusti, the MMRF is entering a new era of transformational 
      change in treating cancer. &#8220;As we participate in the global cancer 
      research platform, we are very excited to be collaborators in developing 
      opportunities that strengthen and speed our quest for a cure. We see new 
      hope every day as we share big data to drive discovery and pursue 
      innovative approaches in immune therapy, targeted drugs and trial 
      design. I look forward to my new role that allows me to continue to 
      support our commitment to myeloma patients, focus on expanding critical 
      corporate partnerships, and launch the largest capital campaign in the 
      company&#8217;s history.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The MMRF attributes its success over the past sixteen years to the work 
      with many brilliant, innovative and courageous people. Dana LaForge 
      provided thoughtful, inclusive, forward-thinking leadership as Board 
      Chairman and will continue to be a valued asset to the organization. In 
      his tenure with the MMRF, Walter Capone has helped build a talented team

			About Multiple Myeloma
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Multiple myeloma is a cancer of the plasma cell. It is the second most 
      common blood cancer. An estimated 24,050 adults (13,500 men and 10,550 
      women) in the United States will be diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 
      2014 and an estimated 11,090 people are predicted to die from the 
      disease. The five-year survival rate for multiple myeloma is 
      approximately 43%, versus 28% in 1998.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF) was established in 1998 
      as a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization by twin sisters Karen Andrews and 
      Kathy Giusti, soon after Kathy's diagnosis with multiple myeloma. The 
      mission of the MMRF is to relentlessly pursue innovative means that 
      accelerate the development of next-generation multiple myeloma 
      treatments to extend the lives of patients and lead to a cure. As the 
      world's number-one private funder of multiple myeloma research, the MMRF 
      has raised more than $250 million since its inception and directs nearly 
      90% of total budget to research and related programming. As a result, 
      the MMRF has been awarded Charity Navigator&#8217;s coveted four-star rating 
      for 11 consecutive years, the highest designation for outstanding fiscal 
      responsibility and exceptional efficiency. For more information about

		&lt;h1&gt;SmartMetric Patent Infringement Case Brought Against Both Visa Inc and Mastercard International -- Hearing in the Federal Circuit Court Scheduled for August 8th, 2014&lt;/h1&gt;
		
			&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, NY--(Marketwired - Jun 30, 2014) - SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCQB: SMME) -- SmartMetric started patent infringement proceedings against the payments card giants, Visa Inc and MasterCard International some three and a half years ago in the Southern District Court of California.&#160;The lawsuit brought by SmartMetric,&#160;Inc. is over the use of its patented technology by the payments card monoliths in respect of the new EMV chip cards that are being issued in the United States.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The founder of SmartMetric back in 1999 applied for a patent covering data cards, that is cards with a chip on them, that are used to make an automatic connection to networks.&#160;In 2004 the patent was issued by the United States Patent  Trade Mark Office.&#160;SmartMetric is alleging that the insertion into an ATM machine or retail card reader of the new EMV chip cards is in violation of its issued patent and in order to protect its intellectual property rights had no other option than to seek redress and protection in the Court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric in the hearing in August, is asking the court to find that both Visa Inc. And MasterCard International are infringing the SmartMetric patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric in its pleadings before the court is also seeking a ruling in respect of damages and a prepaid&#160;royalty based on 25% of the economic savings that flow from&#160;the alleged use of the SmartMetric patented technology by the payments cards companies.&#160;In earlier court filings the sum calculated and claimed by SmartMetric is $13.4 Billion.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The case will be heard in Washington DC in the Federal Circuit Court,&#160;on August 8th, 2014," said the President  CEO of SmartMetric Chaya Hendrick.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the EMV Forum&#160;around 100 million EMV chip cards will be in use in the U.S.A. by the end of 2014 while the Aite Group has reported according to its research that by the end of 2015, 70% of all payments cards will be EMV chip cards in the United States.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SmartMetric is a publicly traded technology company that has added a fingerprint scanner built inside EMV payment credit and debit chip cards thereby creating a second layer biometric authentication protection in defending against card fraud. The company is now actively marketing its technology to card issuing financial institutions around the World.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About SmartMetric, Inc. 
				SmartMetric, Inc. is a technology company that designs and engineers its own advanced products utilizing the company's expertise in miniaturizing electronics.

&lt;p&gt;COLOMBO, June 30 (Reuters) - The United States cancelled the
visa given to a Sri Lankan Buddhist monk heading a hardline
group accused of involvement in violence against Sri Lanka's
minority Muslims, an official of the group said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clashes erupted on June 15 in Aluthgama and Beruwela, two 
towns with large Muslim populations on the island's southern
coast, during a protest march led by the hardline group Bodu
Bala Sena (BBS), or "Buddhist Power Force".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara, a Buddhist monk and the secretary
general of the BBS, had been told of the decision, the official
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An official from the U.S. Embassy called Gnanasara thero
(monk) on Friday and informed him that the State Department
wants to convey him that he cannot use his existing visa to
enter the United States," BBS spokesman Dilantha Vithanage told
Reuters by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Embassy spokesman in Colombo said the U.S. government
would not comment on individual visa cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department's decision came after BBS on Friday
said Facebook accounts of its group's members, including
Gnanasara, had been blocked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many residents of the towns, thronged by tourists, said BBS
activists had made inflammatory statements against Muslims at a
rally before the violence. Much of the coast is dominated by Sri
Lanka's majority Buddhist Sinhalese community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group denies any connection with the incidents, in which
three people died and 75 were injured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Violence against Muslims in Sri Lanka has risen since 2012,
mirroring events in Myanmar, which has seen a surge of attacks
by members of the majority Buddhist community on Muslims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Mahinda Rajapaksa's coalition government has yet
to crack down on the BBS despite calls from his own party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many independent analysts say well-coordinated violence
against Muslims and Christians appears to have tacit state
backing as those involved in previous attacks have yet to be
punished. The government denies any collusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam attacked
Muslim villages in the northeast during the civil war from 1983
to 2009. More than 140 people were killed in a massacre of
Muslims in 1990 blamed on the Tigers, which the group denied.

			INSTEON Announces Availability of Popular Connected Home Products in 
      Microsoft Retail Stores
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			INSTEON, 
      creators of the world&#8217;s best-selling home automation and control 
      technology, today announced that its connected home devices are now 
      available in Microsoft retail stores. Previously, INSTEON announced its 
      all-new apps for Windows Phone and Windows 8.1 and product availability 
      on MicrosoftStore.com
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In its continuing commitment to provide choice, value and service for 
      its customers, Microsoft stores will offer three unique INSTEON kits -- 
      a Starter Kit, Home Kit and Business Kit -- and five standalone devices, 
      including the INSTEON Leak Sensor, Open/Close Sensor, LED Bulb, On/Off 
      Module and Wireless Wi-Fi Camera. Prices will range from $29.99 to 
      $79.99, with kits starting at $199. Microsoft employees will also be 
      trained to help assist customers with questions regarding setup.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Since launching INSTEON on MicrosoftStore.com, we have seen a lot of 
      interest from Microsoft customers in our connected products,&#8221; said Joe 
      Dada, CEO, INSTEON. &#8220;Now that we are making those same products 
      available to Microsoft retail customers, we are confident that our 
      products will be equally as popular in stores.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The INSTEON family of devices turns any home into a connected home. 
      INSTEON users are able to set up lighting scenes, schedule lights to 
      automatically turn on and off, and monitor their homes via wireless 
      cameras from any mobile device. INSTEON kits and modules allow users to 
      receive instant notification alerts when doors and windows are opened or 
      closed, or when there is a water leak in the home. INSTEON provides all 
      of this and more via a free app with no monthly fees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      INSTEON&#8217;s reliable dual-band technology uses both the existing wires 
      (power line) in the home and radio-frequency (RF) communication instead 
      of relying on spotty Wi-Fi connections and routers, which dictate where 
      smart devices must be placed to work properly. By making every networked 
      device talk to each other via RF and the power line, INSTEON eliminates 
      the need for custom wiring and ensures that every device is always 
      connected. Adding remote control and automation to everything from home 
      monitoring to lighting, INSTEON&#8217;s dual-band network and devices allow 
      users to manage the home or office in more variations than any other 
      home automation technology.
