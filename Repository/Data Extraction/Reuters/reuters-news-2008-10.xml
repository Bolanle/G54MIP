&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM shares tumbled 6 percent on Wednesday, their biggest drop in three years, on concern the world's biggest computer services company's results missed Wall Street targets in the quarter that ended Sept 30.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There's unconfirmed speculation that they are going to bring down their numbers for the quarter, that they are going to warn," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of New York-based Solaris Asset Management, which manages about $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for IBM, which is scheduled to release quarterly results on October 16, declined to comment, saying the company does not respond to speculation and market rumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanford Bernstein  Co said in an e-mail to clients that the stock was falling partly on speculation that IBM's investor relations staff was urging Wall Street analysts to lower their estimates for the company's quarterly results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(This is) not confirmed and (we are) skeptical of this," Sanford Bernstein technology sector specialist said in the e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Weisel Partners Analyst David Grossman said he cut his forecasts for IBM's quarterly revenue last month and he expects other analysts to do so because the company's sales will be hurt by the impact of the greater-than-expected strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and other currencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Numbers are coming down," he said. "Some other people are talking about it now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armonk, New York-based International Business Machines Corp shares fell $6.91 to $110.05 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the biggest one-day percentage drop since April 2005 for the company, which is the world's biggest manufacturer of mainframe computers and the second-largest software maker after Microsoft Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle, editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - The Pfizer Inc. AIDS drug maraviroc helps thwart the HIV virus in nearly half of people who have developed resistance to other treatments, according to two related studies published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least 42 percent of patients in Europe, North America and Australia who took maraviroc once or twice a day on top of standard drug cocktails had blood virus counts below levels that cause visible damage to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 18 percent of patients who got a placebo plus a standard HIV drug combination got their viral levels that low over the 48 weeks that have been studied so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, 1,049 volunteers who were resistant to three of the six classes of HIV drugs were involved in the two Pfizer-sponsored studies, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts have said maraviroc could be worth $500 million to Pfizer by 2011. Marketed as Celsentri in Europe and Selzentry in the United States, it was approved a year ago based on 24-week results from the two studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maraviroc stops the virus from getting into the immune cells it affects by blocking a doorway called the CCR5 co-receptor. It was given with other HIV drugs that target the ability of the virus to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volunteers, all with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infections, were screened to be sure they carried a strain of the virus that uses CCR5. More than half of infected people do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said maraviroc did not produce any unusual side effects and, although the drug carries a warning about possible liver problems, "our study simply didn't see liver toxicity, so that's reassuring," said Dr. Roy Gulick of the Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a telephone interview, Gulick said the liver warning was "based on a single case, and that patient had a lot of complicating factors, so there are other possible reasons why they ran into liver trouble."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 33 million people worldwide are infected with HIV. There is no cure and no vaccine, although a drug cocktail can help control infection and keep people healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the virus mutates constantly and usually becomes resistant to the drugs after a while, meaning patients must switch to different cocktails. AIDS experts say they need constant new additions to the list of 20 or so existing HIV drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maraviroc belongs to a new class of these drugs, called HIV entry inhibitors or CCR5 receptor antagonists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gulick said results from the 96-week mark are now being analyzed and may be presented at a scientific meeting in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Maggie Fox and John O'Callaghan)&lt;/p&gt;

WHAT:     Will discuss the process and results of a three-year
          transformation of IBM's employee compensation policies,
          technology and procedures that moved a structure that compensated
          all employees equally to a culture built around
          pay-for-performance during their presentation, "Driving Global
          Pay-for-Performance at IBM"

WHEN:     Human Resource Executive's 11th Annual HR Technology(R) Conference

DETAILS:  Driven by a CEO mandate to embrace pay-for-performance, IBM spent
          three years, dramatically transforming its compensation policies,
          technology and procedures to move to a pay-for-performance
          culture. This transformation started with their global bonus plan
          that had over 270,000 eligible employees and then extended to
          include merit reviews and off-cycle increases world-wide.

          Fontaine will be joined by Clifford to review the results,
          changes and lessons learned in the 65 affected countries since
          the initial roll out and how usage of the Workscape solution has
          expanded in subsequent years, including how the new system
          increased productivity and driven business results.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Oct 1 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) shares tumbled 6 percent on Wednesday, their biggest drop in three years, on concern the world's biggest computer services company's results missed Wall Street targets in the quarter that ended Sept 30.  "There's unconfirmed speculation that they are going to bring down their numbers for the quarter, that they are going to warn," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of New York-based Solaris Asset Management, which manages about $2 billion.    A spokesman for IBM, which is scheduled to release quarterly results on Oct. 16, declined to comment, saying the company does not respond to speculation and market rumors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sanford Bernstein &amp; Co said in an e-mail to clients that the stock was falling partly on speculation that IBM's investor relations staff was urging Wall Street analysts to lower their estimates for the company's quarterly results. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "(This is) not confirmed and (we are) skeptical of this," Sanford Bernstein technology sector specialist said in the e-mail. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Thomas Weisel Partners Analyst David Grossman said he cut his forecasts for IBM's quarterly revenue last month and he expects other analysts to do so because the company's sales will be hurt by the impact of the greater-than-expected strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the euro and other currencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Numbers are coming down," he said. "Some other people are talking about it now." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Armonk, New York-based International Business Machines Corp shares fell $6.91 to $110.05 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It was the biggest one-day percentage drop since April 2005 for the company, which is the world's biggest manufacturer of mainframe computers and the second-largest software maker after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jim Finkle, editing by Maureen Bavdek) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((jim.finkle@thomsonreuters.com; + 1 617 367 4164; Reuters Messaging: jim.finkle.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: IBM SHARES/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2008.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the SecureStore framework, a new way to
provide retailers with cost-effective solutions to help reduce the
billions of dollars of losses caused each year by physical theft,
electronic data breaches and compliance violations.

    Retailers today in every segment are under tremendous pressure to protect
margins amid a "perfect storm" of business risk:


--  Preventing physical loss, increasingly perpetrated by organized
criminal groups;
--  Protecting against database breaches and other electronic threats,
often perpetrated by those same criminal groups;
--  Complying with Payment Card Industry (PCI) regulations for customer
data protection.

    
According to the 2008 National Retail Federation Organized Retail
Crime Survey, 85 percent of the retailers surveyed indicated they had been
victims of organized retail crime in the last 12 months. This represents
as much as $30 billion in retail losses each year, according to the
Federal Bureau of Investigation. These same criminal organizations are
also attacking retailers online and are largely responsible for the 245
million electronic personal records that have been stolen since January
2005, according to the Attrition.org database of data breaches.

    "We are seeing threat convergence in the retail sector. The same
organizations perpetrating in-store theft are also attacking retailers
online," said Val Rahmani, general manager of IBM Internet Security
Systems. "When you combine this trend with threats such as insider theft
and Web site denial-of-service blackmail, along with ever-evolving PCI
requirements, retailers are under immense pressure and simply don't have
the resources to cope. IBM's new SecureStore framework is the first truly
converged security and compliance framework that can help effectively
combat today's new generation of converged threats."

    SecureStore delivers a comprehensive framework for protecting against
online and physical risks that can help retailers reduce losses from
theft, prevent brand and financial damage from data breaches and help
reduce the cost and complexity of complying with PCI and other
regulations. This solution arrives just in time for the holiday season,
when retailers are most vulnerable to risk.

    "Retail is about high volume of people, products and transactions going
through stores and systems," Daniel Marcotte, Director of Systems and Data
Security, La Senza. "We have to control access to the data such business
model generates and prevent its theft. Our customers' confidence is
critical to us. The SecureStore framework provides everything La Senza
needs to assess our current security and compliance posture, and take
remedial action before the holiday rush begins."

    In addition to helping protect retailers from organized retail crimes and
in store losses, the SecureStore framework can help retailers provide
consumers with more protection from identity theft, stolen credit card
information and fraudulent purchases. Recent studies show that most
shoppers will take their business elsewhere if they find out their
personal information was compromised. With SecureStore, retailers can
help allay consumer concerns, while safeguarding themselves against
financial losses or harm to their brands.

    SecureStore is a framework of products and services divided into four
logical categories:


--  Management -- IBM Internet Security Systems (ISS) is currently one of
only four globally certified PCI assessors in the world. This makes IBM ISS
uniquely qualified to provide comprehensive PCI assessments.



--  Network -- SecureStore brings together IBM's comprehensive security
offerings from its ISS, Rational and Tivoli business units to help protect
databases and applications from network-based threats. The network is the
vector through which most data breaches occur; however it is critical for
retailers to also deploy technology that protects applications and
databases. 



--  Assets -- IBM's next-generation Smart Surveillance and item-level RFID
systems lead the SecureStore framework's array of solutions for helping to
protect physical assets from both internal and external threats. The
SecureStore framework provides solutions to help track, manage and monitor
the movement of inventory and the maintenance of fixed assets. 



--  Transactions -- The SecureStore framework consists of comprehensive
security technologies for helping to protect both online and in-store
transactions. Additionally, IBM can deliver security rich, service-oriented
architecture (SOA)-based electronic transaction solutions for the entire
retail supply chain. The SecureStore framework helps drive fraud out of the
process by helping to protect the identity of transaction parties and the
integrity of transaction themselves.

    
The SecureStore framework is available immediately and retailers can
contact their IBM representatives to begin the assessment process before
the holidays.

    "Retailers should be in the business of selling products, not stopping
security threats. The SecureStore framework enables them to get back to
what they do well, and to offload some of their security and compliance
challenges to one of the world's foremost provider of business solutions,"
said Karen Lowe, general manager, Global Retail Sector, IBM. "No other
company can provide a solution of this scope to the retail sector. And
SecureStore goes beyond today's security and compliance requirements. It
helps establish a foundation that enables retailers to exploit new
business opportunities without introducing new risk to the enterprise --
whether that involves expansion, acquisition or exploiting new channels
such as mobile commerce and kiosk-based sales."

</body></entry><entry author="None" date="2008-10-01T16:45:45+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS173930+01-Oct-2008+MW20081001"><headline>IBM Delivers Breakthrough Storage Capability on Blade Computing Solution Designed for the Office</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today a storage breakthrough in blade computing
that will allow small and medium-sized customers and branch offices to
consolidate multiple storage devices onto a single blade computing
system. Building on the leadership design of IBM's office-ready blade
solution, customers can now share information across all blade servers in
a single system to help improve utilization and reliability while
reducing costs.

    IBM is adding industry-first shared storage to the exceptional features of
its BladeCenter S system, bringing enterprise-class storage capabilities
to smaller firms and branch offices that lack the IT staff and budgets to
manage expanding volumes of business information. With this innovative
new approach, IBM is cutting the cost of shared storage technology by 30
to 40 percent and -- supported by new, complementary features -- making
it easier to set up and own. (1)

    First launched in 2007, BladeCenter S is specially designed to simplify
the management of technology needed to run a business -- from servers, to
phone systems and business applications -- in a single system.
BladeCenter S can help reduce the 25 to 45 servers used by an average
mid-size company by up to 80 percent. (2) With the addition of shared
storage, a requirement for many business applications including IBM Lotus
Notes, Microsoft Clustering Services, Oracle, SAP and VMware VMotion,
BladeCenter S can now support nearly any business need.

    BladeCenter S has demonstrated market success with over 4,000 retail
stores planning to run operations on the system by the holiday season and
130 Business Partner centers featuring BladeCenter S, including more than
80 primarily dedicated to its promotion.

    In addition to delivering breakthrough shared storage, or Storage Area
Network (SAN) technology, IBM is also the only blade server vendor in the
industry to offer rapidly growing businesses access to up nine terabytes
of shared storage, equivalent to that needed to store the print
collections of the U.S. Library of Congress and six times the storage
capacity of competitive blade offerings for small and medium-sized
customers and branch offices.

    Like many small and medium businesses, companies with branch offices and
stores such as retailers or healthcare networks seldom have data centers
in which to store and manage the technology they need to run business
operations. With limited IT resources on-site, these companies face unique
technology requirements and require integrated solutions that simplify IT
at the office:

    Harley-Davidson Motor Company is planning to use BladeCenter S to run
multiple sites. One BladeCenter S currently operates at the office of
Harley-Davidson's subsidiary, Buell Motor Company, where its capacity to
run outside the data center and plug in to standard power is essential.

    Harley-Davidson plans to send a fully configured BladeCenter S with shared
storage capability to their Talladega Test Facility in Lincoln, Alabama
where they do not have dedicated local IT staff. The Harley-Davidson
corporate IT team will fully configure the system and send it to the
facility, where all they need to do is plug it in.

    Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center is a private, non-profit community
health center that provides health services to the poor, medically
indigent and or medically under-served residents of Queens County, New
York.

    "As a non-profit organization committed to providing low cost healthcare
to our community, we have to make every dollar count," said Henry Dong,
system support engineer, Joseph P. Addabbo Family Health Center. "We
selected the BladeCenter S running with the new shared storage feature to
allow us to virtualize our IT environment, wringing maximum return from
our investment. In addition, BladeCenter S has the low power and small
footprint needed to fit within our existing server room, further
protecting our investments."

    Other new BladeCenter S features IBM is announcing today include the
BladeCenter Start Now Advisor, which provides clients guided setup so they
can set up the BladeCenter S chassis in 30 minutes or less, and the
BladeCenter Service Advisor, an automatic "call home" feature that alerts
IBM or the customer's authorized service provider to any issues -- think
OnStar for servers.

    Business Partners Select IBM BladeCenter S to Grow Profitability

    To help Business Partners better reach SMB clients, IBM launched the
BladeCenter and Storage Solution Center (BSSC) program 14 months ago. IBM
and Business Partners have opened more than 80 such solution centers
around the world, showcasing the benefits of IBM storage and blade
technology like BladeCenter S. Some early successes include:

    Tipton

    "Since last year, we've increased our IBM sales by 205 percent, the
majority of which came from blades like IBM's BladeCenter S," said Jay
Tipton, CEO of Tipton. "Part of the appeal of blades is that it eliminates
the need to rip and replace. Clients can get started with blades on the
BladeCenter S and continue to grow their businesses with IBM."

    Unistar

    "IBM's BladeCenter S already offers a competitive advantage over other SMB
blade solutions thanks to appealing features including compact size,
locking door, dust filter and noise reducing capability," said Soo-Tsong
Lim, president of Unistar-Sparco Corporation. "The new shared storage
feature will further enhance this superior system, while allowing us to
offer both existing and prospective customers the ability to more easily
migrate and expand data."

    KDSA

    "Our customers, many of which are local Massachusetts non-profit
organizations, have been able to cost-effectively replace and consolidate
old tower servers on to BladeCenter S, increasing the simplicity and
reliability of their infrastructure," said Donald Reczek, Director,
Technology Solutions KDSA Consulting, LLC. "We're seeing an increased
number of customers using virtualization on the BladeCenter S to further
reduce their footprint and gain savings in cooling and power."

    SIS

    "SIS operates a mobile BSSC that we'll use to show clients how the new
storage capabilities on BladeCenter S will allow them to address all the
needs of their business on a single, integrated system," said Steve Sigg,
CEO of Software Information Systems (SIS). "We tell clients that
BladeCenter S is a data center in a box. With shared storage, clients can
now have a virtualized data center in a box."

    Pricing and Availability

    The new IBM BladeCenter S shared storage capability is expected to begin
shipping in volume later this month. It's available for new or previously
purchased BladeCenter S systems. BladeCenter Start Now Advisor is
available now, as are many other new features. For more information visit:
http://www-03.ibm.com/systems/info/bladecenter/s/celebration.html.

    BladeCenter S starts at $2,599, which includes power supplies, fans, rack
rails and a DVD/CD combo drive. This is at least $2,000 less than the
closest current comparable competitive offering.

    About IBM BladeCenter

    IBM has the broadest portfolio of blade offerings in the industry,
including five blade enclosures, five compatible server blades and five
I/O fabrics with a common architecture that allows clients to mix and
match offerings. IBM has also taken a unique approach in the industry by
opening up the IBM BladeCenter hardware architecture, which has created
market and revenue opportunities for hundreds of companies selling
peripherals like network and storage cards, switches and software. Since
opening the BladeCenter specifications in 2004, 500 companies have
downloaded the specifications at no cost. For more information about IBM

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Crosstex Energy
Inc XTXI.O to "sell" from "hold" and cut its price target on
the stock citing reduced natural gas volumes and damage caused
to the company's assets by recent hurricanes, sending its
shares down 20 percent to a three-year low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage cut its price target on Crosstex Energy Inc
stock by 18 percent to $27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also lowered its price target on Crosstex Energy LP
XTEX.O shares by 24 percent to $22 over concerns on the
company's ability to raise capital near term as it approaches
its current credit limit with dilutive equity issuances likely
in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The limited partnership's units fell as much as 21 percent
and touched a five-year low of $14.42 in morning trade.
 "We expect reduced cash flows to persist into 2009, materially
affecting distribution growth and resulting in a weakening
balance sheet," analyst David Chiaro said on Crosstex Energy
LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crosstex Energy Inc owns a 2 percent general partner
interest, a 34 percent limited partner interest and the
incentive distribution rights of Crosstex Energy LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chiaro said he still expects the limited partnership's 3.9
million subordinated D units will convert in the first quarter
of 2009 and it will need to issue $150 million of additional
common units in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, he said, the dilutive effect of the common
issuances will increase pressure on the underlying master
limited partnership and force its structural changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As a result, we suggest investors sell XTXI shares at the
unsustainable current valuation," Chiaro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Crosstex Energy Inc were down $3.89 at $21.09 in
midday trade on Nasdaq. They fell as low as $19.92 earlier in
the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crosstex Energy LP shares were down $1.76 at $16.50 in
midday trade on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CRUZ, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Application server developers and users ranked IBM's WebSphere
higher than application servers offered by Oracle, Microsoft, Adobe,
and four others in the 2008 Evans Data Corp. Application Server Users'
Choice survey announced today.

   In the worldwide survey of over 700 developers, only users of each
application server rated the corresponding product on twenty-one
different attributes including performance, scalability, support,
database connectivity, and security features. In addition the
developers rated the importance of each attribute to provide relative
weighting. WebSphere took top scores in ten out of the twenty-one
categories as well as in combined overall score.

   "WebSphere has raised the bar in user satisfaction for full
featured enterprise scale application servers," said John Andrews,
president and CEO of Evans Data Corp. "But it's more than just an
excellent product, IBM has also surrounded WebSphere with the top
rated support program and the comprehensive Rational tool suite, and
these users obviously appreciate that."

   The Applications Server User's Choice report details users'
rankings for each of eight application servers included in the study
and can be found here:

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Oct 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced migration services and competitive
migration pricing for abandoned HP Identity Center security software
customers aimed at helping them benefit from IBM's broad capabilities for
securing and efficiently running IT for their business.

    IBM also today announced new application security software and four new
worldwide Trusted Identity Centers of Excellence to help organizations tie
together physical and digital security to better manage the identity
lifecycle of their customers and workforce. These efforts further
demonstrate IBM's commitment to provide new capabilities that support the
growing business need for identity management and security.

    HP entered the identity management space with three successive
acquisitions -- Baltimore Technologies in 2003, Trulogica in 2004 and
Trustgenix in 2005 -- but then announced this year that it was stopping
direct business focus on identity management while steering customers to
other providers.

    In response to HP's discontinued identity management products, IBM offers
competitive migration pricing for software and migration services through
IBM Internet Security Systems (ISS) to provide stranded HP customers the
opportunity to efficiently convert from HP software to IBM's security
offerings, such as IBM Tivoli Identity Manager, IBM Tivoli Access Manager
for e-Business and IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager. IBM continues to
strengthen its identity management commitment, most recently evidenced by
the acquisition of Encentuate in March and release of the new Tivoli
Access Manager for Enterprise Single Sign-On in September, adding new
capabilities to help enterprises of all sizes minimize risk and cut
operational costs through security.

    Identity and access management software -- which helps organizations
define IT system user roles and manage who has access to what
applications and information -- was a $3.1 billion worldwide market in
2007, expected to grow to $5.3 billion by 2012 (1) and is a major pillar
of any service management strategy that manages IT data centers and
technical infrastructure. Identity and access management software is
critical to enterprises of all types, particularly businesses involved in
transactional activity such as banking and retail, as well as medical
institutions seeking to protect the privacy of patients.

    "HP's decision to throw in the towel on its identity and access management
software line has left a void for customers," said Al Zollar, general
manager, IBM Tivoli Software. "Obviously security software is a critical
linchpin for protecting a company's global assets and reputation. IBM is
committed to delivering a comprehensive portfolio of security software and
services."

    According to a recent market share report from analyst firm IDC, IBM leads
all vendors in worldwide revenue for identity and access management (1).
As a leader in overall IT operations management software, IBM credits its
success to the ability of its software to provide increased value when
linked together, in addition to a coordinated development roadmap and
highly skilled consulting and services support.

    As Internet use for business purposes continues to rise, the threat of
securing Web applications from hackers, while maintaining compliance with
mandatory business regulations, is top of mind for organizations.
Implementing proactive measures to identify and fix vulnerabilities across
the software delivery process is instrumental for reducing risk and cost.
Building on top of IBM's security foundation of identity and access
management, IBM also announced new offerings to help customers secure
their software applications:

    IBM Tivoli Security Policy Manager -- Brand new IBM software that
provides customers the ability to develop centralized security policy
management for managing application entitlements driven by compliance,
data security and intellectual property protection. The adoption of SOA
and Web 2.0 technologies poses unique security policy management
challenges for managing user entitlements -- the loose coupling of
services and mash-up applications across a business creates multiple
policy management points, each of which may require its own
administration. The IT reality to manage these policies and entitlements
in an environment full of different vendors' technology is manual,
error-prone and creates costly islands of security administration. Tivoli
Security Policy Manager, available by end of 2008, provides
standards-based, centralized application entitlement and SOA security
policy management capabilities to help users strengthen access to new
applications and services and improve policy compliance and operational
governance.

    IBM Rational AppScan Developer Edition -- New software, announced
September 22, designed to lower business risks and reduce costs
associated with conducting business on the web. Through the availability
of Rational AppScan Developer Edition, IBM helps organizations take a
preemptive approach to application security by providing resources needed
to find security and compliance flaws at the earliest stages of the
development process, before they ever pose a real risk or become highly
costly to fix. IBM is the only company to offer security solutions that
span all areas of application delivery, including the development,
testing, deployment and operational phases. IBM Rational's portfolio for
application security also includes: IBM Rational AppScan Standard, IBM
Rational AppScan Enterprise, IBM Rational AppScan Tester Edition and IBM
Rational AppScan Build Edition. To learn more, please visit:
www.ibm.com/software/rational/offerings/websecurity/. 

    New Trusted Identity Centers

    IBM's four new IBM Trusted Identity Centers of Excellence also announced
today -- based in Dallas, TX; San Jose, CA; Bangalore, India; and La
Gaude, France -- extend IBM's identity management capabilities, helping
customers link together physical and digital identities and improve trust
and confidence in identities. The centers are staffed with skilled
services leaders, architects and developers to assist customers with
programs to manage the lifecycle of identities.

    Billions of identities -- ranging from digital passwords to employee
badges and driver's licenses -- are used each day to complete various
types of transactions both on-line and in-person, granting individuals a
wide range of physical and digital access privileges. As the number of
identities and related theft rates continue to rise, the ability for
organizations and individuals to trust that people, in fact, "are who
they say they are" has become paramount, particularly in the global
economy.

    IBM's Trusted Identity initiative utilizes the company's security software
technology and deep industry and security expertise from across IBM. It
focuses on helping customers manage the identity lifecycle starting with
the establishment and creation of new relationships through the use and
upkeep of those relationships. These interactions between individuals,
businesses, governments and organizations have evolved with a dependency
on the integrity and strength of identity credentials. By establishing
trusted relationships, and issuing strong, secure credentials,
organizations can use these relationships to their full potential and
reach consumers, employees and constituents in new ways.

    IBM is working with the Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC)
to help provide a security-enhanced driver's license program built on
IBM's Trusted Identity capabilities. ICBC, which is responsible for
driver and vehicle licensing and public insurance in the Canadian
province of British Columbia, has selected IBM to help develop and
produce new, security-enhanced driver's licenses and provincial ID cards
for its customers.

    As a trusted form of government-endorsed photo identification, driver's
licenses are a favorite of identity thieves. Falsified licenses can be
used illegally to obtain a bank account or credit card and gain access to
government services and benefits.

    "A fraudulently obtained driver's license can have serious economic,
security and road safety impacts when used for criminal purposes or by
dangerous drivers who have been prohibited from operating a vehicle," said
Kathy Thomson, manager of provincial licensing, ICBC. "With the help of
IBM, the new, more secure driver's license will help reduce the risk of
these types of issues in the future."

    IBM is the world's leading provider of security and risk management
technologies and expertise. Clients around the world work with IBM to help
reduce the complexities of security and strategically manage risk. IBM's
experience and range of risk and security solutions are unsurpassed --
from dedicated research, software, hardware, services and global business
partner value -- helping clients secure business operations and deploy
company-wide risk management programs.

&lt;p&gt;  IRVINE, CA, Oct 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Vision Solutions, a leading high availability and disaster recovery
solutions provider in IBM Power Systems markets, today announced a
worldwide distribution agreement with IBM (NYSE: IBM) designed to benefit
partners and customers. Effective immediately, IBM will begin
distributing Vision Cluster1(TM) as a flagship enterprise cluster
management solution for the IBM i operating system.

    "With ever-growing collaboration, both companies have agreed to share
intellectual property, further integrate technologies and align
distribution resources more closely," says Vision Solutions' President and
CEO, Nicolaas Vlok. "We continue to innovate with IBM to embrace and
extend technologies throughout the world, enabling partners to bring
improved availability solutions to customers of all sizes."

    Today's announcement includes elements designed to enhance the customer
experience as IBM and Vision continue to work aggressively from their
respective R labs to deliver the next generation of integrated high
availability and disaster recovery solutions for mid-market to enterprise
customers. Vision Solutions has one of the largest IBM Power Systems
support infrastructures in the world, providing 24/7 customer service to
more than 7,000 customers. IBM and Vision Solutions are aligning their
channels to provide unparalleled market coverage and service to
customers. For instance, Vision partners are now able to purchase
Cluster1 and IBM's PowerHA for i from Vision Solutions or IBM, whichever
is easiest.

    Developed in close cooperation with IBM, Vision Cluster1 extends IBM
PowerHA capabilities and adds enhanced monitoring and management
capabilities that support IBM technologies such as Switched Disk, Cross
Site Mirroring and Cluster Services. Cluster1 integrates these IBM
technologies with Logical Replication solutions to provide true
enterprise-class high availability and disaster recovery protection.

    "Too many customers struggle to attain required levels of availability
demanded by today's marketplace," says Ross Mauri, general manager of IBM
Power Systems. "With this announcement, IBM now brings an even more robust
solution to our partners and customers. Our relationship with Vision is
long-standing and continues to prove beneficial for both companies. This
agreement will make it easier for companies of all sizes to obtain
market-leading availability solutions to fit their unique needs."

    "This announcement is welcome news for IBM partners who want to simplify
the deployment of business resiliency solutions on Power Systems," says
Joe Mertens, president of Sirius Computer Solutions, Inc., an IBM and
Vision Solutions business partner. "Customers are the ultimate
beneficiaries of offerings that are better integrated and more easily
acquired and implemented, and then supported by the leading high
availability and disaster recovery solutions provider in IBM Power
Systems markets."

    Vision Cluster1 provides enhanced monitoring and autonomic capabilities
that enable customers to more easily manage complex enterprise
environments and meet aggressive RTOs and RPOs. When bundled with
Vision's logical replication solutions, customers will benefit from an
improved level of protection. Vision Cluster1 includes one-button switch
capabilities that work with or without a logical replication solution.
Vision's certified service providers can greatly simplify the deployment
of complex cluster topologies to ensure solutions are deployed more
efficiently and with less downtime risk. Cluster1 is also backed by 24/7
certified support -- these integrated offerings keep the world's most
valuable IBM i environments highly available.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 1 (Reuters) - American Capital Ltd (ACAS.O) may not be
able to maintain its current dividend rate in the coming
quarters if the market conditions do not improve, JPMorgan
Securities said, while downgrading the buyout firm's stock to
"underweight" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has been generating realized gains by actively
selling its private equity investments and reinvesting capital
in income producing assets, especially subordinated debt,
analyst Jim Ballan wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although it will be able to cover its dividend in 2008 with
the help of these gains, this strategy will be difficult to
execute going forward as the current financial turmoil lowers
valuations for both debt and equities and reduces deal
activity, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballan also said the transfer of investments from private
equity to income producing assets will not be sufficient to
make up the gap between the current regular dividend and cash
net operating income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In order to support its $1.05 quarterly dividend in 2009,
American Capital will need to raise incremental capital, Ballan
noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, he does not expect the company to raise equity
capital at current levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $25.51 Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - European wholesale and investment banks will likely incur 28.4 billion euros of pre-tax writedowns in the second half of 2008, according to J.P. Morgan Securities, which maintained its cautious stance on European banks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyst Kian Abouhossein sees greatest risk of further markdowns from European banks' exposure to U.S. commercial mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate and leveraged loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst forecast 5.7 billion euros of pre-tax writedowns at British bank Lloyds TSB Group Plc (LLOY.L). These estimates include likely writedowns at HBOS Plc HBOS.L, Britain's biggest mortgage lender which Lloyds rescued last month in a $22 billion takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abouhossein also forecast pre-tax writedowns of 4.5 billion euros at Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), 3.7 billion euros at Barclays Plc (BARC.L), 2.7 billion euros at UBS AG (UBSN.VX) and 2.6 billion euros at Societe Generale (SOGN.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.VX) and HSBC Holdings PLC (HSBA.L) will likely take 2.8 billion euros each in pre-tax writedowns, Abouhossein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst expects pre-tax writedowns of 1.7 billion euros at Credit Agricole SA (CAGR.PA) and 1.3 billion euros at BNP Paribas SA (BNPP.PA). France's Natixis SA (CNAT.PA) and British bank Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.L) are expected to incur 1.1 billion euros each in pre-tax writedowns, Abouhossein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Banks that would be at risk of not making a 2008 JPMorgan Core Tier I of 6 percent would be Lloyds TSB, RBS, Barclays and Credit Agricole and hence we see net asset value at risk," Abouhossein said.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 1 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan downgraded Heartland Payment
Systems Inc (HPY.N) to "underweight" from "neutral," saying the
company's U.S. focus and merchant base pose greater earnings
risk compared to its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a relative 'underweight' highlighting our
preference for more globally diverse processors and our
incrementally more cautious stance on the U.S.," analyst
Tien-tsin Huang said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst also warned that new sales could stay
"depressed" and probably decelerate modestly in the third and
fourth quarters for the provider of card services, payroll,
check management and payments solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given the U.S. credit woes, Heartland is challenged with a
tough selling environment and end market, while its lack of
international exposure serves to aggravate its position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $25.56 Tuesday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 1 (Reuters) - European wholesale and investment banks
will likely incur 28.4 billion euros of pre-tax writedowns in
the second half of 2008, according to J.P. Morgan Securities,
which maintained its cautious stance on European banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Kian Abouhossein sees greatest risk of further
markdowns from European banks' exposure to U.S. commercial
mortgage-backed securities, commercial real estate and
leveraged loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst forecast 5.7 billion euros of pre-tax
writedowns at British bank Lloyds TSB Group Plc (LLOY.L). These
estimates include likely writedowns at HBOS Plc HBOS.L,
Britain's biggest mortgage lender which Lloyds rescued last
month in a $22 billion takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Abouhossein also forecast pre-tax writedowns of 4.5 billion
euros at Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), 3.7 billion euros at
Barclays Plc (BARC.L), 2.7 billion euros at UBS AG (UBSN.VX)
and 2.6 billion euros at Societe Generale (SOGN.PA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.VX) and HSBC Holdings PLC
(HSBA.L) will likely take 2.8 billion euros each in pre-tax
writedowns, Abouhossein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst expects pre-tax writedowns of 1.7 billion euros
at Credit Agricole SA (CAGR.PA) and 1.3 billion euros at BNP
Paribas SA (BNPP.PA). France's Natixis SA (CNAT.PA) and British
bank Royal Bank of Scotland Group PLC (RBS.L) are expected to
incur 1.1 billion euros each in pre-tax writedowns, Abouhossein
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Banks that would be at risk of not making a 2008 JPMorgan
Core Tier I of 6 percent would be Lloyds TSB, RBS, Barclays and
Credit Agricole and hence we see net asset value at risk,"
Abouhossein said. Core Tier I capital ratio is a key measure of
financial strength.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would avoid banks with risk to net asset value based on
our detailed analysis of mark to market losses, traditional
asset quality and funding," Abouhossein added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 1038 GMT, the DJ Stoxx European bank index .SX7P was
up 0.5 percent, as some European banks surged on hopes that the
U.S. Senate will pass a new version of the $700 billion banking
bailout package later in the day.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs removed the world's top
steel company ArcelorMittal MTP.PA from its conviction buy
list and cut its price target on the stock by 40 euros to 59
euros, to reflect a lower steel price forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman expects steel prices to fall on lower demand in
2009. It cut its 2009 steel European steel price estimates by 9
percent to an average 723 euros/tonne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After factoring in our revised steel prices and the likely
production cuts the company (ArcelorMittal) will undertake to
support pricing in the expected weak demand environment, the
shares no longer screen as most attractive in our coverage
universe," Goldman wrote in note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It, however, maintained a "buy" rating on the stock. "We
like the company's broad geographic and end-market exposure,
along with high raw material self-sufficiency and a strong
balance sheet," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman removed the the world's largest stainless steel
maker Acerinox (ACX.MC) from its conviction sell list. Shares
of Acerinox have lost 43.2 percent of their value in the last
12 months, while the FTSE World Europe has shed 33 percent,
Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, however, retained a "sell" rating on the
stock, saying it expects the operating environment for
stainless steel companies to remain challenging in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman added Swedish steel company SSAB (SSABa.ST) and
French company Vallourec (VLLP.PA) to its conviction buy and
sell lists, respectively, on valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SSAB's sector-relative underperformance provides a
compelling entry point, while Vallourec shares have the least
potential upside as they are trading at a premium to closest
peer and sector comparables, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage cut its price target on SSAB shares to 171
Swedish crowns from 278 Swedish crowns, and on Vallourec shares
to 156 euros from 190 euros.

WHO:    Lee Dumas, Director of Architecture, Azaleos Corporation and
         Exchange Ranger/MCA
        Dumas has worked in the Microsoft Exchange and the messaging
         industry for 15 years. He has served on the Microsoft
         Exchange development team at Microsoft, and spent seven years
         with Avanade, a global IT consultancy, where he was
         responsible for architecting Exchange deployments, upgrades
         and migrations for large enterprises. Dumas is a Microsoft
         Certified Architect (formerly known as the "Exchange Ranger"
         program). Fewer than 100 people worldwide are certified MCAs.
WHAT:   Choosing the right storage system is critical to a successful
         Exchange deployment. Exchange Server supports three primary
         types of storage technologies: storage area networks (SAN),
         network-attached storage (NAS), and direct-attached storage
         (DAS). In this webinar, Lee Dumas will explain each option
         and its advantages and disadvantages for Exchange Server
         storage management, including:
        -- Why DAS is the current Microsoft recommended storage system
         for Exchange
        -- Why SAN is the best option if cost and complexity are not
         an issue
        -- Why NAS is the best option for branch offices and/or for
         economical and reliable storage

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two customers of Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) sued the Wall Street firm on Thursday, claiming it convinced them to keep buying risky auction rate securities when it knew the market was collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Manhattan said that between July 2006 and August 2007, Goldman sold $3.6 billion of student loan ARS to Bankruptcy Management Solutions Inc and Ocwen Financial Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman represented to BMS and Ocwen that the securities were appropriate for those companies' investment portfolios which, as Goldman knew or consciously and recklessly disregarded, were restricted to safe, highly-liquid investments," the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of the ARS market collapse in February this year, BMS and Ocwen held a combined $236 million in Goldman-brokered student loan auction rate securities, the lawsuit said. These were ARS based on student loans typically supported by government guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Brokers, including Goldman, chose to take action to conceal from investors such as BMS and Ocwen the rapid loss of liquidity from the market by increasing purchases," the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the financial crisis that has changed the landscape of the industry, the two largest investment banks Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), have become bank holding companies, turning away from the high-risk broker model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BMS does most of its business in California providing software, hardware and services to support Chapter 7 bankruptcy trustees. Florida-based Ocwen provides loan servicing and mortgage fulfillment to the financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined comment on the lawsuit, one of several that have been filed by shareholders or customers of banks and investment banks that dealt in auction rate securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were billed as safe, cash-like instruments bought and sold in periodic auctions every 7, 14 or 28 days, but big banks stopped supporting the auctions in January as investor demand for the debt dried up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many investors have been stuck holding the debt, sparking investigations into whether banks sold the securities even as they privately worried market turmoil was making it harder to complete auctions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

disregarded, were restricted to safe, highly-liquid
investments," the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the time of the ARS market collapse in February this
year, BMS and Ocwen held a combined $236 million in
Goldman-brokered student loan auction rate securities, the
lawsuit said. These were ARS based on student loans typically
supported by government guarantees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Brokers, including Goldman, chose to take action to
conceal from investors such as BMS and Ocwen the rapid loss of
liquidity from the market by increasing purchases," the lawsuit
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the financial crisis that has changed the landscape of
the industry, the two largest investment banks Goldman Sachs
and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), have become bank holding companies,
turning away from the high-risk broker model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BMS does most of its business in California providing
software, hardware and services to support Chapter 7 bankruptcy
trustees. Florida-based Ocwen provides loan servicing and
mortgage fulfillment to the financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined comment on the
lawsuit, one of several that have been filed by shareholders or
customers of banks and investment banks that dealt in auction
rate securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They were billed as safe, cash-like instruments bought and
sold in periodic auctions every 7, 14 or 28 days, but big banks
stopped supporting the auctions in January as investor demand
for the debt dried up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many investors have been stuck holding the debt, sparking
investigations into whether banks sold the securities even as
they privately worried market turmoil was making it harder to
complete auctions.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Oct 2 (Reuters) - Mexican President Felipe Calderon, locked in a high-stakes battle with drug cartels, wants to legalize the possession of small amounts of cocaine and marijuana, a plan that will likely irk Washington. Calderon, a conservative in power for nearly two years, sent a proposal to Congress that would also scrap penalties on carrying small amounts of heroin, methamphetamine and opium for personal use. Reviving a similar push by his predecessor, Calderon's bill aims to free up police to hunt for narcotics dealers and smugglers, but it could meet opposition in largely conservative Mexico as well as in the neighboring United States. What we are seeking is to not treat an addict as a criminal, but rather as a sick person and give them psychological and medical treatment, said Sen. Alejandro Gonzalez, head of the Senate's justice committee. Former president Vicente Fox tried to pass a similar bill in 2006 but ditched it after Washington objected and critics both sides of the border said laxer laws could lure drug tourists from north of the border. Calderon's bill would mean people carrying up to 2 grams (0.07 ounces) of marijuana or opium, half a gram of cocaine, 50 milligrams of heroin or 40 milligrams of methamphetamine would not face criminal charges. It would also give Mexican states the power to try drug dealers in local courts, rather than at a federal level. Drug use is much less common among young people in Mexico than in the United States or Europe, but consumption is creeping up with the growth of the middle class and as tighter border controls mean more cocaine is kept back in the country. Calderon has deployed thousands of troops to clamp down on the drug gangs that shuttle Colombian cocaine up and over Mexico's northern border. But cartel violence has soared as a result, killing some 3,000 people this year, including eight that died in a grenade attack, the first major strike on the public by drug hitmen.

&lt;p&gt;Authors Mike Moran, Bill Hunt Update Popular Work with New Advice
         on Social Media, and the Latest Tools and Techniques
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The 2nd edition of Search Engine Marketing, Inc., by experts Mike
Moran and Bill Hunt, reflects the changes currently taking place in
this fast-paced industry while reinforcing the solid business
fundamentals of how search fits into an enterprise's overall goals.

   Search Engine Marketing, Inc.: Driving Search Traffic to Your
Company's Web Site, first published in 2005, has since earned
widespread praise, from both marketers and technical professionals
alike, for its clear instruction and logical step-by-step approach to
search marketing success. Knowledge, hard work, and execution-- rather
than quick fixes-- represent the critical mix for sustained success,
and Mike and Bill lead readers from start to finish.

   The much anticipated new edition has been thoroughly updated, and
includes a section to help marketers understand the increasing
popularity of social media and how it relates to search. Search Engine
Marketing, Inc. is bundled with a DVD including more than two hours of
video presentations.

   Part I of the new edition, "The Basics of Search Marketing,"
covers how search engines work, how search marketing works - both
organic search and paid placement - and closes with a look at the
behavior of searchers themselves. Market share changes, name changes,
and other transformations in the search business are reflected
throughout.

   In Part II, "Develop Your Search Marketing Program," the authors
help readers identify their own web site's goals, track its progress,
and define a formal search marketing strategy. Readers also learn how
to create winning proposals that can be embraced throughout an
organization, and how changes in free keyword tools can help
streamline the planning process.

   Part III, "Execute Your Search Marketing Program," helps readers
determine if their sites are properly indexed (and what to do if
they're not), choose keywords, optimize content for search landing
pages, understand the strategic placement of inbound and outbound
links, and understand the growth and importance of paid search
programs.

   Search Engine Marketing, Inc. concludes with a new "Beyond"
section, to help readers understand the impact on search marketing
from multimedia content, including content created directly by
customers via blogs, and Web 2.0 capabilities such as Facebook and
Twitter. The authors also help readers use their new skills to improve
search engines within their own sites.

   "The impact of social media has exploded since 2005 when we wrote
the first edition, and bringing search strategy into Web 2.0 marketing
activities can reap significant benefits," Moran said.

   Coinciding with the book's publication, the authors were
interviewed by fellow search expert Heather Lloyd-Martin (author of
Successful Search Engine Copywriting) for a 4-part podcast series. The
first podcast is on search marketing basics, the second on changes
since the first edition, the third on social media marketing, and the
last on Web site search.

   In Part 3, Mike and Bill team with noted author David Meerman
Scott (author of The New Rules of Marketing &amp; PR). Visit
www.ibmpressbooks.com/marketing for the entire series.

   "Search is the opportunity of our time because of its ability to

is small, it is simple, it is complex, but most of all it is deeply
monetizable- if done right. That last part is where Search Engine
Marketing, Inc. comes in. Mike and Bill have done a fantastic job of

&lt;p&gt;ESPN2 to Broadcast One-Hour Special on Oct. 8-9, 2008, Featuring the Prequel to Walt Disney Pictures' Upcoming True-Life Sailing Documentary "Morning Light"

    "Morning Light: Making the Cut" Showcases how 15 Young Sailors
          Were Selected for a Once-in-a-Lifetime Opportunity
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Conceivers, producers and executive producers Roy E. Disney and
Leslie DeMeuse recruited 15 young sailors to take on the challenge of
a lifetime -- the 2,500-mile open-ocean Transpac sailing challenge
featured in the upcoming true-life documentary "Morning Light," which
hits theaters nationwide Oct. 17. The story of how those 15 made the
team is captured in a one-hour special "Morning Light: Making the
Cut," airing on ESPN2 Oct. 8-9, 2008.

   "The ESPN2 special is a compelling depiction of 30 kids -- all
passionate about sailing -- who travel to California in hopes of being
selected for an incredible opportunity," says DeMeuse. "But only half
of them will ultimately be selected to spend six months of their lives
training under world-renowned coaches and have a chance to sail what's
perhaps the most revered of open-ocean sailing competitions, the
Transpac," says DeMeuse.

   Adds Disney, "The special captures what these kids had to do to
prove themselves as sailors, as individuals and most importantly, as
members of a team. It leaves viewers wanting more and beginning
October 17, 'Morning Light' will tell the rest of the story."

   The special is slated to air during primetime on the East Coast on
Wednesday, Oct. 8, at 8 p.m. ET (7 p.m. CT, 6 p.m. MT, 5 p.m. PT and 2
p.m. in Hawaii). It airs during primetime on the West Coast Thursday,
Oct. 9, at 9 p.m. PT (6 p.m. Hawaii, 10 p.m. MT, 11 p.m. CT and
midnight 10/10 ET). The program will also air across a variety of ESPN
International networks, including Australia, Africa, Middle East,
Israel, Caribbean and Canada.

   About The Movie

   Fifteen young sailors... six months of intense training... one
chance at the brass ring. This exciting true-life documentary tells
the inspiring story of a group of intrepid and determined young men
and women, on the cusp of adulthood, as they embark on life's first
great adventure. Racing a high-performance 52-foot sloop in the
TRANSPAC, the most revered of open-ocean sailing competitions, the
crew of "Morning Light" matches wits and skills in a dramatic 2500
mile showdown against top professionals. From their earliest training
sessions in Hawaii conducted by world-class teachers through their
test of endurance on the high seas, they form an unbreakable bond in
the process of becoming a singular team that is greater than the sum
of its parts. Directed and edited by two of the key filmmakers
responsible for the recent rock documentary "Amazing Journey: The
Story of the Who," MORNING LIGHT will appeal to the sense of adventure
in everyone.

&lt;p&gt;Four Orleans Parish Schools to Benefit
NEW ORLEANS--(Business Wire)--
The ExxonMobil Foundation announced today a donation of $1.6
million to launch a pilot program in four New Orleans public high
schools to help students prepare for college.

   The donation to Tulane University will establish a training and
incentive program to increase participation in the Advanced Placement
Program(1) at four public high schools in Orleans Parish over the next
five years, starting next spring.

   "We are very proud to help offer this high-impact program to the
students of New Orleans," said Gerald McElvy, president of the
ExxonMobil Foundation. "Preparing students for college is critical to
New Orleans, Louisiana and the nation. This program has the necessary
tools and our partners have the necessary resources to make this a
huge success."

   Today's announcement took place at John McDonogh High School, one
of the first schools selected to pilot the program.

   "We have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to transform public
education in New Orleans. This generous gift from ExxonMobil hastens
the day when our school system will serve as a model for other cities
around the country," said Scott Cowen, president of Tulane University,
who accepted the donation on behalf of the Scott S. Cowen Institute
for Public Education Initiatives at Tulane University.

   The Cowen Institute will launch and provide ongoing oversight for
the program with a full-time staff member and additional resources.
Program support will be provided by the National Math and Science
Initiative, a non-profit launched in 2007 to help America regain its
global leadership position in technological innovation. ExxonMobil was
the founding sponsor with a commitment of $125 million.

   Superintendent of the Recovery School District, Paul Vallas, also
attended the announcement, along with participating high school
principals, teachers and counselors.

   "We are thrilled that this outstanding program is launching in
four New Orleans high schools. To have these highly trained teachers
providing our students with the tools they need to get into college is
a huge step forward for our education system," Superintendent Vallas
said.

   The Advanced Placement Program (AP(1)), administered by the
College Board, is one of the leading programs available to prepare
high school students for higher education. High school students who do
well in AP classes and pass the AP Exam attain college level skills
and have the opportunity to obtain college credits. The training and
incentive program used to increase participation in the Advanced
Placement Program has worked successfully in school districts across
the United States and is proven to significantly increase college
readiness. According to research done by the National Center for
Educational Accountability (NCEA), students passing AP Exams are three
times more likely to earn a college degree than students who do not
pass. And African-American and Hispanic students who pass an AP Exam
are four times more likely to earn a college degree than those who do
not.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from Chevron, paragraph 5)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tume Ahemba&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAGOS Oct 2 (Reuters) - Nigerian blue-collar oil workers'
union NUPENG said on Thursday it had extended a deadline for
threatened strike action over a labour dispute at U.S. oil firm
Chevron (CVX.N) until next Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The deadline was supposed to expire on Wednesday. But
because of the public holidays and to give room for dialogue,
we extended the deadline to next Wednesday," said Williams
Akporeha, the head of NUPENG in the oil hub of Warri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The NUPENG branch in Warri is demanding that casual staff
working for Chevron be given permanent contracts so they can
enjoy full employment benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has warned it will launch a strike targeting production
if the dispute is not resolved before the ultimatum expires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Progress is being made in the company's engagement with
all parties to resolve the issues through dialogue and respect
for rule of law," Chevron spokesman Scott Walker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Akporeha said most of the contract staff were production
staff at Escravos, where Chevron operates an export terminal
and oilfields, and at deep off-shore facilities. Any strike
would target those operations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Management is trying to engage us in a discussion but they
haven't called a meeting yet. We hope they will do so soon to
avert a strike," Akporeha told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, began
production at its Agbami offshore field in late July. It said
then that production was due to be ramped up to around 100,000
barrels per day (bpd) by early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At normal rates of production, Escravos output is around
300,000 bpd.

&lt;p&gt;Sogeti Group Selected by Microsoft(R) Corporation to Be a Key Partner in Their Windows Vista(R) Application Compatibility Factory Program

DAYTON, Ohio--(Business Wire)--
Sogeti Group, a leading international provider of professional IT
services and member of the Capgemini Group, has been selected by
Microsoft Corporation to be a key service partner in their Windows
Vista Application Compatibility Factory program. This initiative teams
Microsoft with a very select number of System Integrators to help
customers prepare for the Windows Vista operating system.

   As most enterprises have hundreds - even thousands - of
applications, application compatibility is one very practical concern
of organizations that are getting ready to roll out Windows Vista.
Microsoft's Windows Vista Application Compatibility Factory (ACF)
program helps enterprises assess and remediate their existing
applications to ensure Windows Vista compatibility and accelerate
rollout.

   As a global service provider for this program, Sogeti's dedicated
network of expert ACF consultants will supplement its existing global
team of 6,000 Microsoft practice engineers currently delivering
Sogeti's proven business methodologies worldwide.

   According to Michael Del Sarto, Group Marketing Manager from the
Windows Client Marketing Team, Microsoft, "Microsoft recognizes that
compatibility of in-house developed applications can be a barrier to
deployment of Windows Vista(R) across the enterprise. Sogeti Group, as
a Microsoft Gold Certified partner and now also an ACF partner, will
work with clients to identify the application compatibility obstacles,
assess application inventory, determine the best course of action and
conduct remediation services. All ACF partners including Sogeti have
participated in the latest Windows Vista training and can also assist
with Windows Vista deployment."

   "Clients are increasingly looking for enhanced productivity and
optimization of their infrastructure investment and application
compatibility, particularly of customized business-critical
applications, is a key issue", says Sanjeev Agarwal, Vice President of
Sogeti's Global Microsoft Alliance. "The ACF program reduces the
complexity and speeds up the process, so that enterprises can benefit
more quickly from the benefits that Vista can provide,
enterprise-wide."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds table with rating and price target changes)

 Oct 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded software makers
NetSuite (N.N) and CommVault (CVLT.O), as it expects demand to
slacken amid slowing U.S. economic conditions.

 The brokerage also removed Citrix Systems (CTXS.O) from its
conviction buy list. But Goldman maintained a "buy" rating on
the stock, and said Citrix's strength in virtualization, which
allows a single computer to act like many "virtual" machines,
make it an attractive potential takeover target for larger
companies.

 Goldman added Akamai Technologies Inc (AKAM.O), which
provides services that help speed delivery of Web content, to
its conviction sell list due to concerns about increasing
competition and pricing pressure.

 But the brokerage, which downgraded NetSuite (N.N) to
"sell" from "neutral" and CommVault (CVLT.O) to "neutral" from
"buy," added Oracle Corp ORCL.O, the world's third-largest
software maker, to its conviction buy list.

 Goldman cited Oracle's broad mix of products and geographic
exposure, among other factors, for the move.

 The brokerage also upgraded Digital River (DRIV.O), which
manages online businesses, to "neutral" from "sell" on
valuation.

 The following table lists the rating and price target
changes made by Goldman on various technology companies:

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - The Pfizer Inc. AIDS drug maraviroc helps thwart the HIV virus in nearly half of people who have developed resistance to other treatments, according to two related studies published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At least 42 percent of patients in Europe, North America and Australia who took maraviroc once or twice a day on top of standard drug cocktails had blood virus counts below levels that cause visible damage to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 18 percent of patients who got a placebo plus a standard HIV drug combination got their viral levels that low over the 48 weeks that have been studied so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, 1,049 volunteers who were resistant to three of the six classes of HIV drugs were involved in the two Pfizer-sponsored studies, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts have said maraviroc could be worth $500 million to Pfizer by 2011. Marketed as Celsentri in Europe and Selzentry in the United States, it was approved a year ago based on 24-week results from the two studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maraviroc stops the virus from getting into the immune cells it affects by blocking a doorway called the CCR5 co-receptor. It was given with other HIV drugs that target the ability of the virus to replicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volunteers, all with advanced human immunodeficiency virus infections, were screened to be sure they carried a strain of the virus that uses CCR5. More than half of infected people do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said maraviroc did not produce any unusual side effects and, although the drug carries a warning about possible liver problems, "our study simply didn't see liver toxicity, so that's reassuring," said Dr. Roy Gulick of the Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York, who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a telephone interview, Gulick said the liver warning was "based on a single case, and that patient had a lot of complicating factors, so there are other possible reasons why they ran into liver trouble."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An estimated 33 million people worldwide are infected with HIV. There is no cure and no vaccine, although a drug cocktail can help control infection and keep people healthy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the virus mutates constantly and usually becomes resistant to the drugs after a while, meaning patients must switch to different cocktails. AIDS experts say they need constant new additions to the list of 20 or so existing HIV drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maraviroc belongs to a new class of these drugs, called HIV entry inhibitors or CCR5 receptor antagonists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gulick said results from the 96-week mark are now being analyzed and may be presented at a scientific meeting in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Maggie Fox and John O'Callaghan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 2 (Reuters) - Wedbush Morgan Securities downgraded
Akamai Technologies Inc (AKAM.O) to "hold" from "buy," saying
weak economy and competition could weigh on the company's
financial performance resulting in weaker-than-expected
outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs also downgraded the stock to "sell" from
"neutral," according to theflyonthewall.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Akamai, which provides services that help speed
delivery of Web content, fell as much as 12 percent following
the rating cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wedbush said it expects traffic growth for Akamai's media
and entertainment segment to remain challenged as the economy
decelerates. The slowing traffic growth at the segment is
partially due to budget reductions at its customers, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A more competitive market has shortened contract lengths,
pushed contract terms toward annual commitments, and led to
more fixed rate pricing, Wedbush analyst Kerry Rice said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Akamai became more price competitive, we would expect
margins to erode," Rice said, adding that the company's gross
margin has declined since 2005 due to the competitive pricing
environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wedbush, which cut its price target on the stock by $3 to
$20, said it reduced its estimates for the company to reflect
the expected impact of the macro economic pressures and
increasing competition on fiscal 2009 outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's shares fell 10 percent to $15.41 in morning
trade on Nasdaq. They had touched a low of $15.10 earlier.

&lt;p&gt;  SEOUL, KOREA, Oct 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) and IBM Korea (NYSE: IBM) today
announced the completion of IBK's mainframe migration project to IBM
System z10, which was done to help the bank create an advanced IT
environment as the foundation for its new enterprise data center.

    IBM provided the Industrial Bank of Korea with six z10 Enterprise Class
(EC) mainframes, IBM's latest mainframe offering announced in February
2008. The Industrial Bank of Korea migrated from an infrastructure of IBM
z9 mainframes, without any service breaks.

    With the System z10, IBK can now run 50 percent faster, have 70 percent
more capacity and three times the memory, compared to the System z9. IBK
required operational stability and mandatory capacity of its mainframe to
support sustainable growth and to respond to the fast changing financial
services environment.

    JungHoon Sung, Manager of IT System Planning of IBK, said, "The success of
IBK's System z10 migration was based on our great partnership with IBM in
Korea which helped secure mandatory capacity for mainframe, reduce TCO and
improve system stability, efficiency, and liability. We expect innovation
in client service through the great capability of IBM System z10."

    Sukyoung Kang, Director of Financial Services Sector of IBM Korea, said,
"IBK's System z10 migration project is the first case of introducing the
System z10 in the financial services industry of Korea. This is an
indication that markets continue to recognize the power of System z10 to
help them transform their entire data center, providing the automation
ability for IT resource management and tracking in the rapidly changing
business environment."

    The agreement was signed in June 2008.

&lt;p&gt;  TOKYO, Oct 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM Japan (NYSE: IBM) today announced it has signed agreements with the
Chiba Bank Ltd, the Daishi Bank Ltd, and the Hokkoku Bank Ltd to build a
Call Center System common for the three banks.

    The agreement was signed as a part of the TSUBASA project to examine
system integration between the five banks of Chiba Bank, Daishi Bank,
Hokkoku Bank, the Chuugoku Bank Ltd and The Iyo Bank Ltd. This initiative
is expected to create new value through open cooperation across multiple
regions and has been named the TSUBASA project after the Japanese word for
"wing."

    Chiba Bank, Daishi Bank, and Hokkoku Bank have agreed for collaboration
development for the system as their call center system contracts were up
for renewal. IBM Japan will launch the system development starting in
October 2008. The system will be in operation at each bank from November
2009 to March 2010.

    This Call Center System will be developed by utilizing the system
infrastructure of "IBM(R) Channel Sharing Center Service" the outsourcing
service, created by IBM Global Business Services, to share unified
channels of internet and voice for multiple financial institutions. By
combining system infrastructure for servers and telephone switching
devices, it can decrease maintenance cost of the system and improve
operational quality. Compared to having each bank develop and utilize its
own system separately, the collaboration development will not only reduce
the development cost per bank, but also achieve the flexibility to manage
future system enhancement for new products and services.

    With system operation and application maintenance services, provided by
IBM Japan, the IBM Channel Sharing Center Service environment will handle
telephone devices and transactions in call centers of financial
institutions. Also by utilizing both function types of internet and voice,
customer service can be enhanced through the link of internet and call
center. IBM Japan will actively develop and extend services of Call Center
System also for other banks.

    The agreements were signed in September of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS/LONDON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is opening three research centers in Europe as it steps up efforts to catch market leader Google Inc in the field of Internet searching, the U.S. software group said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which failed several times to acquire search company Yahoo! Inc, said the new European search technology center would have hubs in Paris, London and Munich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It added its budget for research and development in Europe, which currently stands at $600 million a year, would increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are the challenger, not the leader, in search, but we believe strongly that search is in its infancy and there is so much room for innovation," Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told a news conference in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For companies like Microsoft search is the key for unlocking huge new opportunities in advertising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer declined to say how much the group would invest in the research centers announced today, but said that "over the next few years we expect to employ several hundred people, software developers, in these centers in Europe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking alongside Ballmer, French Economy Minister Christine Lagarde said the new French facility, to be based in Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris, would be up and running by around March 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lagarde added that Microsoft would benefit from a tax credit scheme aimed at encouraging RD investment. For every 100 euros invested by the U.S. group, it would get 30 euros back from the French state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said the investments announced on Thursday would bring the group's research presence in Europe to 2,000 engineers, taking the top spot in regions outside the United States, a little ahead of China and with India at number three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In many ways it's an interesting time, though, to be talking about investment at all. I was talking to the minister a little bit about the current economic uncertainties and investing in anything today can, I think, be a bit of a hard sell," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CATCHING UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has about 2 percent of the European online search market, according to Web research firm ComScore, compared with Google's 79 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. group recently bought UK mapping specialist Multimap, Germany-based price comparison site Ciao and Norwegian enterprise search company FAST as it tries to establish a niche in particular search areas used for such purposes as shopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Reuters, Jean-Philippe Courtois, President of Microsoft International -- operations outside the U.S. and Canada -- said the $2 billion worth of acquisitions of Internet-based companies in Europe over the past 12 months were complete or nearing completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We keep looking at a lot of great start-up companies in Europe and other parts of the world and I am sure there will be some more to come in the next 12 months," Courtois said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon and Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Chemical Completes Exxsol(TM) Hydrocarbon Fluids Capacity Expansion in Singapore

SINGAPORE--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical has completed a 130,000 tons per year capacity
expansion at its Exxsol hydrocarbon fluids plant in Jurong Island,
Singapore, increasing capacity at this site to more than 500,000 tons
per year. The new capacity is designed to meet demand for
differentiated hydrocarbon fluid products in Asia Pacific, which is
growing at an estimated rate of six percent per year.

   The capacity expansion will provide customers with access to
higher volumes of ExxonMobil Chemical's Exxsol series of
differentiated fluids, and its broader portfolio of hydrocarbon fluids
including Isopar(TM) and Solvesso(TM). Exxsol fluids are specifically
formulated to meet diverse customer needs in applications such as
drilling mud oil, metal working, polymer processing, industrial
cleaning, adhesives, coatings, household products and mining.

   "This expansion reinforces ExxonMobil Chemical's commitment to
meeting the hydrocarbon fluid needs of its global customers and those
in Asia Pacific where growth is particularly strong," said Elissa
Sterry, vice president, Intermediates Global Business, ExxonMobil
Chemical Company.

   Increasing demand in Asia Pacific is a result of strong industrial
growth accompanied by rising awareness of health, safety and
environmental issues and the future consolidation of different
regulatory requirements under the Globally Harmonized System (GHS).
ExxonMobil Chemical's Exxsol hydrocarbon fluids and de-aromatized
fluids portfolios position the company to meet or exceed increasingly
stringent regulations and environmental requirements.

   "The Exxsol D range of products delivers low odor, reduced
toxicity and is not classified as dangerous for the environment under
EU regulations. With significantly lower exposure risks compared to
traditional solvents, worker protection and comfort is enhanced which
can improve productivity," said Ronan O'Flaherty, fluids global
marketing manager, ExxonMobil Chemical Company. "Through product
development technology, ExxonMobil Chemical is committed to helping
customers protect worker and end-user health, and to helping brand
owners meet their sustainability targets while reducing operating
costs."

   The Singapore facility complements ExxonMobil Chemical's two other
world-class hydrocarbon fluid manufacturing plants located in Baytown,
Texas and Antwerp, Belgium. In March 2007, ExxonMobil Chemical
announced an expansion at the Antwerp plant.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, more details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Matt Gil and Georgina Prodhan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS/LONDON Oct 2 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is
opening three research centres in Europe as it steps up efforts
to catch market leader Google Inc (GOOG.O) in the field of
Internet searching, the U.S. software group said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which failed several times to acquire search
company Yahoo! Inc (YHOO.O), said the new European search
technology centre would have hubs in Paris, London and Munich.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It added its budget for research and development in Europe,
which currently stands at $600 million a year, would increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are the challenger, not the leader, in search, but we
believe strongly that search is in its infancy and there is so
much room for innovation," Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told a
news conference in  Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For companies like Microsoft search is the key for
unlocking huge new opportunities in advertising."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer declined to say how much the group would invest in
the research centres announced today, but said that "over the
next few years we expect to employ several hundred people,
software developers, in these centres in Europe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking alongside Ballmer, French Economy Minister
Christine Lagarde said the new French facility, to be based in
Issy-les-Moulineaux, near Paris, would be up and running by
around March 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lagarde added that Microsoft would benefit from a tax credit
scheme aimed at encouraging RD investment. For every 100 euros
invested by the U.S. group, it would get 30 euros back from the
French state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said the investments announced on Thursday would
bring the group's research presence in Europe to 2,000
engineers, taking the top spot in regions outside the United
States, a little ahead of China and with India at number three.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In many ways it's an interesting time, though, to be
talking about investment at all. I was talking to the minister a
little bit about the current economic uncertainties and
investing in anything today can, I think, be a bit of a hard
sell," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CATCHING UP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has about 2 percent of the European online search
market, according to Web research firm ComScore, compared with
Google's 79 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. group recently bought UK mapping specialist
Multimap, Germany-based price comparison site Ciao and Norwegian
enterprise search company FAST as it tries to establish a niche
in particular search areas used for such purposes as shopping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview with Reuters, Jean-Philippe Courtois,
President of Microsoft International -- operations outside the
U.S. and Canada -- said the $2 billion worth of acquisitions of
Internet-based companies in Europe over the past 12 months were
complete or nearing completion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We keep looking at a lot of great start-up companies in
Europe and other parts of the world and I am sure there will be
some more to come in the next 12 months," Courtois said.

&lt;p&gt;  MONTREAL, Oct 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Sainte-Justine Hospital has provided its physicians and care providers in
the Hematology/Oncology department with an advanced mobile communications
technology in collaboration with IBM (NYSE: IBM).

    Sainte-Justine Hospital will become the first French speaking hospital in
Quebec and the first French-language hospital in Canada to use the
wireless, hand-free devices from Vocera Communications Technology. The
French-language version of this technology was introduced in 2007.

    It can be difficult for healthcare providers to quickly contact a
colleague, who may be anywhere on the floor or in the hospital. The new
communications system will allow for instant communication through
lightweight, wearable, voice-activated badges. The devices can also relay
text messages and alerts.

    The communicator, developed by Vocera Communications Inc. and implemented
by IBM, can increase staff productivity, save time and improve patient
care response times. The Sainte-Justine medical technologies evaluation
unit is currently studying the communicator to determine the gains
resulting from the introduction of such technology. Since the
communicators were rolled out, physicians and other health care
professionals have been able to quickly and easily connect, through voice
commands, without stopping what they are doing to look for colleagues or
place a phone call.

    "Patient care for our young patients is our priority and our organization
is continually looking for ways to increase the time spent at the
patient's bedside," said Dr. Michel Duval, Chief of the
Hematology/Oncology department at Sainte-Justine. "The results of the
initial deployment phase for this technology are promising and may allow
us to roll it out to other Sainte-Justine departments. In the future,
this technology will be linked to vital sign and alert monitoring
systems, so that medical staff will be able to monitor patients at their
bedsides or remotely. Vocera was implemented at Sainte-Justine Hospital
thanks to the generous donation of Marc and Tracey Bibeau, who raised the
funds during the 'Golf Legends for Children' event, which featured
internationally-renowned golf players Jack Nicklaus and Gary Player."

    IBM Canada is the exclusive distributor-integrator of the French-language
version of the Vocera communication devices.

    About Sainte-Justine Hospital

    Sainte-Justine Hospital is the largest mother-child centre in Canada and
one of the four major pediatric centers in North America. The hospital has
450 beds, 19,000 admissions and receives 260,000 patients at the
outpatient clinic every year. The workforce is made up of more than 4,000
employees. Sainte-Justine Hospital is associated with Universite de
Montreal and is the largest pediatric training center in Quebec and a
leader in Canada. Each year, the hospital receives some 4,000 students.
Saint-Justine Hospital and its research center have a considerable
international reach. The hospital celebrated its 100th anniversary in
2007 and last December, it received accreditation as a Health Promoting
Hospital from the World Health Organization (WHO).

with doctors and clinics to implement the Company's proprietary digital

prescriptions are routed directly and securely from the physician's office

center services. The suite of software includes digiRX, digiRxStream,
digiReauth, digiRxComp, and digiAccounting.

&lt;p&gt;New IBM Cognos Analytic Application Enables Quick, Actionable Insights into Financial Performance

   -- IBM Cognos 8 Financial Performance Analytics offers users the
 flexibility to easily adapt and configure a wide spectrum of reports
                  as fast as their business changes -
BURLINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Cognos, an IBM (NYSE:IBM) company and the world leader in business
intelligence and performance management, today unveiled a new analytic
application designed to provide organizations with fast, actionable
insights into financial performance using fully-configurable reports.

   Many organizations today use ERP systems that do not provide
management the critical financial visibility they need to ensure the
business is performing against strategic objectives. Analytic
applications provide a more cost-effective means to accessing and
making sense of ERP data, offering packaged, flexible reporting and
analysis complete with out-of-the-box metrics and indicators designed
to help management isolate the underlying causes of changes in
business performance and act accordingly before it is too late.

   IBM Cognos 8 Financial Performance Analytics for J.D. Edwards and
Oracle E-Business Suite is a packaged business intelligence (BI)
application that grants line of business managers immediate,
up-to-date information on their department's financial performance,
cash flow, and vendor relationships, facilitating cross-functional
analysis and driving more consistent reporting.

   Built on an open, services oriented architecture platform, IBM
Cognos 8 Financial Performance Analytics includes configurable
connectors to popular ERPs and other data sources; an adaptable data
warehouse with a dimensional data model specifically for performing
financial analysis; and a complete spectrum of packaged reports and
analytics that can be easily adapted to reflect a company's financial
management best practices, and modified as quickly as business
evolves.

   "Other analytic applications in the market today trumpet the sheer
quantity of packaged reports they offer, but in most cases, they can
only be customized through expensive, time-consuming and often
error-prone means. With IBM Cognos 8 Financial Performance Analytics,
organizations benefit from a core set of packaged financial reports
that is completely adaptable to their ever-changing business needs,
enabling accelerated decision-making and providing the deep,
operational transparency they need," said Doug Barton, vice-president
of product marketing at Cognos. "With its pre-constructed data
extractions, best-fit data models, and proven business intelligence
layer, IBM Cognos 8 Financial Performance Analytics empowers today's
enterprises to work effectively with time-sensitive, trusted
information in faster cycles of accounting and control and business
performance management."

   Consisting of Accounts Receivable, Accounts Payable and General
Ledger analysis modules, IBM Cognos 8 Financial Performance Analytics
consolidates information from disparate financial data sources into
standard reporting formats, arming managers with at-a-glance insights
into key analysis areas such as planning and performance
effectiveness, receivables and payable risk, cash management, and
invoice activity. With information in hand, management can then make
the necessary adjustments to plans to mitigate risk and ensure
corporate objectives are on target.

   Based on the IBM Cognos 8 platform, IBM Cognos 8 Financial
Performance Analytics enables users to extend their information by
capitalizing on IBM Cognos' rich spectrum of performance management
capabilities - including analysis, scorecarding, dashboarding and
multi-dimensional planning - to drive greater business value.

   "IBM Cognos 8 Financial Performance Analytics lets users easily
monitor metrics and quickly identify performance discrepancies in the
spirit of driving greater organizational efficiencies and
productivity. I was particularly impressed with how simple it was to
adapt reports and metrics as business factors changed. In the past,
this style of quick, in-depth reporting would have required a lot of
coding and ETL expertise. With IBM Cognos, it's all GUI -- just drag
and drop. It's incredibly simple," said Ed Leduke, business
intelligence manager at Ferraz Shawmut, a division of France-based
Carbone Lorraine and a global provider of low and medium voltage
industrial fuse and fusegear, as well as thermal management for power
electronics and power interconnection solutions.

   IBM Cognos 8 Financial Performance Analytics is the latest
offering from the suite of IBM Cognos 8 Analytic Applications, joining
IBM Cognos 8 Workforce Performance, which was first unveiled in April
2006. Built upon a single, common foundation for enterprise wide
business performance management, IBM Cognos 8 Analytic Applications
are reporting and analysis applications that help increase resource
productivity and reduce process inefficiencies by delivering a single,
integrated, 360-degree view of an organization's business operations.

   IBM Cognos 8 Analytic Applications are a key component of IBM's
Information Agenda, a new approach to information management
consisting of industry-specific software and consulting services
geared to helping customers use information as a strategic asset
across their businesses.

   Availability:

   IBM Cognos 8 Financial Performance General Ledger Analytics, IBM
Cognos 8 Financial Performance Receivables Analytics, and IBM Cognos 8
Financial Performance Payables Analytics will be available in
mid-October, either direct from Cognos or its network of resellers
worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled new software that helps midsize companies
detect vulnerabilities that can lead to costly security breeches, improve
organizational productivity, and secure data while maintaining compliance
with mandatory business regulations.

    Midsize companies face the same security risks as their larger
counterparts. However they typically have small IT teams, limited budgets
and can lack necessary resources, making their applications vulnerable to
security threats. IBM is focused on helping midsize businesses meet these
challenges while managing compliance to an ever evolving array of
regulatory mandates.

    Recent findings from the IBM Global CEO Study show that a secure,
reliable infrastructure is key to becoming a leading enterprise of the
future. In addition, regulatory compliance is one of the primary
challenges faced by midsize organizations. According to Forrester
Research, regulatory compliance is a priority for 67% of small and
midsize businesses although most admit they are not yet fully
compliant(1). In addition, according to a recent IBM ISS Threat Report,
54% of all vulnerabilities disclosed in the first-half of 2008 were
Web-based.

    IBM's new software, IBM Rational AppScan Express Edition, helps companies
address both external and internal Web security threats before they
impact the business. In addition, the software helps small and midsize
businesses manage Web security and comply with mandatory regulations
including the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard or the Health
Insurance Portability and Accountability Act.

    For example, it is mandatory for organizations that process credit card
payments to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard,
a standard for compliance to prevent credit card fraud, hacking and
various other security vulnerabilities and threats. As midsize businesses
increasingly move to software as a service models, there are potential
risks that their customer's information could be compromised. To avoid
this issue, midsize companies are looking for ways to comply with this
standard, which in turn, will ensure the protection of customer data.

    Rational AppScan Express Edition, the latest software addition to IBM's
Express Advantage portfolio, is an automated security testing solution
that enables users to test for Web application security vulnerabilities.
It also provides streamlined advice on how to fix these issues.

    "IBM continues to offer comprehensive and cost-effective solutions through
the Express Advantage portfolio to our businesses' partners enabling them
to meet the needs of their customers as well as address their challenges,"
said Steve Solazzo, general manager, IBM General Business. "We are
determined to ensure the safety of data for our business partner ecosystem
and, in turn, their customers."

    The latest Rational offering, coupled with the expansion of Express
Advantage threat mitigation services into several new countries this year,
address the growing need for tools and services that midsize companies
require to secure their data while maintaining compliance with mandatory
business regulations. They also complement existing security solutions
created specifically to meet the needs of the midmarket, across IBM
Tivoli, Rational and ISS software.

    Midmarket Threat Mitigation Services experience rapid growth

    Since their launch in April 2008, the  Express Multi-Function Security
Bundle and Express Managed Multi-Function Security Bundle have expanded
into a number of new countries including Greece, Israel, Turkey,
Luxembourg, Philippines, Indonesia, and Vietnam.

    Express Multi-Function Security Bundle provides the most complete
protection against network threats, vulnerabilities, worms, viruses,
spy-ware and spam in a single unified threat management appliance
solution.

    Express Managed Multi-Function Security Bundle was developed for clients
who prefer a fully managed multi-function security solution. IBM is
delivering a service that provides 24/7 comprehensive protection,
monitoring, and supports a broad array of security needs including:
firewall, VPN, behavioral &amp; signature antivirus, intrusion prevention
security (IPS), anti-spam, and Web filtering.

    The offerings now include new enhancements to secure remote access with
Secure Sockets Layer virtual private network (SSL VPN) to employees while
delivering tight security controls to IT. This allows more flexibility to
connect to the Internet from home, the local coffee shop or when on the
road, while ensuring data security. They also contain several firewall
enhancements and usability upgrades that include drag and drop firewall
rule interface and graphical reports in the web user interface. With the
new enhancements midmarket companies are equipped with the tools and
services necessary to stay ahead of security threats and compliance
requirements.

    "In recent years we have recognized that standard firewalls, antivirus
solutions, and other typical security systems are no longer adequate to
protect our operational systems or data from being compromised," said Joao
Patrao, IT Director from SUMA. "Partnering with IBM has helped us sleep
better at night, knowing that our data is protected, that we are in
compliance with regulations, and that we get real value from our security
investments."

    Safe and Sound with Express Advantage

    IBM's Express Advantage portfolio offers midmarket companies solutions
designed to meet their needs with customizable, affordable and
easy-to-manage security platforms. These comprehensive and cost-effective
offerings help companies identify and avoid security threats before they
impact the business. IBM's solutions help midsize companies:


--  Understand their security exposures and define the actions needed to
minimize threats
--  Safeguard all types of critical data while meeting regulatory
compliance requirements
--  Ensure that core IT systems and applications are highly available, and
recoverable in the event of any disaster.

    
IBM Express Advantage combines a comprehensive portfolio of technology
offerings, business solutions and financing options with a network of
local IBM Business Partners and dedicated Concierge customer support
service to create a powerful, end-to-end approach for helping the
mid-sized customer increase efficiency, advance their innovation agenda
and grow.

    IBM continues to leverage these capabilities to differentiate itself in
the marketplace and drive growth in the $253 billion midmarket, one of
IBM's largest and fastest growing market opportunities.

    New Tool for Midmarket to Identify Security Vulnerabilities and Address
Pain Points

    IBM has partnered with the Aberdeen Group to develop the IT Security
Assessment Tool for midsize companies to help assess the existing IT
infrastructure and determine where they may be vulnerable. The online tool
provides them with suggestions on how they can improve their IT security
based on Aberdeen's market research.

    The assessment tool asks companies to prioritize their top pain points and
identify their current capabilities and technologies. Their answers are
compared to those from companies that have strong security infrastructures
and are consistently compliant with business regulations. The companies
can see how they compare in terms of capabilities and technologies. The
tool then makes recommendations on areas for improvement and provides
them with a detailed report that can help identify where they can improve
their security infrastructure and in turn their compliance to mandatory
business regulations.

&lt;p&gt;-IBM Cognos 8 Business Viewpoint provides business users with a
single place to create, maintain, govern and share business dimensions
            for a consistent view of business performance-
BURLINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Cognos, an IBM (NYSE: IBM) company in business intelligence and
performance management solutions, today unveiled new collaborative
business modeling software for business users to create, maintain,
govern and share business perspectives and quickly organize strategic
information for improved decision-making and performance management.

   IBM Cognos 8 Business Viewpoint is a new performance management
offering that addresses the increasing globalization, industry
consolidation and data governance challenges today's businesses face.
These modern organizations need an intuitive, workflow-oriented
business process that lets financial analysts, line and brand managers
or data modelers structure their own view of key information and
supports the multiple levels of authorization required to manage
business performance across the organization. These capabilities are
essential whether the organization is determining an effective way to
standardize relationships between operating companies, or managing
product and customer dimensions and their associated roll-up
structures.

   IBM Cognos 8 Business Viewpoint provides the business user with
comprehensive dimension management capabilities that helps them
maintain collections of business hierarchies and dimensions to yield
new insights, easily reach all data, and quickly align both systems
and people to the latest view of the business across finance and
operations. For example, operations managers might want their sales
hierarchies to reflect the latest re-organization, while financial
analysts might want to re-align their cost centers so they have
visibility to both the planned and actual views.

   The product is complementary to master data management solutions,
like IBM InfoSphere MDM Server, which synchronize master data domains
such as customers and products across operational and transactional
systems enterprise-wide. Specifically designed for performance
management, IBM Cognos 8 Business Viewpoint enables business users to
manage the constantly changing dimensions that are most important to
their business role for a consistent, shared viewpoint on results,
operations and strategy. These dimensions could be associated with
current or future cross-organizational views of reports, plans or
forecasts for business domains such as cost centers, channels or
financial assets.

   "With IBM Cognos 8 Business Viewpoint, it is easy to see how our
product managers could modify business dimensions by altering their
view of product lines and reviewing how their changes affect the other
parts of the business," said Paul Epp, Cognos Applications Manager,
Graymont. "Without disrupting the underlying data or troubling IT, our
business users could nominate how product lines can be remixed through
a simple drag and drop process and then create a workflow to ensure
that the right business owner is alerted to the proposed changes and
has a chance to approve the recommendations."

   IBM Cognos 8 Business Viewpoint is built on the IBM Cognos 8
enterprise-class platform. Its modern, SOA architecture provides an
open approach to data access so architects can leverage existing
standards and business process management solutions. Changes to
dimensions can be tracked back through IBM Cognos 8 Planning and IBM
Cognos 8 Business Intelligence so business analysts and system
administrators can validate proposed changes and make master
dimensions available for reporting, analysis, enterprise planning and
dashboards across the entire performance management system.

   To address governance and data integrity, IBM Cognos 8 Business
Viewpoint centrally stores dimensions to enable a common view across
the organization. It also replaces any manual efforts with reviewable,
automated and auditable processes. This lets data stewards or business
analysts ensure compliance with organizational and external governance
standards. A documented audit trail provides one-click access to data
lineage while security features ensure proper version control and
management oversight on changes and approvals to maintain system
integrity. The workflow also supports collaboration and approvals
across multiple sets of users.

   "As an IT manager, IBM Cognos 8 Business Viewpoint alleviates my
concerns knowing that select users can access the appropriate
dimensions in accordance with our established security and
administration policies," said Susan Dean, Director, Business
Intelligence, MedAssets. "We can confidently and securely enable
deeper collaboration, faster analysis and adaptability for our
business users on our existing, trusted performance management
platform, without the need to burden previously engaged IT resources
in the day-to-day changes to business views."

   "IBM Cognos 8 Business Viewpoint aligns the business to own and
operate dimensions on their own terms," said Leah MacMillan,
vice-president, product marketing, Cognos, an IBM Company. "This new
addition to our portfolio lets the domain experts work at the speed of
the business and powers a more dynamic decision-making process across
business functions - whether it is a financial analyst nominating
changes to the chart of accounts workflow or a product manager moving
consumer products into different business groups and analyzing the
associated impact."

   IBM Cognos 8 Business Viewpoint extends the performance management
capabilities of IBM Cognos 8 v4, announced today. See today's related
release at: (http://www.cognos.com/news/releases/2008/1002-1.html). It
is a key component of IBM's Information Agenda, a new approach
consisting of industry-specific software and consulting services
geared to helping customers use information on demand as a strategic
asset across their businesses.

   Availability:

   IBM Cognos 8 Business Viewpoint will be available in Q4, 2008.

&lt;p&gt;New Cognos 8 Go! Dashboard, location intelligence for Mobile
  workers and new BI search capabilities engage business users in the
       office or on the road with relevant information on demand
BURLINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Cognos, an IBM (NYSE: IBM) company and a world leader in business
intelligence and performance management solutions, today unveiled
major enhancements to its IBM Cognos 8 Go! software portfolio. These
new capabilities extend IBM Cognos 8 BI v4 so business users can
create, access and interact with personalized views of performance
information to quickly make informed decisions that drive business
performance.

   A recent TDWI survey found that the percentage of active BI users
who use a BI tool at least once a week in organizations has increased
from 18% in 2005 to 24% in 2008. Respondents cited many factors that
accelerate BI usage, including delivering data through a dashboard
(46%), report interactivity and self-service (44%), among other
things*.

   To continue to address these needs, Cognos is delivering more
flexible, consumer-oriented ways for users to stay connected to the
business with personalized access to trusted information through
familiar dashboard, mobile device, Web browser, spreadsheet, word
processor or presentation software interfaces.

   Today, Cognos is introducing a new dashboard capability called IBM
Cognos 8 Go! Dashboard, new location-aware capabilities for IBM Cognos
8 Go! Mobile and new highly targeted search capabilities for
structured and unstructured data within IBM Cognos 8 Go! Search. These
capabilities give IT the opportunity to securely extend their
performance management framework to help more business users quickly
find the information they need to make better decisions, contribute to
information that others depend on and take action to better manage
performance.

   IBM Cognos 8 Go! Dashboard dynamically delivers rich Flash-based
graphics for business users or executives to quickly create
personalized dashboards that reflect the trusted, consistent
performance information delivered from IBM Cognos 8 BI or other
enterprise sources. External widgets such as RSS feeds or relevant
pieces of pre-built reports, scorecards or metrics can also be
incorporated directly into the dashboard so business users can obtain
a complete view of the information that matters most to them.

   "We rely on the bird's-eye view of business information delivered
through our dashboards and scorecards to increase operational
efficiencies in key areas," said Mark Lack, Manager, Planning and
Financial Analysis, Mueller Inc. "The new interactive viewer within
IBM Cognos 8 Go! Dashboard is super cool. It will give business users
the ability to quickly drag and drop, re-sort and rearrange slick
graphical content in compliance with existing IT policies and
infrastructure. The result is a custom, manageable view of business
information built on trusted BI content without the need for the IT
department to spend valuable time building individual dashboard views
for every imaginable business scenario."

   New advances in IBM Cognos 8 Go! Mobile let mobile business users
and executives more easily view and interact with the same reports
they would find on their desktop via their mobile device for efficient
decision-making regardless of location. Unlike competing solutions,
the product delivers new location-based business intelligence
capabilities which use GPS information on the user's BlackBerry,
Symbian or Windows Mobile device to create reports that automatically
adjust based on the location of the user.

   The software also supports all types of business reports,
including:

   --  Ad-hoc, prompted reports run by the business user directly
        from the mobile device;

   --  Scheduled reports delivered to the device based on a schedule;

   --  "Bursted" reports, which are valuable in large-scale
        production-level types of business reporting, such as Web
        invoicing. With bursting, large reports are executed once and
        then divided into segments for efficient distribution to
        intended recipients. The data is read only once throughout the
        process which provides associated network and processing
        efficiencies;

   --  Cascading prompts, which dynamically link one report prompt to
        another with related information such as countries,
        territories and cities.

   Cognos 8 Go! Search Advances Convergence of BI and Search

   IBM's recent CEO and CIO surveys have found unstructured corporate
information such as user files, customer comments, medical images, Web
and rich media content to be growing at 63%. The explosive growth of
this type of business information has pushed the convergence of the BI
and Search categories. It has created demand for new BI search
capabilities to provide quick and easy access to both ranked and
relevant BI content and unstructured information.

   Newly updated, IBM Cognos 8 Go! Search v4 lets any business user
extend the decision-making capabilities of IBM Cognos 8 BI by securely
accessing and dynamically creating BI content using simple key-word
search criteria. The software works with popular enterprise search
applications such as IBM OmniFind Enterprise Edition, Google, Yahoo
and Autonomy so users can see structured, trusted BI content and
unstructured data such as Word documents and PDF's in the same view
within a familiar interface.

   Users can search all fully-indexed metadata as well as titles and
descriptions within a report. Search-assisted authoring and
exploration gives them options to refine queries or analyze data cubes
based on search terms. These capabilities speed access to the most
relevant business information regardless of naming similarities
between reports, helps business users quickly refine queries as
required and frees IT from constantly re-creating commonly used
reports. This leaves IT with more time for strategic business
initiatives.

   The software is completely integrated with the web-based
administration and security parameters set by IT administrators for
IBM Cognos 8 BI. This integration provides a centralized, efficient
approach to administration and security and effectively addresses two
common areas of concern for resource-constrained IT departments, who
want to provide more autonomy to business users, but need a single
administration point and assurance that corporate authentication
policies will be maintained.

   "These new enhancements to our Go! Portfolio provide
business-driven performance information to help each area of the
organization strategically manage the information that is most
pertinent to them," said Leah MacMillan, vice president, product
marketing, Cognos, an IBM Company. "Both the business and IT gain more
autonomy whether employees are in the office searching, monitoring and
analyzing business outcomes or on the road looking for new business
updates or geographically relevant information."

   The IBM Cognos 8 Go! Portfolio of software is a key component of
IBM's Information Agenda, a new approach consisting of
industry-specific software and consulting services geared to helping
customers use information as a strategic asset across their
businesses.

   Availability:

   IBM Cognos 8 Go! Dashboard, IBM Cognos 8 Go! Mobile v4 and IBM
Cognos 8 Go! Search v4 will be available in Q4, 2008 direct from
Cognos or its network of resellers worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;-New release strengthens IBM's Information on Demand strategy by
empowering business users with new and enhanced performance management
                capabilities delivered to IT standards-
BURLINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Cognos, an IBM (NYSE: IBM) company, and a world leader in business
intelligence and performance management solutions, today unveiled IBM
Cognos 8 v4 which extends IBM's Information on Demand strategy to help
customers improve their ability to engage the business user through a
more dynamic and interactive experience, inform their decision making
with greater context and relevance and align their strategy and
operations through complete visibility to targets, plans, forecasts
and metrics across finance and operations.

   IBM Cognos 8 v4 lets organizations easily and securely extend
access to trusted information to fully engage a diverse group of
employees, customers and partners across financial and operational
divisions and processes. Richer BI and performance management user
capabilities such as enterprise planning, dashboards, analytics and
reporting combine with an enhanced enterprise-class platform, flexible
business modeling, and consumer-oriented interfaces to help business
users gain access and interact with the right information needed for
decision making to optimize business performance.

   Casual business users, business managers, and executives in all
sizes of organizations are grappling with information overload and the
rapid pace of change in today's globally connected economy. These
types of business users represent 80% of workers in average
organizations, according to Wayne Eckerson, director of TDWI Research
at the Data Warehousing Institute.* They need quick access to relevant
information, whether they are in the office or on the road, to make
informed decisions that improve financial and operational visibility
and drive overall performance.

   New self-serve flash-based dashboard, mobile and search
capabilities in IBM Cognos 8 v4 help business users quickly drive
decisions through flexible, consumer-oriented interfaces that let them
access and interact with relevant performance information using
familiar applications or devices. These include BlackBerry(R), Symbian
or Windows Mobile devices, enterprise search engines or desktop
productivity applications. (See today's related release at:
http://www.cognos.com/news/releases/2008/1002-2.html.)

   The debut of IBM Cognos 8 Business Viewpoint introduces new
cross-functional business modeling capabilities to help business users
and IT collaborate. Business users define a shared representation of
how their business information should be structured and viewed to
drive decisions in a workflow environment without disruption to the
downstream systems which are governed by IT. These capabilities let
financial analysts, line and brand managers, or data stewards
maintain, govern and share hierarchies and business views according to
their own organizational preferences while the IT department retains
control over how approved changes are published and used. (See today's
related release at:
http://www.cognos.com/news/releases/2008/1002-3.html.)

   Customers can further align business operations, advanced
analytics and strategic plans across the organization by using IBM
Cognos Now! and IBM Cognos TM1 as trusted data sources for IBM Cognos
8 BI and Planning. Key metrics from the continuous business monitoring
of operational metrics can easily be added to a personalized business
dashboard along with key parts of business reports that are pertinent
to a particular line of business. Newly updated enterprise planning
capabilities blend both planning and analysis features to help
increase the productivity and accuracy of planners within the planning
process. Planners can also build persistent views of the organization
to provide increased context for forecast data entry.

   These enhanced user capabilities are supported by new solutions
and updated professional services, education, and support offerings to
further accelerate customer success. Today, Cognos has also introduced
IBM Cognos 8 Financial Performance Analytics which is the latest
addition to the Cognos' family of Analytic Applications. It is
designed to provide organizations with fast, actionable insights into
financial performance using fully-configurable reports for general
ledger, receivables and payables analysis. See today's related release
at: (http://www.cognos.com/news/releases/2008/1002-4.html.)

   New enhancements to the Cognos 8 enterprise-class platform help
business users gain valuable context from the information they
receive, and provides the IT department with streamlined development
and management capabilities:

   --  Access to the capabilities of Business Glossary, part of the
        IBM InfoSphere portfolio, which provides business users with
        access from every report to an enterprise dictionary for
        consistent interpretation of defined terms such as "gross
        margin" or "customer" and stewardship information that is used
        to help govern the data they are looking at.

   --  Support for annotations lets users add thoughts, decisions and
        comments to reports and charts to provide additional insight
        into the information for reviewers.

   --  Report authors or data modelers can now view business lineage
        of where the data was sourced for reports, or view the entire
        data supply chain by linking to 3rd party metadata providers

&lt;p&gt;HydroPoint and the Coca-Cola Company to Host Webcast Outlining Guidelines for Achieving Smart Water Management

   HydroPoint's Sustainability 2.0(TM) Educational Series Continues
  with a Webcast on Smart Water Management Strategies that Deliver an
           Immediate Reduction in Corporate Water Footprint
PETALUMA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
HydroPoint Data Systems Inc., provider of the WeatherTRAK(R) Smart
Water Management solution, today announced the next webcast in its
Sustainability 2.0(TM) Educational Series. The webcast, "Guidelines
for Achieving Smart Water Management," outlines Sustainability 2.0
strategies that bring immediate ROI while delivering on water
conservation goals. The webcast will be co-hosted by The Coca-Cola
Company and HydroPoint on Friday, October 10, 2008 at 2 pm ET.

   With drought conditions becoming more prevalent across North
America, the sharp decline in the world's water supply has meant a
dramatic increase in water rates, which now outpace oil and gas
prices. This in turn has resulted in an immediate need for businesses
to reduce their water footprint.

   It is critical for all organizations - from Wall Street to Main
Street, as well as government - to evaluate their water footprint as
part of their conservation efforts. This webcast will examine
Sustainability 2.0 Smart Water Management strategies that eliminate
the greatest areas of water waste and exceed conservation and
cost-saving goals.

   Jeff Foote, director of environment and water resources for The
Coca-Cola Company, will discuss the company's experience with Smart
Water Management initiatives and how it reduces water consumption
throughout the company's entire supply chain. Foote will also discuss
the criteria the company uses to evaluate sustainability programs and
the metrics and tools put in place to measure programs, manage
progress and report successes.

   Sustainability 2.0 strategies fuse economic and green benefits,
enabling conservation programs to produce accountability and ROI for
lasting financial and environmental returns. Organizations that have
implemented next-generation sustainability programs have realized
substantial cost savings by reducing their corporate water footprint.

   According to the recent Frost and Sullivan "Going Green Survey,"
CEO's are the leading champions for sustainability initiatives; nearly
70 percent of C-level executives perceive sustainability programs as a
competitive advantage. Additionally, more than two-thirds of senior
executives polled identified achieving sustainability as a growth
opportunity for their companies. The majority of respondents also
reported that their company's rate of investment in sustainability
initiatives is expected to increase.

   "Webcast participants will gain the knowledge to launch, measure,
manage and report on successful Smart Water Management strategies,"
said Christopher Spain, founder and chief strategy officer for
HydroPoint. "Sustainability 2.0 strategies deliver significant
financial benefits to corporate bottom lines, quickly offsetting any
initial investment. By implementing Sustainability 2.0 strategies,
companies enjoy a competitive advantage and achieve corporate growth
objectives."

   Sustainability 2.0 strategies are enabled by HydroPoint's
WeatherTRAK Smart Water Management solution. Proven to save four times
more water and expenses than traditional urban water conservation
practices, the WeatherTRAK solution eliminates waste by dynamically
adjusting water output based on landscape needs and changes in local
weather conditions. Companies apply cost savings realized through
WeatherTRAK Smart Water Management to fund other critical technology
infrastructure projects throughout the enterprise.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 2 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is
stepping up efforts to improve online search, where it
considerably lags market leader Google (GOOG.O), by
establishing a three-centre research facility in Europe, it
said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, whose efforts to buy search company Yahoo Inc

&lt;p&gt;New Visa Survey Reveals Global Companies Plan to Reduce Reliance on Checks and Increase Commercial Card Usage

   Global Respondents to Visa's Global Cash Management Survey Report
Satisfaction with their Commercial Card Programs
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Today Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) released a global survey showing 74
percent of respondents are satisfied with their commercial payment
card programs. Currently, 50 percent of respondents currently use
commercial payment cards to make payments as part of their overall
cash management strategies. In the next 12 - 18 months, 52 percent of
survey respondents intend to reduce reliance on checks and 45 percent
plan to increase their use of commercial card programs.

   Survey respondents rely on commercial payment cards to reduce
processing and administrative costs (70 percent); eliminate
paper-based invoicing (62 percent); facilitate receivables and
payments (57 percent); and provide transaction data for better vendor
pricing negotiation (46 percent). Companies also use commercial card
programs to increase visibility into cash positions and improve
forecasting.

   "We are really pleased to see the level of satisfaction reported
alongside the intention to increase use of commercial card programs,"
said Darren Parslow, head of Global Commercial Solutions for Visa Inc.
"Commercial cards are a key part of an effective cash management
strategy providing greater transparency, financial controls and robust
information reporting tools."

   Currently, in the United States, 58 percent of respondents use
commercial payment cards with Canada close behind at 54 percent.
Forty-six percent of respondents in Asia Pacific (AP) utilize
commercial card programs, whereas 44 percent of their counterparts in
Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa (CEMEA) and 38
percent and 30 percent respectively in Europe and Latin America and
Caribbean (LAC) rely on cards. In all areas, companies expect to
increase their usage of commercial payment cards in the next 12-18
months: Sixty percent of respondents plan to increase card usage in
CEMEA, 48 percent in the U.S., 42 percent in Europe and LAC, 41
percent in Canada, and 38 percent in AP.

   Importance of ERP Processes

   In general, 65 percent of companies said that utilizing both
e-procurement and ERP processes is important to their organizations.
Forty-five percent cited cost reduction due to process streamlining as
the primary reason for integration. In addition, companies believe
that ERP integration enables:

   --  Availability of transaction data for spend analysis

   --  Use of card transaction data for better pricing negotiation

   --  Enhanced compliance with commercial policies and procedures

   --  Automated expense reporting reconciliation

   Positive Impacts on Cash Flow Management Efficiency

   Respondents identified cash positioning and forecasting as the
least efficient step in their current cash management processes. The
lack of streamlined operational processes and inadequate information
and reporting capabilities were also cited as efficiency challenges.
However, the majority of respondents said they have improved their
overall cash management programs during the past year with 68 percent
of companies identifying their cash flow programs as efficient.
Overall, companies found that commercial card programs delivered
efficiency gains that improved their cash management capabilities.

   Other improvements from commercial card payment programs include:

   --  Access to new levels of data

   --  Visibility into cash position

   --  Help forecasting future cash needs

   --  Enabling the implementation of financial management software

   Visa Global Cash Management Survey: Objective and Methodology

   The Visa Global Cash Management Survey examined the use of
commercial payment cards on a global basis. The survey was conducted
by Survey.com, a firm specializing in internet market research, and
involved 800 financial, treasury and cash management executives from
11 countries across five geographic areas, including North America,
Asia Pacific (AP), Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa
(CEMEA), Europe, and Latin America and Caribbean (LAC). The majority
of respondents in the U.S. worked for companies with more than US$500
million in sales per year. In other geographies, the majority of
respondents were employed by companies with over 100 employees and
annual sales of at least US$25 million annually.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI (Hollywood Reporter) - In another sign of Hollywood's growing interest in the Indian film industry, the Walt Disney Company India is planning a quartet of live-action features under its local banner, Walt Disney Pictures India.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have finalized two projects to start with," a WDCI spokesperson told The Hollywood Reporter on Friday. Budget details were not provided.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first project is "The 19th Step," which revolves around the ancient Indian martial arts form Kalarippayattu. The film, planned as a multilingual Indian release, stars leading South Indian actor Kamal Hassan. Japanese star Asano Tadanabo and Indian actress Asin also are in the cast. Bharat Bala, one of India's best-known music video directors, will be at the helm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second film, "Zokkomon," is a children's tale starring child actor Darsheel Safari, who won acclaim in 2007 for the hit "Taare Zameen Par" (Stars On Earth), which tackled the theme of dyslexia. Satyajit Bhatkal is directing "Zokkomon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two other Walt Disney Pictures India features are in the development process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney made its first foray into local production last year with an exclusive three-picture deal to co-produce animation titles with veteran Mumbai-based banner Yash Raj Films. The first release, "Roadside Romeo" -- voiced by top Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan and actress Kareena Kapoor -- opens October 24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - Washington Mutual Inc
WAMUQ.PK, the bankrupt holding company of the failed regional
bank, is seeking to access a $5 billion cash deposit JPMorgan
Chase  Co (JPM.N) gained control of when it took over its
deposits last week, a Washington Mutual lawyer said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In first-day motions in U.S. bankruptcy court in Delaware,
concerns about the status of the $5 billion deposit dominated
the proceedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is our understanding that those deposits were taken as
part of the transaction with JPMorgan," Marcia Goldstein, a
bankruptcy lawyer representing Washington Mutual, said in
court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They (JPMorgan) have indicated to us that they would like
some opportunity to review the facts that are related to those
assets," she continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual was closed by the U.S. government last
week in the largest bank failure by far in the United States,
and its banking assets were sold to JPMorgan for $1.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing this
week, the holding company said it had $5 billion of cash
deposited with Washington Mutual Bank prior to it being taken
over by U.S. banking regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldstein said the company had reached a "standstill
agreement" with JPMorgan that would require both parties to
give each other 48 hours notice if WaMu seeks to withdraw the
deposit or either party decides to take any court action
related to the deposit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even JPMorgan might have trouble with a withdrawal request
of $5 billion," Goldstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $5 billion could potentially be used to pay creditors
of the holding company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It sounds very unusual for the holder of a $5 billion 
account not to be able to make withdrawals from that account,"
Thomas Lauria, a lawyer representing a group of note holders in
the case, told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The standstill agreement is in effect until Oct. 15,
Goldstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldstein also said at the hearing that WaMu was not
seeking outside bankruptcy financing at the time, as it
currently has "adequate cash" to fund the costs of the
bankruptcy process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Brian Moss)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Working with Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne to Develop Advanced Gasification Technology

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil announced today that it has entered into an agreement
with Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne to develop next-generation technology
to convert coal, coke or biomass to synthesis gas (i.e., CO and
hydrogen), which could facilitate the use of carbon capture and
storage to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power generation.

   Under the agreement, ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company
and Pratt &amp; Whitney Rocketdyne will work together to develop and test
new gasification technology to improve efficiency and reduce the cost
of converting raw materials into gas. The work focuses on the
development of a gasification-reactor system, which has the potential
to offer significant advantages compared to conventional approaches.
Key features of PWR's rocket-engine expertise -- uniform feed
distribution, high temperature combustion and rapid heat removal --
are utilized, resulting in a smaller and more cost effective system.

   "Gasification technology has the potential to help with many of
our most pressing energy challenges and we are pleased to be involved
in this important project," said Rich Pisarczyk, president of
ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company. "Turning coal and similar
energy sources into synthesis gas would allow these sources to be
converted into a range of products, including chemicals,
transportation fuels and power plant feedstock. Gasification also
helps enable the adoption of carbon capture and storage and therefore
reduces emissions from the use of coal and other heavy feedstocks."

   Work has begun on pilot plants to test the technology at the Gas
Technologies Institute in Des Plaines, Illinois, and the Energy and
Environmental Research Center in Grand Forks, North Dakota. ExxonMobil

   CHEVRON LOSES MAJOR LOBBYING BATTLE IN CONGRESS OVER ECUADOR TRADE
BENEFITS, SAYS AMAZON DEFENSE COALITION

   Chevron has lost a critical lobbying battle in Congress in its
effort to escape a $16.3 billion liability in Ecuador stemming from a
landmark environmental case, according to Amazonian residents and
their lawyers engaged in a court battle with the company.

   Despite hiring a team of A-list Washington insiders - including
Wayne Berman, John McCain's national finance chairman and former
Senator Trent Lott -- Chevron's plan to enlist Congress to help it
abort the class-action case in Ecuador has failed with the renewal of
trade benefits to the South American country.

   "This is a major setback to Chevron's effort to undermine the rule
of law in Ecuador to avoid cleaning up an environmental disaster,"
said Steven Donziger, an American legal advisor to the plaintiffs.

   A bill extending the trade benefits to Ecuador, Peru, Columbia and
Bolivia passed the Senate on Thursday after clearing the House earlier
in the week. A large team of Chevron lobbyists headed by Berman had
worked for months to attach a rider that would have excluded benefits
for Ecuador, where Chevron stands accused of having caused what
experts believe could be the largest oil-related disaster on the
planet.

   An independent expert appointed by the court found last March that
Chevron was responsible for damages in Ecuador and should pay between
$7.2 and $16.3 billion. A final decision is expected in 2009.

   The potential liability stems from sub-standard practices used by
Texaco when it was the operator of an oil consortium in Ecuador's
Amazon from 1964 to 1990. Chevron bought Texaco in 2001 and will bear
any liability in the case.

   Chevron had hoped the threat of cutting trade benefits would
pressure Ecuador's government to scuttle the lawsuit, but the strategy
backfired as Ecuador fought back via its Washington ambassador, Luis
Gallegos. Gallegos told Congress that Chevron had tried to pressure
the Ecuador court to undermine the trial once evidence was introduced
that suggested the oil giant's culpability.

   Gallegos had told Congress his country would lose 350,000 jobs if
Chevron succeeded in the lobbying campaign.

   Representatives of the plaintiffs - who include five indigenous
tribes and residents in 80 rainforest communities -- had accused
Berman of misrepresenting the case to several members of Congress and
to the office of the United States Trade Representative. One such
misrepresentation was that Chevron claimed to Congress it had been
"released" by Ecuador's government after a small environmental
remediation but in fact that release specifically excluded private
claims of the type being brought in the lawsuit.

   How Chevron obtained even that limited release is now the subject
of an official corruption investigation in Ecuador. The
court-appointed expert, for example, found that more than 80% of the
sites Chevron claimed had been remediated to secure the release have
levels of deadly toxins in violation of legal norms.

   Ecuador's national prosecutor recently indicted two Chevron
lawyers and seven former Ecuadorian government officials for fraud
after they signed documents certifying the clean-up.

   Aside from the political jockeying in Washington, Chevron has
admitted in court that Texaco dumped 18.5 billion gallons of toxic
waste into Amazon waterways and abandoned over 900 waste pits while it
operated the concession. Tens of thousands of people now live in the
middle of the contamination, some directly on top of waste pits
Chevron covered with dirt without cleaning out contaminants.

   Health problems and cancer rates in the region have skyrocketed in
recent years, according to scientific evidence presented by the
plaintiffs. Neither Texaco nor Chevron has ever conducted a single
health study of the area nor published a map for local residents
detailing the sites of its covered waste pits.

   Pablo Fajardo, the Ecuadorian lawyer for the plaintiffs, said he
was pleased Congress did not accept "misinformation" put forth by
Chevron's lobbying team.

   "Chevron is trying to peddle misinformation to the U.S. Congress
just like Texaco told the indigenous people of Ecuador that oil was as
healthy as vitamins," Fajardo said.

   Chevron had hired Berman after he succeeded three years ago in
getting Congress to help the company kill a deal for a merger between
a Chinese state oil company and California-based Unocal. Berman's
efforts paved the way for Chevron to buy Unocal itself.

   It turns out Unocal operated in Burma, which has caused Chevron a
spate of bad publicity for generating billions in hard currency for
the repressive military regime there.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it is collaborating with Business
Partners and universities to launch a jointly developed scholarship
program for students focused on furthering mainframe education. The new
program is designed to support increased demand in education and training
in mainframe and large enterprise computing.

    The new initiative -- called the IBM Destination z Enterprise Computing
Scholarship Program -- will allow students to receive scholarship funding
for educational courses that will increase their technical skills in
mainframe computing. The program will be co-funded by IBM Business
Partners who are increasing their investments in the mainframe. In just
the past eight months, the number of new partners aligned to the System z
has increased by more than 40%.

    The program, which will be formally launched later this year in the US,
will offer students the opportunity for scholarship funding for such
classes including "z/OS Basics: Introduction to the New Mainframe," "Linux
on System z," and "WebSphere Application Server for z/OS," that are being
taught at membership colleges and universities.

    The increase in rising energy costs and environmental concerns are putting
increased pressure on growing computer data centers that process
everything from banking and retail transactions to managing health care
records. While clients are looking for increased demand for mainframe
technical expertise to support this transformation, business partners are
realizing the opportunities to build and deploy new offerings to help
organizations looking to transform their enterprise data centers.

    The scholarship program is an opportunity funded from IBM Destination z, a
multidimensional mainframe community organization dedicated to increasing
the value of IBM System z mainframes for clients. IBM Business Partners
already committed to the scholarship program include Mainline Information
Systems, Levi Ray &amp; Shoup, Rocket Software, Vicom Infinity as well as
Universities such as Illinois State, Marist College, Minnesota State
University, Syracuse University of South Carolina, and many others.

    Mainframe Ecosystem Momentum Builds

    Today's news is in support of business partners who are increasingly
building new solutions running on the mainframe. With these enhancements
and increased demand comes an expanded ecosystem of ISVs, universities,
clients, students and business partners all focused around the mainframe
and its utilization as a way to redefine the new enterprise data center
today.

    For example, in just the past nine months, the number of new business
partners aligned to the IBM System z mainframe has increased 40% and there
has been a 55% increase in the number of mainframe education courses
completed in PartnerWorld University during the same timeframe.
Additionally, ISV applications built for the System z have now exceeded
4,000 with more than half of these new applications running on the Linux
platform.

    Today's announcement builds on the value that IBM System z Business
Partners are finding in mainframe education:

    "As one of IBM's key business partners focused on delivering mainframe
offerings to clients, investing in the skills and people that are going to
run these mission critical platforms is key to its success," said Doug
Harrell, Vice President of Sales, System z, Mainline Information Systems.
"This new scholarship program is yet another unique way how IBM and
Mainline are teaming up as part of the larger ecosystem to continue to
educate the up-and-coming mainframe programmers of tomorrow."

    "We are heavily invested in the future of the IBM System z mainframe --
and in working with our strong Business Partner and university channels.
IBM is offering some great programs and incentives for the next
generation of mainframe programmers," said Karl Freund, Vice President,
Marketing and Strategy, IBM System z.

    The Destination z Enterprise Computing Scholarship Program is part of
IBM's overall Academic Initiative for the System z program. The IBM
Academic Initiative for System z provides colleges and universities with
educational resources to enhance the enterprise systems skilled resource
base and helps students develop practical skills that enable them to find
good jobs quickly upon graduation. Under the Academic Initiative for
Systems z, more than 400 global universities are teaching mainframe and
large enterprise computing skills today, up from 20 in 2004, and over
50,000 students have taken courses so far.

    Today's news follows on the heels of IBM's announcement of the fourth
annual "Master the Mainframe" competition, designed to familiarize
students with concepts for the growing large enterprise computing
industry and build mainframe skills, enabling them to become the business
and IT leaders of tomorrow.

    Applications for the new scholarship program will begin to be accepted on
Monday, October 6. Students interested in applying for the scholarship can
apply at http://www.zjournal.com/scholarship.

&lt;p&gt;  BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA, Oct 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it has opened three new Global Delivery
Centers in Argentina, entailing a US$60 million investment over ten
years. IBM also announced the extension and opening of its Virtual IT
Campus, the largest IT services hub in South America.

    These investments are in addition to the more than US$200 million that the
company has announced in Delivery Centers over the past seven years in
Spanish-speaking South America (SSA) -- Argentina, Bolivia, Chile,
Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, Uruguay and Venezuela -- as a result of
exponential growth reported in the services division and in the
development of Global Delivery Services.

    Argentina has been selected by IBM as one of the four countries in the
world to deploy its Global Delivery Centers, as part of the company's
strategy to become a globally integrated enterprise. IBM shapes its
strategy, management and operations in a truly global manner, locating its
operations and functions where it makes more sense, based on the right
cost, the right skills, the right talent, and favorable business
environment.

    IBM has tripled its workforce in SSA in recent years, to almost 15,000
professionals, 50% of whom work in the Global Delivery and Services
organization.

    The three new global delivery centers located in Argentina serve more than
20 countries around the world. Services include server, database, network
and storage monitoring and support based on global practices, processes
and methodologies.

    The extension of the Virtual Campus has contributed to the growth of IBM's
Command Center which monitors servers across the region. Over 5,000
servers of top companies in all sectors and industries of the region are
monitored from Argentina. The mainframe processing capacity of the IT
Campus is equivalent to adding the capacity of all of Argentina's leading
banks. Regionally integrated resources, processes and methodologies,
building on IBM expertise and best practices, have placed this IT
mega-center in an unparalleled position to offer uninterrupted service
24x7 all round the year, at a par with the largest centers in the U.S.
and the world.

    "These projects are part of the ten-year investment plan we have for SSA,"
said Gustavo Mendez, IT Services Director for SSA. "We are a Globally
Integrated Enterprise that leverages the know-how of its human capital and
its competitive edge to optimize resources and offer value-added solutions
to its customers all round the world."

    Due to the steady pace of growth experienced over the past five years by
the LA region and LA countries -- including Spanish-speaking South
American countries, IBM Corporation has included the region in a new
organization called "Growth Markets." This territory comprises 51
countries with a consistent 20% growth rate, now representing 22% of the
Company's global revenues. The Company is planning to invest in these
countries approximately US$1.6 billion by 2010.

part of its transition to a traditional bank holding company,
Credit Suisse said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any such acquisitions would however be done on a smaller
scale, analyst Susan Katzke said, noting the company's
historical bias towards organic growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman has historically been biased toward organic growth
strategies; we expect that bias to be unchanged," analyst Susan
Katzke wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katzke recommended buying Goldman's stock as a core
financial services holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were trading up 2.8 percent at
$135.22 in early trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

Europe. We are pleased to host an elite gathering of key ticket industry
decision makers at Ticket Summit 2009," said Vaccaro.

    Ticket Summit 2009 is the premier conference in the secondary ticket

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; changes source, adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its rating on Costco
Wholesale Corp (COST.O), the No.1 U.S. warehouse club, to "buy"
from "neutral," saying the recent sell off in the stock creates
a compelling entry point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Costco's business model is a strong defensive play in the
current macro environment with superior earnings deliverability
partly due to its defensive sales mix and value proposition,
analyst Adrianne Shapira wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Customers pay an annual fee to shop at Costco's clubs,
which sell everything from digital cameras and watches to
bulk-sized packages of toilet paper and water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many of its clubs also sell gasoline, luring shoppers
looking to fill tanks with cheap fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Costco's warehouse club business model that offers
rock-bottom prices when bulking up, should translate into
higher market share and steady same-store sales gains," said
Shapira, who raised her price target on the stock by $4 to $72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares, which have fallen about 10 percent in
the last one month, were trading up about 2 percent at $63.02
before the bell. They closed at $61.92 Thursday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;LISBON Oct 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) launched on
Friday a software package for a Portuguese ultra-cheap laptop
for school children that the government hopes will boost the
country's technological edge in education.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Portugal started rolling out the 'Magellan' computer at
schools last month. It aims to hand out a total 500,000 of the
laptops, which cost just 50 euros ($69.29) for school children,
at home and export it to countries in Latin America and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer unveiled the software package
called 'Suite Magellan' to go with the laptops, which will
include Windows XP and Office in addition to development
applications, free email and instant messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a unique, amazing and wonderful programme on a
global scale," Ballmer said at the presentation. "It's a great
example to show how the private and public sectors can work
together to create new opportunities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Portuguese Socialist Prime Minister Jose Socrates has made
boosting poor education standards and technology at schools a
priority of his government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We all know that one of the fundamental keys for the
country to progress lies in technology," he said. "We all know
that the presence of computers in schools boosts education."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government hopes the Magellan project, named after the
16th century Portuguese explorer, will raise computer access at
schools to two students per computer by 2010, up from five now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Portugal has developed a fledgling software industry in the
past few years and in June Microsoft bought Portuguese mobile
software company MobiComp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said the Magellan project could help create a
platform for the computer industry development in Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is an important step forward for Portugal's high-tech
industry," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the computer will be assembled in Portugal by a
company called JP Sa Couto, it is based on Intel's Classmate PC,
a cheap computer that has been adopted in various formats in
countries such as Brazil and Indonesia. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez signed an agreement to buy
1 million Magellan laptops for Venezuelan schools. The computers
also went on public sale in Portugal last week for 285 euros. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Axel Bugge; Editing by Sharon Lindores)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Senior Goldman Sachs (GS.N) executives
have agreed to keep the majority of their shares in the company
for at least three years, or until Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N) redeems the Goldman preferred
stock it bought last week, whichever comes first, according to
a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The executives, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein, Ehief
Financial Officer David Viniar, and co-chief operating officers
Gary Cohn and Jon Winkelried, signed a letter on Sept 28
stating that they, their families and estates would not sell
more than 10 percent their common shares in Goldman until Oct
1, 2011, or until Berkshire redeems the $5 billion in Goldman
preferred stock it bought last week when it gave the investment
bank a major boost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's shares had been struggling among the upheaval in
the financial industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The preferred shares carry a 10 percent dividend, and
Berkshire will also receive warrants to buy $5 billion of
common stock within five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Phil Wahba; Editing by Anshuman Daga)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 3 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Compass
Minerals International Inc (CMP.N) to "overweight" from
"neutral," saying the company offers investors high free cash
flows and healthy earnings momentum from a stable base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Its defensive business profile is largely insensitive to
changes in GDP growth, credit market stability, energy costs,
currency volatility, or import competition," analyst David
Silver wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst raised his 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates for
the company, which produces inorganic minerals and provides
highway deicing salt, due to improved salt profitability, and
said he expects continued dividend increases.
  The company's shares, which have shed 44 percent over the
past three months, closed at $42.28 Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think the current share price represents solid value
and a lower-risk alternative in turbulent markets," Silver
said.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, updates share movement) Oct 3 (Reuters) -
Goldman Sachs made several price target changes on European
banks and said it expects loan growth to slow markedly against
a backdrop of higher funding costs, capital pressures and
softening economic growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also added Swiss bank Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX)
to its pan-Europe conviction buy list and removed Natixis
(CNAT.PA) from its pan-Europe sell list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While previous credit cycles have often turned due to a
slowdown in demand, we believe that the current cycle is about
to turn as a result of both weaker demand and supply dynamics,"
Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European banks have been grappling with frozen funding
markets and intense pressure on their balance sheets, prompting
state bailouts and other rescue deals for the likes of Dexia
(DEXI.BR) and Bradford and Bingley BB.L.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Against this financial backdrop, Goldman Sachs recommended
exposure to banks which stand to benefit from the fall-out from
the crisis and whose premium valuations can be expanded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also recommended banks with distressed
valuations, with reduced risk due to government intervention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We note that the leading indicators of tighter lending
standards and an expected softening in credit demand are both
in evidence," said the brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RATING CHANGES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs upgraded Credit Suisse to "buy" from
"neutral," saying the Swiss bank heavyweight was well placed
relative to the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In our view, Credit Suisse is a sound counterparty
relative to industry peers as its wealth management business
should have a beneficial influence on its derivatives and prime
brokerage activities, while its comfortable capital ratio
should help weather the risk of further writedowns," said the
brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the bank might face problems related to funding,
capital and credit risk like the rest of the sector, it enjoys
a stable funding advantage due to its private banking franchise
and a stable capital position, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It raised its price target on the stock to 70 Swiss francs
from 58 Swiss francs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage raised its rating on Natixis, one of the
largest listed French banks, to "neutral" from "sell" on
valuation and said the share price now fully discounts a bleak
outlook for returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage cut its price target on the stock to 3.4
euros from 4.3 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the major price target changes, Goldman Sachs raised
its target on Barclays Plc (BARC.L) to 390 pence from 340 pence
and Credit Agricole (CAGR.PA) to 15.30 euros from 14.40 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage cut its price target on Deutche Bank
(DBKGn.DE) to 59 euros from 66 euros and HBOS HBOS.L to 220
pence from 389.75 pence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 1055 GMT, shares of Credit Suisse were trading up about
2 percent at 54.05 Swiss francs, while those of UBS (UBSN.VX)
were up 4.5 percent at 22.28 Swiss francs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Natixis were up 7.6 percent at 2.53 euros, while
those of BNP Paribas (BNPP.PA) and Societe Generale (SOGN.PA)
were both up more than 5 percent and 3 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Barclays were trading up 7 percent at 361.75
pence, while those of HBOS were up more than 10 percent at
187.6 pence.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Analyst Interview. Today's interview
is with Director of Zacks Equity Research Dirk van Dijk, who discusses
Exxon (NYSE: XOM), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), Conoco (NYSE: COP) and
Petrobras (NYSE: PBR).

   Your focus is on ... offshore companies (for Strong Buy
recommendations), is it not?

   The only real hope for finding big new oil fields is in deep
water. Those rigs are very scarce and are mostly already chartered for
more than three years at daily rental rates of well over $500,000. The
owners of those rigs have already locked in years of fabulous cash
flow. There is next to no risk that the firms renting these rigs are
going to default.

   In addition, these companies tend to be fiscally sound, don't
they?

   You want to find a strong balance sheet these days? Take a look at
Exxon (NYSE: XOM). Does Chevron (NYSE: CVX) have to tap the commercial
paper market? Of course not. So what difference should it make to them
if the commercial paper market dries up?

   Is turmoil in the credit default swap market going to affect
Conoco (NYSE: COP)? I don't see how it does to any significant degree.
There may be some political risk in dealing with the national oil
companies that now dominate the world energy scene, but I seriously
doubt that a company like Petrobras (NYSE: PBR) is going to go off the
deep end.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co will not offer a job to Alan Fishman, chief executive of Washington Mutual, the struggling regional bank it bought a week ago, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the bank told WaMu employees they should know their outlook at the newly combined company by December 1, JPMorgan spokesman Tom Kelly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fishman had only joined WaMu in September as the bank sought to turn around losses linked to its mortgage portfolios. According to a regulatory filing, he could get $13.65 million for the 18 days he was on the job.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is among a handful of executives that have been told they will not have jobs at the combined company, according to the memo sent to Washington Mutual employees on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other executives from Seattle-based Washington Mutual who will not have roles at the bank include President and Chief Operating Officer Stephen Rotella, chief legal officer Michael Solender, special adviser Frank Baier, chief human resources officer Daryl David, and executive vice president of corporate strategy and development Todd Baker, according to the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan will be hiring several senior Washington Mutual executives for the combined management team, Charlie Scharf, JP Morgan's chief executive officer for retail financial services, wrote in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include Al Brooks, president, commercial group; Deb Horvath, chief information officer; John McMurray, chief enterprise risk officer; David Schneider, president, home loans; and Tony Vuoto, president of WaMu's credit card business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Casey, chief financial officer of Washington Mutual, has been asked to stay through the end of the year. JPMorgan's Michael Cavanagh, however, will be chief financial officer of the combined banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees' pensions and 401K plans are safe and deferred compensation and all benefits will stay the same, Kelly said. JPMorgan will not pay executive severance or change in control payments, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual was closed by the U.S. government in the largest bank failure by far in the United States, and its banking assets were sold to JPMorgan for $1.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said the transaction means it will now have 5,410 branches in 23 U.S. states from coast to coast, as well as the largest U.S. credit card business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It vaults JPMorgan past Bank of America Corp to become the nation's second-largest bank, with $2.04 trillion of assets, just behind Citigroup Inc. Bank of America will go to No. 1 once it completes its planned purchase of Merrill Lynch  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A group of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc creditors are asking a U.S. judge to allow them to conduct depositions and access documents from JPMorgan Chase  Co, claiming JPMorgan prevented Lehman from accessing $17 billion in assets on the eve of its bankruptcy filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In court documents filed late last week, a group of unsecured creditors claimed that JPMorgan refused to let Lehman access assets and instead froze Lehman's account, triggering a liquidity crisis that led to the 158-year-old investment bank's collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(JPMorgan's) refusal to make those assets available to (Lehman) and its subsidiaries in the days leading up to (Lehman's) bankruptcy filing may have contributed to Lehman's liquidity constraints," the creditors said in the court documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for JPMorgan, however, disputed the $17 billion figure and said that JPMorgan had provided $87 billion in cash to facilitate trading at Lehman in the early days of its bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To say that somehow JPMorgan was inhibiting the liquidity just is not consistent with the facts," said Harold Novikoff, a lawyer representing JPMorgan in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creditor's committee said it believes had JPMorgan not taken those actions, Lehman's liquidity problems could have been averted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection from creditors Sep. 15, in the largest U.S. bankruptcy filing ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital subsequently bought Lehman's core North American capital markets business, and other units are being sold off to other parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has played a key role in the case since day one, as the firm regularly advanced billions to Lehman units to help clear and facilitate securities transactions with customers and clients of Lehman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The creditors said in the court filing that JPMorgan held the $17 billion in excess assets as collateral, due to its role in providing cash advances to Lehman to fund overnight repurchase agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan does not think that $17 billion is a "correct valuation" of the assets, Novikoff said.

&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio--(Business Wire)--
"The Clean Air Task Force applauds the passage by Congress of a
tax incentive package to promote carbon capture and storage (CCS).

   CCS is a method of capturing global warming CO2 emissions from
coal plants and other industrial sources. CCS prevents the release of
CO2 to the atmosphere by storing it in deep geologic formations like
depleted oil fields or deep saline formations. The tax incentives were
included in the credit market bail out bill.

   These incentives are an important first step in promoting carbon
capture and storage as a tool to fight global warming.

   The incentives are designed to drive early commercial
CCS projects forward. Possible projects that could benefit include
coal gasification and power production CCS projects in the Midwest as
well as a pipeline from the Midwest to the Gulf Coast for enhanced oil
recovery.

   The credit market bailout package passed by Congress included $2.5
billion in incentives for developing CCS. $1.4 billion provides an
investment tax credit for CCS power projects that capture and store 65
percent of their carbon dioxide and gasification projects that capture
75 percent of their carbon dioxide.

   An additional $1.1 billion in tax incentives will be available in
the form of a $20 per ton tax credit for geologic carbon storage (GCS)
and a $10 per ton tax credit for enhanced oil recovery (EOR),
providing the CO2 comes from an industrial or power project that
captures a minimum of half a million tons of CO2 per year."

   Kurt Waltzer is the Carbon Storage Development Coordinator, Coal
Transition Project, Clean Air Task Force.

   About the Clean Air Task Force

that is dedicated to restoring clean air through scientific research,
public education, and legal advocacy. The Clean Air Task Force is

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced plans to open a new Collocation data
center at its Greenock facility in Scotland. The data center delivers
services to help mid-sized enterprises consolidate and centralize their
information technology (IT) infrastructures in a single secure and
resilient location, allowing them to significantly reduce costs and staff
management time.

    The center offers facilities typically only available to large enterprises
such as energy efficient cooling, dedicated electric infrastructure backed
up by diesel generators, 24 hour security, alarm monitoring and CCTV, and
resilient internet connections.

    In addition to IBM equipment, customer-owned equipment will be welcomed in
the data center, giving clients the choice of retaining management and
monitoring responsibility for the equipment (Collocation), or requesting
IBM to perform basic management and monitoring functions (Collocation
Plus). Clients can move their existing back-office hardware to the
facility and manage it remotely.

    Matthew Hawkins, SirsiDynix Chief Operating Officer, whose company uses
the service, said, "SirsiDynix cares deeply about its customers' Software
as a Service (SaaS) experience; therefore, we thoroughly explored
Collocation partner options for several months. During our research we
focused on strong features such as power, cooling, redundancy (for backup
and fail-safe purposes) and cost at the facility level, and company
stability at the corporate level. Our options were narrowed down to two
companies and IBM was by far the best vendor suited to meet our growing
needs in the SaaS market."

    "This new service aims to offer quick financial returns to a medium sized
business by removing the challenge of securing and maintaining their data
centers, so potential savings can be ploughed back into their business,"
said Alex Reardon, director, General Business Sector, UK &amp; Ireland for
IBM. "IBM has the skills to run, manage and monitor client IT, ensuring
information is secure at all times."

    The new Collocation data center in Greenock is being built to IBM's
strategic "green" data center standards. The modern design and build of
the data center will utilize best practices in cooling and power
management where the technology has been designed to take advantage of
the free cooling on offer by the local climatic conditions.

    IBM has committed GBP 540 million globally to deliver technologies that
help clients dramatically increase the level of energy efficiency in
their data centers. IBM has engaged with more than 2,000 clients to
deliver hardware, software and services technologies that have helped
them reduce data center energy consumption and cut energy costs by as
much as 40 percent.

    IBM has had a presence in Inverclyde for 57 years. This new data center
complements the services offered by the IBM Greenock location which is now
a Service based facility. Greenock plays a key role within IBM in
Scotland, offering a highly skilled flexible workforce providing key
support to IBM's global growth strategy.

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM, Oct 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Reportlinker.com announces that a new market research report related to
the Pharmaceutical industry is available in its catalogue.

    Pfizer - Market Outlook for a Global Leader, 2008-2013

   
http://www.reportlinker.com/p096391/Pfizer---Market-Outlook-for-a-Global-Leader-
008-2013.html

    Pfizer is the world's largest and most profitable pharmaceutical company.
Its pharmaceutical division generates sales of $44671m in 2007. Pfizer is
recognised as being one of the strongest performing pharmaceutical
companies in terms of sales, revenue growth, acquisitions, breadth of
portfolio, product launches and pipeline developments. Pfizer's
prominence is due to the company having nine blockbuster products, seven
market leaders and strong products in all the major therapeutic
categories. How can you compete with them? Which areas are the exposed
in? Find out today.

    This new report - Pfizer - Market Outlook for a Global Leader, 2008-2013
- examines the Pfizer group critically, through comprehensive research
and analysis. This report covers both of Pfizer's pharmaceutical and
animal healthcare division. Importantly, visiongain discusses Pfizer in
the context of the wider pharmaceutical industry and global market.
Furthermore, visiongain applied independent analysis and techniques such
as financial forecasting, SWOT analyses, R pipeline analysis and
qualitative projections. The result is a comprehensive market-based
report with detailed analysis and informed opinion.

    Why you should buy this report:

    In particular, Pfizer - Market Outlook for a Global Leader, 2008-2013
concentrates on the following essential aspects of that company and it s
market, including the competitive environment for leading pharma
companies:

    - Detailed analysis of Pfizer's divisions and its products, including
Lipitor

    - Sales forecasts for Pfizer's pharmaceutical division

    - Sales forecasts for key products and therapeutic areas

    - Discussions of issues affecting the relevant market segments, including
competitor analysis

    - Drivers and opportunities for Pfizer

    - Restraints and threats facing the company

    - Discussion of company strategy in the context of the market

    - Pipeline developments and their implications for the future

    - Strategic alliances and licensing

    - International operations, including developing markets.

    Visiongain believes that the period 2008 to 2013 will be pivotal for
Pfizer, particularly due to patent expiry and the demands of new
technological paradigms, such as biologics and genomic medicine. A closer
examination of Pfizer's portfolio reveals that many of its leading
products will lose patent protection during the next five years, causing
severe revenue erosion for the company.

    Those challenges include Lipitor, the number-one selling drug in history
and a product responsible for a significant share of Pfizer's revenue.
The global healthcare industry is entering an exciting new period, with
both significant opportunities and great challenges for companies such as
Pfizer. Any professional interested in the fortunes of leading
pharmaceutical companies from the present onwards cannot afford to ignore
this study.

&lt;p&gt;  STUTTGART, GERMANY, Oct 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
German Healy Hudson GmbH and IBM (NYSE: IBM) have signed a five-year,
five million euro Software as a Service contract. As part of the
agreement, IBM will support Healy Hudson's e-placing solution "Deutsche
eVergabe," which is an electronic tendering procedure that addresses
public service clients. IBM business partner, Fritz &amp; Macziol, will help
distribute the solution.

    As a result, customers of Deutsche eVergabe can upload their tenders and
interested suppliers can answer electronically. The whole process is
completely web-based, which means that no media disruption is necessary.

    The demand for managing tenders via the Internet exists due to a new
EU-directive, which aims at comprehensive deployment of such solutions by
2010. E-placing is attractive for tendering organizations as well as for
providers, because they can save a lot of work, time and money compared to
the conventional tendering process. "Customers can use powerful software,
but they only have to pay a small fee for it," explains Christian
Konhaeuser, Chief Executive of Healy Hudson.

    IBM will operate Healy Hudson's servers from an IBM data center and take
care of the administration of their middleware-software. Utilizing the on
demand model, Healy Hudson will only pay for the resources it consumes.

    Haydar Celik, Strategic Outsourcing Business Partner Manager at IBM
Germany, explains: "The advantage of a SaaS model is flexibility,
especially for small and medium-sized businesses. We believe in the
concepts and solutions of our SaaS partners. That's why we support them
beyond technology, so that success is achieved quickly."

    The contract was signed in June 2008.

solutions designed to optimize the procurement processes of private

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Realscan 3D Inc. (www.realscan3d.com) of Redondo Beach, California
recently completed extensive 3D scanning work for Disney's talking dog
comedy, BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA. The film, set for release on October
3, 2008, is directed by Raja Gosnell (SCOOBY DOO) and written by
Analisa LaBianco and Jeff Bushnell.

   The story centers on a spoiled and pampered Beverly Hills bred
Chihuahua named Chloe (voiced by Drew Barrymore). On vacation with her
owner in Mexico, Chloe accidentally gets lost and then stranded with
no way to get back home. It's up to her Los Angeles street-smart
Chihuahua pal Papi (voiced by George Lopez) to head south of the
border to rescue his lady love.

   Shot with an innovative mix of live-action canines merged with
state-of-the-art 3D modeling, BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA takes the
beloved genre of "talking dog" movies to astonishing new heights.
Realscan 3D joined together with visual effects powerhouses Tippett
Studios and Cinesite to scan the film's vast menagerie of canine
characters.

   Coming off their highly successful work with collaborators Hoyt
Yeatman, Framestore CFC, and Cinesite on Disney's UNDERDOG, Realscan
3D got the call from the studio again to apply their proprietary
RealCapture NexGen 3D scanning technology to BEVERLY HILLS CHIHUAHUA.

   Realscan captured the entire cast of canines for the movie,
working both in pre-production in Los Angeles and on set in Puerto
Vallarta. Realscan delivered the highly accurate body and head scans
to both Tippett Studios and Cinesite. The two FX powerhouses then
added rigging, fur, and animation. The accurate models were used in
the film in a variety of ways ranging from head replacements to
full-body digital doggies. In one scene Tippett created as many as 240
digital Chihuahuas using the accurate models supplied by Realscan.
Another shot with a German Shepherd and a Doberman squaring off went
completely CG when shot design changed after principle photography.
The studio saved significant time and money for the digital doggies
appearing in the film by combining the talents of this winning team.

   Realscan 3D (www.realscan3d.com) is a Los Angeles-based effects
company specializing in solutions for the creation of low-cost,
high-quality digital assets for any application.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 6 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N)
third-quarter earnings estimates were cut by Fox-Pitt Kelton
analyst David Trone to a loss, citing additional mark-to-market
losses, losses on government-sponsored enterprises' (GSE)
securities, and a build in credit reserve. Trone now expects a
loss of 10 cents a share in the third quarter compared to his
prior view of profit of 32 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He expects the company to record net marks of $4.3 billion
in the quarter, comprising $2.0 billion on leveraged loans,
$1.0 billion on mortgage assets, $1.2 billion loss on GSE
securities and $400 million related to a settlement on auction
rate securities. Trone also expects a $1.7 billion in reserve
build associated with the Washington Mutual acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These losses will be partially offset by $300 million of
liability valuation gains and a $700 million tax benefit, a
large part of which will be in the investment bank, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the fourth quarter, Trone raised earnings estimates to
86 cents a share from 79 cents a share, and for 2009 to $3.91 a
share from $3.82 a share, citing net income contribution from
Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan may record reversal gains in the future from
assets that were conservatively marked during the Bear Stearns
and Washington Mutual acquisitions, Trone said, adding that
upward earnings revisions are likely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company will gain market share in the long term across
its traditional banking and securities units, from the demise
of some peers, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's shares were down 5 percent at $43.66 in morning
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Move Means Premises Customers Can Now Incorporate Real-Time Asset
                  Information into their Applications
AUSTIN, Texas &amp; ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
RF Code, Inc., http://www.rfcode.com, a leader in automating
physical asset management using RFID enabled solutions, today
announced at AFCOM Data Center World Conference and Expo (Booth #123),
that it has received certification from IBM for its Zone Manager
integration module, which provides seamless, real-time physical asset
inventory, location information, and wireless sensor information to
IBM Websphere Premises Server applications.

   This news follows closely on the heels of an earlier announcement
that RF Code is certified Ready for IBM Tivoli Asset Management for
IT. RF Code's approach of providing an easy integration path means
that data center customers of IBM Premises, IBM Tivoli Maximo, Eracent
and other market leading asset management and enterprise systems get
the instant information they need to better manage their IT assets.

   RF Code was virtually the first to announce a data center solution
that fully automated the inventory and audit process down to the rack
level. "We realized then that working with IBM to integrate our
solution into their data center offerings and eliminate manual
tracking would greatly benefit both our company's customers," said
Mitch Medford, CEO, RF Code.

   Data center asset tracking is an important part of an overall
asset management strategy. It's emerging as a key to an organization's
overall financial strategy. Without asset awareness, asset security
and audit compliance are virtually impossible. Interestingly,
inventorying those assets is one of the most time intensive, manual
processes data center professionals undertake. According to a new ABI
research report written about recently on TMC.net, ABI analyst
Jonathan Collins is quoted as saying: "Managing and auditing (data
center assets) is a serious pain point for IT departments, and
automating those applications with RFID can drive clear ROI."

   By automating the inventory process and automating the capture of
environmental state information, RF Code helps companies reduce their
operational costs while providing critical information companies need
to run more profitable organizations.

   About RF Code, Inc.

   RF Code automates the ability to discover, track and monitor
high-value physical assets across the enterprise. Using the company's
award-winning platform for active RFID, customers know instantly and
on demand the precise location of each individual asset. This spares
them the high cost, time intensity, and compliance risk of a manual
inventory. RF Code and its world-class roster of global partners
develop solutions used in demanding industry environments including
IT, healthcare, defense, pharmaceutical, manufacturing, transportation
and homeland security. http://www.rfcode.com

&lt;p&gt;Industry-First GRC Control Applications for Primary Business
   Applications Helps CFOs, CIOs, Others Reduce Costs of Meeting GRC
                             Requirements
ACTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
To automate the manual processes associated with governance, risk,
and compliance (GRC) for business applications, Lumigent Technologies,
Inc. today announced it will be unveiling the industry's first
application GRC control suite at IBM Information On Demand 2008 to be
held, October 26-31, 2008, at Mandalay Bay in Las Vegas. Lumigent will
be exhibiting in booth 29.

   At the conference, Lumigent will launch its GRC control
application suite for enterprise resource planning, financial
management, and other primary business applications. The Lumigent GRC
applications help CFOs, CIOs, controllers, and other business
executives 1) reduce the cost of meeting GRC requirements for their
primary business applications and 2) improve productivity and
profitability by administering governance mandates.

   "We are addressing a glaring omission in today's GRC marketplace
-- enterprise business applications that drive down the costs of
compliance with primary business applications while increasing their
effectiveness," said John H. Capobianco, chairman of Lumigent.
"Historically, GRC platforms and toolsets have been aimed at
enterprise IT departments. But business executives need
business-focused, GRC applications. That's what we're giving them."

   Lumigent Conference Highlights

   Highlighting the launch of its new GRC application suite, Lumigent
will be demonstrating one of its GRC applications at the conference.
The company also plans to make a series of launch-related
announcements, including customers and partners.

   The Lumigent applications run in tandem with the primary business
applications, creating and managing the GRC controls for the business
applications. To create each Lumigent GRC application, the company:

   --  analyzes a business process application, using subject matter
        experts to identify data source fields that must be monitored;

   --  defines the rules and policies that should control the source
        data;

   --  uses those data definitions, rules, and policies to create the
        complementary GRC application, which combines best practices
        with deep industry and regulatory expertise; and

   --  packages the finished applications for license and
        installation, ensuring each application is easily utilized yet
        completely configurable.

   Once deployed, the Lumigent application then continuously monitors
the source data to provide the core GRC process intrinsically valued
by CFOs and other business executives, controllers, and finance
departments.

   Capobianco said, "On average, a company spends $2.5 million on
compliance and business controls. That is a growing trend, driven by
expanding governance. Today, companies spend that money on manual
labor. Given the economic uncertainty, there couldn't be a better time
to automate that process, drive down the cost, and increase the
effectiveness with finished GRC applications."

executives reduce the cost of meeting Governance, Risk and Compliance
(GRC) requirements for their primary business applications.

&lt;p&gt;Hansen Natural Corporation and The Coca-Cola System Announce Agreements for
Distribution of Monster Energy Drinks in Western Europe, Canada and Selected
U.S. Territories

CORONA, Calif., Oct. 6, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Hansen Natural Corporation
("Hansen") (Nasdaq:HANS), The Coca-Cola Company ("TCCC") (NYSE:KO) and Coca-Cola
Enterprises, Inc. ("CCE") (NYSE:CCE) today announced that they have completed
agreements for distribution of the category-leading Monster Energy(r) drinks
line in six Western European countries, Canada and selected territories in the
U.S. These agreements will complement Hansen's existing relationship with
Anheuser-Busch ("AB") and will not affect Hansen's agreement with AB for the
on-premise channel nationwide.

The agreements will take effect beginning in November 2008 in the United States
and parts of Western Europe, and in early 2009 in Canada. As part of the
agreement with TCCC, Hansen has the right to negotiate distribution agreements
with additional Coca-Cola bottlers to service the TCCC territory not covered by
CCE.

"We are pleased to be partnering with the world's leading beverage system to
expand the retail presence and penetration of our Monster Energy(r) drinks,"
said Rodney Sacks, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Hansen. "We believe
the relationship with The Coca-Cola Company and Coca-Cola Enterprises will
enable us to build on the success of our Monster Energy(r) brand in North
America and expand into fertile new international markets. In the United States,
the relationship will complement our existing long-term arrangements with
Anheuser-Busch distributors, which have been and we expect will continue to be
very important to Hansen. We believe that the combination of these two leading
distribution systems will provide us with an unrivaled distribution network in
North America."

Under the agreements, a significant portion of Monster Energy(r)'s current North
American Direct Store Delivery ("DSD") volume will be serviced by Coca-Cola
bottlers, primarily CCE.

The agreements in North America include all Monster Energy(r) trademark
beverages including Monster Energy(r) and Java Monster(tm) as well as the
Lost(r) Energy(tm) brand.

According to A.C. Nielsen data, Monster Energy(r) is the #1 energy drink by
volume in the United States.

"The Coca-Cola System has taken a multi-faceted approach to becoming one of the
key players in the fast-growing energy drink category," said Sandy Douglas,
President, Coca-Cola North America. "We are pleased that our bottlers are now
able to distribute this brand as part of our diverse portfolio of leading
sparkling and still beverage brands in North America and Europe."

In Western Europe, the agreement includes the distribution of Monster Energy(r)
in all CCE European countries -- Great Britain, France, Belgium, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg and Monaco.

"Monster Energy(r) drinks are strong additions to our energy portfolio,
reinforcing our strategic priority of being #1 or a strong #2 in every category
in which we choose to compete," said John Brock, Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, Coca-Cola Enterprises. "Monster Energy(r) continues to outperform the
energy category in the United States, and we look forward to bringing another
proven brand to our territories in Western Europe."

&lt;p&gt;  PARIS and ARMONK, NY, Oct 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Boulanger, a French retail company specializing in leisure, multimedia
and households products, with the help of IBM (NYSE: IBM) Research and
Global Business Services, a worldwide player in 3D universes for
enterprises, has implemented a new distribution channel using 3D Internet
and virtual worlds. This project, implemented for Englos Boulanger Store
(near Lille, north of France), is part of Boulanger's multichannel
strategy to develop a 3D universe to complement their stores and Internet
site. This will allow the French retailer to offer its customers
innovative and complementary services.

    Consumers can now visit Boulanger Island in Second Life to view and
interact with Boulanger products in a familiar context, such as in a
house, click on the product of interest to directly access the
Boulanger.fr website, and place an order. Other capabilities include the
Service Center, where customers can learn about all the services offered
by Boulanger. For example, consumers can view repair or maintenance
videos, or speak with a maintenance person who can guide them through the
steps to make first level repairs.

    Boulanger is committed to delivering innovation to its customers, whether
in its strategy or in its products and services. In 2007, the company
launched its Internet e-commerce site (boulanger.fr) and in 2008,
Boulanger decided to establish a 3D presence. From the very beginning,
Boulanger and IBM's goal was to enable total integration between the
three channels -- store, website and 3D Universe -- and create
complementary and value-creating services for each channel. The objective
for 2009 is to create an even greater interaction between the store, the
website and the 3D Universe.

    "Retailers have to explore new and creative digital channels to reach
today's intelligent and informed consumer," said Colin Parris, vice
president, Digital Convergence, IBM. "Boulanger's use of the virtual
worlds demonstrates the company's capability to transcend traditional
boundaries to provide an immersive and interactive shopping experience
for customers."

    To help Boulanger meet this challenge, IBM had two objectives: develop a
community aspect through the 3D universe and propose new services
(configuration of kitchen, cooking lessons, guides, etc.) -- while
integrating the three complementary distribution channels. The 3D Universe
will also allow Boulanger to create a community between its customers. It
will offer them the opportunity to talk about the products and services
offered, and give Boulanger the opportunity to better understand their
customers' expectations.

    "The project, developed jointly by IBM and Boulanger's teams, was very
attractive to us because of its interactive and community aspect, both
vis-a-vis our customers and also for our internal teams. With this
project, we want to develop various distribution channels to allow our
customers to find all of our products wherever they are -- in our stores,
on our Internet site or in the 3D universe, while benefiting from new
services that can be easily reached," explains Jacques Honore, Boulanger's
CIO.

&lt;p&gt;Webalo Enables First Time Easy-Deployment of Microsoft Business Intelligence on Any Mobile Device

    Continues Webalo's Growing Access to the More Than $5.1 Billion
                Worldwide Business Intelligence Market
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
Webalo, Inc. today announced that, for the first time, users of
the Microsoft(R) Business Intelligence (BI) platform can easily access
business reports on any mobile device. This makes available real-time,
critical business information without the need to program custom
solutions or reports.

   This capability is made possible by the newly released Webalo
Mobile Dashboard(TM) for the Microsoft BI suite. The Webalo Mobile
Dashboard can transform, without complex reprogramming, SQL Server,
PerformancePoint, SharePoint, or Excel content into easy-to-read,
easy-to-navigate mobile displays that conform to whatever brand or
model of handheld device being used.

   According to Gartner, Inc., the 2007 market for business
intelligence was just over $5.1 billion, with Microsoft BI steadily
gaining market share over the past few years. Since Webalo is the only
solution to deliver many kinds of business intelligence on any mobile
device, the Mobile Dashboard has a very large business opportunity.

   "Our goal is to make it possible for any mobile professional to
have access to exactly the information they need on any kind of
device," said Peter Price, president and CEO of Webalo, Inc. "Our
intent is to mobilize this sizeable market to enable business
executives to keep pace with the hyper-speed of business today."

   Says Nils Rasmussen, founder and president of Solver, Inc., a
leading a performance management and business intelligence solutions
provider, "Up until now, providing access to critical business
information on different mobile devices has required unique
programming for each device, and for each underlying BI platform.
Webalo has eliminated that nearly insurmountable problem." Added
Rasmussen, "This is particularly important in today's tight economy,
when timely business decisions are even more critical to companies'
success than ever in the past."

   The Webalo Mobile Dashboard for Microsoft BI works on RIM
operating system 4.0 or above, Windows Mobile 2003 (PPC Edition),
Windows Mobile 5 (both PPC and Smartphone Editions) or Windows Mobile
6 (all versions), and Java-enabled MIDP 2.0 smartphones. The Mobile
Dashboard is available as a hosted service or an inside-the-firewall
appliance.

   About Webalo

   Webalo technology transforms enterprise applications and data to
make them compatible with mobile devices. This eliminates the need for
traditional custom programming, reducing the deployment of mobile
applications from weeks or months to, in most cases, less than a day.
The resulting "anywhere, any time, on-demand" availability of
enterprise data on handheld devices turns such devices into viable
alternatives to desktop, laptop, and palmtop computer hardware, and
lets mobile employees work more productively -- on the spot -- to
solve problems, answer questions, monitor operations, close sales, and
make informed decisions.

   The Webalo Mobile Dashboard Service -- available both as a hosted
service and as a behind-the-firewall appliance -- lets non-IT business
administrators securely specify the content of mobile-accessible
information, and the companion Webalo Proxy Server configures it, in
seconds, to conform to the native user interface of any BlackBerry,
Windows Mobile, Palm, Symbian, or Java-enabled smartphone. Webalo's
technology transforms the role of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
into a User Oriented Architecture, enabling Web services to
communicate with users as effectively as they communicate with other
system services.

   Software vendors and system integrators such as Actuate, IBM,
Nokia, and RIM are working with Webalo to enhance both their service
oriented business applications and their mobile devices. Los Angeles
based, Webalo is privately held and was founded in 2000. For further

&lt;p&gt; Oct 6 (Reuters)- J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Dollar
Tree Inc (DLTR.O) to "overweight" from "neutral," saying sales
trends and fundamentals are solid at the company, which sells
most of its merchandise for $1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Outside of warehouse clubs Costco Wholesale Corp (COST.O)
and BJ's Wholesale Club Inc BJ.N, Dollar Tree is the only
retailer we cover that is generating positive traffic -- year
to date average of 2.9 percent," analyst Charles Grom wrote in
a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grom said the company's merchandise strength was not just
in consumables but also in health and beauty care, party
supplies, and household goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst, who raised his 2008 and 2009 earnings
estimates, said the current valuation does not accurately
reflect the company's top-line prospects and earnings-per-share
upside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the Chesapeake, Virginia-based company closed at
$35.28 Friday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today launched a company-wide initiative that extends its
traditional software delivery model toward a mix of on-premise and cloud
computing applications with new software, services and technical
resources for clients and Independent Software Vendors (ISVs). IBM's new
cloud services can help businesses of all sizes more easily adopt cloud
computing models to better manage data, lower operational costs and make
collaboration easier.

    Businesses face a unique set of challenges as they look to grow in a
globally integrated economy. A perfect storm of data deluge, a fluid
regulatory environment and widening information technology (IT) skills
gaps is placing additional cost pressures on top of already
resource-strapped organizations. As a result, businesses are looking for
new ways to drive more value out of their IT infrastructures and free up
resources for strategic growth investments.

    "We are moving our clients, the industry and even IBM itself to have a
mixture of data and applications that live in the data center and in the
cloud," said Willy Chiu, vice president, high performance on demand
solutions, IBM. "IBM's cloud computing strategy was inspired by feedback
from the business world's broadest IT customer base indicating a growing
desire to utilize data, applications and services from any device and from
any location based on open standards."

    IBM has a four-pronged strategy to capture the cloud computing opportunity
by: 1) delivering its own cloud services portfolio; 2) helping ISVs
design, build, deliver and market cloud services; 3) helping clients
integrate cloud services into their business; and 4) providing cloud
computing environments to businesses.

    IBM's clients and partners will have access to a growing number of cloud
services specialists through its worldwide network of 13 Cloud Computing
Centers and 40 IBM Innovation Centers to help test applications via cloud
computing models.

    IBM has extensive experience in building cloud computing solutions used
for both public and private cloud-delivered services. IBM's cloud-building
services include: server, storage and network virtualization, service
management solutions to automate workload management, usage tracking and
billing and a portfolio of security and resiliency offerings to enable
end-user confidence. IBM offers consulting and implementation skills for
organizations to leverage cloud computing as a key component of their
overall business and IT strategy.

    New IBM cloud services

    IBM's ability to deliver cloud services is made possible by technologies
that include Request-Driven Provisioning (RDP), Dynamic Workload
Management (DWM), Usage and Accounting and Security. Offered as part of
IBM's Tivoli portfolio, these technologies give clients and ISVs the
assurance of delivering quality services from a cloud computing
environment with the ability to monitor and log activity, chargeback and
secure identity and access management protections. New IBM cloud services
areas that utilize these technologies include:

    1. "Bluehouse" -- IBM is launching a free open beta for "Bluehouse," the
first Web-delivered social networking and collaboration cloud service
designed to connect people from different businesses. "Bluehouse" combines
social networking and online collaboration tools to help businesses of all
sizes to securely work together through firewalls and beyond
organizational boundaries. This suite of hosted online technologies
allows individuals to share documents, contacts, engage in joint project
activities, host online meetings and build social networking communities
via the cloud through a Web browser. The "Bluehouse" beta is available
today at http://bluehouse.lotus.com.

    An example of IBM's Tomorrow at Work initiative to anticipate trends in
work styles, "Bluehouse" can be used by anyone to collaborate with
external groups, such as partners, agencies, suppliers, customers and
outside experts as easily and securely as with co-workers. Small and
medium-sized businesses will benefit from minimal up-front costs and
maintenance of this Software as a Service (SaaS) platform, and
departments in larger companies will have a quick, simple way to work with
their key stakeholders within their intranet and out on the Web.

    2. Lotus Sametime Unyte -- Arranges quick, easy Web conferences including
the sharing of documents, presentations or applications through any Web
connection. No on-site software server deployment or support is needed.
By enabling businesses to communicate in real-time with a worldwide
network of employees, partners and customers, Sametime Unyte will help
local companies become global trading partners. IBM has built in several
enhancements to Sametime Unyte to enable global customer use through
multi-language support and faster network performance. In addition,
several new features make online meetings easier, including a "waiting
room" for meeting participants to gather and specialized alerts and
prompts for meeting hosts. Soon IBM will integrate Sametime Unyte with
Lotus Notes and Lotus Sametime to allow people working in email or
instant messaging to join Web conferences, with a single click of a
button. Sametime Unyte is available at www.sametimeunyte.com.

    3. IBM Rational Policy Tester OnDemand -- Helps reduce online risks by
automating Web content scanning to isolate privacy, quality and
accessibility compliance issues. Available as a subscription on an annual
basis, this software helps improve trust by detecting online usability and
compliance-related issues before they affect Web site visitors.

    4. IBM Rational AppScan OnDemand -- Scans Web applications for security
bugs, allowing customers to immediately identify sources of online risk
without the necessary time and investment for in-house training and
resources.

    5. Telelogic Focal Point -- Helps customers better manage their software
investment by providing product management teams with the ability to
collect, analyze and prioritize product features in line with broader
organizational goals. Telelogic Focal Point enhances communication by
centralizing the product information shared by product management,
engineering, marketing and other stakeholders.

    6. Remote Data Protection -- Reduces the risk associated with information
protection, enabling clients to maximize the value of information and
evolve to a service-enabled information infrastructure. IBM Global
Technology Services, through its acquisition of Arsenal Digital Solutions,
is introducing Onsite Data Protection and Remote Data Protection. The
service offerings enable clients to achieve a rapid time to protection for
their business data and to remotely recover it as a cloud service 24/7.

    New Cloud Services Resources for ISVs

    IBM's cloud services resources can help ISVs build new applications
quickly using open standards-based technologies. New resources include:

    1. A new series of white papers, on-line demos and downloadable code to
help ISVs address the common challenges of designing and building
cloud-enabled services, such as multi-tenant architecture. Resources
include enhanced technical blueprints on IBM's developerWorks Web site and
technical support through IBM's global network of 40 Innovation Centers.

    2. Creating a new SaaS Enablement Network of infrastructure providers that
use IBM server technology to help ISVs deliver interoperable SaaS
solutions, which allow disparate applications to work together. Members
include Terremark, Rackforce, and iTricity, which recently opened a new
Cloud Computing Hosting Center for Belgium, The Netherlands and
Luxembourg. IBM added 100 partners to its SaaS Specialty program in 2008,
the largest annual increase which nearly doubles its SaaS partner
ecosystem.

    3. IBM Business Partners can take advantage of a variety of new marketing
resources, including free web conferencing services using the IBM Lotus
Sametime Unyte service.

    On October 15 and 16, IBM will host partners and customers at its
Executive Briefing Center in Palisades, New York, to discuss its cloud
services strategy for this rapidly growing market. For more information
on this event, visit https://www-950.ibm.com/events/wwe/swg/08bbpsaas.nsf.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 6 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities said it downgraded
home builder Standard Pacific Corp (SPF.N) to "underweight,"
citing the stock's recent outperformance, expectation of
above-average impairment charges and substantial dilution after
recent issuance of securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While the recapitalization has improved SPF's net
debt-to-cap, equity still susceptible to deterioration given
our outlook for large impairments to continue due to its
geographic exposure," said the brokerage, which downgraded the
stock from "outperform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Standard Pacific's 66 percent exposure to weak markets of
California, Florida and Arizona, has been a key driver of its
cumulative land charges, JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage expects material land impairment charges of
$343 million in second half of 2008 and $380 million in 2009.
Standard's stock is trading at a premium, well above its peers,
as it had risen 73 percent from its low on Aug. 25, the
brokerage said. Following the completion of the company's
securities issuance, its fully diluted share count has
quadrupled, JP Morgan said adding that this has limited upside
on a "normalized" EPS basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's stock closed at $5.06 Friday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 6 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities downgraded KKR
Financial Holdings LLC KFN.N, an affiliate of private equity
firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co [KKR.UL], to "neutral" from
"overweight," saying the company's growth prospects are limited
amid a deteriorating economic environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe it may be difficult for KKR Financial Holdings
to raise incremental debt or equity capital and that the firm
may become more cautious regarding the use of its current
liquidity," analyst Jim Ballan said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This would result in relatively small growth as cash-flow
growth would be limited to the reinvestment of returned
capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The use of collateralized loan obligation (CLOs) structures
have also limited the company's growth prospects, Ballan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CLOs invest in leveraged loans, used to help fund
private-equity buyouts, and issue bonds backed by the cash
flows from the loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the company will benefit from run-rate earnings
being in excess of the current dividend and the firm still has
"favorable financing" in terms of pricing and tenor, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the San Francisco, California-based company
closed at $5.65 Friday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;AspenTech Announces BASF as First Customer to Deploy aspenONE Using Microsoft Application Virtualization Technology

   Long-Time AspenTech Customer BASF Uses Virtualization to Shorten
      Deployment Time and Accelerate Cost Savings and Performance
                      Improvements from aspenONE
BURLINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Aspen Technology, Inc. (OTC: AZPN.PK) today announced that the
first deployment of aspenONE software using Microsoft Application
Virtualization was completed by long-time customer BASF.

   --  BASF used Microsoft Application Virtualization to accelerate
        how quickly its worldwide process engineering team can begin
        using and realizing value from new releases and updates of the
        aspenONE Process Engineering suite.

   --  BASF engineers throughout the world have used aspenONE for
        years to quickly create higher quality process modeling
        simulations and costing and sizing activities which improve
        plant designs and optimizes production.

   --  Now, BASF is achieving additional IT and operational cost
        savings and faster performance improvements leveraging
        Microsoft Application Virtualization.

   --  Microsoft's virtualization technology decouples applications
        from operating systems and runs software as network services,
        making applications available whenever and wherever they are
        needed, even when disconnected from the network.

   --  aspenONE is the market-leading application suite that enables
        process manufacturers to implement best practices for
        optimizing engineering, manufacturing, and supply chain
        operations. Earlier this month, AspenTech released aspenONE V7

&lt;p&gt;Oct 6 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities added MEMC
Electronic Materials Inc WFR.N to its focus list, saying the
passage of the investment tax credit in the United States will
be a positive near-term catalyst for the company and the solar
energy sector as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tight credit market could slow expansion by new players as
new capital is likely to be harder to come by over the next 12
months, but the company stands to benefit as it is cash rich
and does not need to borrow to expand capacity, analyst
Christopher Blansett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst reiterated his "overweight" rating and has a
price target of $45 on the stock of the company, which supplies
silicon wafers to the chip and solar industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investor expectations are at a multi-year low and we
believe the stock is likely to outperform on an absolute basis
over the next 12 months as sentiment improves," Blansett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company, whose customers include South
Korea's Samsung (005930.KS) and China's Yingli Green Energy
(YGE.N), closed at $25.37 Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange. They have shed 71 percent so far this year.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)

 Oct 6 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank cut its rating on beverage
company Coca Cola Co (KO.N) to "hold" from "buy," citing lower
volume expectations, lower equity income and increasing
currency headwinds.

 Analyst Marc Greenburg said the proposed price raise by
bottling companies was timed badly given the current state of
the U.S. economy.

 "Credit is difficult. Job loss is mounting. Confidence is
low. And some very large commodity baskets, which have caused
the spike, are receding," Greenburg said in a note to clients.
"Our larger concern is increasingly that rising soft drink
price may be occurring at the exact worse time."

 Greenburg said the price hike, estimated to be 7 to 9
percent, is aimed at protecting gross margins of the bottlers,
which was of little concern to the consumer.

 He cut his fourth-quarter earnings estimates for Coca Cola
to 61 cents from 63 cents a share.

 In a seperate note, Greenburg also cut his price targets
and 2009 earnings estimates on food and beverage company
Pepsico Inc (PEP.N) and its bottlers PepsiAmericas Inc PAS.N
and Pepsi Bottling Group Inc PBG.N.

 "Forecast reductions stem from lower volume expectations in
the U.S. as bottlers continue to target higher pricing, as well
as reduced growth and currency expectations in non-US
segments," said Greenburg.

 The following are the price target and earnings estimate

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Oct 7 (Reuters) - A U.S. court said on
Tuesday Ecuador's government did not have to enter arbitration
with Chevron Corp (CVX.N) over an estimated liability of up to
$16 billion stemming from oil waste pits in the Amazon
rainforest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals found Chevron's claim
that Ecuador must submit to arbitration over who was
responsible for any environmental damage to be "without merit,"
according to a summary order from the New York court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an ongoing suit in Ecuador, locals charge that Chevron's
Texaco unit damaged their health by dumping billions of gallons
of oil-laden water from 1972 to 1992, before turning over
operations to state-run Petroecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This ruling is yet another blow to Chevron's strategy to
avoid liability in Ecuador and signals that Chevron should take
responsibility for the environmental and medical tragedy that
resulted from the contamination," Pablo Fajardo, an attorney
for the plaintiffs, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Texaco, bought by the second-largest U.S. oil company in
2001, denies its operations affected the health of Amazon
communities. The company argues it was released from liability
because it paid $40 million for an environmental clean-up in
the 1990s, and blames Petroecuador for much of the pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Court's decision denies Chevron the contractual remedy
of arbitration and will require us to pursue other avenues to
ensure that the government of Ecuador lives up to its legal and
contractual obligations," Chevron spokesman Don Campbell said
in a e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ecuador argues the 1995 release for Chevron excluded
third-party claims such as the current civil lawsuit, which
plaintiffs' lawyers say is expected to be decided next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An expert appointed by the Ecuador court assessed damages
of between $7.2 billion and $16.3 billion, which Chevron called
"exaggerated" and based on "erroneous" evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three-judge panel's ruling on Tuesday for the appeals
court upheld a federal court decision finding no legal basis
for Chevron's claim that Ecuador had to arbitrate the dispute
under a 1965 agreement between Texaco and Gulf Oil Co before a
predecessor company to Petroecuador took over Gulf's interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The ruling does not address the issue of ultimate
responsibility and Chevron remains firm on its position that
the government of Ecuador and Petroecuador must comply with
their contractual obligations, which they have consistently
repudiated," Chevron's Campbell said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron has repeatedly raised other concerns about the
ability to get a fair trial in Ecuador," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Rafael Correa, a leftist who often scorns foreign
oil companies and accuses them of cheating Ecuador of money,
has said the company did irreversible damage to the jungle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; San Ramon, California-based Chevron described an indictment
by Ecuador last month of two attorneys associated with its
operations in the country as politically motivated.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed and assigned Outlooks for J.P. Morgan
Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC), mortgage
pass-through certificates, series 2007-LDP12, as follows:

   --$19.0 million class A-1 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$444.9 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$6.3 million class Q at 'B'; Outlook Negative;

   --$3.1 million class T at 'B-'; Outlook Negative.

   Fitch does not rate the $40.7 million class NR.

   The affirmations are the result of stable performance since
issuance in August 2007. As of the September 2008 distribution date,
the pool's certificate balance has decreased 0.2% to $2.5 billion from
$2.504 billion at issuance. 120 loans (88.9%) are interest-only or had
an initial interest-only period greater than six months at issuance.
No loans are maturing until 2011 (2.8%).

   Fitch has identified sixteen loans of concern (12.0%), including
one specially serviced asset (0.2%) and two of the top ten loans
(5.4%) that were in the process of stabilizing at issuance. Potential
losses on the specially serviced asset, a limited-service hotel
property located in Oxford, AL, are expected to be absorbed by the
non-rated class NR.

   The largest loan of concern, Ten Penn Center (2.8%), secured by an
office building in Philadelphia, PA, had a year-end (YE) 2007 debt
service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 0.60 times (x). The property is
projected to have a cash flow shortfall for the first three years of
the loan term. A $6 million debt service letter of credit (LOC)
remains in place to cover projected shortfalls. As of June 2008,
servicer reported occupancy remained in line with issuance of
approximately 68%.

   The second largest loan of concern, 7000 Central Park (2.6%),
secured by an office building located in Sandy Springs, GA, had a YE
2007 DSCR of 0.60x. As of June 2008, servicer reported occupancy was
approximately 81%. Underwritten occupancy was set to 95%, including a
master lease. Loan features included a debt service reserve and a
leasing cost reserve that was held back at closing to help with
lowered physical occupancy.

   There are two shadow rated loans in the transaction (1.8%), and
both loans maintain their investment-grade shadow rating. The largest,
Summit Mall (2.6%), is secured by a 529,065 square foot (sf) mall in
Fairlawn, OH. Servicer reported occupancy as of the June 2008 is 91.8%
compared to 88.5% at issuance.

   The largest loan in the pool (6.5%) is collateralized by an

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Loses Another Round in Legal Battle over Ecuador Rainforest Contamination; Amazon Defense Coalition Says Chevron Should Accept Responsibility for Contamination

     U.S. Federal Appeals Court Rejects Attempt to Shift Liability
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
A three-judge panel for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit in New York today denied an attempt by Chevron to shift a
multi-billion dollar liability to Ecuador's government for a massive
environmental contamination in the Amazon rainforest.

   The appeals court, in a summary order, found that Chevron's claim
was "without merit".

   Chevron faces a potential $16.3 billion liability in the
long-running case, which was first filed in U.S. federal court in New
York in 1993 against Texaco and is currently on trial in the Ecuador
town of Lago Agrio. After years of pre-trial motions, the proceeding
shifted to Ecuador in 2003 after Chevron argued it would be a more
appropriate forum.

   Pablo Fajardo, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said, "In the past
year, the company has had a motion to dismiss the Ecuador case denied,
seen two of its lawyers indicted in Ecuador for fraud and lost a major
lobbying battle in Congress over the extension of trade benefits to
Ecuador.

   "This ruling is yet another blow to Chevron's strategy to avoid
liability in Ecuador and signals that Chevron said take responsibility
for the environmental and medical tragedy that resulted from the
contamination."

   Chevron bought Texaco in 2001 and will bear any liability in the
case, which is expected to be decided in 2009.

   In March of this year an independent expert appointed by the
Ecuador court found that Chevron was responsible for the dumping of 18
billion gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways and the
abandonment of more than 900 waste pits. The dumping happened when
Texaco was the exclusive operator of an oil consortium in the Amazon
from 1964 to 1990.

   Local residents have complained for years of severe health
problems, including cancers and spontaneous miscarriages. Five
indigenous groups say they are struggling for survival and have been
displaced from most of their ancestral lands.

   The court-appointed expert, Richard Cabrera, assessed damages
between $7.2 billion and $16.3 billion.

   The appeals court decision stems from an effort by Chevron to
force Ecuador's government into a binding arbitration to determine who
should be responsible for the liability. Chevron claims it was
released by the government from further responsibility for clean-up in
1995 after it performed a limited remediation, but Ecuador claims that
the release excluded third-party claims of the type being pressed in
the civil lawsuit.

   The ruling in New York upheld a federal trial court decision by
Judge Leonard Sand that found no legal basis for Chevron's claim that
Ecuador was obligated to arbitrate the dispute over the release.

   Ecuador was represented by C. MacNeil Mitchel and Eric W. Bloom at
Winston &amp; Strawn. Chevron was represented by Thomas F. Cullen and
Louis K. Fisher of Jones Day in Washington, D.C.

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, Oct 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
What do you do when the Virtual Worlds Forum Show is displaced physically
-- have a "virtual" Virtual Forum. That's exactly what happened in London
yesterday.

    After a shooting at the nightclub that was to host the Virtual Worlds
Forum, the facility became a crime scene and the event was homeless. IBM
(NYSE: IBM) stepped up and offered its Virtual Business Center in Second
Life as a refuge for displaced avatars -- and the Forum planners accepted.

    Kevin Aires, a global web strategist at IBM, quickly set up some space,
including some trade stands, and avatars began filing in for virtual
coffee. IBM broadcast the event live on-line, including Aires' "Boris in
Wonderland" chat show, for those that didn't wish to enter Second Life.
Visitors were also able to tour the new Virtual Green Data Center

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM), the world's leader in UNIX(R) revenue share (1), today
announced new POWER6(TM) processor-based servers for enterprise and SMB
clients and updated virtualization and systems management software
designed to help clients improve performance, drive innovation, and
maximize return on their IT investments in the new enterprise data center.

    The new offerings provide a clear alternative to HP, Sun and other
competitive systems by helping customers consolidate their data centers or
departmental workloads, increase operational efficiencies, and reduce
energy costs.

    More and more companies are choosing IBM Power Systems(TM) servers to
simplify their IT infrastructures. According to International Data
Corporation (IDC), in 2Q08 IBM UNIX grew revenue 25.8% YTY, outpacing all
others, outgrowing HP by 2 to 1 with Sun in decline. (1) Clients are using
innovative IBM solutions, services, virtualization, and the technology
that produced POWER6, the world's fastest microprocessor, to manage a
broad variety of business applications -- from multiple servers in the
large data center to standalone computers supporting the small business
franchise.

    For example, IBM today announced a new Power(TM) 570 with more than twice
the performance per core and more than twice the performance per watt as
HP's Superdome. (2)

    As the world's most popular midrange server, the IBM Power 570, now offers
more energy efficiency and consolidation options with new processor cards
that double the number of cores in the same system footprint. Starting at
just 4 cores, the system can be upgraded to a full 32-core single system
image (32-core SMP); and with hot-node add, businesses can install more
server modules without having to take the system down when the time comes
for growth.

    IBM also announced that the Power 570/16, which supports from 2 to 16
POWER6 cores, now features faster speeds of 4.4 GHz and even 5.0 GHz --
the fastest of the POWER6 processors -- previously available only in the
top of the line Power 595.

    With twice the number of cores for performance and efficiency packed into
the same system footprint as previous 570 systems, the Power 570/32 gives
users more than 2.4 times the performance per watt compared to the Sun
M8000 system. (3)

    Helping Businesses Consolidate Workloads

    The Power 560 Express, a commercial computer system, is a new POWER6
server model that sits between the Power 550 and Power 570. The Power 560
features 4-, 8- and 16-core configurations and is designed to help
businesses consolidate multiple UNIX, i or x86 workloads onto less
footprints.

    The Power 560 can save companies up to $840,000 and 83 percent in energy
by consolidating 13 Sun Fire V490 servers on a single Power 560 server
with PowerVM, as compared to consolidating the same number on four Sun
SPARC Enterprise M5000 servers with dynamic system domains. (4)

    The Power 560 Express provides an 80-percent performance boost and
60-percent performance per watt improvement compared to a 16-core HP
Integrity rx7640. (5)

    IBM today also announced:

    The Power 520 Express and Power 550 Express, providing new 4- and 8-core
options for i editions. AIX(R) and Linux users can now add i on the same
system.  The JS12 blade server running on IBM BladeCenter can now be
pre-installed with i and easily attached to low cost DS3200 storage to
create a SAN. Enhanced RAS features for hot-node add and repair for Power
570 and Power 595 servers, allowing concurrent repair of one node while
the system continues to operate, even while PowerHA is mirroring
transactions across multiple systems and storage.

    The new Power 570/32, 570/16, and 560, expanded capabilities of the Power
550 and 520 systems and the new SAN options on blades all run any
combination of AIX, i, and Red Hat or Novell Linux.

    Virtualization, Energy Management, and Availability Software

    Enhanced Power Systems software for AIX, i and Linux, includes:

    A beta version of PowerVM(TM) Active Memory Sharing, new virtualization
software that helps clients improve memory utilization by pooling
resources between partitions. IBM Systems Director, a new foundation for
enterprise platform management, spanning multiple platforms and operating
environments. Systems Director helps clients deploy, monitor, analyze,
optimize and update Power server and storage physical and virtual
resources running any combination of AIX, i or Linux workloads. Systems
Director is managed through an intuitive graphical interface and provides
upward integration to enterprise service management tools, including IBM
Tivoli. A new version of Active Energy Manager, an extension to IBM
Systems Director, featuring advanced energy control options designed to
boost performance per watt by slowing processor clock speed or even
putting processors in "nap" mode when not in use. It also allows users to
set an energy cap a for a single POWER6 server, or even across a pool of
POWER6-based servers. PowerHA(TM) for AIX, enhanced with asynchronous
GLVM support that enables geographic dispersion of systems to improve
business resiliency and disaster recovery. A new release of IBM iCluster,
a high-availability solution based on logical replication, that
integrates with IBM i service and fix management tools. A new
distribution agreement with Vision Solutions for IBM to distribute Vision
Cluster1(TM), Vision's flagship enterprise cluster management solution
for IBM i. New and updated Rational software for the i operating
environment that helps geographically-distributed software delivery teams
collaborate.

    In addition to IBM Systems Director, IBM recently introduced AIX
Enterprise Edition to help UNIX clients discover applications and server
relationships, monitor and report service status, manage workload
partitions (WPARs), and enable cost analysis of server usage. Systems
Director and AIX Enterprise Edition have been designed to provide a full
platform management solution for UNIX servers, and to integrate with IBM
Tivoli tools for enterprise service management.

    "Today's broad set of announcements span performance, virtualization,
energy efficiency, availability and management and demonstrate
convincingly that IBM is clearly the smart choice for businesses looking
to reduce total IT costs, including the often more expensive operational
aspects," said Scott Handy, vice president of worldwide marketing and
strategy, IBM Power Systems. "With new servers and our systems software
offerings moving higher up the customer value chain, we're continuing to
demonstrate the added value we provide to customers when compared to HP
and Sun."

    "We are offering customers more attractive total infrastructure solutions
whether they are replacing one workload at a time in a department or are
consolidating, simplifying and integrating their IT and moving to a shared
infrastructure approach that supports tens or hundreds of applications
from one or more groups of users or lines of business."

    Winning UNIX Revenue Share

    As industry studies demonstrate, IBM continues to lengthen its lead in
revenue share for UNIX and RISC + Itanium (R+I) servers. According to IDC,
IBM gained 5.1 points of revenue share with 25.8% growth YTY in 2Q08 for
UNIX servers, and holds the #1 position with 35.7% revenue share, +4.6
points ahead of #2 Sun and nearly 10 points (9.9) ahead of HP. (1) In
fact, IBM is the only major UNIX vendor to gain revenue share in the past
five years, picking up points while both HP and Sun lost share. (6) IBM's
#1 position is even stronger in the 20 designated growth segments. (7)

    And in the R+I server space, which features IBM Power Systems servers
running on AIX, Linux and i, IBM continues to gain revenue share at the
expense of HP and Sun. (8)

    Through its Power Systems Migration Factory offering, IBM has helped
nearly 1,200 customers migrate from competitive Sun, HP and other
platforms to IBM's AIX or Linux on Power, resulting in more than $1
billion in revenues. (9)

    IBM has demonstrated that robust and mature technologies such as
virtualization have become a key factor in the customer-buying decision.
IBM recently reported that a threefold increase in customer adoption of
virtualization (10) on its unified Power Systems line of servers is being
fueled by customers consolidating additional partitions onto existing
servers. This significant leap in the uptake of virtualization -- 64
percent in the second quarter alone -- exceeds by a large margin levels
common on x86 systems. (11)

    Overall, IBM Power Systems with POWER6 technology have recorded more than
70 industry-leading performance benchmarks.

infrastructure. The benefits are increased productivity and return on
investment resulting from the elimination of strains on time and
resources."

capacity they need, giving them the flexibility to grow into their blades
and protect their investments.

    BladeCenter S Express

IBM BladeCenter S for smaller firms is now
available with industry-first shared storage, bringing enterprise-class
storage capabilities to smaller firms and branch offices that lack the IT
staff and budgets to manage expanding volumes of business information.
With this innovative new approach, IBM is cutting the cost of shared
storage technology by 30-40 percent and -- supported by new,
complementary features like Start Now Advisor and BladeCenter Service
Advisor -- making it easier to set up and own (1).

    BladeCenter S is specially designed to help small and medium-sized firms
simplify the management of technology needed to run a business -- from
servers, to phone systems and business applications. BladeCenter S can

&lt;p&gt;Business Technology Partners Attains Gold Certified Partner Status in Microsoft Partner Program

     Business Technology Partners Further Distinguishes Itself by
 Earning a Microsoft Competency in Networking Infrastructure Solutions
                   and Information Worker Solutions
NEW YORK &amp; SOUTHFIELD, Mich.--(Business Wire)--
Business Technology Partners, a premiere New York City-based IT
consulting and managed services firm, today announced it has attained
Gold Certified Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program with a
competency in Networking Infrastructure Solutions and Information
Worker Solutions recognizing Business Technology Partners' expertise
and impact in the technology marketplace. As a Gold Certified Partner,
Business Technology Partners has demonstrated expertise with Microsoft
technologies and a proven ability to meet customers' needs. Microsoft
Gold Certified Partners receive a rich set of benefits, including
access, training and support, giving them a competitive advantage in
the channel.

   "We are extremely pleased to have attained Gold Certified Partner
status in the Microsoft Partner Program. This allows us to clearly
promote our expertise and relationship with Microsoft to our
customers," said Joshua Aaron, President of BTP. "The benefits
provided through our Gold Certified Partner status will allow us to
continue to enhance the offerings that we provide for customers."

   "Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the
gap between their business demands and technology capabilities," said
Allison Watson, corporate vice president of the Worldwide Partner
Group at Microsoft Corp. "They need to trust in a company that can act
as an expert adviser for their long-term strategic technology plans.
Microsoft Gold Certified Partners, which have certified expertise and
direct training and support from Microsoft, can build a positive
customer experience with our technologies. Today, Microsoft recognizes
Business Technology Partners as a new Gold Certified Partner for
demonstrating its expertise in providing customer satisfaction using
Microsoft products and technology."

   As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner
status, Business Technology Partners had to declare a Microsoft
Competency. Microsoft Competencies are designed to help differentiate
a partner's capabilities with specific Microsoft technologies to
customers looking for a particular type of solution. Each Competency
has a unique set of requirements and benefits, formulated to
accurately represent the specific skills and services that partners
bring to the technology industry. Within select Competencies, there
are Specializations that focus on specific solution areas that
recognize deeper expertise within that Competency. Serving as a
specialized path to earning those Competencies, Specializations give

area of focus.

   Microsoft Gold Certified Partners enrolled in the Networking
Infrastructure Solutions Competency have proved their expertise in
implementing technology solutions based on either the Microsoft
Windows Server 2003 or Windows 2000 Server operating system, with a
particular focus on Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 and Windows
Small Business Server 2003. These implementations may include crafting
solutions that connect Windows-based servers, PC locations and the
Internet; installing a server farm; or building a small-business
Windows Server stand-alone solution that includes file and print
capabilities.

   "Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to
better enable ISVs to meet customer needs," said Sanjay Parthasarathy,
corporate vice president of the Developer and Platform Evangelism
Group at Microsoft Corp. "They allow ISVs to keep and win customers
through their deep knowledge of solutions-based Microsoft platform
technologies. Microsoft has a long history of working closely with ISV
partners to help them deliver compelling solutions and applications to
our mutual customers, and the Microsoft Competencies are an important
step in continuing to enhance vital relationships with ISVs
worldwide."

   The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and
represents Microsoft's ongoing commitment to the success of partners
worldwide. The program offers a single, integrated partnering
framework that recognizes partner expertise, rewards the total impact
that partners have in the technology marketplace, and delivers more
value to help partners' businesses be successful.

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Oct 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SOA Software, a leading Integrated SOA Governance Automation vendor, today
announced that it has expanded certification of the Microsoft .NET
Framework to include the Microsoft Managed Services Engine (MSE) as a
Governed Service Platform. Building on previous certifications of
Microsoft BizTalk Server and the .NET Framework, this expansion allows
customers to confidently use MSE as part of a heterogeneous enterprise
SOA environment sharing services with other commercial SOA platforms like
SAP NetWeaver, IBM WebSphere, BEA, and Oracle, as well as RedHat and
other open source providers.

    Certified Governed Service Platform status means that customers can be
confident that their platforms will not compromise the fidelity of the
governance systems and structures defined in an enterprise SOA program.
The certification process ensures that Governed Service Platforms can
implement and enforce governance policies providing reporting data to
enable a closed-loop audit process.

    SOA Software has provided custom Windows Communication Foundation bindings
and an extensible channel stack to provide additional governance
capabilities to enterprises using the MSE for service virtualization.
Security administrators can centrally define policies for services through
SOA Software's Policy Manager(TM) leveraging automated governance approval
processes. Once approved, the MSE can dynamically leverage the policy
exposed via WS-MetadataExchange to ensure consistent policy enforcement at
multiple levels of granularity.

    SOA Software provides channels for audit, monitoring, SLA, faults/events,
dynamic routing, message recording, and security including Kerberos,
mutual auth SSL, username token, authorization (XACML), trust (SAML) and
basic auth (LDAP). More channels are on their way; in some cases built by
customers and partners using SOA Software's published APIs.

    "The certification of Governed Service Platforms advances the discipline
of Integrated SOA Governance Automation," said Frank Martinez, executive
vice president of SOA Software. "Microsoft is deploying the MSE to provide
customers with advanced service virtualization capabilities and along with
SOA Software's membership in the Business Process Alliance (BPA), this
certification gives them the confidence that SOA Software's products will
preserve the fidelity of the governance models, structures and mechanisms
supporting their enterprise SOA program."

    Customers will add SOA Software's Integrated SOA Governance Automation
solution to the .NET Framework and MSE in order to:


--  Enable and coordinate enterprise-level Service Lifecycle management
    across the virtual services through automation and workflow tailored to fit
    an organization's roles and policies.

--  Leverage SOA software's end-to-end policy support between clients and
    services to streamline the effort necessary to enable enterprise governance
    models.

--  Make services they expose from applications running on .NET Framework
    visible to and compliant with enterprise policies defined, enforced and
    audited across other platforms; and make services they design and build

&lt;p&gt;Disney Interactive Studios Excavates New Intergalactic Adventures With Spectrobes: Beyond The Portals

        Sequel to Highly Popular Nintendo DS Game Now Available
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The portals to distant planets have opened and adventures lie
ahead. Disney Interactive Studios today announced that Spectrobes:
Beyond The Portals is now available at U.S. retailers. Spectrobes:
Beyond The Portals is the sequel to Spectrobes, one of the
best-selling third-party Nintendo DS(TM) games of 2007 with more than
1 million units shipped worldwide.

   Spectrobes: Beyond The Portals for Nintendo DS continues the story
of Rallen and Jeena, planetary patrol officers who discover, excavate,
awaken and train mysterious fossilized creatures known as Spectrobes
and then use them to battle enemies, known as the Krawl. The story
surrounds the origins of mysterious portals that lead to distant solar
systems and introduces new characters, including the dark Spectrobes.

   "Spectrobes: Beyond The Portals is an ambitious and immersive
Nintendo DS game that significantly expands upon the features of the
original," said Craig Relyea, senior vice president of global
marketing, Disney Interactive Studios. "The Spectrobes franchise is a
major focus for Disney Interactive Studios and this new release will
continue to excite players worldwide."

   Overseen by Disney Interactive Studios' Tokyo office and developed
by Kyoto, Japan-based Jupiter Corp., the studio behind Spectrobes and
the critically acclaimed The World Ends With You(R) from Square Enix,
Inc., Spectrobes: Beyond The Portals has a wide array of new features.
These include a new story; two new battle types -- one with the
Spectrobes and another with the main character, Rallen; a new,
revamped three-dimensional perspective with a view from behind the
character; a map to assist with exploration; new excavation features;
more than double the amount of Spectrobes; and new Nintendo Wi-Fi
Connection and local wireless features. Also, for the first time, the
game includes the ability to play as Rallen's partner, Jeena, to solve
challenges during special missions.

   The innovation from the first game continues with Spectrobes:
Beyond The Portals. Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection features include: the
debut of online battle; a variety of content available for download;
and a robust global community site with player profiles, 50 achievable
emblems, leaderboards and squads. Players can form squads with their
friends to determine the best player among them. The Wi-Fi market
feature enables players to list and sell their creatures to other
players globally using in-game currency, known as Gura. The local
wireless features include battle modes for two or four players (either
as two-player teams or individually); trading creatures and fossils;
and transferring existing creatures from Spectrobes to Spectrobes:
Beyond The Portals (two Nintendo DS systems required during the
transferring process).

   Code input cards, which were introduced with Spectrobes, have been
redesigned and will be unveiled with the game. The game includes a
random pack of four collectible cards, each of which can be placed
over the touch screen and used to enter a code with the stylus that
unlocks new content. Additional cards will be available in the future
through individual retail offers and other offers. In addition, the
code input cards available from Spectrobes are compatible with
Spectrobes: Beyond The Portals.

   Spectrobes: Beyond The Portals includes DGamer, Disney Interactive
Studios' innovative technology that provides a fun, connected online
game community for Disney video game fans. The DGamer features in
Spectrobes: Beyond The Portals include 15 unlockable badges based on
accomplishments in the game, Spectrobes-related outfits for players'
DGamer avatars and the ability to chat with friends using the Nintendo
Wi-Fi Connection or online at www.dgamer.com.

   "We approached Spectrobes: Beyond The Portals with the
expectations of significantly adding features and enhancing what was
already a deep and successful first game," said Kentaro Hisai,
producer, Disney Interactive Studios Japan. "Jupiter is among the best
development studios for creating original role playing games and
Spectrobes: Beyond The Portals will add to that reputation."

   Spectrobes: Beyond The Portals is rated E10+ for Everyone 10 and
Older by the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) and has a
suggested retail price of $29.99.

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA, Oct 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IOActive, an industry-leading provider of application security and risk
management services, today announced that it is one of nine companies
internationally selected to be a member of Microsoft's Security
Development Lifecycle (SDL) Pro Network, which will kick off its
year-long pilot phase in November 2008. The SDL Pro Network is a group of
security service providers that specialize in application security and
have substantial experience and expertise with the methodology and
technologies of the Microsoft SDL. The program is designed to make the
SDL accessible to companies outside of Microsoft, providing customer
protection while continuing to improve the process itself.

    Members of the SDL Pro Network will help organizations of all sizes
implement SDL through five capability areas:


    1. Training -- Provide security training and advice on implementing SDL
       in addition to exploring the company's organizational and policy
       capabilities.

    2. Requirements and Design -- Plan how security will be integrated into
       software design by examining user requirements, industry standards,
       and threat models.

    3. Implementation -- Perform code analysis and review, and enforce the
       use of safe APIs.

    4.  Verification -- Perform additional security code reviews alongside
        fuzzing and web application scanning.

    5.  Release and Response -- Perform a Final Security Review that
        includes response planning and execution to determine whether
        software is ready for customer delivery.

    
Part of Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing initiative, Microsoft
developed the SDL more than six years ago with the objective of producing
more secure software that could withstand the ever-changing nature of
malicious attacks. The SDL prescribes security and privacy measures
during each stage of development and requires that a final review occur
before the software is released. The result is that software developed
following the SDL protocol exhibits fewer security vulnerabilities.

    "IOActive is thrilled to be a member of this elite program and we are
flattered that Microsoft trusts us as capable of delivering expert SDL
services to the community. Institutions that choose to 'bake' security
into their development process -- as opposed to 'bolting' it on -- will
enjoy a significant competitive edge in the marketplace as enterprises and
consumers increasingly seek out organizations that invest in proactively
securing the technology ecosystem," said Joshua Pennell, president and CEO
of IOActive.

    Members of the SDL Pro Network are a select group of industry leaders that
specialize in application security and have extensive experience with the
Microsoft SDL. IOActive has worked closely with Microsoft for the last
five years on a number of key initiatives -- most notably, IOActive was
one of the few companies hired by Microsoft to perform the code review of
the Windows Vista operating system.

    "We are really excited to work with IOActive on this project," said David
Ladd, principal security program manager in Microsoft's Trustworthy
Computing group. "With help from industry leaders like IOActive, we hope
to not only increase accessibility of our SDL process, but to improve
security protocol in software development as a whole."

&lt;p&gt;  REDWOOD CITY, CA, Oct 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Nimsoft, the fastest growing systems management company, today announced
that the company has completed a funding round of $12 million led by new
investor Goldman Sachs with follow on investments from Series A investors
JMI Equity and Northzone Ventures. The company will use the funds to
continue its growth and help achieve its vision of becoming the world's
leading enterprise systems management software company.

    "Nimsoft has an innovative, well-run business model with a strong
management team," said David Campbell, Vice President, Principal
Investment Area, Goldman Sachs. "To operate modern data centers, it is
critical for IT customers to have robust systems management software that
is easy to deploy and maintain to ensure they are providing the right
level of service to their businesses. Nimsoft has a proven track record
of delivering this functionality to both large and small enterprises and
managed service providers (MSPs) around the world. We are pleased to
invest in Nimsoft to enable further growth as a leading enterprise
systems management provider."

    "Despite the tough economic times, we were overwhelmed with interest from
multiple prestigious investors," said Gary Read, president and CEO of
Nimsoft. "An investment from Goldman Sachs is further recognition of the
strength of our business model, product performance and future business
opportunity. With the global market experience and formidable resources of
Goldman Sachs added to the existing knowledge of our initial investors JMI
Equity and Northzone Ventures, we are confident we will continue to grow a
highly successful business."

    According to Gartner Dataquest, the worldwide revenue for IT operations
management software was $12.9 billion in 2007, representing 13.5 percent
annual growth.(1) Nimsoft extended its position in the Gartner "Magic
Quadrant for IT Event Correlation and Analysis, 2007" and has expanded to
700 customers in 30 countries. With revenue growth of 534 percent over
the past four years, Nimsoft is the fastest growing systems management
company in the world due largely to its easy-to-use performance and
availability monitoring software that offers a fast and compelling Return
on Investment.

    An InformationWeek product review ranked Nimsoft the "Best of the Best"
among nine application performance management (APM) solutions. APM is a
critical segment of systems management because it monitors the performance
of the customer experience -- in addition to core IT infrastructure
performance. InformationWeek reviewers noted Nimsoft was "a real leader"
in service level management for its "flexible and robust SLA reporting
engine" and ability to "report SLA performance granularly... which many
APM tools are unable to do."

    Lead Goldman Sachs investor David Campbell will join the Nimsoft board of
directors and provide strategic counsel for the company's ongoing
development and growth. Peter Arrowsmith of JMI Equity and Torleif Ahlsand
of Northzone Ventures will continue to serve on the Nimsoft board of
directors.

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Coca-Cola Hellenic, Semiconductor Manufacturing International, Infineon, Motorola and Priceline.com

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling
Company (NYSE: CCH), Semiconductor Manufacturing International (NYSE:
SMI), Infineon (NYSE: IFX), Motorola (NYSE: MOT) and Priceline.com
(Nasdaq: PCLN).

   Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the
free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

   Here are highlights from Monday's Analyst Blog:

   Coca-Cola Hellenic Upped to Buy

   Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (NYSE: CCH) enjoys an
attractive geographic mix with 66% of revenues being derived from
developing or emerging markets. In addition, the company's product mix
is less dependent on CSDs (carbonated soft drinks) than other
bottlers.

   Since the company conducts business and reports financial results
in Euros, much of the stock's performance is inversely correlated with
US dollar's exchange rate with the Euro. However, as management has a
sound business strategy and proven execution skills, the recent
earnings decline is providing a valuation-based buying opportunity.
Therefore, the stock has been upgraded to a Buy.

   SMI Reflects Pullback in Semis

   Semiconductor Manufacturing International (NYSE: SMI) is a Chinese
semiconductor foundry company with multiple integrated chip wafer
fabrication plants. SMI is the largest foundry company in China (third
largest worldwide) and operates multiple plants and fabrication (fab)
lines. Strategic alliances with Chartered, Toshiba, Infineon (NYSE:
IFX), Fujitsu, Motorola (NYSE: MOT), Elpida and IMEC have provided
access to intellectual property (IP) associated with a variety of
semiconductor process technologies.

   We remain concerned regarding operational performance in the
near-term given severe price declines in DRAM. The firm has announced
they plan to exit the DRAM business. We believe shares are currently
fairly valued and expect them to trade at current valuation metrics.
We continue to rate shares of SMI a Hold.

   Priceline Downgraded from Buy

   Priceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN) offers customers the ability to make
hotel reservations worldwide primarily under the Booking.com and Agoda
brands internationally and the Priceline.com brand in the U.S.

   Slowing economic growth domestically and around the globe is
negatively affecting Priceline.com's results. Macro conditions have
worsened in recent months, and problems in the credit markets are
making economic conditions more difficult.

   Due to slowing economic growth in Priceline's domestic and
international markets, we are reducing our estimates for the second
half of 2008 and full-year 2009. Our 2008 EPS estimate goes from $5.76
to $5.43 and our 2009 EPS estimate goes from $7.16 to $6.34.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Oct 7 (Reuters) - Tokyo Disney Resort operator
Oriental Land Co Ltd (4661.T) said on Tuesday it had scrapped a
plan for a new Disney-theme entertainment complex in a major
city in Japan, citing the poor prospects of the project's
investment returns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The firm said it would continue to explore possibilities for
a new business, which might not involve Disney characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company and Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) have spent more than
a year studying a plan to build an urban-style amusement
facility in 2010 or later, but they decided that the estimated
investment return would not justify the project, it said.

&lt;p&gt; * Preliminary Q3 EPS $2.05 beats estimates of $2.01&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Affirms 2008 profit outlook despite financial crisis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * IBM stock up 6 pct in late trade; bolsters other techs
 (Adds analyst comment on tech sector, margins, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tiffany Wu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 8 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) posted a
higher-than-expected preliminary quarterly profit and affirmed
its full-year outlook, calming some fears that the financial
crisis is sparking a meltdown in technology demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of IBM, the world's largest computer services
company, rose 6 percent on the news, which also bolstered other
technology shares that have been hammered on fears that a
global recession would crush corporate IT spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is very nice to see some positive news, not just for
IBM but for -- to a degree -- the tech space overall, given the
downdraft we have seen in recent weeks," said Chuck Jones,
technology analyst for Atlantic Trust Private Wealth
Management, which manages $16 billion of assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he and other investors were wary of calling a bottom
for the battered tech sector, pointing to pockets of weakness
such as the warning on Monday from European software giant SAP
AG (SAPG.DE) that it had seen a sudden drop-off in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In this market you are gun-shy about everything. It is
hard to have a lot of conviction about anything out there," he
said, but added, "This also can be a good time to buy stocks.
When things look the bleakest, this is a good time to put some
money to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp said on Wednesday its
third-quarter net income jumped 20 percent to $2.8 billion as
revenue rose 5 percent to $25.3 billion, including 3 points
from currency benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings per share from continuing operations rose to
$2.05, compared to $1.68 a year earlier, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts were looking for earnings of $2.01 per share on
revenue of $26.5 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano said in a statement that
IBM was confident about its 2008 outlook, citing a steady base
of recurring revenue and profits, and investments for growth in
emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For companies to be reaffirming their outlook through the
end of the year is h-u-g-e," said Mike Holland, chairman of
investment company Holland  Co, who oversees assets in excess
of $4 billion, including IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In this environment, the combination of meeting current
expectations but also reaffirming their outlook is an
incredible performance," he said. "You made my evening," he
told Reuters after getting the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM AS SAFE HAVEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has been one of the bright spots in technology this
year as the Armonk, New York-based company gets about
two-thirds of revenue from outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although a quarter of revenue comes from the hard-pressed
financial services sector, IBM enjoys recurring income from
services and software contracts that account for about half its
business, providing a buffer during sharp economic downturns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the second quarter, IBM's profit had blown past Wall
Street expectations and it had raised its 2008 profit per share
forecast to at least $8.75, or 22 percent year-on-year growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many investors had viewed IBM shares as a safe haven
earlier this year, but the stock has been pummeled in recent
weeks along with other tech shares and the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Since the stock was at $120 three weeks ago and is now at
$90, clearly investors were really worried about the technology
market," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital
Group. "For IBM to have done pretty well in the third quarter
and affirm the full-year guidance is a good sign."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caughey, whose firm owns IBM shares, said they had been
buying tech shares in recent days: "It's been my sense all
along that this is not a tech problem. This is not 2001."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares, which had fallen 5.33 percent to close at
$90.55 on the New York Stock Exchange earlier on Wednesday,
rose to $96 in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of rival Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) rose 3 percent,
Dell DELL.O rose 2 percent, while Oracle ORCL.O and
Microsoft (MSFT.O) gained about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM is scheduled to post quarterly results on Oct. 16. The
unexpected preliminary report on Wednesday comes on the eve of
the lifting of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ban on
short-selling of more than 950 stocks, including IBM. The end
of the ban has concerned some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM also said its gross margin in the third quarter
improved to 43.3 percent from 41.3 percent a year earlier. Its
pretax income rose 19 percent to $3.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While some analysts noted that IBM's revenue was a little
weak after excluding currency benefits, they also noted that
the company has controlled costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Earnings were solid, revenues were weak. That's probably a
good sign but a problem overall for the global economy," said
Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer, Solaris Asset
Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Eric Auchard, Gabriel Madway and

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - If Cyrus Nowrasteh wants to work for Disney again, he's got a funny way of showing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nowrasteh wrote the ABC miniseries "The Path to 9/11," but in a new documentary he scolds the network and its parent company for allowing powerful politicians to effectively censor the show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And therein lies a main premise of "Blocking the Path to 9/11," the straight-to-DVD movie that hits Blockbuster, Best Buy, Netflix and Amazon.com on Tuesday, and is also available for $19.95 from the movie's Web site (www.blockingthepath.com): Why is a documentary about a popular ABC miniseries hitting store shelves while the miniseries itself is unavailable on DVD?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documentary makes the case that Disney CEO Bob Iger bowed to pressure from President Clinton and the Democratic Party not only to alter parts of the miniseries before it aired in 2006 but also to make sure the DVD never sees the light of day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also suggests that Disney isn't interested in selling the rights to "Path to 9/11" to another company -- perhaps Lionsgate -- that would release it on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger, in fact, took heat from a shareholder at its annual meeting in March for not attempting to recoup some of the $40 million Disney spent to make the miniseries, which aired without commercials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowrasteh said that 25 million people watched "Path to 9/11" over two nights, and the controversy it engendered over scenes that Disney cut would practically guarantee its success on DVD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documentary was bankrolled by Citizens United, a conservative nonprofit group run by David Bossie, a former chief investigator into Clinton's alleged involvement in the Whitewater scandal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bossie called the documentary "a remarkable tale of pressure from the Clinton attack machine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney declined comment for this report, but Nowrasteh says in the documentary that president of Disney-ABC Television Group Anne Sweeney told him, "There is nothing that Disney or ABC has ever done that is better" than "Path to 9/11."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nowrasteh also said ABC Entertainment president Steve McPherson thought the miniseries so good that he wanted to show it annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such praise, though, went out the window when Iger received a call from Clinton complaining about the miniseries and Democratic operatives hit the airwaves with complaints and even conspiracy theories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, says "Path to 9/11" director David Cunningham, "Mostly, everybody involved with this movie consider themselves liberals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One particularly goofy claim, Cunningham said, was that he and ABC were being secretly directed by Cunningham's father, a prominent Christian minister, to make a miniseries critical of Clinton. And the documentary takes Keith Olbermann, MSNBC and other news outlets to task for taking such innuendo seriously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documentary stars its writer-director, John Ziegler, a former talk-radio host at KFI-AM Los Angeles. Ziegler said many top Disney executives -- more than were portrayed in the documentary -- were upset that Disney caved to political pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quinn Taylor, ABC's senior vp movies and television, for example, told Ziegler that Disney prevented him from publicly defending the show, "preferring to allow the movie to be attacked by the left as right-wing propaganda."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documentary not only goes after Disney, ABC, Iger, Olbermann and Clinton but also one of the stars of the miniseries: Harvey Keitel, shown bashing the miniseries and complaining that he was tricked into playing his role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Ziegler first shows footage of Keitel -- on the last day of shooting the miniseries -- praising the cast and wishing them "big success" with the show. Then Nowrasteh explains how the "Clinton spin machine" contacted several "Path to 9/11" actors and pressured them to speak against the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Harvey cut and ran," Nowrasteh said. "It's the most despicable act of cowardice I've ever witnessed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, ABC showed the project with three minutes cut out, the editing overseen by top Disney executives two days before airtime, Nowrasteh said. Those scenes are shown in the documentary marked in red text: "Removed by demand of Bill Clinton."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Edited out were references to Osama Bin Laden by name and some scenes of Clinton's grand jury testimony about Monica Lewinsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More significantly, though, were intermittent snippets of dialogue that, once removed, make some scenes difficult to follow. For example, CIA analyst Patricia Carver is asked via radio by soldiers in Afghanistan for "clearance to load the package" as women and children are approaching Bin Laden. Carver, seeking permission from National Security Adviser Sandy Berger to kill Bin Laden before the opportunity passes, says: "We know that the special action team has pinpointed the target. We know enough to try." But while the second sentence is in the miniseries, Disney cut out the first sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't understand the scene, and I directed it," Cunningham said after seeing Disney's edits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the largest section edited out was a scene showing Afghani and American soldiers disgusted when they can't get permission to kill Bin Laden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Are there any men left in Washington, or are they all cowards?" asks an Afghani soldier in the scene that was struck from the miniseries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They shouldn't have removed a frame," Nowrasteh said. "The movie had it right."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHUCK JONES, TECHNOLOGY ANALYST FOR ATLANTIC TRUST PRIVATE WEALTH MANAGEMENT, WHICH MANAGES $16 BILLION OF ASSETS FOR LARGELY HIGH NET-WORTH INDIVIDUALS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very nice to see some positive news not just for IBM but for, to a degree, the tech space overall, given the downdraft we have seen in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At least it's a bit of a relief rally. It makes you feel more comfortable about IBM...&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't see it as a wholesale 'all clear' for technology stocks. SAP just preannounced earlier this week. That's not surprising given that they are a software company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The revenue was a little weak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jones calculates that in constant currency terms revenue rose 2 percent compared with 6 percent growth on the same basis in the second quarter and 4 percent in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a normalized tech spending environment, IBM wouldn't have reported 6 percent constant currency growth, but could have done 4 percent, all other things being equal"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM made up the difference between top line and bottom line figures by tighter expense control to the tune of about $200 million by Jones' estimates. "It doesn't look like they became really draconian on their expenses. The bottom line is that they saved a couple of hundred million dollars."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outstanding question that investors will have to await to hear more detail on the conference call will be what IBM executives have to say on October 16 about how much of their business got pulled away due to concerns in the market, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this market you are gun-shy about everything.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Ordered to Pay Broker $1 Million, According to Clouse Dunn
Khoshbin LLP -- GS

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 8, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A panel of securities industry
arbitrators has ordered investment banking giant Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) to pay
one of its former brokers $1 million following an investigation into the
company's compensation system.

Greg Fullmer, 49, of Los Angeles, worked for Goldman Sachs for 11 years until
the company fired him in 2004, according to the claim filed with the Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) in Los Angeles. During Mr. Fullmer's
employment, Goldman Sachs restructured its compensation plan for brokers, and
began withholding a portion of brokers' commissions and converting them to
restricted stock accounts that would pay out over time. Doing so saved the
company approximately $250 million annually.

But when Goldman Sachs fired Mr. Fullmer, the claim states, it refused to pay
him that money, saying he had forfeited his pay by soliciting firm employees to
work elsewhere. In the decision handed down late last night, the FINRA panel
ordered the company to pay Mr. Fullmer $1 million.

"This ruling fully vindicates Mr. Fullmer and restores his hard-earned good
reputation," says attorney Rogge Dunn of Clouse Dunn Khoshbin LLP in Dallas, who
represents Mr. Fullmer. "Obviously, he earned these commissions, and this award
recognizes that."

Mr. Dunn says the Goldman Sachs deferred compensation plan is a classic case of
"golden handcuffs." He says the company's restrictions on the deferred funds and
attempts to force brokers to forfeit them are designed to keep brokers from
taking their business to other firms.

Also representing Mr. Fullmer is attorney Shain Khoshbin of Clouse Dunn Khoshbin
LLP.

Mr. Dunn noted that Mr. Fullmer was a top producer in Goldman Sach's Los Angeles
office and was chosen to provide training for the company's new hires in New
York. Currently, Mr. Fullmer works at UBS, where he is the top producer in that
firm's Los Angeles office and one of the company's top 15 investment advisors
nationwide, out of more than 7,000 UBS professionals.

This is the second million-dollar award Mr. Dunn has won against Goldman Sachs.
On January 13, 2006, another arbitration panel awarded $2.5 million to a broker
who worked in Goldman Sach's San Francisco office and brought similar claims.

Mr. Dunn and Mr. Khoshbin regularly represent brokers and executives in the
brokerage industry. They have litigated complex business and employment disputes
throughout the country. Mr. Dunn is board certified in both Civil Trial Law and
Labor and Employment Law by the Texas Board of Legal Specialization.

ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE:IBM) today announced third-quarter 2008 diluted earnings
of $2.05 per share from continuing operations, an increase of 22
percent, compared with diluted earnings of $1.68 per share in the
third quarter of 2007. The company also reported net income of $2.8
billion, an increase of 20 percent. Revenue increased 5 percent,

   IBM said it continues to expect full-year 2008 earnings per share
of at least $8.75, or year-to-year growth of 22 percent.

   The company's gross profit margin in the third quarter was 43.3
percent compared with 41.3 percent in the third quarter of 2007.
Pre-tax income was $3.9 billion, an increase of 19 percent compared
with the third quarter of 2007.

   At the end of the third quarter, IBM's year-to-date free cash flow
was approximately $6.4 billion and its cash balance was $9.8 billion.

   "Our results demonstrate that the combination of a steady base of
recurring revenue and profits, investments for growth in emerging
markets, a range of products and services that deliver value to
clients, and a strong and flexible financial foundation give IBM a
competitive edge in good times and tough times," said Samuel J.
Palmisano, IBM chairman, president and chief executive officer. "We
remain confident in our full-year outlook."

   IBM will provide more detailed information about its third quarter
results during its regularly scheduled Webcast.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Cocaine addicts may have brain deficits that predispose them to drug abuse, and abusing drugs appears to make matters worse, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They said images of cocaine addicts' brains reveal abnormalities in the cerebral cortex -- the brain's outer surface -- and these changes relate to dysfunction in areas responsible for attention and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These data point to a mixture of both drug effects and predisposition underlying the structural alterations we observed," said Dr. Hans Breiter of Massachusetts General Hospital, whose research appears in the journal Neuron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breiter and colleagues compared magnetic resonance images, or MRIs, of 20 cocaine addicts with 20 carefully matched volunteers to map out cocaine-related differences in the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Compared to their healthy counterparts, cocaine addicts had far less overall volume in the cortex, the outer layer that helps plan, execute and control behavior. These differences were especially pronounced in areas regulating reward, attention and decision-making.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also noticed that while the healthy volunteers tended to have thicker areas in some frontal regions on the right side of the brain, this was reversed in the addicts. And overall, the addicts had less variation in the thickness of their cortex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Differences in the right and left side of the brain are important because they typically suggest a genetic cause, Breiter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers also found changes in the cingulate -- another reward center -- that appeared to correspond with the length of cocaine use but not nicotine or alcohol use, suggesting that these changes were the result of long-term cocaine exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Human studies have shown differences in how addicts make judgments and decisions, but it is not well understood how these differences relate to alterations in the structure of the brains of addicts," Breiter said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The researchers said the findings underscore the importance of keeping vulnerable people from using cocaine. And they said follow-up studies should be done to see if similar changes are present in people with other addictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Julie Steenhuysen, editing by Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - No CEO gets to their lofty perch without a healthy dose of narcissism.

For one, a comedy series about executives trying to bring innovation to a baseball-card company feels autobiographical coming from Eisner, who actually bought Topps last year for $380 million with the mandate of rejuvenating the brand. Of all the subjects Eisner's digital studio, Vuguru, could have devoted a Web series to, he just happened to pick another company he owned. In addition, Eisner himself is a recurring offscreen character in "Topps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But here's the catch about this study in self-absorption: "Topps" happens to be both an exercise in executive egomania and a very funny Web series (a rarity) to boot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In "Topps," twin comedians Randy and Jason Sklar play the fictional Leyland and Leif Topps, potential successors to the throne at the not-fictional Topps company. But the brothers get a rude awakening when informed that their beloved Uncle Marvin Topps has sold the company to the not-fictional Eisner, who has installed a proxy functionary to ride herd on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Leyland and Leif are total nincompoops who spend every episode following through on every pipe dream they've ever had about Topps, like "avant cards," in which they suggest hiring Diane Arbus to shoot pitcher Randy Johnson. Whereupon they are informed Arbus is dead and therefore unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the workplace zaniness of "30 Rock," Topps doubles as solid online entertainment and a promotional platform for the baseball card company. But Eisner himself gets more than a few plugs. Although he doesn't ever actually appear, someone playing him pipes in via speakerphone and barks orders. There's even the casting of a black version of Eisner, who is referred to as "Bleisner" (don't ask).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On paper, "Topps" seems like the kind of thing you shoot on a shoestring for a corporate retreat. But that's the weird thing about Internet programing: It is so niche by nature that what might seem too -- pardon the pun -- inside baseball actually can have enough viewers to survive. "Topps" is what original programing on the Internet should be: Funny enough to be on TV but too niche to survive on even basic cable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's even stranger is that as self-glorifying an impulse as "Topps" may be driven by, it is far and away better than other series Vuguru has done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything, "Topps" underscores what an odd moment Eisner is at in his career. Here's a pretty Internet-savvy guy who happens to be investing in a company that couldn't seem any more old-media: Topps, a 70-year-old purveyor of cardboard pictures of baseball players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's always been something kind of daffy about Eisner's Topps acquisition, down to his assertion that the company's mascot, Bazooka Joe, had the potential to be a media property akin to Mickey Mouse -- he of Eisner's previous employer, the Walt Disney Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the bubblegum fumes wafting off Topps' core product are starting to get to Eisner. Although Bazooka Joe's Q rating isn't public, my guess is his brand equity ranks somewhere between the Maytag repairman and Chef Boyardee. Attention "Entourage" writers: Vincent Chase cast as Bazooka Joe -- you can dine out for an entire season on that joke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if you ask Eisner nicely, something tells me he'll be up for a cameo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) announced today that it has donated
$500,000 to the State of California's Department of Forestry and Fire
Protection (CAL FIRE) to help support the cost of battling the state's
severe wildfires this year.

   "On behalf of the people of California, I offer Chevron my sincere
thanks for its generous donation to support our state's firefighting
efforts in the face of one of the most difficult and costly fire
seasons in history," Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger said. "California
has the most courageous and best trained firefighters in the world,
and we must ensure they are equipped with the resources needed to
protect our communities. The cooperation during this year's fires has
been fantastic, and I am pleased to see private support because as
Californians, we are all in this situation together."

   The Chevron donation is in response to the more than 2,000 fires
this summer that engulfed nearly 1.2 million acres across the state -
several times the annual average - and required the response of
firefighters from CAL FIRE, local firefighters and other volunteers.

   "As a California company, we're grateful for the courage and
determination of California firefighters who put themselves at risk to
protect our state and its resources," said Chevron vice chairman Peter
Robertson. "This contribution is, in part, recognition of their
outstanding public service."

   The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection is
dedicated to the fire protection and stewardship of more than 31
million acres of California's privately-owned wildlands. The
Department's firefighters, fire engines, and aircraft respond to an
average of more than 5,600 wildland fires each year. Those fires burn
more than 172,000 acres annually.

   "I am pleased with this demonstration of Chevron's commitment to
public safety and partnership with CAL FIRE," said Chief Ruben
Grijalva. "Wildfires and other disasters strike California all too
often. With support from public and private organizations, such as
Chevron, CAL FIRE stands ready to prepare for, respond to, and recover
from disasters that may impact all Californians. Chevron's
demonstration of corporate responsibility serves as a great example of
public/private partnerships within California's emergency response
community."

   Chevron has a history of providing support when natural disasters
occur in the state, most recently a $500,000 grant from the Chevron
Foundation in October 2007 for relief efforts related to the Southern
California wildfires. In addition to the monetary support in 2007,
Chevron also provided 20,000 bottles of water, 11,500 meals and a
firefighting team and engine was dispatched from the Richmond
Refinery.

   To further support fire safety and prevention, Chevron will
introduce a fire truck as its next Chevron Toy Car with packaging that
will include fire safety tips for children.

&lt;p&gt;Company Exceeds Initial Goal;

                Pledges 20 Percent Reduction Between Now and 2012
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) honored Pfizer Inc today in
recognition of the company's award-winning Energy and Climate Change Program,
which reduced total greenhouse gas emissions by 43 percent per million dollars
of revenue from 2000 to 2007.

These reductions, which exceeded Pfizer's original goal of 35 percent, were
achieved in partnership with the EPA's Climate Leaders Program. Climate Leaders
is a public-private initiative in which the EPA works with companies to develop
comprehensive climate change strategies. Today's announcement was made during a
meeting of energy and climate change leaders in Chicago.

"Climate change is the world's greatest global environmental challenge and has
the potential to adversely impact the health of millions of people," said Natale
S. Ricciardi, president of Pfizer Global Manufacturing. "As the largest
research-based biomedical and pharmaceutical company, we have a responsibility
to act proactively on environmental health issues. By voluntarily reducing our
GHG emissions and promoting energy conservation, we hope to increase awareness
and encourage others to do the same."

Due to the leadership of its Global Energy and Climate Change Team and the
efforts of colleagues worldwide, Pfizer exceeded its GHG reduction goals by
implementing more than 1,000 projects during the duration of the goal. The
projects included installing a combined heating and power system at its
Singapore facility; a geothermal system at its Freiburg, Germany, site; a
photovoltaic (solar panel) system at its LaJolla, Calif., facility; and boiler
efficiency upgrades at its Kalamazoo, Mich., site, as well as many smaller
projects.

Pfizer has also taken steps to improve the fuel efficiency in its sales fleet
through several approaches including raising driver awareness of efficient
driving methods and increased use of fuel cards, dual-fuel, and hybrid vehicles
in certain markets.

In his remarks at today's conference, Mr. Ricciardi said Pfizer pledges to
reduce total global GHG emissions by an additional 20 percent from 2008 to 2012.
He noted that Climate Leaders recently endorsed the goal.

"We look forward to continuing our partnership with the EPA in this effort," Mr.
Ricciardi said. "We will build upon our initial success by implementing
additional energy efficiency projects, adding cogeneration capacity and other
clean energy technologies, and improving fuel efficiency in our sales fleet."

Through its Energy and Climate Change Program, which began in 2000, Pfizer has
established public metrics and achieved significant greenhouse gas emission
reductions, implemented energy conservation measures, and achieved cost savings.
Pfizer has been recognized globally, regionally and locally for its commitment
to addressing these challenges.

&lt;p&gt;dabs.com Chooses Multi-Channel Retail Software from Junction Solutions and Microsoft Dynamics AX to Drive Growth and Improve Customer Service

    --Multi-channel retail pioneer dabs.com, which sells through a
          combination of online retailing and telephone based
  business-to-business account management, has started to implement a
  business management solution from Junction Solutions and Microsoft
Dynamics to support its planned growth, improve efficiency and deliver
                       better customer service--
SHEFFIELD, England--(Business Wire)--
Junction Solutions, a provider of multi-channel retail enterprise
software and services based on the Microsoft Dynamics AX platform,
today announced that dabs.com, part of BT PLC group and one of the
leading direct retailers of electronics goods and services in the UK,
has selected JunctionRES from Junction Solutions to underpin their
entire operation, to drive growth, enable efficiency and deliver
improved customer service.

   Established in 1987, dabs.com sells a huge range of home
computing, consumer electronics and business IT products to consumer
and B2B customers across the UK and Eire. Beginning as mainly a
business to consumer operation, the company has also grown its
business to business channel over recent years. dabs.com now sells
around 15,000 products via catalogues, inbound and out bound call
centres and via six different website stores including dabs.com and
dabs4work.com.

   The company needed to replace its home-grown systems due to their
decreasing ability to keep up with the fast paced evolution of the
business. They decided to replace them with a new multi-channel retail
enterprise-wide (ERP) solution to better manage planning, purchasing,
warehouse, order processing, customer services, returns and marketing.
After reviewing many software vendors, dabs.com chose Junction
Solutions and Microsoft Dynamics AX.

   Neil Catto, Financial Director at dabs.com said, "Our business
operates across many channels on single digit margins. With prices
changing daily on short life-cycle product lines that can last for as
little as 3 weeks, efficient and flexible technology is absolutely
fundamental to our success. Having looked at the marketplace, we felt
that Microsoft Dynamics AX stood out as the most flexible, intuitive
and powerful ERP platform around."

   The company said that because it holds only around 3-4 weeks stock
at any time, accurately forecasting demand and knowing the quantities
and types of stock it needs to order is the best way of avoiding over-
or out-of-stocks.

   "Junction Solutions demonstrated an intimate understanding of
multi-channel retail and also provided a proven retail solution built
on Microsoft Dynamics AX, so it was an obvious choice for us. The deep
integration of JunctionRES and Consumer Driven Planning, along with
the technology stack offered through the Microsoft Dynamics AX
architecture provides endless opportunities for us as a company," said
Catto.

   Once the project is complete, Dabs anticipates a reduced cost of
purchasing from its suppliers due to improved supply chain visibility,
shorter lead times and reduced levels of reserve stock. Improved stock
availability and more targeted analysis of marketing initiatives are
likely to give rise to increased sales. Other benefits cited include:
improved reporting across the business; tighter controls; cost
reductions through the automation of administrative functions; and
improved operational speeds, for instance on customer orders and
logistics.

   Hector Hickmott, Sales Director at Junction Solutions, said, "We
are delighted to welcome another key multi-channel retailer to our
customer community. Junction Solutions is completely focussed on
developing deep functionality for this sector and look forward to a
long and successful relationship with Dabs. It is great to see
successful companies like Dabs endorsing the huge amount investment we
have made, over the last five years, in our multi-channel retail
solution on Microsoft Dynamics AX."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a new initiative to help Business
Partners develop and deepen solution competencies and skills to leverage
New Enterprise Data Center transformation opportunities. In addition to
sales, marketing and technical guidance, Business Partners can also
qualify to receive as much as 100 thousand dollars in business
development funds.

    IBM's New Enterprise Data Center strategy is an evolutionary model
designed to help businesses transform their IT infrastructures to become
more energy efficient and responsive to business needs. The new program
will enable Business Partners to develop and deepen their solution
selling skills in three specific areas: virtualization/consolidation,
energy efficiency and business resiliency. Through a broad range of
education, certifications and assessment tools Business Partners can more
effectively develop deeper skills and capabilities, and drive higher
margin sales in these growing markets.

    IBM developed the new program based on input from IBM Business Partner
councils from around the world who also believe that this is the way that
the industry is moving. The result is the industries most comprehensive
program that spans the IBM hardware, software and services lines and
supports customers development strategies from inception to execution that
recognizes Business Partners who invest in and sell the full IBM portfolio
to address clients' IT transformation needs.

    IT analysts estimate that the majority of the Global 1000 organizations
will have to significantly modify their data centers in the next five
years. Already, they are short of space, short of energy, and lack the
power and cooling necessary for handling the next generation of
high-density server and storage gear. What's also alarming is that in the
2008 IBM Global CEO study, more than 80% of CEOs surveyed stated they
anticipate significant change in the marketplace in the next three years,
yet the gap in their confidence on their ability to support, even embrace
these changes has more than tripled.

    As client needs shift to more challenging and higher value IT problems,
IBM is arming its Business Partners with the opportunity to expand their
skills and increase their growth by delivering offerings based on customer
demands.

    For example, specialty accredited Business Partners will have the ability
to measure the energy consumption of a data center before and after a
project, providing clients with information to help them claim subsequent
energy efficiency credits. Partners will have the skills to reduce the
complexity and increase the efficiency of the client's IT environment.
They will be able to help clients reduce power consumption by 40% and
floor space occupancy by 60% for the same workload through advanced
virtualization techniques.

    Business Partners that participate in the New Enterprise Data Center
Specialty can also take advantage of:

    The Business Development Fund -- An upfront payment for qualifying
Business Partners which can be used to invest not only in marketing but
in business development activities, marketing intelligence, investment and
certification training and even personnel salaries, that will result in
New Enterprise Data Center solutions opportunities and revenue. 


    IBM Lab Services -- Partners can take advantage of mentoring services from
IBM researchers on new technologies, first implementation services and
technical requirements. IBM Lab Services will be offered in North America,
Western Europe, China and India.  

    IBM NEDC Toolkit -- Partners will be able to use IBM assessment tools, to
better understand the client's issues and opportunities for improvement to
their infrastructure, to make if more resilient, and more efficient. 


    Increased Sales Support -- For Partners at the highest specialty
achievement category, the opportunity to utilize the IBM Deal Hub resource
to assist them in coordinating, facilitating and manage pre-sales
activities across various IBM channel aligned resources, including
pricing, regardless of the size of the opportunity.

    Business Partners that achieve accreditation will receive a specialty mark
certifying that they have acquired the skills and experience in one or
more of the New Enterprise Data Center solution areas and is recognized
by IBM as an expert. In addition, they are awarded US$25,000 to
US$100,000 in business development funds and gain access to a broad
portfolio of education, marketing, and sales benefits that support their
go-to-market activities.

    The new Specialty consists of two achievement categories -- Specialty and
Specialty Elite. Specialty is designed to provide a growth path for
Business Partners who wish to expand their IBM New Enterprise Data Center
capabilities. Partners who wish to make a deeper investment in IBM New
Enterprise Data Center skills can qualify for Specialty Elite.

    "The New Enterprise Data Center Specialty, part of IBM's company-wide new
enterprise data center strategy, underscores our ongoing commitment to
deliver programs that help our partners expand their business and
profitability," said Rich Hume, general manager, IBM Global Business
Partners. "No other vendor has an offering for its Business Partners as
complete. This offering includes assessment tools that helps them identify
and deliver these solutions in a consistent way."

    IBM Business Partners that have previewed the Specialty and gave an
enthusiastic response to the education, marketing, sales and support
benefits.

    "IBM's New Enterprise Data Center Specialty program will help define how
businesses, solution providers and IBM will shape the future of the
technology industry," said Eric Borcherding, vice president of CIBER
Enterprise Solutions' Technology Solutions Practice. "This new program
further demonstrates IBM's commitment to provide a higher level of skills
and cooperation with its partners to generate success. At CIBER, we
believe this program will enable us to work directly with our clients to
develop a comprehensive strategy to effectively reduce power/cooling,
improve security and resiliency, reduce IT costs and build a flexible
foundation for the future."

    The New Enterprise Data Center

    IBM's New Enterprise Data Center strategy is an evolutionary model
designed to help businesses transform their IT infrastructures to become
more efficient, service-oriented and responsive to business needs.
Organizations that employ this approach can be better positioned to adopt
and integrate new technologies, such as Web 2.0 and Cloud Computing, in
order to deliver dynamic and seamless access to IT services and resources.
The New Enterprise Data Center model integrates five elements or solution
areas: highly virtualized resources; efficient, green and optimized
infrastructures and facilities; business-driven services management;
business resiliency and security; and information infrastructure.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 8 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) reported continued
unplanned flaring on Tuesday at its 150,000 barrel-per-day Los Angeles-area
refinery, according to filing with state regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The 150,000 bpd refinery, in Torrance, continued to operate despite the
"unplanned flaring event," according to the company's filing with the
California Governor's Office of Emergency Services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The event is ongoing but the refinery continues to operate," it
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil gave no further details, and refinery officials could not
immediately be reached or comment.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 8 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Cadence
Design Systems Inc (CDNS.O) to "overweight" from "underweight,"
saying the software company's scheduled restructuring and its
contract renewals in 2009 and 2011 make it an investment
choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By no means is this an easy call," analyst Sterling Auty
said in a note to clients. "There will be several bumps along
the way as management has to reinvigorate a lagging product
portfolio, meet new competition in its analog strong hold,
restructure its workforce and combat sluggish demand for EDA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This could put Cadence into three- to four-year transition
that would take its margin expansion up to 21 percent in 2012
from zero percent this year, the analyst added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The electronic design automation (EDA) software sector will
get healthier in 2009 and should lag the impact of the
semiconductor industry, which is expected to get worse before
better in 2009, Auty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Auty said the company's shares look attractive on both a
free cash flow multiple and a discounted free cash flow basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $5.16 Tuesday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc tried to suppress medical studies that did not support the use of its epilepsy drug Neurontin, internal Pfizer documents submitted in a U.S. lawsuit against the company showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The documents suggest that Pfizer's marketers influenced Neurontin's scientific record to boost sales at least until 2003 by delaying the publication or altering the conclusions of studies that had found no evidence the drug worked for various conditions besides epilepsy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, denied the charges. "Pfizer is committed to the communication of medically or scientifically significant results of all studies, regardless of outcome," a company spokesman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is the latest in a string of allegations against the pharmaceutical industry suggesting it has controlled the flow of clinical trial research to boost its marketing position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents, including reports by experts who reviewed thousands of company documents for plaintiffs, were submitted to the U.S. District Court in Boston and were made available on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neurontin was a blockbuster product for Pfizer until 2004, when generic versions of the medicine hit the market. Sales totaled $2.7 billion in 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer agreed in 2004 to pay $430 million and plead guilty to criminal charges for illegally marketing Neurontin for unapproved uses such as migraines and pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversy over clinical studies surrounding the treatment echo other recent cases in the drugs industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. researchers, for example, claimed in August that Merck  Co Inc had conducted a clinical trial into Vioxx to support a marketing campaign before the launch of the painkiller. Vioxx was withdrawn on safety grounds in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And both Merck and Schering-Plow Corp were criticised earlier this year for delaying release of negative trial results for their cholesterol drug Vytorin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Hirschler and Ajay Kamalakaran in Bangalore; Editing by John Stonestreet and David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: Wipro, Ltd. (NYSE: WIT),
Skechers USA, Inc. (NYSE: SKX), Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Co. (NYSE:
CCH), Scientific Games Corp. (Nasdaq: SGMS) and AtheroGenics, Inc.
(Nasdaq: AGIX).

   Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the
free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

   Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:

   Wipro ADR Estimates Adjusted

   Wipro, Ltd. (NYSE: WIT) ADR is a global provider of IT services,
software solutions, and research and development (R) services, and
is the third largest in India. It has development centers in India and
abroad, which utilize its global resource pool and quality processes
to provide cost-effective IT solutions to its clients around the
world.

   We remain concerned that margins may continue to be pressured for
currency fluctuations and acquisition-related integration issues in
the near-term. However, there has been minimal reduction in operating
margins despite salary hikes to onsite employees. The company has also
provided improved revenue guidance for 2Q09 and integration of its
acquisitions seems to be well on track.

   Skechers a Hold in Current Climate

   In July, Skechers (NYSE: SKX) issued third-quarter guidance that
was below consensus expectations. Macro risks have increased in the
last two months, and economic conditions have worsened. These
conditions are continuing to pressure consumer discretionary spending,
and that is negatively affecting the footwear maker' results.
Therefore, we are reducing our estimates for 2008 and 2009.

   Longer term, the Manhattan Beach, California-based company's
diverse portfolio of brands, international growth opportunities, and
retail store expansion should bode well for its stock price. Still,
its near-term upside will be limited until macro conditions show signs
of improving. We maintain our Hold rating.

   Coca-Cola Hellenic Upped to Buy

   Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (NYSE: CCH) enjoys an
attractive geographic mix with 66% of revenues being derived from
developing or emerging markets. In addition, the company's product mix
is less dependent on CSDs (carbonated soft drinks) than other
bottlers.

   Since the company conducts business and reports financial results
in Euros, much of the stock's performance is inversely correlated with
US dollar's exchange rate with the Euro. However, as management has a
sound business strategy and proven execution skills, the recent
earnings decline is providing a valuation-based buying opportunity.
Therefore, the stock has been upgraded to a Buy.

   Scientific Games a Smart Play

   Scientific Games (Nasdaq: SGMS) has a leading position in several
markets, including the instant ticket and online lottery markets. In
addition, Scientific Games continues to win significant contracts in
both the instant ticket and online lottery markets from both domestic
and international lottery authorities.

   Also, the company has made several acquisitions that have
accelerated top-line growth. Ron Perelman, a world-renowned private
investor, owns 28.1% of the company's stock. The Buy rating is
maintained.

   AGIX Files for Chapter 11

   For those of you still holding onto AtheroGenics (Nasdaq: AGIX),
the research-based pharmaceutical company with two clinical-stage drug
development programs (according to Zacks senior drug industry analyst
Jason Napodano, CFA, who published a report on AGIX last week), the
company has just announced today it has filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy.

   The question now seems to be who, if anyone, will pick up the
pieces of the late-phase candidates AGIX had been developing. But for
anyone shocked by today's announcement, they shouldn't be. From the
same AGIX report: "The company previously released phase III data on
lead compound AGI-1067 that did not meet the primary end point."

&lt;p&gt;ROME Oct 8 (Reuters) - The investment by Italian oil

should be similar to that made by U.S. major ExxonMobil Corp.
(XOM.N), Papua New Guinea Prime Minister Sir Michael Somare said

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Oct 8 (Reuters) - Indonesian state oil firm
Pertamina is seeking a 10 percent participating interest in gas
fields in Indonesia operated by U.S. oil major Chevron (CVX.N)
and Japan's Inpex (1605.T), a Pertamina official said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pertamina wants to expand its upstream activities and is
looking to Chevron's gas fields in offshore East Kalimantan and
Inpex's gas field in the Timor Sea to boost its gas reserves
and production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These fields have not yet produced gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The government has agreed that Pertamina can participate
in those gas fields. We have talked informally with Chevron
about that," Karen Agustiawan, Pertamina's upstream director,
told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The gas fields are promising. We have prepared financing
to be involved in those fields," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has approved Chevron Corp's proposal to develop
natural gas fields offshore from East Kalimantan, which would
help Indonesia crank up its flagging gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combined natural gas reserves in the area covered by
the plan are estimated at more than 3 trillion cubic feet, an
official at Indonesian energy watchdog BPMIGAS has said.
Chevron currently produces gas from several other fields in
East Kalimantan, but the output is in decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's Inpex Holding Inc is currently the sole operator of
the Abadi gas field in the Masela block in eastern Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The field is estimated to have more than 10 trillion cubic
feet of natural gas reserves. If confirmed, that would make the
project the second-biggest new gas field after the Tangguh
project in Papua, which has combined reserves of 14.4 tcf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pertamina already has several gas fields in Indonesia,
including in South Sumatra, which supplies gas-fired power
plants in Jakarta via pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, which has far more gas than oil, has pushed
companies to move faster in developing gas projects as the
country badly needs the fuel for domestic industries and
exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's second-biggest liquefied natural gas (LNG)
exporter after Qatar has been struggling to meet export
commitments due to declining gas output being diverted to the
domestic market.

biggest oil producer, will boost production in 2009 and 2010
with the start of operations in the Tombua-Landana oil field in
Cabinda's offshore Block 14, a spokesman said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 8 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities upgraded the
European media sector to "neutral" from "underweight," but cut
its price target on eight media companies, citing declines in
ad spending in Western Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the lack of visibility in the overall market we
believe investors may be attracted by the solid balance sheet,
high FCF and low volatility of the defensive media stocks,"

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today announced it has
closed GS Loan Partners I with $10.5 billion in equity and leverage
commitments, including more than $1 billion of equity from the firm
and its employees. This is the first senior debt fund of its kind
raised by Goldman Sachs and the 15th fund formed by the firm's
Principal Investment Area (PIA) since 1986.

   The fund seeks to generate current income as well as long-term
capital appreciation through senior secured loan investments. Its
primary focus will be providing senior secured loans to finance
leveraged buyouts, recapitalizations and acquisitions for leveraged
buyout firms and other corporate issuers. Investments in high-quality
companies together with the seniority and collateral of the loans
should provide GS Loan Partners with a strong position in the capital
structure and an attractive risk profile for these investments.

   "GS Loan Partners is a natural extension of PIA's business, in
particular our GS Mezzanine Partners business where we have been a
global market leader in providing subordinated debt since 1996," said
Richard A. Friedman, Head of the Merchant Banking Division of Goldman
Sachs. "With our well established investment platform and the fund's
sizeable capital base, we are seeing attractive investment
opportunities."

   "The current environment of constrained balance sheets and
declining new leveraged loan issuance has created significant
opportunities for GS Loan Partners," said Thomas G. Connolly, Managing
Director with global responsibilities for GS Loan Partners. "Our
unique ability to provide senior debt issuers with commitments in size
on known terms and with certainty of financing should allow us to
provide our investors with attractive, risk-adjusted returns."

   The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a bank holding company and a
leading global investment banking, securities and investment
management firm. Founded in 1869, the firm is headquartered in New
York and maintains offices in London, Frankfurt, Tokyo, Hong Kong and
other major financial centers around the world. Established in 1986,
the firm's Principal Investment Area is part of the Merchant Banking
Division and includes the GS Capital Partners, GS Loan Partners and GS
Mezzanine Partners funds. To date, the Principal Investment Area has
raised 15 funds aggregating more than $82 billion of capital and
leverage commitments. With a global team of approximately 140
investment professionals, Goldman Sachs' Principal Investment Area has
expertise in a wide variety of industries and regions. GS Loan
Partners I is Goldman Sachs' first fund dedicated to providing senior
secured loans and investing in senior debt.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Oct 10 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service has
warned it may cut the long-term debt ratings of Morgan Stanley
(MS.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) as well as those of their units,
in a sign the global financial crisis is deepening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The rating agency said it had placed Morgan Stanley's A1
rating on review for a downgrade while assigning a negative
outlook to the Goldman Sachs Aa3 rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lower ratings would increase the cost of borrowing for the
two banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The warnings came even as governments across the world
pledged public funds to shore up the capital of banks, as credit
markets remained in deep distress amid a financial crisis which
is now almost a month old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just ahead of the Moody's announcement, Mitsubishi UFJ
Financial Group (8306.T), Japan's largest bank, said it had no
plans to pull out of a planned $9 billion investment in Morgan
Stanley despite the Wall Street bank's shares losing a quarter of
their value on Thursday alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rating agency's actions do not come as a surprise given
the cataclysmic change in the landscape on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late last month, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley stunned
Wall Street when they became commercial bank holding companies
after worries grew about their ability to fund themselves and
investors lost confidence in their high-risk brokerage model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley declined to comment and Goldman Sachs
spokesmen in the United States could not immediately be reached
for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Becoming bank holding companies gives the two firms access to
federally insured deposits but also subjects them to greater
regulatory scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has unveiled deals to raise $15 billion from Warren
Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) and public investors.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - A small Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) investor proposed a new deal on Thursday to sell the company to Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) for $22 a share, a 74 percent premium to the Web pioneer's current stock price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Barracuda Networks Detects and Blocks "Backdoor" Virus Sent via Fake Microsoft Security Update Email

CAMPBELL, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Barracuda Networks Inc., the worldwide leader in email and Web
security appliances, announced that Barracuda Central, its 24x7
security operations center, began immediately blocking a malicious
"backdoor" virus distributed via a socially engineered email
purportedly from Microsoft earlier today. Barracuda Networks was one
of the first vendors to profile the malware and quickly categorized it
in the Barracuda Real-Time Protection system to block the virus in
incoming and outbound emails on all Barracuda Spam Firewalls worldwide
with Barracuda Real-Time Protection enabled.

   The virus, categorized by Barracuda Central as
"Trojan.Backdoor.Haxdoor," is delivered as an attachment to an email
allegedly from the Microsoft Security Assurance team and utilizes
several innovative social engineering techniques, such as using
Microsoft KnowledgeBase naming conventions for the file attachment, as
well as the inclusion of a PGP signature block at the bottom of the
email message. The email informs the recipient that "Microsoft company
has recently issued a Security Update for OS Microsoft Windows. The
update applies to the following OS versions: Microsoft Windows 98,
Microsoft Windows 2000, Microsoft Windows Millenium, Microsoft Windows
XP, Microsoft Windows Vista."

   Further, the fake email "strongly" recommends that the recipient
install a "update" to "protect your computer against security threats
and performance problems." Once installed, Barracuda Central
determined that the malware "phones home," and leaves an outbound TCP
connection open presumably to await further instructions.

   "The leverage of the Microsoft name, the inclusion of an apparent
PGP signature block - frequently used by security professionals - and
the routine nature in which users are accustomed to applying software
updates make for a dangerous and potentially effective combination of
social engineering techniques in this particular attack," said Stephen
Pao, vice president of product management for Barracuda Networks.
"Unsuspecting users without the proper virus protections in place,
could mistakenly install the malware. Based on the volume of real-time
blocks reported by the Barracuda Real-Time Protection system in the
outbreak's early stages, we know the attack hit a significant global
footprint."

   In addition, Barracuda Central categorized this malware in its
anti-spyware protocol definitions to block all "phone home" activity
across all Barracuda Web Filters worldwide, preventing the attack from
affecting corporate networks even when users with previously infected
laptops connect to the network.

   For email not protected by Barracuda Spam Firewalls, such as
personal email, the Barracuda Web Filter can block the virus in Web
downloads when behind Barracuda Web Filters.

Barracuda Central validates the hypothesis by collecting samples of
suspect emails from Barracuda Spam Firewalls around the world that
elect to participate in data collection.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) expects upstream production earnings to fall from the previous quarter due to lower prices and hurricanes, but said its refining performance would be much stronger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil company also said on Thursday its third-quarter profit would top the previous quarter's, as analysts expected. Its shares rose slightly after plunging 12.5 percent in regular trading amid a massive market sell-off that saw larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) drop 11.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is basically traders throwing everything overboard to prevent the whole ship from sinking," Fadel Gheit, oil analyst at Oppenheimer in New York, said of Exxon's drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said in its interim third-quarter update that Gulf of Mexico storms were expected to have cut U.S. oil-equivalent production by about 150,000 barrels per day in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Chevron said the third-quarter results would include an estimated $400 million in charges for the cost of toppled platforms, asset write-offs and initial expenses for repairs. This would be partly offset by a gain of about $350 million from asset sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said third-quarter refining would improve significantly on the previous quarter, when it made a big downstream loss and its overall profit would top the second quarter, when it posted a record $5.98 billion net profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect Chevron to report a third-quarter net profit of $6.25 billion, or $3.24 per share, on revenue of $86.9 billion, according to averages on Reuters Estimates. Chevron said it would report the results on October 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the third-largest U.S. oil company, said last week that oil and natural gas production in the third quarter was flat to slightly lower than in the second quarter as hurricanes disrupted output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Wednesday, Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) estimated third-quarter oil and natural gas production rose and its refining margins soared about 40 percent from year-earlier levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude oil prices averaged above $118 per barrel in the third quarter, or 57 percent up on the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude prices have since tumbled along with global economic prospects and dropped below $85 a barrel on Thursday for the first time in almost 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said the price it received for U.S. crude in July and August rose more than $5 a barrel to an average of $119.20, while the benchmark rose about $1.50 on the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its average international price for liquid hydrocarbons fell slightly from the previous quarter, as did its average realizations for natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. production fell about 1 percent in the first two months of the quarter from the previous one to 695,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, the San Ramon, California-based company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares plunged 12.5 percent to $64 on Thursday, but rose 40 cents after the close. The stock has now lost about 31 percent in 2008, while the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index .OIX has lost 40 percent in the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

at Oppenheimer in New York, said of Exxon's drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said in its interim third-quarter update that Gulf
of Mexico storms were expected to have cut U.S. oil-equivalent
production by about 150,000 barrels per day in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, Chevron said the third-quarter results would
include an estimated $400 million in charges for the cost of
toppled platforms, asset write-offs and initial expenses for
repairs. This would be partly offset by a gain of about $350
million from asset sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said third-quarter refining would improve
significantly on the previous quarter, when it made a big
downstream loss and its overall profit would top the second
quarter, when it posted a record $5.98 billion net profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect Chevron to report a third-quarter net
profit of $6.25 billion, or $3.24 per share, on revenue of
$86.9 billion, according to averages on Reuters Estimates.
Chevron said it would report the results on Oct. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the third-largest U.S. oil company,
said last week that oil and natural gas production in the third
quarter was flat to slightly lower than in the second quarter
as hurricanes disrupted output. [ID:nWNAB4785]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But on Wednesday, Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) estimated
third-quarter oil and natural gas production rose and its
refining margins soared about 40 percent from year-earlier
levels. [ID:nN08530890]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude oil prices averaged above $118 per barrel in the
third quarter, or 57 percent up on the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crude prices CLc1 have since tumbled along with global
economic prospects and dropped below $85 a barrel on Thursday
for the first time in almost 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the price it received for U.S. crude in July
and August rose more than $5 a barrel to an average of $119.20,
while the benchmark rose about $1.50 on the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its average international price for liquid hydrocarbons
fell slightly from the previous quarter, as did its average
realizations for natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. production fell about 1 percent in the first two
months of the quarter from the previous one to 695,000 barrels
of oil equivalent per day, the San Ramon, California-based
company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares plunged 12.5 percent to $64 on Thursday, but
rose 40 cents after the close. The stock has now lost about 31
percent in 2008, while the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil
index .OIX has lost 40 percent in the same time.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today reported in its interim
update that it expects third quarter 2008 earnings to exceed those of
2008's second quarter. Downstream results are expected to improve
significantly compared with the second quarter. Upstream earnings are
expected to decline between quarters, in part due to the effect of
September hurricanes, as well as lower commodity prices.

   Basis for Comparison in Interim Update

   The interim update contains certain industry and company operating
data for the third quarter 2008. The production volumes, realizations,
margins and certain other items in the report are based on a portion
of the quarter and are not necessarily indicative of Chevron's
quarterly results to be reported on October 31, 2008. The reader
should not place undue reliance on this data.

   Unless noted otherwise, all commentary is based on two months of
the third quarter 2008 vs. full second quarter 2008 results.

   UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

   The table that follows includes information on production and
price indicators for crude oil and natural gas for specific markets.
Actual realizations may vary from indicative pricing due to quality
and location differentials and the effect of pricing lags.
International earnings are driven by actual liftings, which may differ
from production due to the timing of cargoes and other factors.

   Total U.S. production declined about 1 percent during the first
two months of the third quarter. However, hurricanes in the Gulf of
Mexico are expected to reduce oil-equivalent production in the United
States for the month of September by about 150 thousand barrels per
day. International liquids production fell nearly 6 percent in the
first two months of the third quarter, primarily due to facilities
downtime associated with the expansion project and annual turnaround
activities at the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan. The Tengiz Field
expansion project was completed in late September.

   Directionally, international liquids liftings are expected to be
lower in the full third quarter than in the second quarter.

   During the first two months of the third quarter, U.S. crude oil
realizations rose more than $5 per barrel to $119.20, while the West
Texas Intermediate benchmark price increased about $1.50 per barrel
compared to the second quarter. This difference largely reflects Gulf
of Mexico production that is priced on a lagged basis. International
liquids unit realizations in July and August declined slightly from
the second quarter. U.S. natural gas realizations decreased $0.31 to
$9.53 per thousand cubic feet during the first two months of the third
quarter, while international natural gas realizations fell $0.15 to
$5.29 per thousand cubic feet. Worldwide realizations for crude oil
and natural gas in September 2008 are expected to be lower than those
of July and August.

   In addition to hurricane-related production curtailments, third
quarter results will also include an estimated $400 million in charges
for incremental costs to abandon toppled platforms, asset write-offs,
and initial expenses associated with the repair of facilities.
Preliminary projections suggest that approximately 5 MBD of
oil-equivalent production will be permanently shut-in as a result of
facilities damage from the September hurricanes.

   Partly offsetting these costs are gains of roughly $350 million on
the sale of the company's 9.2% interest in the K2 development, along
with other asset sales in the Gulf of Mexico.

   DOWNSTREAM - REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

   The table that follows includes industry benchmark indicators for
refining and marketing margins. Actual margins realized by the company
may differ significantly due to location and product mix effects,
planned and unplanned shutdown activity and other company-specific and
operational factors.

   Downstream earnings are expected to rebound significantly from the
loss incurred in the second quarter. This projected improvement is
primarily due to the following factors:

   --  Lower crude prices. From the start to the end of the third
        quarter, WTI crude prices decreased $39 per barrel. This
        significant decline in crude prices is projected to improve
        third quarter earnings, primarily due to impacts on
        provisionally priced crudes and derivative gains.

   --  Less refinery downtime. During the second quarter, the
        Pascagoula, Mississippi, refinery was down for scheduled
        maintenance while the company's refinery at Pembroke, United
        Kingdom, experienced unplanned downtime. The company's global
        refinery system had minimal downtime during the third quarter.

   Refining and marketing indicator margins were mixed comparing the
full third quarter with the second quarter, as shown in the table
above.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and US VIRGIN ISLANDS, Oct 09 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
The United States Virgin Islands (USVI) selected IBM (NYSE: IBM) to
assist in building two 911 systems designed to help police, fire and
medical services respond faster and more efficiently to emergencies
throughout the islands.

    IBM will provide technical design and installation, project management,
and consulting and testing services for the systems, to be located at
Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, and Kings Hill, St. Croix. In addition, IBM
will provide training to 911 operators, first responders, IT support
personnel and agency leadership; topics will range from the basics of
using the system to improved practices for emergency response.

    The systems will feature computer assisted dispatch technology that will
promptly provide 911 operators with relevant questions to ask individuals
reporting a broad range of emergencies -- including fires, medical crises
and crimes. For example, software will instruct an operator responding to
a report of an automobile accident to ask about injuries, evidence of
fire, whether any roads are blocked and other vital questions. The
information will then be relayed to first responders, better equipping
them to help those in need.

    USVI Governor John P. deJongh, Jr. has been committed to establishing a
fully functioning 911 emergency communications system since taking office
in 2007. The USVI retained IBM to evaluate the territory's current
emergency communications system and work with the first responder
community to identify shortfalls and determine the requirements for a new
911 system. This new system will provide for the creation of new call
centers with updated technology to support the 911 system, proper
training programs and the ability for the Virgin Islands to meet the new
federal digital emergency communications standards.

    "Our Administration is working to overhaul its outmoded emergency 911
communications system to provide enhanced safety and security for all
residents and visitors to the territory. This project represents this
administration's long term commitment that will help to protect our
residents and visitors from crime as well as natural or man-made disasters
and provide a level of safety and security necessary to foster robust
economic growth by attracting more businesses and visitors," deJongh said.
"We've come to value IBM's technical experience and professional project
management."

    The project leverages IBM's deep expertise in large-scale systems that
integrate computers, networking, telephony, mission-critical applications
and call centers.

    "An efficient and sophisticated 911 system is one of the key building
blocks of modern society," said IBM Partner Jeffrey H. Smith. "The
government of the U.S. Virgin Islands understands how this project is
expected to assist in improving the quality of life for the islands'
residents and many visitors."

    The IBM team includes equipment and support from business partners Daycom
Systems, BCG/enVision Technologies, Hyperion Inc., Lenovo, and PlantCML.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Oct 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it has signed a multi-million IBM Global
Business Services agreement with the Fashion Research Institute (FRI) to
implement a first-of-a-kind Virtual World Product Lifecycle Management
(PLM) Enterprise System.

    Fashion Research Institute, headquartered in New York, NY, conducts
research into technology-based initiatives and develops emerging
technologies to overhaul traditional fashion practices and methodologies.
FRI's mission is to reduce the carbon footprint and change the
environmental impact of the industry in ways that are sustainable,
replicable, respectful of the practitioners, and meaningful for all
stakeholders. FRI maintains Shengri-La, a five-island complex in Second
Life, and an OpenSim complex.

    "We're proud to pioneer the first big business solution that leverages the
OpenSim virtual world platform to address economies of scale," said
Shenlei Winkler, FRI. "The Fashion Research Institute understands how to
design real world consumer goods using a virtual world environment, and
IBM understands the scaling challenges of global enterprise. Taking on
both simultaneously is a winning move."

    This virtual world enterprise solution, expressly created as a product
design environment, will offer a fundamentally new work flow addressing
critical issues facing the design industry, such as ensuring
manufacturability of designs and decreasing substantial sample costs by
two-thirds. Users of this solution will ultimately be able to enter a
virtual world, receive training on the systems, and take a design from
concept to prototype -- with every step short of actual manufacturing
being done virtually.

    This first-of-a-kind system will allow fashion and consumer packaging
designers to access and use 3-D tools with the Second Life client
interface. In addition it will also connect to the OpenSim virtual world
platform to create packaging and fashion products, provide efficient
workflow queues, and allow groups with an interest in the product to
collaborate and modify designs. The program will also generate virtual
product samples and accurate factory specifications that enable high
quality product mass-manufacturing in the real world.

    FRI will offer an IBM-backed and co-developed enterprise solution
providing a simpler and more intuitive user interface than currently
existing design-industry-oriented software including scalability for
businesses of all sizes. Users of the IBM-built technology could see
product sample creation costs and time to market decrease dramatically.

    The initial proof-of-concept solution expected to go live in 2H09 will be
piloted with up to 20 international design houses. Ultimately this
solution will be offered as a design service or enterprise installation,
to creative industry design houses of all sizes globally.

    "As the Fashion Research Institute continues to enhance the IT
capabilities of the fashion and consumer packaged goods industries, IBM's
deep knowledge in product design, enterprise systems, and virtual worlds
will help FRI bring new market opportunities to the fashion world," said
Jeffrey Russell, IBM Global Business Services. "A design house
implementing this solution could reduce dozens of weeks of design time,
minimize the number of physical samples manufactured, and increase
product manufacturing quality enough to put into development and
production many additional collections."

    The initial agreement was signed in March 2008 but was expanded in August
2008 to include consumer package design.

    About the Fashion Research Institute

    Fashion Research Institute conducts research into technology-based
initiatives and develops emerging technologies to sweepingly overhaul
traditional fashion industry practices and methodologies. FRI's mission is
to reduce the carbon footprint and change the environmental impact of the
industry in ways that are sustainable, replicable, respectful of the
practitioners, and meaningful for all stakeholders. FRI maintains
Shengri-La, a five-island complex in Second Life, and an OpenSim complex.
FRI is an IBM business partner, and has been working closely with top IBM
architects and researchers over the last year to develop its
virtual-worlds-based product design solution.

&lt;p&gt;Aetna and Pfizer Present ''State of Motion'' Health Fair in Hartford to Encourage Families to Adopt Healthy Lifestyles

    Dozens of Local Community Partners to Participate; Free Health
                         Screenings Available
HARTFORD, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
Aetna and Pfizer Inc are co-sponsoring a recreational health fair
for Hartford families on October 18 to raise awareness of the
importance of healthy lifestyles in the family and the community. The
free event will run from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m., rain or shine, in
Hartford's Bushnell Park.

   More than half of adults in Connecticut are overweight or obese.
Since 1990, the number of obese adults in Connecticut has nearly
doubled, and now one in five adults is obese.(1) Approximately
one-quarter of Connecticut youth are overweight or obese.(2) Hartford
County has the highest percentage of obese children, at over 11
percent.(3) To help combat this growing obesity epidemic and encourage
healthy lifestyles, Aetna and Pfizer, aim to educate Hartford families
about managing their health.

   "Tackling obesity and the serious health issues it can cause is a
primary goal of numerous city, state and national civic and health
organizations, but too often we are all working in silos," said
Michael Hudson, president of Aetna's Northeast Region, including
Connecticut. "We are proud to be uniting our efforts in Connecticut
through this initiative and working with Pfizer and a number of
exceptional community partners to bring the message of good health and
physical activity to Hartford's families. We hope this fair will
encourage people to make the small but important lifestyle changes
necessary to improve their long-term health and well-being."

   A number of organizations will be participating in the event
including the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection's No
Child Left Inside program, Hartford Hospital, Connecticut Children's
Medical Center, St. Francis Hospital and Medical Center, Hartford
Public Schools, the City of Hartford and Qualidigm. The fair will
offer free health screenings and provide families with educational
materials on healthy lifestyles. A series of stations will be set up
to raise awareness about healthy eating and exercise through
family-focused interactive events, healthy eating seminars and cooking
demonstrations.

   "Pfizer is proud to partner with Aetna and work with other
community organizations to promote wellness and help improve the
health of our communities," said John Sory, Vice President, Pfizer
Health Solutions. "We hope the event will provide families with the
information and tools they need to begin taking steps toward wellness
and disease prevention by eating right, exercising regularly, and
monitoring their health."

   The health fair is the first step in a broader community-based
effort between the participating organizations to encourage health and
wellness, reduce obesity, and promote disease prevention and
management.

 (Updates to early morning)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose in skittish
trade on Thursday as investors snapped up beaten down shares
after a six-day slide and a solid profit from IBM (IBM.N)
spurred hope that the credit crisis might not be stifling all
demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of International Business Machines Corp, a
technology services giant, rose 2 percent, making the stock a
top boost to the Dow, while Apple Inc (AAPL.O) , another tech
bellwether, led the Nasdaq with a 4 percent gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But trading was skittish, with some market participants
away for the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hunt for cut-price shares also fueled a recovery in the
shares of natural resource companies, with aluminum producer
Alcoa (AA.N) , rebounding nearly 6 percent after the stock was
hammered in the wake of a profit shortfall that the company
posted on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What we're seeing is just a bear market rally. An oversold
rally," said Dave Rovelli, managing director U.S. equity
trading at Canaccord Adams in New York. "You could see a
significant rally over the next couple of days. The market is
so oversold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI added 48.91 points,
or 0.53 percent, to 9,307.01. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX climbed 4.08 points, or 0.41 percent, to 989.02. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC shot up 17.03 points, or 0.98
percent, to 1,757.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares rose to $92.45 on the New York Stock Exchange,
while Apple climbed to $92.83 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even so, lowered profit estimates by some major retailers,
including TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N), fueled some caution about the
outlook for consumer spending. TJX shares fell 3.7 percent to
$26.61 after the off-price retailer cut its profit outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The expiration of a U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission's ban on short selling in more than 950 financial
stocks cast a pall on individual financial stocks, including
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) , whose shares slid 11 percent to $14.88
on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Short sellers borrow shares and sell them in anticipation
that the price will fall. They then buy the shares back at the
lower price, returning them to the broker, and profiting on the
price decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the economic front, a government report showed the
number of U.S. workers filing new claims for jobless benefits
fell 20,000 last week, in line with forecasts as the impact of
hurricanes Gustav and Ike eased. For details, see

&lt;p&gt;CHIBA, Japan (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said sales of its Xbox 360 game console are beating projections in Japan, prompting the company to raise its shipment forecast for the country, a stronghold for Sony Corp and Nintendo Co Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global demand for the Xbox 360 has not been dented by the financial crisis, and the game machine is well positioned to attract holiday shoppers thanks to its recent price cuts, said John Schappert, Microsoft's corporate vice president overseeing its online game services and game software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan, home to two of its biggest rivals, Sony and Nintendo, has traditionally been a tough market to crack for the U.S. software giant's game operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft in September lowered the price of its Xbox 360 in Japan, helping the game machine outsell Sony's PlayStation 3 in the month. That was the first time the Xbox 360 has beaten the Sony console in monthly sales in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've done better than we forecast. We are finding that we have a shortage of hardware," Schappert told Reuters in an interview after his keynote speech to the Tokyo Game Show on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are raising our forecast" for Xbox 360 hardware shipments to Japan, he said, though he declined to give specific figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG TITLES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the price reduction, demand for the Xbox 360 got a boost in Japan from the recent launches of popular role-playing games for the Microsoft console, such as Square Enix Holdings' "Infinite Undiscovery" and Namco Bandai Holdings' "Tales of Vesperia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Action or fighting games tend to sell well in the United States, while in Japan role-playing games often dominate the bestseller lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Relationships we've formed over the eight years of doing business with our Japanese partners really are paying dividends now as we see legendary franchises coming and making their new home on the Xbox 360," Schappert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Namco Bandai said on Thursday it would launch the next version of its popular fighting game series "Tekken" for both the Xbox 360 and the PS3 next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Namco Bandai has launched previous editions of "Tekken" for Sony machines as well as for mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another recent coup, Microsoft said in July Square Enix would launch the "Final Fantasy XIII" for its console, sharing the upcoming version of the blockbuster role-playing game with the PS3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the announcement, Square Enix had only said it was developing the next version of its hugely popular "Final Fantasy" series for the Sony console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Square Enix has sold more than 85 million units of "Final Fantasy" games worldwide, while sales of "Tekken" games have totaled 33 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRICE LEADER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the run-up to the critical holiday season, Microsoft also cut the U.S. prices of its Xbox 360 in September, lowering the price of its entry-level console to $50 below Nintendo's top-selling Wii, which had been the lowest-priced console among the three competing machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That has made the Xbox 360 attractive at a time when the financial turmoil is making consumers price conscious, Schappert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not seen our demand diminished" worldwide, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a mass-market price the world can afford. No better time to have that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival Sony said on Thursday it will launch a PS3 model with an 80 gigabyte hard disk drive in Japan on October 30 for 39,980 yen ($398), beefing up its hardware ahead of the gift-giving period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony currently offers the 40 gigabyte model for the same price in Japan, compared with the 25,000 yen price tag for the Wii, and the Xbox 360's high-end Elite model, which sells for 39,800 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sophie Hardach and David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities said more large-cap U.S. banks are likely to face earnings declines that could pressure capital ratios and impact dividends at some other banks as credit quality continues to deteriorate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Banks with high dividend payout ratios, such as Suntrust Banks Inc (STI.N) and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N), are candidates for potential dividend cuts, analyst Vivek Juneja wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit losses at Suntrust, which has 26 percent of its total loans in residential mortgages, are likely to continue to rise faster as weakness spreads to prime mortgages and losses increase in home equity and residential construction, Juneja said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Midwestern banks, like Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB.O) and National City Corp NCC.N with more exposure to manufacturing companies in their overall commercial loan portfolios, are likely to face rising losses from weaknesses in real estate and manufacturing segments, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anurag Kotoky in Bangalore; Editing by Deepak Kannan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 9 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded U.S.
defense communications and information technology company
Harris Corp (HRS.N) to "neutral," saying that the company's
"pronounced underperformance" had led to discounted valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, however, downgraded government contractor
CACI International Inc CAI.N to "neutral" from "overweight"
on valuation and said it was concerned about the outlook for
defense, particularly the services business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Harris, the brokerage said the stock had underperformed
considerably and now traded at a discounted valuation that more
accurately reflected its concerns about a slowdown in the
high-margin radio frequency (RF) business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The JTRS (joint tactical radio system) program could also
push Harris' legacy radios aside, although we are becoming
incrementally more cautious on the prospects for JTRS," analyst
Joseph Nadol said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nadol, however, believes that delays to the JTRS program
and the high cost of these radios could make Harris' offerings
more competitive on this front.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He sees likely softness in the company's commercial
businesses, but expects overall earnings to be solid. The
brokerage had an "underweight" rating on Harris' stock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On CACI, which provides a range of technology and
intelligence services to the Pentagon and civil federal
agencies, Nadol said he is not expecting a significantly
improved outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that contract terms in the service area are
likely to get tougher, which could dampen industry margins," he
said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) posted a higher-than-expected preliminary quarterly profit and affirmed its full-year outlook, calming some fears that the financial crisis is sparking a meltdown in technology demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of IBM, the world's largest computer services company, rose 6 percent on the news, which also bolstered other technology shares that have been hammered on fears that a global recession would crush corporate IT spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very nice to see some positive news, not just for IBM but for -- to a degree -- the tech space overall, given the downdraft we have seen in recent weeks," said Chuck Jones, technology analyst for Atlantic Trust Private Wealth Management, which manages $16 billion of assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he and other investors were wary of calling a bottom for the battered tech sector, pointing to pockets of weakness such as the warning on Monday from European software giant SAP AG (SAPG.DE) that it had seen a sudden drop-off in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this market you are gun-shy about everything. It is hard to have a lot of conviction about anything out there," he said, but added, "This also can be a good time to buy stocks. When things look the bleakest, this is a good time to put some money to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp said on Wednesday its third-quarter net income jumped 20 percent to $2.8 billion as revenue rose 5 percent to $25.3 billion, including 3 points from currency benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $2.05, compared to $1.68 a year earlier, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts were looking for earnings of $2.01 per share on revenue of $26.5 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano said in a statement that IBM was confident about its 2008 outlook, citing a steady base of recurring revenue and profits, and investments for growth in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For companies to be reaffirming their outlook through the end of the year is h-u-g-e," said Mike Holland, chairman of investment company Holland  Co, who oversees assets in excess of $4 billion, including IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this environment, the combination of meeting current expectations but also reaffirming their outlook is an incredible performance," he said. "You made my evening," he told Reuters after getting the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM AS SAFE HAVEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has been one of the bright spots in technology this year as the Armonk, New York-based company gets about two-thirds of revenue from outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a quarter of revenue comes from the hard-pressed financial services sector, IBM enjoys recurring income from services and software contracts that account for about half its business, providing a buffer during sharp economic downturns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, IBM's profit had blown past Wall Street expectations and it had raised its 2008 profit per share forecast to at least $8.75, or 22 percent year-on-year growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many investors had viewed IBM shares as a safe haven earlier this year, but the stock has been pummeled in recent weeks along with other tech shares and the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since the stock was at $120 three weeks ago and is now at $90, clearly investors were really worried about the technology market," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. "For IBM to have done pretty well in the third quarter and affirm the full-year guidance is a good sign."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caughey, whose firm owns IBM shares, said they had been buying tech shares in recent days: "It's been my sense all along that this is not a tech problem. This is not 2001."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares, which had fallen 5.33 percent to close at $90.55 on the New York Stock Exchange earlier on Wednesday, rose to $96 in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of rival Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) rose 3 percent, Dell DELL.O rose 2 percent, while Oracle ORCL.O and Microsoft (MSFT.O) gained about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is scheduled to post quarterly results on October 16. The unexpected preliminary report on Wednesday comes on the eve of the lifting of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ban on short-selling of more than 950 stocks, including IBM. The end of the ban has concerned some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also said its gross margin in the third quarter improved to 43.3 percent from 41.3 percent a year earlier. Its pretax income rose 19 percent to $3.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some analysts noted that IBM's revenue was a little weak after excluding currency benefits, they also noted that the company has controlled costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Earnings were solid, revenues were weak. That's probably a good sign but a problem overall for the global economy," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer, Solaris Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard, Gabriel Madway and Peter Henderson in San Francisco and Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

When things look the bleakest, this is a good time to put some money to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp said on Wednesday its third-quarter net income jumped 20 percent to $2.8 billion as revenue rose 5 percent to $25.3 billion, including 3 points from currency benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings per share from continuing operations rose to $2.05, compared to $1.68 a year earlier, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts were looking for earnings of $2.01 per share on revenue of $26.5 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano said in a statement that IBM was confident about its 2008 outlook, citing a steady base of recurring revenue and profits, and investments for growth in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For companies to be reaffirming their outlook through the end of the year is h-u-g-e," said Mike Holland, chairman of investment company Holland  Co, who oversees assets in excess of $4 billion, including IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this environment, the combination of meeting current expectations but also reaffirming their outlook is an incredible performance," he said. "You made my evening," he told Reuters after getting the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM AS SAFE HAVEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has been one of the bright spots in technology this year as the Armonk, New York-based company gets about two-thirds of revenue from outside the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although a quarter of revenue comes from the hard-pressed financial services sector, IBM enjoys recurring income from services and software contracts that account for about half its business, providing a buffer during sharp economic downturns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the second quarter, IBM's profit had blown past Wall Street expectations and it had raised its 2008 profit per share forecast to at least $8.75, or 22 percent year-on-year growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many investors had viewed IBM shares as a safe haven earlier this year, but the stock has been pummeled in recent weeks along with other tech shares and the broader market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since the stock was at $120 three weeks ago and is now at $90, clearly investors were really worried about the technology market," said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group. "For IBM to have done pretty well in the third quarter and affirm the full-year guidance is a good sign."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caughey, whose firm owns IBM shares, said they had been buying tech shares in recent days: "It's been my sense all along that this is not a tech problem. This is not 2001."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares, which had fallen 5.33 percent to close at $90.55 on the New York Stock Exchange earlier on Wednesday, rose to $96 in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of rival Hewlett-Packard (HPQ.N) rose 3 percent, Dell DELL.O rose 2 percent, while Oracle ORCL.O and Microsoft (MSFT.O) gained about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is scheduled to post quarterly results on October 16. The unexpected preliminary report on Wednesday comes on the eve of the lifting of a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ban on short-selling of more than 950 stocks, including IBM. The end of the ban has concerned some investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM also said its gross margin in the third quarter improved to 43.3 percent from 41.3 percent a year earlier. Its pretax income rose 19 percent to $3.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some analysts noted that IBM's revenue was a little weak after excluding currency benefits, they also noted that the company has controlled costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Earnings were solid, revenues were weak. That's probably a good sign but a problem overall for the global economy," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer, Solaris Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard, Gabriel Madway and Peter Henderson in San Francisco and Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle; Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today that Merrill Lynch will use its new
iDataPlex servers, a new class of data center hardware that allows
mass-scale, Internet-style computing in a compact, energy-saving package.

    The industry-standard, IBM System x iDataPlex servers will be used to help
Merrill Lynch build and evaluate new risk-analysis programs. Merrill's
iDataPlex units draw minimum power -- 40% less than typical designs.
iDataPlex more than doubles the amount of systems that can run in a single
IBM rack -- packing five times the compute power of typical rack systems.

    Taking a page from the Internet's model, iDataPlex is built for stateless
computing that effectively turns many separate computers into a pool of
shared resources or "cloud." Merrill Lynch is among a handful of companies
leading their industries towards using cloud networks to deliver
applications only when needed.

    "Our goal is to rapidly adopt technologies like iDataPlex that reduce the
power consumption within our data centers," said Jeffrey M. Birnbaum,
chief technology architect at Merrill Lynch. "iDataPlex is a perfectly
positioned platform for this new style of computing -- giving us the
ability to pack a lot more compute power into smaller, less expensive
package and minimize power and cooling costs. iDataPlex technology
combined with a Stateless computing model allows Merrill Lynch to
optimize Data Center efficiency."

    iDataPlex marks a key engineering advance in IT hardware. It helps IBM
clients develop cloud-style data centers, designed to take advantage of
dramatic improvements in IT efficiency and provide for quick rollout of
new IT services to support future business growth. IBM is helping clients
move to new enterprise data centers by focusing on best practices around
virtualization, green IT, service management and cloud computing.

    iDataPlex is part of IBM's "Blue Cloud" initiative, powered by 200
full-time researchers and more than $100 million in investments over the
past three years. Blue Cloud brings together a variety of offerings to
help IBM clients deliver an ever-expanding number of IT services demanded
by business users and consumers. Built on IBM's expertise in delivering
large-scale computing systems, Blue Cloud is a set of hardware, software
and services that allows IBM clients to offer personal and business
services from remote, centralized servers, the "cloud," that share
computing resources and bandwidth -- to any device, anywhere.

&lt;p&gt;CHIBA, Japan (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Thursday sales of its Xbox 360 video game console are surpassing its own projections in Japan, and the company is revising up its shipment forecast for the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Japan, the home market to two of its biggest rivals, Sony Corp (6758.T) and Nintendo Co Ltd 7974.OS, had until recently been a weak spot for Microsoft's game business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft in September cut the price of its Xbox 360 in Japan, helping the game machine outsell Sony's PlayStation 3 in the month. That was the first time the Xbox 360 has beaten the Sony console in monthly sales in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've done better than we forecast. We are finding that we have a shortage of hardware," John Schappert, Microsoft's corporate vice president overseeing its online game services and game software, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are raising our forecast" for Xbox 360 hardware shipments to Japan, he said, though he declined to give specific figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides the price cut, demand for the Xbox 360 got a boost in Japan from the recent launches of popular role-playing games for the Microsoft console, such as Square Enix Holdings' (9684.T) "Infinite Undiscovery" and Namco Bandai Holdings' (7832.T) "Tales of Vesperia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Action or fighting games tend to sell well in the United States, while in Japan role-playing games often dominate the bestseller lists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Relationships we've formed over the eight years of doing business with our Japanese partners really are paying dividends now as we see legendary franchises coming and making their new home on the Xbox 360," Schappert said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Namco Bandai said on Thursday it would launch the next version of its popular fighting game series "Tekken" for both the Xbox 360 and the PS3 next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Namco Bandai has launched the previous installments of "Tekken" for Sony machines as well as for mobile phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another recent coup, Microsoft said in July Square Enix would launch the "Final Fantasy XIII" for its console, sharing the upcoming version of the blockbuster role-playing game with the PS3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to the announcement, Square Enix had only said it was developing the next installment of its hugely popular "Final Fantasy" series for the Sony console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sophie Hardach)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  JOHANNESBURG, SOUTH AFRICA, Oct 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Building on significant progress with its growing partner and client base
in sub-Saharan Africa, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today will host an innovation
forum in Johannesburg to discuss both progress made during the past year
and what lies ahead. Today's forum brings together leaders from
government, academia and businesses to spark new initiatives that advance
Africa's position in the global economy.

    Just under a year ago, IBM announced a $120 million investment in
sub-Saharan Africa to accelerate the development of new markets, foster
the growth of skilled IT professionals and create new jobs. Today, the
company continues the dialogue, reinforcing its focus on world growth
markets and collaborative approach to innovation.

    The forum will highlight progress on programs kicked off in
2007,
including:


--  the donation of a Blue Gene
supercomputer to the Meraka Institute
--  the creation of a mentoring program, Makocha Minds
--  a partnership with CARE on a microfinance grid
--  the launch of the IBM Africa Innovation Center
--  the launch of Africa's first Cloud Computing
Center

    
The discussions today will also include new focus areas for
collaboration including alternative energy solutions, banking the
unbanked, and the role of women entrepreneurs in shaping Africa's future.

    "We've made tremendous progress with our partners in Africa over the past
year, and will continue to build on that momentum as we grow existing
programs and implement new ones," said Bruno Di Leo, general manager, IBM
Growth Markets. "An information technology infrastructure and a sound
educational system are crucial as African business organizations look to
compete globally. IBM is committed to playing an important role in
providing the latest technology and expertise and in the development of
skills across the continent of Africa, and in emerging markets around the
world."

    Today's forum is part of IBM's Global Innovation Outlook (GIO). Every
year, IBM joins together with leaders from business, academia, and
politics from around the world to create new opportunities for business
and society. This program -- the GIO -- has focused on topics ranging
from energy and the environment to transportation and mobility to
security and society. In 2007, the GIO also focused on sustainable
long-term economic development in Africa.

    "Sub-Saharan Africa is a key focus of our growth strategy and we are
rallying resources to ensure that we expand our reach to participate in
the continent's economic transformation into global competitiveness,"
said Mark Harris, general manager, IBM sub-Saharan Africa.

    IBM also recently invested in a strategic IT services delivery capability
infrastructure that includes its Johannesburg-based Integrated Delivery
Center, which has created 1,500 new jobs to date, and the Business
Continuity and Recovery Services facility.

    These investments are aligned with IBM's globally integrated enterprise
model, which leverages the skills and strengths of different world markets
to deliver quality services to its clients, wherever they may be.

financial foundation give IBM a competitive edge in good times and tough times,"

   --$13.3 million class P at 'B-'; Outlook Negative.

   Fitch does not rate the $66.6 million class NR.

   The rating affirmations reflect minimal paydown since issuance and
stable performance of the pool. As of the September 2008 distribution
date, the transaction has paid down by 0.22% to $5.320 billion from
$5.332 billion at issuance. Outlooks reflect likely rating changes
over the next one to two years.

   There have been no specially serviced loans since issuance. Fitch
has identified 29 loans (8.9%) as Loans of Concern. The largest Fitch
Loan of Concern (1.4%) is secured by a multifamily property in
Ventura, CA. Although the borrower has nearly completed all planned
renovations, the property has made concessions to increase occupancy.
The property reported a DSCR of 0.67x as of June 2008.

   The second largest Loan of Concern (1.2%) is secured by a
multifamily property in Sunnyvale, CA. The property is currently
undergoing a $13 million dollar renovation project which is
responsible for a decrease in average occupancy. Renovations will take
approximately two years to be completed.

   There were three additional loans at issuance, Southland Mall
(2.3%), Orchard at Saddleback (1.9%), and Arches Apartments (1.2%),
that were in the process of stabilizing. Fitch has reviewed the
updated occupancy and cash flow information for these loans and has
determined that Southland Mall and Orchard at Saddleback were in-line
with the stabilization schedule set forth at issuance. Renovations at
Arches Apartments will take approximately two years to be completed,
based on a recent servicer inspection. Information regarding the
stabilization schedule was not available at issuance.

   There are two shadow rated loans within the transaction: Centro
Heritage Portfolio V (2.4%) and Center West (1.7%). Occupancy as of
June 2008 for Centro Heritage Portfolio V and Center West were 89.5%
and 74.2%, respectively, consistent with issuance. Both of the loans
maintain investment grade shadow ratings.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and other banks rose Friday, in stark contrast with former investment banks Goldman Sachs Group Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bank of America and JPMorgan shares closed up more than 6 percent and 13 percent, at $20.87 and $41.64, respectively, in late afternoon trading. The shares of Citigroup Inc (C.N), which withdrew its bid on Thursday to buy struggling regional bank Wachovia Corp WB.N, also closed higher at $14.11, or up about 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which recently converted to bank holding companies to boost deposits and calm investor concern about their funding sources, saw their share prices fall some 22 percent and 12 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts and investors attributed the rise in other financials to short covering, as investors bought up shares believing government action to stabilize Morgan Stanley and the rest of the market may be possible this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd be surprised if people would want to be short financials going into the weekend," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head of the U.S. equity group at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others noted a slight easing in the commercial paper market, which is crucial for bank funding, as a possible reason for the boost in bank shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's so much anxiety within the financial system that any good news could set the stage for a dandy rally," said David Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners, in St Louis, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N, which agreed last month to sell itself to Bank of America, rose from a year low set on Thursday to $15.75, up more than 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this level, the shares are trading at a 14 percent discount to the price implied by Bank of America's offer, which suggests some doubt the deal will go through. Analysts, however, believe Merrill would struggle to survive on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given what's happened with Morgan Stanley today, I cannot see under any circumstance that Merrill would try to walk away from this deal ... nor do I think that (Bank of America Chief Executive) Ken Lewis will try to renegotiate," said Nancy Bush, analyst at NAB Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay and Kristina Cooke; Editing by Tim Dobbyn and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares in JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N),
Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and other banks climbed on Friday,
in stark contrast with former investment banks Goldman Sachs
Group (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan and Bank of America were both up over 4
percent, at $39.17 and $20.53 respectively, in afternoon
trading. Shares in Citigroup Inc (C.N), which on Thursday
withdrew its bid to buy struggling regional bank Wachovia
WB.N, were also higher at $13.37, or up about 3.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which recently converted
to bank holding companies to boost deposits and calm investor
concern about their funding sources, saw their share prices
fall 32 percent and 17 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts and investors attributed the rise in other
financials to short covering, as investors bought up shares
believing government action to stabilize Morgan Stanley and the
rest of the market may be possible this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'd be surprised if people would want to be short
financials going into the weekend," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head
of the U.S. equity group at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth
Management in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others noted a slight easing in the commercial paper
market, which is crucial for banks' funding, as a possible
reason for the boost in bank shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's so much anxiety within the financial system that

comment, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Christian Plumb and Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley  (MS.N) and Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) shares slumped on Friday after Moody's Investors
Service said it might cut their ratings, reviving concerns
about the viability of their banking models.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stock of Morgan Stanley, the No. 2 independent investment
bank after Goldman, fell 43 percent on doubts that a planned $9
billion cash injection from Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group Inc
(MUFG) (8306.T) would be enough to enable the company to ride
out the current crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley shares have lost about 70 percent in the
past week and are at their lowest in nearly 14 years on worries
that Mitsubishi UFJ may back out of the cash-injection deal.
Both companies have given assurances that it would close on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc shares were down 20 percent on
worries about Morgan and the broader financial turmoil. The
Amex Securities Broker-Dealer Index .XBD shed 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Morgan Stanley shares have been under extraordinary
pressure as of late, for no apparent fundamental reason, as we
estimate liquidity, the balance sheet, and long-term earnings
prospects are sound," David Trone, an analyst with Fox-Pitt
Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller, said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, as we've seen with Bear Stearns and Lehman, once
the fear virus has infected the story, it is tough to shake."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley declined to comment on the movement in its
stock and debt, or on speculation about the MUFG deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which became the fifth-largest U.S. bank after
conversion to a commercial bank, has little choice but to wait
for Tuesday, when it can complete its $9 billion sale of stock
and convertible preferred shares to Mitsubishi. The deal could
be completed before U.S. markets open on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People inside the bank say there was no effort under way to
accelerate the waiting period for the Mitsubishi deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MUFG has affirmed it expects to close the deal on Tuesday
at the same terms, even though it would immediately absorb a $2
billion paper loss on the stock, based on current prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley said it does not plan to issue new common
stock in a public offering, as Goldman did after billionaire
investor Warren Buffett bought into the firm. It also is not
likely to pursue other capital deals because they would dilute
MUFG's holding and possibly scuttle that deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's warned Friday it might cut the long-term debt
ratings of Morgan Stanley and Goldman, which would increase
their cost of borrowing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Mitsubishi transaction hasn't closed yet ... I think
there's a legitimate concern that that deal doesn't go
through," said Jon Fisher, a portfolio manager at Fifth Third
Asset Management in Minneapolis. "Once (the Moody's
announcement) hit last night, people jumped to the Lehman
Brothers parallel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'ON THE ROPES?'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley stock tumbled $5.29 to $7.16 on the New York
Stock Exchange, while Goldman Sachs was down $18.36 at $83.00.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cost to insure Morgan Stanley's debt against default
rose on Friday, indicating investor concern about its financial
stability. The bank's five-year credit default swaps rose to an
upfront payment of 28 percent of the sum insured plus 500 basis
points a year from 19 percent on Thursday, according to Phoenix
Partners Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That means it would cost $2.8 million to insure $10 million
of debt plus $500,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The ratings might be cut and if you look at the credit
default swaps are kind of blowing out, so I would imagine
investors think that there could be some credit event in the
horizon," said Ken Crawford, senior portfolio manager of Argent
Capital Management in St Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Perhaps (the concerns are) that they need capital and
their inability to secure that capital," he added. "We've seen
the story before with Lehman and AIG. Maybe Morgan Stanley is
the next company to be on the ropes or in deep, deep trouble."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's said its review was "based upon its expectation
that an extended downturn in global capital market activity
will reduce Morgan Stanley's revenue and profit potential in
2009, and perhaps beyond this period."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Moody's noted that Morgan Stanley had moved quickly
to reduce risk on its balance sheet and decrease leverage, and
said the firm has a "good liquidity profile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a Morgan Stanley filing with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, the company had
$175 billion of average liquidity at the end of August, of
which $81 billion was at the holding company level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'CONFIDENCE' KEY VARIABLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It had a tier 1 capital ratio of 12.7 percent at end of
August and $23 of assets for every dollar of equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, Morgan Stanley Chief Executive John Mack
warned staff that the bank would be under siege but urged them
to stay upbeat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Veteran Ladenburg Thalmann bank analyst Richard Bove cited
the MUFG comments, along with disclosures in Morgan Stanley's
latest quarterly regulatory filing that it had minimal exposure
to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEHMQ.PK counterparty risk,
as positive developments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, he wrote in a research note: "Confidence is still
the key variable in this story as it was in Bear Stearns and
Lehman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Mitsubishi UFJ fell 8.5 percent to 710 yen, in
line with a 9 percent drop in Tokyo's index of bank stocks
.IBNKS.T.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Sachi Izumi, Jennifer Ablan, Tony

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ACI Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ: ACIW), a leading international provider of
electronic payment software, has signed a multi-million dollar agreement
with IBM (NYSE: IBM) for software and services to integrate its global
workforce and client base through unified communications and
collaboration technologies.

    A range of IBM software and services will deliver a virtually-connected
work environment to synchronize online activities for more than 2,000 ACI
Worldwide employees and clients in 88 countries.

    As electronic payment volumes grow, ACI products are demanded by more
customers in increasingly connected markets. ACI Worldwide supports more
than $70 billion consumer transactions per year. On an average day, ACI
software manages more than $5 trillion in wholesale payments. To meet the
challenges associated with growth, ACI selected a range of collaboration,
unified communications and social software to unify and virtualize
communications among its distributed work force and customers. An
integrated operation will be designed to overcome time differences and
geographical distances in a global business environment.

    "The ability to collaborate in all dimensions is key to extending our
industry leading position around the world," said Dave McCann, chief
information officer at ACI. "Business collaboration needs to more
accurately reflect the way people naturally prefer to interact. This IBM
solution is designed to accelerate individual and collective worker
productivity by 50 percent or more by breaking down barriers of time,
space and departmental silos."

    "IBM's unique approach to Unified Communications provides easy and
intuitive access to communications and collaboration services across a
broad spectrum of environments, making it easier to find, reach and
collaborate with your customers and employees," said Bruce Morse, vice
president for IBM Unified Communications and Collaboration. "Lotus
Sametime is a unified communications platform built on open standards
allowing easy integration with a broad range of IT vendor and IBM products
such as Lotus Connections, Lotus Quickr, WebSphere Portal and Lotus
ActiveInsight as well as ACI's existing environment to help them work
seamlessly and efficiently with their employees and customers."

    Cited by Gartner as a current Magic Quadrant leader in Unified
Communications for offering integrated and comprehensive solutions, IBM is
serving new clients such as ACI and expanding into its existing client
base. With market forces including the proliferation of communications
methods and convergence of all communications on IP networks and
open-software platforms, IBM helps clients improve business operations and
processes through a Unified Communications and Collaboration portfolio of
software and services.

    ACI will use the following IBM software:

    Lotus Sametime, for unified communications including instant messaging
and Web conferencing.  Lotus Connections, for enterprise social
networking and expert community-building.  Lotus Quickr, for team
collaboration and enhanced document sharing.

    Lotus ActiveInsight, a management dashboard with a view of real-time
business metrics, which defines and communicates business goals. It will
integrate with business intelligence systems; introduce group scorecards;
deploy applications on new clients; and update three-dimensional charting
support.  IBM WebSphere Portal, which delivers a Web 2.0 business mashup
framework and consistent user experience for ACI employees and customers
on a global basis.  IBM's OmniFind search tool, to help employees and
customers find, analyze and get the most out of their information,
regardless of where it is stored.  The visual modeling capabilities of
IBM Rational Data Architect, Rational Software Modeler and Rational
Software Architect will be used to simplify the design of future
applications.

   --Class A-4 at 'AAA';

   --Class B at 'A';

&lt;p&gt;BAKU Oct 10 (Reuters) - A Kazakh oil group led by U.S.
major Chevron (CVX.N) plans to start oil shipments via the
BP-run (BP.L) Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan (BTC) pipeline in the second
half of October, BP Azerbaijan said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We expect to start pumping some volumes of Tengizchevroil's
crude via the Baku-Ceyhan pipeline in the second half of
October," company spokesman Tamam Bayatly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She did not say how much oil was expected to be delivered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tengizchevroil, struggling to expand its key pipeline export
route, the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC), had hoped to start
alternative exports via Baku in mid-2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source at Azerbi state oil company Socar told Reuters last
month Tengizchevroil could start delivering 1.0-3.0 million
tonnes per year (20,000-60,000 bpd) via Azerbaijan and gradually
increase volumes to 5.0 million tonnes per year. The crude was
supposed to be shipped by both BTC and railways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The BTC pipeline, which runs from large Azeri fields on the
Caspian Sea to the Turkish Mediterranean port of Ceyhan, can
pump more than 1 million barrels per day, but currently works
under its design capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tengizchevroil wants to double capacity of its CPC pipeline,
running from Kazakhstan to the Russian Black Sea port of
Novorossiisk, to 60 million tonnes per year to accommodate
rising output in the central Asian country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group's shareholders, which also include U.S. Exxon
Mobil (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and
LUKOIL (LKOH.MM) as well as Kazakhstan, Oman and Russia as
member states, have yet to agree on the expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To see the latest story on CPC expansion talks, click on

&lt;p&gt;  BEIJING, Oct 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Today, some 600 years after construction began on the 178-acre site that
would become the center of unrivalled imperial power known as China's
Forbidden City, the Palace Museum and IBM (NYSE: IBM) will open the
walled fortress -- and hundreds of years of history and culture -- to the
world.

    Three years in the making, IBM has meticulously built a virtual recreation
of the architecture and artifacts of the former palace grounds, enabling
online visitors to get a first-hand view into imperial China as embodied
in the intricate design, history and storied culture of this newly
accessible Forbidden City.

    "The Forbidden City: Beyond Space &amp; Time" (www.beyondspaceandtime.org) is
a first-of-a-kind, fully immersive, three-dimensional virtual world that
recreates a visceral sense of space and time of this Chinese cultural
treasure -- as it was centuries ago during the height of the Ming and
Qing dynasties -- for most anyone with access to the Internet.

    A video news release and high-resolution photo images are available for
journalists at: www.thenewsmarket.com/ibm

    "The rich cultural heritage of China's imperial past, embodied in the
Forbidden City for over five centuries, is now brought to life and
accessible to all through a virtual world created by IBM and the Palace
Museum," said Henry Chow, Chairman, Greater China Group, IBM. "This
initiative takes the online experience to a new level of innovation with
rich content, educational storytelling, community and social networking
features that represent the next generation of 3D-Internet applications.

    "What makes me proud is that IBM now has opened the door to a cultural
treasure and rich heritage to everyone, everywhere which in the past was
only available to relatively few."

    Originally, the Forbidden City was constructed to embody the idea of the
emperor as the center of the universe with a series of dramatic courtyards
and gates, buildings and landings underscoring a design built to reinforce
security and power. This huge palace complex was completed in 1420, about
twelve years after construction began, and contains hundreds of exquisite
buildings and historic artifacts, and on October 10th, celebrates its 83rd
anniversary as a museum and one of China's major cultural attractions.

    Now, using virtual world technology, visitors can experience the awe
inspired by this vast and amazing space. Rather than experiencing its
wonders in isolation, the virtual Forbidden City allows you to see and
interact with other users and a range of helpful automated characters. As
you explore the virtual Forbidden City, you can choose to simply observe
the buzz of activity, or you can take tours and participate in activities
that provide insights into important aspects of Qing culture.

    Visitors to the virtual Forbidden City will be able to take tours that
correspond to major historical topics and stories from the Forbidden City,
such as Dragons of the Forbidden City, the Supreme Golden Halls of the
Forbidden City, the Imperial Garden, and the Symbolic Animals in the
Forbidden City.

    "'The Forbidden City: Beyond Space &amp; Time' is a program that combines
China's world-class cultural heritage with state-of-the-art information
technology. Three years in the making, the Palace Museum worked closely
with IBM in jointly engineering the program. Both parties have been deeply
touched by the profound and dazzling ancient Chinese culture," said Zheng
Xinmiao, the Director-General of The Palace Museum. "Meanwhile, we would
like to express our sincere gratitude to IBM for its full investment and
devotion and its strategy of applying innovative technology to social and
cultural promotion. This program is only a start, which, as we believe,
will have an unlimited future to explore China's traditional culture."

    Visitors to the virtual Forbidden City may also engage in activities in
which their avatars take an active role in the culture of the period. For
example, avatars can take part in activities such as archery, cricket
fighting, and playing the ancient game of Weiqi, the "board game of
surrounding" now popularized as GO.

    Visitors may also view and inspect artifacts and scenes such as "The
Emperor Having Dinner" and "Court Painting."

    The recreation of the Forbidden City represents how 3D technology can be
used to educate and provide cultural experiences on a large scale. At the
Forbidden City in Beijing, local visitors can also use a kiosk to interact
with the virtual world. It is the first virtual world to be built using
SOA architecture and includes open source components such as Linux.

    IBM's BladeCenters with Linux Blade Servers are at the heart of this
virtual world -- supporting robustness with the capability to enable
thousands of concurrent users and the scalability comparable to that of
massive multiplayer online games. IBM built the application using
WebSphere Application Server, Tivoli, ESB (Message Broker), DB2 Viper,
and IBM BladeCenters. The virtual world runs on Linux, Windows and Mac
operating environments.

    IBM has dedicated more than a decade to creating successful cultural
heritage projects, including the Vatican Library, the Pieta, Hermitage
Museum, Eternal Egypt, and the Smithsonian's National Museum of African
American History and Culture.

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Methanex Corp., Grupo Televisa SA de CV, HSBC Holdings, Plc, AAR Corp and Centennial Communications Corp.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: Methanex Corp. (NASDAQ: MEOH),

CYCL).

   Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog:

   Methanex Pressured from Chile

   Methanex Corp. (NASDAQ: MEOH) is the world's largest producer and
marketer of methanol. The Menlo Park, California-based company is
benefiting from improving fundamentals and lower costs, along with
declining average gas costs. It also has strong cash flow that drives
dividend increases and stock buybacks. However, problems with the
company's Chilean facilities force us to rate the stock a Hold.

   The company is hard hit by elimination of natural gas supplies
from seven Argentine suppliers as well as an increase in export duty
for gas by the country to 100%. However, the company may have found a
way out by seeking alternative sources of natural gas or by directly
participating in exploration projects. It is now anticipating
increasing quantities of Chilean gas and expects to spend about $100
million in capital over the next 3 years. About 62% of the natural gas
for the Chilean facilities is currently sourced from suppliers in
Argentina.

   Grupo Televisa Lowered to Hold

   Grupo Televisa SA de CV (NYSE: TV) has been posting great
operating results in recent years. New investments in the telecom
sector and the gambling business are quite encouraging and should keep
on growing in the following quarters. However, the economic crisis in
the U.S. and Europe will affect not only the media company's
international business, but also its Mexican operations in the very
short term.

   A considerable share of the company's income comes from its U.S.
operations, including the sale of content, website and cable
television. We believe TV is in a better position to face the economic
crisis if compared to other Mexican companies, since it has a strong
cash position. However, it will be hard to avoid the effects of the
adverse scenario. We are changing our current recommendation on TV
from Buy to Hold.

   HSBC Not Joining U.K. Bailout

   We are continuing our Hold on HSBC Holdings, Plc (NYSE: HBC). The
company will report its third quarter trading update on November 10.
We are maintaining our EPADS estimates at $6.75 for 2008 and $7.50 for
2009.

   Earnings should reflect strong loan and deposit growth, especially
in emerging markets, and improved productivity, partially offset by
increased impairment charges due to problems in credit markets.
Importantly, HSBC announced that it does not intend to take part in
the UK government's recapitalization program for banks as it already
has sufficient capital.

   AIR Overleveraged and Sinking

   AAR Corp (NYSE: AIR) provides goods &amp; services to commercial
airlines and the defense establishment. On the commercial side, demand
for he Wood Dale, Illinois-based company's product offerings moves
with the size of the fleet -- which is declining -- while requirements
for its services may grow as the airlines outsource more maintenance,
repair and overhaul work.

   For defense, AIR designs and manufactures mobility products,
aircraft internal cargo loading/unloading systems and composite
structures. AIR has leveraged its balance sheet to support its
commercial aircraft leasing activities, which, at this point, is not
considered a positive.

   Centennial Down to Fair Value

   We maintain our Hold rating for Centennial Communications Corp.
(NASDAQ: CYCL), a regional provider of wireless and integrated
communications, based on the company's recent operational performance
driven by stronger than expected revenue and earnings, along with
sustainable subscriber growth.

   New initiatives in fiscal 2009, including network infrastructure
upgrades in the U.S. and new unlimited tariff plans in Puerto Rico,
are expected to accelerate overall business performance.

&lt;p&gt;  BALTIMORE, MD, Oct 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Brower Piven, A Professional Corporation announces that a class action
lawsuit has been commenced in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York on behalf of purchasers of securities of
General Electric Company ("GE" or the "Company") (NYSE: GE) during the
period between September 25, 2008 and October 1, 2008, inclusive (the
"Class Period").

    No class has yet been certified in the above action. Members of the Class
will be represented by the lead plaintiff and counsel chosen by the lead
plaintiff. If you wish to choose counsel to represent you and the Class,
you must apply to be appointed lead plaintiff no later than December 2,
2008 and be selected by the Court. The lead plaintiff will direct the
litigation and participate in important decisions including whether to

Period. You may contact Brower Piven (through hoffman@browerpiven.com or
410/332-0030) to answer any questions you may have in that regard.

    The complaint includes claims against GE and certain of its officers with
violations of Section 10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The complaint asserts that during an investor conference call
on September 25, 2008, defendants falsely represented that GE would not
require any additional fund raising through debt, equity, or otherwise
during the fourth quarter-ended December 31, 2008 but that 5 days later,
on October 1, 2008, the Company announced that it planned to offer at
least $12 billion of common stock in a public offering. The complaint
further alleges that on October 2, 2008, GE announced the offering was to
be priced at $22.25 per share, below the stock's prior day closing price
of $24.50 per share and below its 52 week low, an announcement that
caused the value of GE shares to decline significantly.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs, one of the foremost bulls on commodities, turned a near-term bear on Monday after conceding that global financial turmoil would take a far bigger toll on demand than first anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We have underestimated the depth and duration of the global financial crisis and its implications on economic growth and commodity demand," its commodity markets research team lead by Jeffrey Currie said in a report dated October 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank, which has consistently been at the top of Reuters oil price polls for years, said in the report that it now expects U.S. crude oil prices to end the year at around $70 a barrel, down from a previous forecast of $115 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, should the financial and evolving economic crisis cut deeper into demand, the market could fall as low as $50, which we believe to be the industry's cash cost and shut in level," the analysts wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude rose $3.11 or 4 percent to $80.81 a barrel on Monday as news of fresh European efforts to end the financial crisis revived prices from a 13-month low on Friday, when heavy selling and demand fears knocked prices 10 percent lower. O/R&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also cut its end-2009 price target to $107 a barrel from $125 and made an even deeper $37 cut to its average-2009 forecast, which it now put at $86 a barrel -- making it the third most-bearish forecaster as of Reuters last poll on Sept 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also cut its forecast for copper prices in three months to $3,500 a tonne versus and old forecast of $7,960, but predicted a recovery to $6,625 in 12 month's time. London Metals Exchange three-month copper rose 2.5 percent to $4,920 a tonne.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also cut its three-month view on aluminum to $2,060 from $2,950 and saw a more measured rise to $2,600 in 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As copper is the only base metal that remains substantially above its marginal cost of production even at the current depressed price levels, we believe that it remains the most vulnerable to further downside in the near term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEDIUM-TERM UPSIDE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the analysts also said recent events strengthened their argument for a structural bull market, as commodity producers are "highly dependent upon access to capital and were already struggling to grow production capacity before recent events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the swiftness and severity of the pullback in commodity and other asset prices stresses the ability of the industry to grow future production capacity, it also creates a much more unstable political environment in many of the producing countries around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, it is likely that the supply constraints that have propelled commodity prices to record-high levels in recent years will likely be even more binding as the credit crisis resolves and as economic growth regains positive momentum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests the potential for substantial upside from commodity investments in the medium-to-longerterm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On base metals, it said infrastructure growth in China, the expansion of Chinese consumer demand for manufactured good and stretched production infrastructure supported a bullish case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Leff; Editing by Valerie Lee)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Company Grants $1.5 Million to Tree People to Reforest Fire-Ravaged Areas Surrounding Los Angeles

LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company announced a grant of $1.5 million to
TreePeople, a non-profit organization, to help reforest fire-ravaged
areas in the mountains surrounding greater Los Angeles. Under
TreePeople's California Wildfire Restoration Initiative, of which
Disney is the biggest financial supporter, thousands of volunteers
will plant an estimated 60,000 new trees over the next three years.

   "It's a great way for Disney to give back to the community that we
have called home for the last 85 years," said Disney President and CEO
Robert A. Iger, who added the gift "is right in line with Disney's own
environmental policies, which seek to maintain sustainable strategies
for minimizing our impact and encouraging and activating others to be
environmentally responsible."

   "Because of the foresight and generosity of Disney, we are going
to be able to send thousands of people, including students, up to the
mountains to restore the burned areas," said Andy Lipkis, TreePeople
founder and president. "Just as these forests have been sending rivers
of clean water to the city for all these years, the city can now be
sending a river of human hands and caring back to them."

   Disney announced its gift at TreePeople's 21st annual "An Evening
under the Harvest Moon" last Saturday. The event honored Disney's
previous work to plant and care for trees and to educate kids about
the urban environment and stewardship of natural resources. Earlier
this year, Disney, with a $250,000 grant and the support of its
VoluntEARS launched with TreePeople an initiative to green Los Angeles
school campuses parks and other spaces where children gather in
support of the city's Million Trees LA initiative.

   One of the world's main media and entertainment companies, Disney
has been involved in environmental causes for over 60 years when Walt
Disney himself began making award-winning nature documentaries. For
the last twenty years, Disney's Environmental Affairs team has worked
to establish and sustain a positive environmental legacy for Disney
and for future generations through a wide variety of programs and
policies.

   Started by teenagers in the 1970s, TreePeople has planted more
than two million trees in the LA area with the help of hardworking
volunteers. As acknowledged leaders in the U.S. Citizen Forestry
movement, TreePeople supports residents, students, government
agencies, business and neighborhoods by providing the tools to take
environmental action in their communities. TreePeople's recent project
to help restore the fire-damaged mountains of Southern California is
its most ambitious yet.

&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which would be one of the 10 largest U.S. banks
with $150 billion in assets, wants to turn a New York-chartered
trust it has had since 1990 into a full service New York bank
with trust powers, under the name Goldman Sachs Bank USA, the
Democratic governor said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's Utah-based industrial loan company would be
merged with the New York trust and Goldman would keep a Utah
branch, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "New York is the hub for international finance and
Goldman's decision today builds on a strong foundation,"
Paterson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nor was a spokesmen for Morgan Stanley (MS.N). Like
Goldman, Morgan Stanley last month got federal regulators to
let it transform into a commercial bank holding company, a
strategy that lets both of the investment bank rivals tap
federally insured deposits though they must accept more
oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Joan Gralla; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that IBM FileNet Records Manager v4.5
received the U.S. Department of Defense's (DoD) Standard for Records
Management (DoD 5015.2-STD V3 April 2007) certification. This
certification verifies IBM FileNet Records Manager's ability to control
the creation, declaration, classification, retention, application of
legal holds, transfers, and destruction of electronic and non-electronic
records. Additionally, IBM FileNet Records Manager was also certified to
meet the stringent requirements of managing records in a classified
environment where security and access are paramount.

    "It's more important than ever for organizations to produce trustworthy,
authentic and admissible information," said Craig Rhinehart, director,
Compliance and Discovery, IBM Enterprise Content Management. "Records
management is critical for ensuring information compliance with regulatory
and legal mandates. We are pleased our market leading offering has again
passed the DoD's rigorous 5015.2 testing and certification process."

    Certification is required for all records management solutions implemented
by the DoD. It is widely adopted as a de facto standard for many
commercial organizations and the National Archives and Records
Administration (NARA) has endorsed the DoD standard for use by all Federal
agencies. As a result of the continuing shift towards increased
collaboration across government, this standard has become an integral
component of many Federal Agencies' records management practices --
enabling organizations to improve inter-agency collaboration without
compromising security.

    To earn certification, FileNet Records Manager demonstrated that it can
meet a multitude of mandatory requirements in both classified and
unclassified environments such as implementing and managing file plans,
handling multiple records disposition phases, declaring and filing records
including email messages, managing metadata, supporting vital records,
controlling security, and placing legal holds on records.

    IBM FileNet Records Manager v4.5

    FileNet Records Manager v4.5 is an enterprise records management offering
that combines content and process to automate and streamline all
records-based activities by supporting the entire lifecycle of records
from creation to disposition. Enabled by ZeroClick automation, the
solution is designed to help users implement best-practices records
declaration, classification, and records administration while minimizing
the impact on the business user and records manager, improving
productivity and returning a tangible return on investment.

    FileNet Records Manager v4.5 works together with other IBM ECM
capabilities such as Content Collection &amp; Archiving, Advanced
Classification, and eDiscovery. IBM FileNet Records Manager v4.5 also has
the capability to manage records in multiple IBM and other third party
repositories.

    New features of FileNet Records Manager v4.5 include:


--  Functionality designed to facilitate the transfer of records from a
Federal Agency to NARA, utilizing IBM ZeroClick records-process features.

--  Performance enhancements for records deletion, multithreaded batch
operations, and dynamic hold to support large content based retrieval (CBR)
result sets. 
--  Single Sign On (SSO) for easier user interoperability across the
Workplace, and Workplace XT and records administration user interfaces.

--  Multilanguage support so that an RM server can be configured to use
multiple language packs for expanded support of global, multilingual
enterprise records management environments. 

    
IBM FileNet Records Manager v4.5 is available now. For more

&lt;p&gt;  SANTIAGO, CHILE, Oct 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Aiming to be the technological vanguard university in Chile, Universidad
de Los Andes signed an important contract with IBM Chile (NYSE: IBM) on
September 24, 2008.

    The agreement involves a complete data center implementation that will

computational systems for a SAP platform and legacy applications, as well
as the administration and support of the university's communication
system.

    After a complete market study, the university selected IBM Chile. This
contract will establish a five-year relationship between both institutions
with the opportunity of extending services in the future.

    "The Universidad de Los Andes has entrusted IBM with a great
responsibility," commented Luis Siles, country manager of IBM Chile. "The
technology infrastructure that IBM will install will provide a highly
available, stable and strong environment, which is important for the
university, especially for tasks such as the student admission process."

    IBM Chile was selected for this important agreement because its proposal
was aligned to the university's needs regarding timing, flexibility,
support and quality of technological outsourcing service.

to its conviction buy list, saying the companies have
particularly strong balance sheets, sustainable cash flow and
lower commodity price leverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Arjun Murti said valuation of both the companies
were compelling, following the recent sell off in their shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With a $30 billion positive net cash position and ability

Exxon should represent one of the premier 'safe-haven' stocks

exploration and production volumes are beginning to turn
positive, which could be a key catalyst for the shares, and
that the company offers an attractive cash flow yield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murti also downgraded Marathon Oil (MRO.N) and Murphy Oil

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on current prices in paragraphs 10,11)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said in a
commodities research note Monday it was lowering its U.S. and
UK natural gas price forecasts on the back of downward 
revisions to its oil and coal outlooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are lowering our UK NBP price forecast through March
2010, as well as our 2008/2009 winter U.S. natural gas forecast
as current credit constraints have exacerbated the global
economic slowdown and have significantly damaged the current
and forward oil demand outlook," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lower oil prices led Goldman to revise down its UK NBP
prices, which are arbitraged against the (oil-indexed) European
Continental prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it lowered its 2008/2009 winter, 2009 summer
and 2009/2010 winter UK NBP prices to $15.35 per million British
thermal units, $10.60/mmBtu and $14.20/mmBtu, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also lowered its 2008/2009 winter NYMEX natural gas
forecast to $7.60/mmBtu, from $9.50/mmBtu previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the event of an inventory stock out in the winter, NYMEX
natural gas prices would have to move up to residual fuel oil
prices in order to reduce demand, and these prices have been
downgraded as well as the rest of the oil complex, thereby
lowering the upside to natural gas prices," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it still expects summer 2009 NYMEX natural gas
to price at parity with coal, but at lower levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We still expect US natural gas to price at parity with
Appalachian coal during summer 2009 in order to incentivize
coal-to-gas fuel substitution and rebalance the market.
However, Goldman Sachs JB Were has just downgraded their
Newcastle (thermal) coal price forecast for 2009, on which we
base our Appalachian coal price expectations, in response to
softer European demand for coal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The natural gas price parity with coal is now expected to
take place at $7.30/mmBtu, the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYMEX front-month November natural gas futures NGX8 were
trading in the $6.70/mmBtu area early Monday, sliding from a
high of $8.32/mmBtu in mid-September, as concerns over damage
and shut-in Gulf of Mexico production in the wake of hurricanes
Gustav and Ike waned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; British gas prices for November delivery, meanwhile, were
trading in the $12.80/mmBtu area Monday.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 13 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities cut Diamond
Offshore Drilling Inc (DO.N) to "underweight" from "overweight"
and said shares of the oil and gas drilling contractor was
overvalued relative to its group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rating change is in view of a rebound in the group, a
long grind sideways and rapid deterioration of dayrates to, or
below, midcycle levels, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we expect positive deepwater rates in the near term,
we have cut 2009 and 2010 earnings estimates given EP
(exploration and production) budget risk," JP Morgan analyst
David Smith said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the analyst expects a strong rebound in the services
names should the markets stabilize, he said Diamond Offshore
presented less upside in a rebound versus its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Offshore driller stocks largely discount a rapid return to,
or below, midcycle rates. Under this scenario, Diamond Offshore
has the most margin to lose, particularly if deepwater
newbuilds arrive into a market that is cutting deepwater
exploration budgets, Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Smith said even if oil prices find support at $80 barrel
and the offshore drillers avoid significant earnings
deterioration, the company would still look expensive, adding
that it was more business than credit risk for Diamond
Offshore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said he preferred shares of companies like
Transocean Inc (RIG.N) and Pride International Inc PDE.N
which have better backlog support and improving fleets at a
cheaper price, and Noble Corp (NE.N), Rowan Companies Inc
(RDC.N) which present more upside in a rebound and little
liquidity risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diamond Offshore shares were up 9 percent at $72.59 in
morning trade amid a broader market rally. The shares touched a
high of $74.23 in early trade Monday on the New York Stock
Exchange. The Dow Jones U.S. oil equipment and services index
.DJUSOI was up 5 percent at 388.25.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 13 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities downgraded Dow
Chemical Co (DOW.N) to "neutral" from "overweight," cut its
earnings per share estimates for the largest U.S. chemical
maker and said the stock could face a near-term weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The consensus earnings estimates for the third quarter of
2008 and full year 2009 look too high, the brokerage said,
adding that if the "unpopular" Rohm and Haas acquisition
encounter delays or disruptions, the stock could come under
some pressure as a result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acquisition synergies will probably be delayed given the
contracting demand environment, JP Morgan said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Downside risk to the current share price exists related to
deteriorating business fundamentals and transaction risks for
its Kuwait PIC and Rohm and Haas ROH.N dealings," analyst
Jeffrey Zekauskas said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Dow had outperformed the market since the beginning
of the year, Zekauskas said he was "less confident" that Dow
can meaningfully outperform the broader market in coming
months.
 The analyst cut his earnings forecast for Dow's third-quarter
by 25 cents to 43 cents citing impacts of Hurricanes Gustav and
Ike.
 However, he said Dow's above-average dividend yield, financial
strength, and global presence still made it attractive from a
long-term point of view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, there may be a temporary widening of commodity
margins due to hurricane-related supply disruptions in the Gulf
Coast, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow shares closed at $24.40 Friday on the New York Stock
Exchange.

quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a good chance" that both Boston Scientific Corp
(BSX.N) and St. Jude will beat ICD sales expectations, though
Boston's upside should be greater, analyst Michael Weinstein
wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the third quarter, the brokerage expects ICD market
growth of 15 percent year-over-year, including 9 percent growth
in the U.S. and 29 percent internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which expects the company's third quarter to
be modestly better than consensus, is forecasting $386 million
in revenue for St. Jude's ICD business in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of St. Jude closed at $32.52 Friday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;FalconStor(R) NSS Enables Automated, Application-Consistent
  Failover in Geographically Dispersed Clusters of Both Physical and
          Hyper-V Virtual Servers for Better DR over the WAN
MELVILLE, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
FalconStor Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: FALC), the provider of TOTALLY
Open(TM) data protection solutions, today announced that, as part of
its ongoing support of Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V
virtualization technology, FalconStor(R) Network Storage Server (NSS)
software works seamlessly with Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Failover
Clustering to provide instantaneous disaster recovery (DR) over the
wide-area network (WAN) in both physical server and Hyper-V virtual
server environments.

   Integrating both logical and virtual worlds, the combination of
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Failover Clustering and Hyper-V virtual
servers enables automatic failover of business-critical applications
running on geographically dispersed physical and virtual servers. The
solution provides companies with integrated data protection, less
expensive DR and immediate recovery from server failure.

   FalconStor's open software-based SAN replication and cluster
protection software, FalconStor NSS, is tightly integrated with
Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Failover Clustering, enabling not only
protection of the host server but also of individual Hyper-V virtual
machines configured as clustered servers. FalconStor is the first data
protection vendor to deliver replication and automated failover
processes in Microsoft Windows Server 2008 environments at the block
level, which eliminates any performance impact on the host.

   Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V in multi-site cluster deployments
enables IT organizations to cost-effectively adopt virtualization,
improve utilization, optimize infrastructure and rapidly provision new
servers using systems management tools for both physical and
virtualized environments. FalconStor NSS software provides a real-time
software-based replication and multi-site failover solution with
application integrity optimized for Microsoft virtual server
environments.

   "As an early adopter of Microsoft Hyper-V in our production
environment, which runs hundreds of virtualized servers created with
Microsoft's Hyper-V virtualization technology, we have been able to
benefit from FalconStor NSS software's support of Hyper-V for nearly a
year," said Oyvind Kaldestad, vice president of Corporate IT for
Lionbridge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ: LIOX), a leading provider of
globalization, development and testing services that designs and
develops custom training courseware. "Also, having tested FalconStor
NSS software with Microsoft Windows 2008 Failover Clustering and
Hyper-V using different SANs between the primary and DR site, we are
excited to see how well the failover process works without locking us
into identical storage hardware at each location."

   FalconStor NSS software automatically protects both Windows Server
2008 and Hyper-V clusters through WAN optimization and automated
multi-site cluster failover integration. With FalconStor NSS software,
customers can unify their multi-vendor SAN environments and replicate
to a remote site using nearly any vendor's storage equipment at either
location.

   "In the past, integrating high availability and disaster recovery
capabilities together into a 'geo clustering' solution has been an
expensive proposition that required significant administration
sophistication and expertise," said Eric Burgener, senior analyst at
The Taneja Group. "FalconStor now has added capabilities to its core
NSS software offering that makes creating these configurations for
Windows Server 2008 environments simpler and more cost-effective,
giving customers a much more approachable, integrated HA/DR solution.
With evolving business and regulatory mandates turning DR into a
must-have capability, this development will be welcomed by mid-market
and enterprise customers alike."

   "Our storage virtualization and data protection software provides
a TOTALLY Open, enterprise-proven solution for businesses seeking to
improve their recovery-time and recovery-point objectives in a
cost-effective manner," said Bernie Wu, FalconStor vice president of
business development. "The integration work we've done with Microsoft
Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V and Failover Clustering takes this one
step further by providing overall multi-site application availability
and consistency."

   FalconStor NSS software provides a disaster recovery suite for
Windows Server 2008 that seamlessly supports Microsoft's multi-site
failover clustering feature for physical servers or Hyper-V virtual
servers while ensuring application integrity during failover.
Transactional applications - such as Microsoft SQL Server, Microsoft
SharePoint, Microsoft Dynamics, Microsoft Exchange and others -
present a huge data-integrity challenge when they are configured
within multi-site clusters where DR is required. Because of the
latency and distance that the WAN introduces, there is no guarantee
that every block of data will arrive at the secondary site in the
event of a failure. FalconStor NSS software enhances data protection
for Microsoft Windows Server 2008 Failover Clustering in multi-site
environments by ensuring at the sub-block level that each application
has a clean, consistent restart point just before service was
interrupted.

   FalconStor and Microsoft have a strong history of working together
to provide scalable business solutions for the mid-tier and enterprise
markets. FalconStor is a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner and a
managed ISV partner and has earned Microsoft's Advanced Infrastructure
Storage Solution Specialization Competency.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, background)

 Oct 13 (Reuters) - Stifel Nicolaus cut its price target on
multinational beverage giant Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), citing a weak
global economy and outlook.

 Overall sales in the fizzy drinks sector have fallen in the
past three years, affecting companies like PepsiCo, Coca-Cola
Co, and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (DPS.N).

 Analysts Mark Swartzberg and Mark S. Astrachan cut their
price target to $55 from $60 to reflect a lower expected
earnings base and slower estimated profit growth over the next
two years.

 "...We think this is a good example of a company caught in
the downdraft of a generally bearish market..," the brokerage
said in a note to clients.

 Stifel Nicolaus also trimmed its 2008 earnings outlook on
Coca-Cola to $3.13 a share from $3.14 a share, but has
reiterated its "buy" rating on the stock of the company.

 The analysts said they believe Coke remains a "quality
company" with a strong cash flow profile.

 Shares of the company closed at $41.50 Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

   So what stocks are on (your new Buy) list?

   I would first of all stress that this is simply a starting point
for further investigation, not a recommendation to go out and buy all
of these stocks. However, it does appear at first glance that Mr.
Market is simply giving these names away.

   These are some of the household-names associated with this list:
CBS Corp. (NYSE: CBS), France Telecom (NYSE: FTE), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE)
and BP (NYSE: BP). None of these companies are in danger of going out
of business soon, and they are all trading at modest next-year P/Es
with solid dividend yields.

   In fact, CBS and FTE currently offer yields north of 10%, and
offer products that consumers cannot easily cut from their budgets.
And none of these companies are trading right now at a price-to-book
multiple of higher than 1.59. So these are very conservative equities
to buy, as well.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded the European
oil services sector to "neutral" from "attractive" and said it
sees a significant margin squeeze coming from lower oil
industry capital expenditure and higher oil service capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it cut its 2009 oil price forecast to
reflect oil demand weakness given the significant global
economic turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to believe that the underlying drivers of the
structural bull market for crude oil remain intact, most
notably struggling oil supply growth," analyst Michele Vigna
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vigna expects the cyclical downturn to last at least
through the first half of 2009, with an oil price averaging $75
per barrel in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst downgraded Neste Oil Corp (NES1V.HE) to
"conviction sell" from "buy" and Petroleum Geo-Services
(PGS.OL) to "conviction sell" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Vigna upgraded Soco International (SIA.L) to
"neutral" from "sell" . The analyst said Soco's stock no longer
screens unattractively relative to its peers from a valuation
perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst also upgraded SBM Offshore SBM.AS to
"neutral" from "conviction sell" on valuation.

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N), the biggest oil trader on Wall Street, has been restricted from making a market in price assessment agency Platts' daily oil trading window as counterparty anxiety grows, two sources familiar with the move said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman is the latest in a series of major investment banks to be placed under a so-called "review" by Platts, which has said it may sometimes need to limit the activities of some companies in its half-hour price-discovery process if their acceptability by counterparties threatens to distort benchmark prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the restrictions on its commodities trading arm J Aron are not as severe as those placed earlier on some rivals, who were effectively barred from participating in the window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the sources, who was familiar with the order, said Goldman Sachs was still able to trade during the window and that its deals would be taken into account by Platts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency uses bids, offers and trades to set the price for hundreds of opaque, over-the-counter (OTC) physical oil and energy products every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman will not be able to submit bids and offers to make a market during the assessment, said the source, who declined to be named. The second source said Goldman had been put under review by Platts, but did not give any details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman's bids and offers will not be taken into account," the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to fix author's name)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Luke Pachymuthu and Annika Breidthardt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DUBAI/SINGAPORE Oct 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N),
the biggest oil trader on Wall Street, has been restricted from
making a market in price assessment agency Platts' daily oil
trading window as counterparty anxiety grows, two sources
familiar with the move said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is the latest in a series of major investment banks
to be placed under a so-called "review" by Platts, which has
said it may sometimes need to limit the activities of some
companies in its half-hour price-discovery process if their
acceptability by counterparties threatens to distort benchmark
prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the restrictions on its commodities trading arm J
Aron are not as severe as those placed earlier on some rivals,
who were effectively barred from participating in the window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the sources, who was familiar with the order, said
Goldman Sachs was still able to trade during the window and
that its deals would be taken into account by Platts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency uses bids, offers and trades to set the price
for hundreds of opaque, over-the-counter (OTC) physical oil and
energy products every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Goldman will not be able to submit bids and offers to
make a market during the assessment, said the source, who
declined to be named. The second source said Goldman had been
put under review by Platts, but did not give any details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman's bids and offers will not be taken into account,"
the source said, speaking on condition of anonymity. "That
limits their market making but their trades are not affected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Goldman did not participate in the half-hour
Platts window that runs from 0800 GMT to 0830 GMT, traders
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The review does not stop Goldman from trading oil, and
there was no suggestion that the review had affected its
day-to-day trade. But being restricted from making a market in
the window will reduce the bank's influence on Platts'
benchmark prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs corporate communications and a Platts
spokesman declined to comment. Platts has repeatedly declined
to confirm or deny previous instances where it has placed a
company under review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Platts does routinely, and as part of standard editorial
practice, review the companies participating in its price
assessment processes, with the objective of maintaining the
integrity of its price assessments," Platts said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STEPPED-UP MONITORING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the month-old financial crisis roils Wall Street,
claiming once-mighty financial institutions in its wake,
Platts, a unit of McGraw-Hill Companies Inc MHP.N, has
stepped up its monitoring of counterparty acceptance in the oil
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It placed Lehman Brothers, which had a much smaller energy
trading operation, under review in early July, about two months
before the bank collapsed, and did the same for trading
heavyweight Morgan Stanley (MS.N) a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Morgan Stanley chose to withdraw itself from the
trading window rather than face a public test of its
creditworthiness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which has fared better than its peers through the
crisis, had value-at-risk -- a measure of the amount of money a
company could lose in a single day from a particular trade --
of $51 million a day on commodity markets in the past quarter,
according to a quarterly report, taking more risk than any
other major investment bank. [ID:nN16286216]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its shares have shed about 42 percent since Lehman's
collapse last month, compared with rival Morgan Stanley's 74
percent, giving it a market capitalisation of around $35
billion at Friday's close. Morgan Stanley's is $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Platts does not have the resources nor the remit to assess
a company's credit status, but says it must respond to changes
in the market when faced with issues -- including counterparty
credit acceptance -- that threaten to skew its prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is not uncommon for Platts to put a company under
"review" for things like violating the rules of trade or
delivering off-specification product, essentially a punitive
measure with different levels of severity known in the industry
as "boxing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But until recently it was less common to do so because of
credit concerns, since these are more difficult to assess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike the futures markets, in which all trades are backed
by a clearing house, cash and OTC energy trade is usually
bilateral, exposing traders to counterparty risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because of that risk, daily trading volumes in OTC swaps
and cash markets has fallen, traders say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Platts competes with Thomson Reuters in providing news and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares in JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N),
Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and other banks climbed on Friday,
in stark contrast with former investment banks Goldman Sachs
Group (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of JPMorgan and Bank of America were both up over 4
percent, at $39.17 and $20.53 respectively, in afternoon
trading. Shares in Citigroup Inc (C.N), which on Thursday
withdrew its bid to buy struggling regional bank Wachovia
WB.N, were also higher at $13.37, or up about 3.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs, which recently converted
to bank holding companies to boost deposits and calm investor
concern about their funding sources, saw their share prices
fall 32 percent and 17 percent respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts and investors attributed the rise in other
financials to short covering, as investors bought up shares
believing government action to stabilize Morgan Stanley and the
rest of the market may be possible this weekend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'd be surprised if people would want to be short
financials going into the weekend," said Owen Fitzpatrick, head
of the U.S. equity group at Deutsche Bank Private Wealth
Management in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others noted a slight easing in the commercial paper
market, which is crucial for banks' funding, as a possible
reason for the boost in bank shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's so much anxiety within the financial system that
any good news could set the stage for a dandy rally," said
David Rolfe, chief investment officer at Wedgewood Partners, in
St Louis, Missouri.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Elinor Comlay and Kristina Cooke; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team to Receive Advance Access
to Microsoft Vulnerability Data
COLUMBIA, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Open source innovator and SNORT(R) creator, Sourcefire, Inc.
(Nasdaq: FIRE), a leader in Enterprise Threat Management, today
announced that it will receive vulnerability information from
Microsoft in advance of monthly security bulletins through its
participation in the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP).
MAPP, a new program from the Microsoft Security Response Center
(MSRC), provides vulnerability information to security software
providers in advance of Microsoft's monthly security update release.

   As a partner in MAPP, the early notification will help the
Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team (VRT) better anticipate
emerging threats and continue its track record of delivering timely
protection against new and dynamic attacks.

   "Security is an industry-wide challenge, and through our
participation in the Microsoft Active Protections Program, Sourcefire
is demonstrating its commitment to ensuring the continued safety and
integrity of our customers' networks," said Matt Watchinski, Senior
Director of the Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team. "By writing
rules designed to detect all attempts to exploit a vulnerability,
instead of just the exploits themselves, the VRT takes a comprehensive
approach to protecting its users' assets. The MAPP program is evidence
that Microsoft shares our commitment to delivering comprehensive
security solutions."

   The Sourcefire VRT is a group of leading edge intrusion detection
and prevention experts working to discover, assess and respond to the
latest trends in hacking activity, intrusion attempts and
vulnerabilities. In addition to MAPP, the VRT is supported by the vast
resources of the open source Snort community; including public and
private data feeds, independent security researchers and honeynets.
This collaborative network makes the VRT one of the largest groups
dedicated to advances in the network security industry.

   Because the VRT will now be receiving vulnerability information
earlier, Sourcefire customers can benefit from improvements to
Sourcefire's industry leading rule development and update process.
These enhancements may include:

   --  Faster rule development

   --  Improved detection rates

   --  Fewer false positives

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A sharp slowdown in the global economy could test the ability of Visa Inc (V.N) and Mastercard Inc (MA.N), the world's largest credit and debit card networks, to dodge the worst of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both companies have posted better-than-expected results so far this year and their shares peaked at record highs in May, when most of the financial industry was already feeling the squeeze from sliding asset values and rising loan defaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa launched the largest initial public offering in U.S. history just days after the near collapse of Bear Stearns Cos Inc, the first big victim of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together with Mastercard, Visa is one of the few financial services company that has consistently garnered "outperform" recommendations from analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But neither company is immune to the worst credit crisis in decades. A stronger dollar, higher net charge-offs and fears of a global recession will hurt both companies, investors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their future results "could be dramatically less than expected," said James Ellman, portfolio manager of hedge fund Seacliff Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're exposed to a slowdown in spending ... and the transactions from a consumer standpoint are slowing down, so that impacts (them) negatively," said Walter Todd, portfolio manager of Greenwood Capital Associates. "Internationally, it's very clear now the rest of the world is going to slow down significantly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNDER PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's shares have fallen 35 percent since May's record highs, and Mastercard has lost almost half its market value, on heightened fears of a global recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And investors said the share price targets and earnings estimates for both companies are overly optimistic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Reuters Estimates, analysts' average forecasts are for earnings to rise 25 percent for Visa and 23 percent for Mastercard in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The valuation framework for Mastercard and Visa has to adjust to a different situation for all financial companies and for the market in general," said Ken Crawford, senior portfolio manager of Argent Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are in a period in financials where a lot of the rules, a lot of the norms are for the moment put on hold," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenwood Capital's Todd said earnings and revenue estimates for both companies should be cut by at least 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ellman said the companies' revenues could grow by only single digits in 2009, compared with an average forecast of 15 percent for Visa and 13 percent for MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the companies' shares could fall a further 20 percent to 25 percent in the event of a mild recession, and up to 50 percent in a severe global recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa shares are trading 25 percent below analysts' mean price target of $80, while Mastercard is 35 percent under the mean price target of $271, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last month, U.S. unemployment jumped to the highest level in five years, while mortgage foreclosures hit record levels and credit markets virtually froze, raising concerns about a U.S. recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economic outlook is also challenging for emerging markets from Russia to Brazil, where Visa and Mastercard have been growing faster in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenues at both companies are also expected to suffer from a recent appreciation of the dollar, as this reduces the amount in dollars of sales abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And credit card net charge-offs, a measure of loan losses, are expected to hit nearly double-digit levels in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to get a significant reduction in transactions throughout the consumer economy, and these two companies cannot avoid that," said Mike Holland, chairman of Holland  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and Mastercard had no comment since they are in a quiet period before releasing their quarterly earnings. Visa is due to report results on October 29; Mastercard is due on November 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECULAR TREND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, the world's biggest card networks are still seen as a compelling long-term bet. Immune to the heavy write-downs for bad loans hitting consumer lenders, they book revenue every time anyone uses one of their branded credit or debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, both companies are benefiting from consumers' increasing tendency to use plastic rather than paper money, a trend that's expected to continue, although at a slower pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, investor Julian Robertson said he had bought Mastercard shares in a vote of confidence for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Crawford said Visa and Mastercard shares would take longer to recover than the shares of other financial companies once the markets stabilizes, as investors would rush for other stocks that have been hit harder, such as JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
When Walt Disney Pictures' newest animated comedy adventure BOLT
opens Nov. 21, 2008, audiences in more than 1,000 theatres will not
only enjoy a family film about an action-star dog who believes he has
superpowers, they will be able to see it in RealD 3D, then - with no
superpowers required - help save the earth by recycling their 3D
glasses in the theater.

   With the opening of BOLT, RealD is expanding a comprehensive
eyewear recycling program, available for moviegoers to deposit their
glasses after seeing a film. However, moviegoers will continue to have
the option of keeping their glasses as a souvenir to remember their
RealD movie experience. Since RealD launched as a company, recycling
its glasses has been a goal. When JOURNEY TO THE CENTER OF THE EARTH
opened in July, it began a successful pilot program with several
exhibitor partners, leading to the new comprehensive program. There
are over 30 3D films already announced to be released within the next
three years.

   "Like any successful recycling program, it's about making it easy
for people to recycle," stated Michael V. Lewis, RealD chairman and
CEO. "We appreciate the participation of our exhibitor partners and
know that audiences will appreciate the convenience as well."

   About the Movie

   For super-dog BOLT (voice of JOHN TRAVOLTA), every day is filled
with adventure, danger and intrigue--at least until the cameras stop
rolling. When the star of a hit TV show is accidentally shipped from
his Hollywood soundstage to New York City, he begins his biggest
adventure yet--a cross-country journey through the real world to get
back to his owner and co-star, Penny (voice of MILEY CYRUS). Armed
only with the delusions that all his amazing feats and powers are
real, and the help of two unlikely traveling companions--a jaded,
abandoned housecat named Mittens (voice of SUSIE ESSMAN) and a
TV-obsessed hamster named Rhino (voice of MARK WALTON)--Bolt discovers
he doesn't need superpowers to be a hero. Directed by Disney veterans
Chris Williams and Byron Howard, BOLT is a hilarious, fun-filled,
action-packed animated comedy adventure in Disney Digital 3-D.

   RealD is the global leader in 3D, bringing the most advanced and
enjoyable digital 3D experience to cinemas worldwide. RealD's
next-generation technology, deployed across the world's largest 3D
platform in 27 countries with more than 1,400 installations worldwide,
provides a stunningly realistic viewing experience. The impact of 3D
upon today's moviemaking has been compared to the advent of color film
when once there was only black and white. Beyond cinema, RealD is the
worldwide inventor and provider of key stereoscopic technologies used
in science, manufacturing, marketing, and other industries, with
thirty years of scientific development behind its systems. RealD's
mission-critical 3D visualization technologies are used by
organizations such as NASA, Pfizer, BMW, Boeing and more. For more

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings upgrades and assigns Ratings Outlooks to J.P. Morgan
Commercial Mortgage Finance Corp.'s mortgage pass-through
certificates, series 1999-C7, as follows:

   --$38.1 million class F to 'AA+' from 'AA'; Outlook Positive.

   Additionally, Fitch affirms and assigns Ratings Outlooks to the
following classes:

   --Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$0.6 million class C at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$52.1 million class D at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$12.0 million class E at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

   --$26.0 million class G at 'BB'; Outlook Positive;

   --$4.0 million class H at 'BB-'; Outlook Stable.

   The $23.4 million class NR certificates are not rated by Fitch.
The class A-1, A-2, and B certificates have paid in full.

   The upgrade reflects increased credit enhancement due to scheduled
amortization and loan payoffs since last review of 7.8%. Classes F and
G have been assigned Positive Outlooks due to anticipated future
paydown and increased credit enhancement. The outlooks reflect likely
direction of any rating changes over the next one to two years.

   As of the September 2008 distribution date, the pool's aggregate
balance has been reduced 80.5%, to $156.3 million from $801.4 million
at issuance. Three loans (37.4%), including the largest loan in the
pool, have defeased.

   There are currently three loans (11.5%) in special servicing. One
asset (4.7%) has been in special servicing since 2003 and real
estate-owned since 2004. The loan is secured by 107,052 square feet of
office space in Ridgeland, MS, a Jackson-area suburb. The properties
consist of two office buildings; one of the buildings has recently
undergone significant repairs. The special servicer is working to
lease up vacant space and is marketing the properties for sale. Recent
valuations of the asset indicate losses upon liquidation.

   The second largest specially serviced asset (4.5%) is secured by a
multifamily property located in Okemos, MI. The property is currently
91% occupied, but has suffered from declining market rents and an
increase in concessions. The property is currently for sale with
losses expected upon liquidation.

   Eighteen (79.5%) of the remaining 38 loans in the transaction have
an anticipated repayment date in either 2008 or 2009. These include
the three defeased loans (37.4%). The 35 non-defeased loans have a
year-end 2007 weighted average debt service recovery ratio (DSCR) of
1.42x and a weighted average interest rate of 7.33%.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
Published ratings, criteria and methodologies are available from this
site, at all times. Fitch's code of conduct, confidentiality,
conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance and other

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Discover Financial Services Inc
(DFS.N) and card networks Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc
(MA.N) have settled an antitrust lawsuit, sending shares of the
fourth-biggest U.S. credit card company up over 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In 2004, Discover had filed a lawsuit against MasterCard
and Visa seeking roughly $6 billion in damages, as it contended
the card networks had harmed its business by preventing their
member banks from issuing credit cards for Discover's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa and MasterCard had already agreed to settle a similar
lawsuit with American Express Co (AXP.N) for about $3.9
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa, MasterCard and Discover confirmed in separate
statements the deal and said they were working on the specific
terms of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Terms of the settlement will be available following
completion of the deal," Discover said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement had been previously disclosed to Reuters by a
clerk for Judge Barbara Jones in U.S. District Court. Jury
selection starting on Tuesday for a trial before Jones had been
canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. courts have ruled that efforts by Visa and MasterCard,
the world's two biggest credit card companies, to restrict
banks from working with rivals was anti-competitive and broke
antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa had placed $3 billion into a U.S. litigation escrow
account with net proceeds from its March initial public
offering -- funds that were withheld from its U.S. member
banks' distribution in the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest card network has said the account was
used to pay $2.1 billions to American Express and would be used
to pay for any future settlement in other related litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This settlement is covered by the company's retrospective
responsibility plan, a mechanism for addressing potential
liability in certain Visa litigation," Visa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Discover were up 14.3 percent to $12.12, while
MasterCard was up 3 percent to $178.76. Visa stock was down 0.6
percent to $58.54 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Martha Graybow; editing by Gerald

&lt;p&gt;Next-Generation Firewalls with App-ID(TM) Uniquely Positioned to
   Close the Protection Gap Between Vulnerability Identification and
                               Patching
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Palo Alto Networks today announced that it has joined the
Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) as an inaugural member. As
an inaugural member, Palo Alto Networks will be provided with
vulnerability information in advance of Microsoft's monthly security
update release to offer protection to customers efficiently and
effectively.

   The latest edition of Palo Alto Networks' Application Usage and
Risk Report - which analyzed the traffic of nearly one million users
across 60 enterprises - confirmed the extent to which application
threat activity has evaded enterprise defenses and exploited
vulnerabilities in everything from web browsers to desktop
applications. Palo Alto Networks next-generation firewalls with
patent-pending App-ID(TM) application classification technology
currently track and secure more than 700 traditional and emerging
applications, and this number continues to grow.

   "Keeping up with patches - from validating and testing, to
deployment - is a race against time, and a race that is being won by
hackers," said Steve Mullaney, vice president of marketing for Palo
Alto Networks. "Even more challenging is that to a traditional
security infrastructure, application-level exploits often look like
normal application traffic. Our next-generation firewalls, which
combine timely knowledge and research provided by Microsoft, can
provide the most targeted and comprehensive protection against all
vulnerabilities at the infrastructure and application-level."

   "Our partners share our passion for industry collaboration to
protect a world full of Internet users," said Mark Miller, director of
Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing product management. "No one company
can accomplish this by itself. That is why we are partnering with Palo
Alto Networks to advance and improve security."

   MAPP is a new program that will provide vulnerability information
to security software providers in advance of Microsoft Corp.'s monthly
security update release. By receiving vulnerability information
earlier, security software providers can give customers potential
improvements to their security protection features, such as
third-party intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems
or security software signatures.

   About Palo Alto Networks

   Palo Alto Networks(TM) enables visibility and policy control of
applications and content running on enterprise networks. Based on
innovative App-ID(TM) application classification technology, the Palo

Enterprises can now set and enforce application usage policies to meet
compliance requirements, improve threat mitigation and lower
operational costs. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Discover Financial Services Inc (DFS.N) and card networks Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) have settled an antitrust lawsuit, sending shares of the fourth-biggest U.S. credit card company up over 14 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2004, Discover had filed a lawsuit against MasterCard and Visa seeking roughly $6 billion in damages, as it contended the card networks had harmed its business by preventing their member banks from issuing credit cards for Discover's network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard had already agreed to settle a similar lawsuit with American Express Co (AXP.N) for about $3.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa, MasterCard and Discover confirmed in separate statements the deal and said they were working on the specific terms of the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Terms of the settlement will be available following completion of the deal," Discover said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement had been previously disclosed to Reuters by a clerk for Judge Barbara Jones in U.S. District Court. Jury selection starting on Tuesday for a trial before Jones had been canceled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. courts have ruled that efforts by Visa and MasterCard, the world's two biggest credit card companies, to restrict banks from working with rivals was anti-competitive and broke antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa had placed $3 billion into a U.S. litigation escrow account with net proceeds from its March initial public offering -- funds that were withheld from its U.S. member banks' distribution in the IPO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest card network has said the account was used to pay $2.1 billions to American Express and would be used to pay for any future settlement in other related litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This settlement is covered by the company's retrospective responsibility plan, a mechanism for addressing potential liability in certain Visa litigation," Visa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Discover were up 14.3 percent to $12.12, while MasterCard was up 3 percent to $178.76. Visa stock was down 0.6 percent to $58.54 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Martha Graybow; editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds dateline, details from report)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) lowered
its outlook on the U.S. communications technology sector,
citing a recessionary outlook, but was upbeat on the prospects
for top network equipment makers Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and
Juniper Networks Inc JNPR.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs on Tuesday forecast overall technology
spending will likely continue to slow and perhaps approach zero
growth or turn negative heading into 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given the worsening macro backdrop, we believe quality
companies that are less reliant on troubled financial markets
and have a record of strong profitability should perform well,
as investors are likely to re-engage the markets through higher
quality companies," analyst Simona Jankowski said in a report
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jankowski said Cisco is likely to outgrow its peers during
the downturn as well as in the long term, and that the shares
appeared attractive at 15 times Goldman's estimate for calendar
2009 earnings, compared with the sector's median multiple of
about 19.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also turned "incrementally more positive" on
Cisco's smaller rival Juniper after downgrading the shares and
taking a wait-and-see stance for much of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A majority of Juniper's business comes from service
providers such as phone companies. Spending by such customers
is likely to recover in 2009 ahead of the consumer or business
segments due to demand for higher network capacity, Jankowski
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She added, however, that it was too early to get bullish on
Juniper shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisco shares fell 1 percent to $19.08 in early afternoon
trade while Juniper shares fell 3.5 percent to $18.30. The
Nasdaq composite .IXIC fell 1 percent.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) has asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to deny the request from a group of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK creditors seeking permission to conduct depositions and access JPMorgan documents, according to court filings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A group of unsecured creditors had requested the information, claiming that JPMorgan refused to let Lehman access assets and instead froze Lehman's account, triggering a liquidity crisis that led to the 158-year-old investment bank's collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan objected in a court filing on Monday saying that "the identity and amount of securities being held for liquidation by JPMorgan Chase is extremely confidential market-sensitive information" and asked that the motion be denied, but that the creditors could refile their request in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said the company has been actively involved in the process of helping Lehman unwind, and suggested that the creditors could seek some of the documents they are requesting from Lehman itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate document, Lehman Brothers Holdings asked the request be delayed until the court holds a status conference, saying that a comprehensive process needs to be developed "for the most efficient and expedient investigation of the debtor's acts."

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - At least two brokerages cut their 2009 earnings estimate on U.S. asset managers, including BlackRock Inc (BLK.N), T. Rowe Price Group Inc (TROW.O) and Franklin Resources Inc (BEN.N), citing a fall in assets under management (AUM) in the face of turmoil in global markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs cut its estimate for the group by 26 percent on average, while Morgan Stanley cut its forecast by 27 percent on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Marc Irizarry of Goldman expects the group to start 2009 with AUM that are 15 percent lower than a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect the group to face a much more challenging operating environment highlighted by choppy performance, weak flows and declining margins," Irizarry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rapid pace of AUM deterioration leaves little time for the group to reposition resources, which could lead to a cumulative 2008/2009 operating margin decline of 250 basis points on average, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley analyst Hojoon Lee said the severe recent sell-off in risky assets has reset AUM significantly lower for the group, which is hitting earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spike in volatility and deteriorating macroeconomic conditions have hurt the organic growth outlook for the coming quarters, Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is a risk of further cuts to estimates if equities do not have a sharp rally, Lee said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Amiteshwar Singh in Bangalore; Editing by Pratish Narayanan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SHANGHAI, CHINA and ARMONK, NY, Oct 14 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the opening of a new research facility in
Shanghai that will provide greater accessibility for clients to tap into
IBM Research expertise and greater opportunities for collaboration with
universities and other research institutions in China.

    The new facility is an extension of the IBM China Research Laboratory --
one of IBM's eight research labs worldwide focused on delivering
high-value technological innovations that help solve clients' most
challenging business and technology problems. The IBM China Research
Laboratory was established in Beijing in 1995.

    "The very nature of research is changing. It is more open, more global and
more collaborative," said Dr. John E. Kelly III, IBM senior vice president
and director of IBM Research. "The establishment of IBM Research in
Shanghai reflects both the rich pool of science and engineering talent in
China as well as our continued commitment to expand our collaboration with
Chinese enterprises and academic institutions."

    The IBM China Research Lab in Shanghai will focus primarily on innovative
research areas such as Information Analytics, Web Delivered Service
Computing, Cloud Computing and Stream Computing. Cloud computing, for
example, is emerging as a significant shift as today's organizations, no
matter what size, are facing extreme data overload and skyrocketing energy
costs. IBM Research's work in this area includes an exploratory system
which monitors comprehensive factors such as application workload,
resource utilization and power consumption to intelligently schedule the
workload migration and save unnecessary power consumption.

    The lab also will focus on integrating Service Science, Management and
Engineering (SSME) into the Chinese University Curriculum, recognizing the
growing importance of services in the global economy. SSME is a new
academic discipline designed by IBM to develop the skills required in an
increasingly services-based global economy, and brings together computer
science, operations research, industrial engineering, business strategy,
management sciences, social and cognitive sciences, and legal sciences to
develop the skills required in services-led organizations.

    "Our extension in Shanghai adds to the significant research and
development presence in China and increases China's position as an
innovation hub for IBM," said Dr. Thomas Li, director of IBM's China
Research Laboratory. "IBM's China Research Lab helps clients innovate,
helps to cultivate local talent and is an integral part of the IBM
Research network that brings technological innovation to clients
globally."

to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said shares of Aon and Marsh  McLennan were

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that industry analyst firm IDC has ranked
IBM the worldwide leader in the application management services (AMS)
market over Accenture, EDS and all Indian-based firms based on combined
bundled and discrete services revenue in 2007.(1)

    According to IDC estimates, IBM held a significant combined lead in
application management services reflecting the company's historical growth
and flexibility in evolving an application management practice that
supports discrete and embedded application management solutions.

    "As clients seek higher-value solutions from services partners they
increasingly require flexibility in the way they contract for AMS
services, either combined with traditional systems integration or
strategic outsourcing, or as an optimized, standalone agreement," said
Colleen Arnold, general manager, Global Application Services, IBM Global
Business Services. "Through our long-term investments in repeatable
assets and the world's most sophisticated global delivery network, IBM is
able to offer clients the greatest depth of capabilities across any
number of industries, any where in the world."

    In addition to flexible capabilities, growth in IBM's AMS offerings is
driven by the company's Business Application Modernization, accelerating
SOA adoption and reducing transformation costs, time and resources. By
optimizing core applications around SOA, clients can improve business
model readiness by componentizing their businesses to more quickly
respond to emerging market opportunities.

    In its groundbreaking study, IDC determined that the applications
management services market is evolving as customers pursue greater
Applications Outsourcing efficiencies while pushing for higher value
services that integrate reusable frameworks for application, business
process and quality assurance modernization. IDC explains that "IBM, for
example, has clearly built up a robust AMS practice, addressing either
discrete or integrated solutions based on customer needs. While
historically the bundled strategy may have dominated its approach, the
discrete approach is growing as a significant portion of its full service
portfolio."

&lt;p&gt;  LIMA, PERU, Oct 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today that Backus-Sabmiller, Peru's largest
beer company, has acquired a new platform based on IBM servers and
storage.

    Backus-Sabmiller needed to update its server platform, and has adopted
state-of-the-art technology from IBM. After an initial evaluation, IBM's
offering was the solution that best met the company's need to strengthen
its processing capacity. The client needed to rethink its infrastructure
in order to optimize its cost efficiency, provide scalability for its
corporate growth plans, and guarantee the high availability of its
business operations.

    The solution is based on 35 BladeCenter servers, 2 System x3755 servers, 2
System Storage DS4800 devices and 5 TS3200 libraries, which combined
offered the client the opportunity to upgrade its IT infrastructure, with
the following value added: flexibility, adaptable to changing workloads;
simple administration, focused on providing processing, disk and tape
resources on demand; operational continuity enabled by a remote
contingency scheme and optimum response time in user applications. DS4800
is the high-end device in the DS4000 family of storage disk systems, and
is well-known in the market as having one of the best price/performance
ratios, combined with advanced compatibility and availability.

    Backus-Sabmiller has gained a competitive advantage with the acquisition
of an IBM BladeCenter that uses up to 50 percent less floor space and up
to 35 percent less energy than competitor rack servers without sacrificing
performance. Blades are the next-generation solution, promising
improvements across the board. IBM BladeCenter's innovative, open design
offers a true alternative to today's sprawling racks and overheated server
rooms.

    "IBM's commitment to the process with Backus and, particularly, its
efforts, were the reasons why we selected it. The leading-edge technology
solution we have acquired from IBM was aimed at strengthening our
processing capacity, which is a non-core area for Backus," said Gustavo
Noriega, CIO de Backus-Sabmiller.

    Rafael Sanchez, General Manager, IBM Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador, Uruguay &amp;
Paraguay, commented, "We thank Backus-Sabmiller for its trust in IBM Peru.
We are confident that the solution delivered will meet the company's
future growth needs, maintaining and improving availability and processing
capacity to do business with its suppliers and customers. Today,
Backus-Sabmiller is preparing a flexible and agile system of operational
capacity that will enable it to continuously improve its productivity and
cut down its administrative costs."

&lt;p&gt;  QUITO, ECUADOR, Oct 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Banco de Guayaquil, the second
largest financial institution in all of Ecuador, has gone live with a new
IBM infrastructure of servers, storage and software as means to improve
data center efficiency and processing capability at its two data centers.

    Banco de Guayaquil replaced its hardware at both the production and
back-up sites with two IBM z9 mainframes, and as a result, increased its
processing capacity by 35 percent. New software including z/VSE, storage
hardware including the DS8100 as well as services and support were
included in the implementation.

    The new infrastructure went live on September 29th of the present year.

    Banco de Guayaquil was looking to improve its online environment to
support the bank's business growth, keeping high quality and security
standards. The bank was also structuring new projects, like "Banco del
Barrio" (Neighborhood Bank), targeted at retailers. The challenge was to
install a service point at a non-banking store, such as pharmacies,
stores, telephone booths, etc. located in urban and rural areas that
attract many visitors. This means moving the bank closer to the
neighborhood, to places where there is no banking presence, thus
fostering the development of banking services in the country.

    "Banco de Guayaquil is a great example of how leading financial
institutions are looking at the IBM mainframe as the foundation for a new
enterprise infrastructure," said Mauricio Arias, General Manager IBM
Ecuador. "We're pleased that Banco de Guayaquil is now able to provide the
services and offerings they need for their customers, based on the
reliability of the IBM mainframe. We look forward to a long relationship."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Deploys Foundry Networks NetIron MLX Routers At Enterprise Engineering
Center

SANTA CLARA, Calif., Oct. 14, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Foundry Networks(r), Inc.
(Nasdaq:FDRY), a performance and total solutions leader for end-to-end switching
and routing, today announced Microsoft's selection of Foundry(r) Networks'
NetIron(r) MLX Series 10 gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) IPv4/IPv6 MPLS routers for its
Enterprise Engineering Center (http://www.microsoft.com/EEC), a state-of-the-art
proving ground for the world's most complex computing environments based in
Redmond, Wash. The Microsoft EEC can replicate virtually any production
environment for customers to gain a clear view of how Microsoft's pre-release
products will perform in their home environments prior to installation.

Microsoft's objective for the EEC was to deploy a network that provides internal
and external customers access to resources located within the EEC and labs
connected to its new 10 gigabit campus area network (CAN). The center's
operators demanded a solution that would scale to meet escalating performance
requirements, but would be flexible enough to allow staff to reconfigure the
network regularly to meet customer needs. With this at top of mind, Microsoft
selected Foundry's NetIron MLX-16 routers for its core and the NetIron MLX-4
routers in additional labs to allow for Virtual Private LAN Services (VPLS)
across a 10 gigabit connection. Today, the EEC can create a VPLS instance for
each customer offering customers improved traffic separation. With the new
Foundry Networks solution installed, the EEC also implemented Q-in-Q in
conjunction with VPLS to achieve a hierarchical design to meet its goals.

"We needed a network infrastructure that would allow us to utilize the same
network for multiple customers without compromising the security or performance
of the network," said John Cressey, lead program manager for Microsoft's EEC.
"However, we also wanted a solution that would let us better realize the
potential for Microsoft products. Scalability and capacity were also critical
criteria. Ultimately, we needed the ability to expand as EEC customer needs
require."

By leveraging Foundry routers, the EEC has the traffic separation, performance
and future expansion capacity it needs with a standards-based solution, as well
as improved utilization of the network.

"Foundry provided a solution with the greatest value, from its ability to scale
to getting the maximum out of our investment," concluded Cressey. "Today, we
have a network capable of handling the cutting edge converged applications our
customers use as well as a network that's easy to manage, delivers wire-speed
performance and offers a rich feature set to provide the EEC with greater
versatility."

Built with Foundry's state-of-the-art, fifth-generation, network processor-based
architecture and Terabit-scale switch fabrics, the Foundry NetIron MLX Series
routers give the network a rich set of high-performance IPv4, IPv6, MPLS, and
Multi-VRF capabilities as well as advanced Layer 2 switching capabilities.
Designed to enable reliable converged infrastructures and support
mission-critical applications, the NetIron MLX Series features an advanced N+1
redundant switch fabric architecture for very high availability. This
architecture ensures that the system continues to operate at peak performance
even in the case of a switch fabric card failure. The NetIron's 10 gigabit fiber
ports terminate to racks hosting the servers, allowing staff to allocate
resources per rack for each customer.

"The Microsoft EEC is known worldwide as the networking test-bed for Microsoft's
enterprise software solutions," said Benjamin Taft, Foundry's vice president of
corporate marketing and alliances. "Microsoft's selection of Foundry's
award-winning NetIron MLX Series routers for the EEC allows customers to ensure
their network infrastructure interoperates with our routing platform and
Microsoft's solutions."

    Pfizer to Host Investor Meeting on October 28th to Review Data
               from Key Pain and Inflammation Compounds
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer will highlight several presentations and posters across a
spectrum of pain and inflammatory conditions at the American College
of Rheumatology (ACR) annual meeting in San Francisco from October 25
to 29, 2008. Late-breaking abstracts for Pfizer's investigational
JAK-inhibitor CP-690,550 and Celebrex (celecoxib capsules) will be
presented at the meeting.

   Pfizer will also host an investor briefing during ACR to review
data from three pipeline candidates on Tuesday, October 28 at 6:00
p.m. Pacific Time.

   "At least half of all patients suffering from pain associated with
arthritis, fibromyalgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy do not
receive sufficient relief from existing therapies," said Dr. Ken
Verburg, development head of Pfizer's Pain Portfolio. "Pfizer has a
long history in bringing innovative therapies to patients to help
manage these conditions, such as Celebrex and Lyrica (pregabalin)
Capsules CV, and we continue to expand our pain franchise through
significant R investment in this key 'invest to win' therapeutic
area with 12 compounds currently in clinical development."

   Pfizer will present data on a number of compounds that represent
potential new mechanisms targeting pain and inflammation. These
include a new molecule designed to target nerve growth factor, a key
pain mediator; a JAK-inhibitor that interferes with the intracellular
messenger signaling of a range of inflammatory cytokines to reduce the
disease process in rheumatoid arthritis; and a highly selective
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor which upregulates the activity of
this important neurotransmitter.

   "Arthritis is one of the most prevalent chronic health problems
and the leading cause of disability among Americans over the age of
15. There still remains significant need for new medications to
address the pain, disability and underlying disease progression of
inflammatory diseases," said Dr. Ethan Weiner, development head for
Inflammation at Pfizer. "We are very excited to present data on
CP-690,550, our JAK-inhibitor, and lead compound in development for
rheumatoid arthritis, as well as tanezumab, a compound that may offer
a novel way of treating osteoarthritis pain at the upcoming ACR
meeting."

   Data on Pfizer's investigational and in-line compounds targeting
pain associated with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and
fibromyalgia to be presented at the meeting include:

   Rheumatoid Arthritis

   --  CP-690,550: Phase 2b data evaluating the activity of Pfizer's
        small molecule JAK-inhibitor, CP-690,550 in combination with
        methotrexate in patients with rheumatoid arthritis will be in
        a late-breaking presentation by Dr. Joel Kremer, professor of
        medicine and head of rheumatology, Albany Medical College on
        Tuesday, October 28.

   --  CP-690,550: Phase 2 data evaluating the tolerability and

&lt;p&gt;C2C email management strength now available for file archiving
SPRINGFIELD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
C2C, a leading provider of email, file and messaging management
solutions, today announced that it is extending the benefits of its
Archive One solution to provide automated, policy-based record
retention, discovery, search and disposition for Microsoft Windows
file systems.

   Archive One for Files offers customers the benefits of removing
old files, large files, or particular types of files in order to
reduce cost, improve performance, retention management, optimize
capacity usage, and improve backup windows on primary storage devices.

   The solution can be installed alongside the email archiving and
Microsoft SharePoint archiving automated data management solutions
provided by C2C. The data can all be stored in a single repository, or
be separated by recognition of the data type, or even by logical
departmental units (such as finance or human resources) each with its
own repository regardless of the type of data.

   "Extending the Archive One platform to Windows file systems is a
huge added value for our customers, enabling them to perform
comprehensive file management with a minimal learning curve by
leveraging the same familiar user interface," said Dave Hunt, CEO at
C2C. "This extension of Archive One brings commonality to the
management of data across the enterprise for email messages,
documents, and other data so that it remains accessible and auditable
throughout the data lifecycle."

   Archive One for Files was developed to provide flexible automated
data management, building on C2C's foundation of data searching and
intelligent actions to carry out mass actions across different types
of data to assist in compliance, legal discovery and storage capacity
management. Like other C2C solutions, administrators do not need to
archive data before applying a command, such as copy, move, delete,
classify, compress, archive, or un-archive. Archive One is capable of
data processing speeds of one million messages per hour.

   "ESG research suggests that companies will archive over 80,000
petabytes of file data in the next three years, and customers will
need sophisticated tools to manage this along with all of the
incremental email data being retained for compliance, legal and
business reference purposes," said Brian Babineau, senior analyst at
Enterprise Strategy Group. "This is good news for enterprises using
Archive One for email to reduce risk, optimize integrity and minimize
compliance issues, because they can now achieve the same goals for
files with an application they are already comfortable using. At the
same time, Microsoft users who are looking for an all-in-one archiving
and management platform will find Archive One has much to recommend
it."

   About C2C

   C2C offers unsurpassed automated data management solutions, which
reduce risk, optimize performance and minimize compliance issues for
over three million users at more than 2,000 organizations worldwide.
Based on its in-depth understanding of message management, C2C

&lt;p&gt;New Data across Pfizer's Pain and Inflammation Portfolio to Be Presented at Upcoming ACR Meeting

 Data from Development Programs in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis Pain,
                        and Fibromyalgia to be Presented

Pfizer to Host Investor Meeting on October 28th to Review Data from Key Pain and
                             Inflammation Compounds
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer will highlight several presentations and posters across a spectrum of
pain and inflammatory conditions at the American College of Rheumatology (ACR)
annual meeting in San Francisco from October 25 to 29, 2008. Late-breaking
abstracts for Pfizer's investigational JAK-inhibitor CP-690,550 and Celebrex
(celecoxib capsules) will be presented at the meeting.

Pfizer will also host an investor briefing during ACR to review data from three
pipeline candidates on Tuesday, October 28 at 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time.

"At least half of all patients suffering from pain associated with arthritis,
fibromyalgia and diabetic peripheral neuropathy do not receive sufficient relief
from existing therapies," said Dr. Ken Verburg, development head of Pfizer's
Pain Portfolio. "Pfizer has a long history in bringing innovative therapies to
patients to help manage these conditions, such as Celebrex and Lyrica
(pregabalin) Capsules CV, and we continue to expand our pain franchise through
significant R investment in this key 'invest to win' therapeutic area with 12
compounds currently in clinical development."

Pfizer will present data on a number of compounds that represent potential new
mechanisms targeting pain and inflammation. These include a new molecule
designed to target nerve growth factor, a key pain mediator; a JAK-inhibitor
that interferes with the intracellular messenger signaling of a range of
inflammatory cytokines to reduce the disease process in rheumatoid arthritis;
and a highly selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor which upregulates the
activity of this important neurotransmitter.

"Arthritis is one of the most prevalent chronic health problems and the leading
cause of disability among Americans over the age of 15. There still remains
significant need for new medications to address the pain, disability and
underlying disease progression of inflammatory diseases," said Dr. Ethan Weiner,
development head for Inflammation at Pfizer. "We are very excited to present
data on CP-690,550, our JAK-inhibitor, and lead compound in development for
rheumatoid arthritis, as well as tanezumab, a compound that may offer a novel
way of treating osteoarthritis pain at the upcoming ACR meeting."

Data on Pfizer's investigational and in-line compounds targeting pain associated
with rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis and fibromyalgia to be presented at
the meeting include:

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 14 (Reuters) - JP Morgan raised its rating on Western
Union (WU.N) to "overweight" from "neutral," saying the
company's business model was more defensive than its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said Western Union's money transfer service
was mainly used by lower income individuals and it was less
dependent on discretionary spending and consumer spending on
credit -- two factors that have pressured the stocks of payment
processing companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also said the market was over estimating the
earnings risk of Europe and the U.S. slowing further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, JP Morgan cut its fiscal 2008 earnings estimate by
2 cents to $1.31 a share, saying the company will be hurt by
the recent rise in U.S. dollar and a weaker global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While WU is exposed to rising unemployment, we believe
worldwide demand for low-cost labor plus ongoing share gains by
Western Union provides a buffer even in a global recession,"
analyst Tien-tsin Huang said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huang added that worldwide remittance growth has been
resilient posting positive growth in 31 years out of the last
34 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We also like Western Unions's revenue diversity as 63
percent of revenue are derived outside the U.S., with no
country other than Mexico accounting for more than 5 percent,"
the note said.

&lt;p&gt;Sustainability Reporting Leaders Including Danone, Vodafone, Coca-Cola and Novo Nordisk Discuss Ways to Improve Corporate Transparency and Accountability

   Over 25 leading corporate sustainability reporters will share
their best practice at the corporate responsibility reporting and
communications summit on 25 - 26 November in London.
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
In the current economic climate, stakeholders are putting
increasing pressure on companies to be transparent and accountable in
how they report on social and environmental issues.

   While this is already widely accepted - the number of CR reports
published per year has increased by a whopping 10 000 % in the past 10
years - the challenge is now to produce the best possible report.

   But how do the leaders manage to deliver an effective and thorough
report, whilst making sure that their stakeholders actually read it?

   The CR Reporting &amp; Communications Summit gathers CSR leaders
including Alliance Boots, Fortis, Telefonica and Nestle to address
this particular challenge, as well as topics ranging from materiality
and multi-stakeholder audiences to assurance and employee engagement -
as defined by Ethical Corp research with CSR managers.

   A CR report is a recognized risk management tool in a company's
reputation, but it's also a source of financial opportunities, as GRI
Chief Executive Ernst Ligteringen, a speaker at the summit, explains:
"Transparent, trusted information that yields good investment
decisions offers a strong opportunity for 21st Century companies".

   After numerous conversations with CSR managers, Ethical Corp has
found that one of their toughest challenges is actually to justify CR
reporting - and CR in general - to their board management.

   In response to this, the second day of the summit opens with a
plenary session focusing on the value of CR reports, led by Novo
Nordisk, The Guardian newspaper and Fortis.

   Other speakers include Tata Group, Bayer AG, GlaxoSmithKline,
Vodafone, Danone, Shell and many more.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and PARIS, Oct 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the commencement of cash tender offers in
France and the United States, by CITLOI S.A.S., a wholly-owned subsidiary
of IBM, for all outstanding shares (including shares represented by
American Depository Shares ("ADSs")) and warrants of ILOG (NASDAQ: ILOG),
(PARIS: ILO).

    The cash tender offer price for the shares is EUR 10 per ordinary share
and the price for the ADSs is the U.S. dollar equivalent of EUR 10, based
on the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate as of the settlement of the tender
offers(1). The French offer is currently expected to close on November 17,
2008 and the U.S. offer is currently expected to expire at 12:00 noon EST,
on November 17, 2008.

    The proposed acquisition, announced on July 28, 2008, has been cleared per
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvement Act requirements by the US
antitrust authorities and has been authorized by the French Minister of
Economy. The offers are subject to the authorization of the European
antitrust authorities and to the condition that, following the expiration
of the offers, CITLOI will have acquired the right to hold shares
(including ADSs) and warrants representing at least 66.67 percent of
ILOG's share capital and voting rights (on a fully-diluted basis).

    The board of directors of ILOG has unanimously approved the offers. Also,
as previously announced, IBM has received commitments from certain ILOG
shareholders to tender their shares in the offers. These commitments
together represent approximately 10 percent of ILOG's issued share
capital. The Board of Directors of INRIA has ratified the undertaking of
INRIA to tender its shares.

    ILOG technologies will add significant capability across IBM's entire
software platform. In addition to bolstering IBM's existing rules
management offerings, ILOG products are expected to extend IBM into new
markets through powerful yet easy-to-use tools in business rules,
optimization, visualization, and supply chain management. ILOG products
will help customers improve the management of business decisions.

    ILOG offers tools and technologies for business managers, analysts,
architects, developers and operations research professionals to use as
they analyze, plan, track and improve business processes. Today, hundreds
of large enterprises use ILOG technologies to automate decisions, allocate
scarce resources and to build smart interfaces into their business
processes. Additionally, scientists and mathematicians from hundreds of
universities use ILOG products for advanced research, design, and
analysis.

    For example, a business rule might be applied to elevate a premier
customer to the front of a phone queue as part of a customer service
process. ILOG's Business Rule Management System provides users with tools
that allow greater control over the criteria that determine how and when
to route those premier customers. As such, businesses can accelerate the
process of initiating policy changes that may be driven by market trends
or competitive activity to ensure customer satisfaction is maintained.

    If completed, the acquisition of ILOG will improve IBM's BPM and SOA
position by providing customers a full set of rule management tools for
information and application lifecycle management across a comprehensive
platform including IBM's leading WebSphere application development and
management platform.

    (1) The cash tender offer prices for the warrants are EUR 0.50 per 2003 n
degrees1 warrants, 2003 n degrees2 warrants and 2005 warrants; EUR 0.65
per 2004 warrants; EUR 0.83 per 2006 warrants and EUR 1.93 per 2007
warrants.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI Oct 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it has cut
India's Oil  Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC.BO) to sell from neutral
and added it to its Asia Pacific conviction sell list on a
lower forecast for oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It also cut the 12-month target price on the country's top
oil and gas producer to 760 rupees from 1,000 rupees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs said it has lowered its oil price forecasts
for full-year 2009 to $97 per barrel from $113 earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We note that ONGC has been a constant beneficiary of high
oil prices, albeit a weak one, although popular street
perception is that ONGC benefits from low oil prices," Goldman
Sachs said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ONGC shares, which have fallen about 27 percent so far this
year, were trading down 1.5 percent at 901.90 rupees on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; India has a government-controlled fuel price regime, under
which state-run upstream companies such as ONGC are forced to
grant subsidies to state-owned oil marketing companies, which
are made to sell products at mandated discounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the note to its clients released earlier on Tuesday,
Goldman also attributed the downgrade to ONGC's poor production
growth profile, including a likely production decline in fiscal
year 2009, and the company's expensive valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm said it cut ONGC's consolidated fiscal years 2009
and 2010 earnings by 16-29 percent, on account of lower oil
prices and lower volumes, even as lower forecasts for the
Indian rupee against the U.S. dollar have lent some support to
its earnings.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) on Monday applied
to New York state's banking department to become a "full
service state-chartered bank," Gov David Patterson said, saying
this helps cement New York's position as a financial capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which would be one of the 10 largest U.S. banks
with $150 billion in assets, wants to turn a New York-chartered
trust it has had since 1990 into a full service New York bank
with trust powers, under the name Goldman Sachs Bank USA, the
Democratic governor said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's Utah-based industrial loan company would be
merged with the New York trust and Goldman would keep a Utah
branch, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "New York is the hub for international finance and
Goldman's decision today builds on a strong foundation,"
Paterson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman was not immediately available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nor was a spokesmen for Morgan Stanley (MS.N). Like
Goldman, Morgan Stanley last month got federal regulators to
let it transform into a commercial bank holding company, a
strategy that lets both of the investment bank rivals tap
federally insured deposits though they must accept more
oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Joan Gralla; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) may emerge as long-term winners in the quake that has shaken up U.S. banks. Their staying power will be tested by their ability to complete their high-risk mergers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's $1.9 billion purchase of Washington Mutual Inc's WAMUQ.PK banking units and Wells Fargo's planned purchase of Wachovia Corp WB.N, originally valued at $15.1 billion, add large, powerful retail branch networks to what were already two of the biggest banks in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both purchase prices are only a small fraction of what the targets were once worth and reflected evaporating investor confidence that Wachovia and Washington Mutual would have the time and capital to combat soaring mortgage losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan and Wells Fargo quarterly results topped forecasts on Wednesday, their continued prosperity may be at risk as the economy slides into what some expect will be a deep recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Trying to integrate companies in the midst of a difficult operating environment is challenging, to say the least," said Chris Hagedorn, who helps invest $21.4 billion at Fifth Third Asset Management in Cincinnati. "These companies have done big integrations in the past and I would give them the benefit of the doubt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has had three large mergers in recent years: Chase Manhattan Corp's 2000 purchase of JP Morgan  Co, the 2004 purchase of Bank One Corp and May's rescue of Bear Stearns Cos. Wells Fargo has not had one since 1998, when Norwest Corp bought the old Wells Fargo and took its name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the success of the Washington Mutual and Wachovia takeovers depends on their acquirers' abilities to live up to their past records at merger integration and a presumption they properly assessed credit risks. JPMorgan is writing down $31 billion for Washington Mutual loans, while Wells Fargo expects to write off $74 billion from Wachovia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ECONOMY SAGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But economic conditions are not good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We necessarily need to be prepared for a bad environment," JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call. He later added: "If you are not fearful, you're crazy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins said it is a "good working assumption" that the economy is in recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The steps taken by the government will help over time and we'll see what happens," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Moroney, chief investment officer of Horizon Investment Services LLC in Hammond, Indiana, said JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are "taking on huge risks, but getting huge opportunities. It depends on how bad mortgages, car loans and credit cards are going to get. There are also integration issues: getting computers to work, getting people to work together. We've seen those things go awry at other banks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THE GOOD AND THE BAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Wachovia itself has seen both sides of the coin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before buying the former Wachovia in 2001 and taking its name, First Union Corp lost thousands of customers when it botched the takeover of Philadelphia's CoreStates Financial. It also lost $2 billion when it shut down Money Store, a lender to people with poor credit histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ken Thompson, the former chief executive of First Union and later Wachovia, at first shed that bank's reputation for poor integrations, smoothly absorbing the old Wachovia, as well as Alabama's SouthTrust Corp, a 2004 purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he shattered that progress with a $24.2 billion purchase of California mortgage lender Golden West Financial Corp in October 2006, just as the housing market was about to crash. Many analysts at first thought Wachovia overpaid, although even they did not see the scope of the eventual deterioration at Golden West, once regarded as a conservative lender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual, meanwhile, last month became the largest U.S. bank ever to fail, following rapid expansion into subprime mortgages, home equity loans and option adjustable-rate mortgages, the latter also a Golden West specialty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh told analysts the integration of Washington Mutual, acquired three weeks ago, is "progressing well." He also said Washington Mutual -- now backed by JPMorgan -- has staunched the deposit outflows that prompted regulators to seize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Atkins said a key feature of the Wachovia takeover "is to combine our sales and cross-sell culture with Wachovia's service culture." Wells Fargo emphasizes selling several products to each customer, while Wachovia usually ranks near the top of independent customer satisfaction surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wells Fargo is a company known for going slow in integrating deals and, if it is smart, will move quickly to identify and retain much of Wachovia's key talent," wrote Kevin Fitzsimmons, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill  Partners LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay and Dan Wilchins; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE Oct 16 (Reuters) - Australian soft drinks group
Coca-Cola Amatil (CCL.AX) reaffirmed it expects around 7
percent earnings growth in the second half after a strong third
quarter, but warned the outlook could change if consumer demand
slips in November and December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also said on Thursday it had lined up debt facilities to
cover all its refinancing needs for this year and next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Notwithstanding the volatile market conditions, CCA has
experienced solid trading in the third quarter," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Australia, it said earnings and volumes were in line
with expectations following a very strong third quarter last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is benefitting from its major competitors Cadbury
Schweppes CBRY.L and Frucor, owned by Danone (DANO.PA), being
distracted by sale processes, it said in a slide presentation
for analysts visiting its New Zealand operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In New Zealand, earnings growth had slowed from a very
strong first half, as the country slid into a recession, while
in Indonesia Amatil had very strong volume and earnings growth
in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Amatil expects its costs per case to rise by just
over 3 percent this year, based on constant currency, but aims
to recover those increases from customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amatil shares have fallen 15 percent so far this year, less
than half the fall in the broader market as it is seen as a
defensive stock.

Fargo  Co (WFC.N) posted better-than-expected earnings on
Wednesday despite higher credit losses, underlining their
standing as among the strongest big banks in the battered U.S.
financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The banks are the first major U.S. lenders to report
results for the third quarter, a difficult period for banks
that grew dire in late September as credit markets seized up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you are not fearful, you're crazy," JPMorgan Chief
Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though quarterly profit fell 84 percent at JPMorgan and 25
percent at Wells Fargo, the banks' shares fell less than rivals
as investors were heartened that tighter credit and a souring
economy didn't hurt results more. Both banks added deposits as
nervous customers fled weaker rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you were a bull, the results confirm these companies
will be survivors," said Richard Moroney, chief investment
officer of Horizon Investment Services LLC in Hammond, Indiana.
"They both had major deterioration in credit, and that's hardly
a pretty picture, but results didn't seem that bad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both banks are making big bets on the economic outlook with
acquisitions of major lenders felled by risky home loans.
JPMorgan last month bought Washington Mutual Inc's WAMUQ.PK
bank units for $1.9 billion, and Wells Fargo is buying Wachovia
Corp WB.N in a takeover originally valued at $15.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite being well capitalized, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo
were among the initial nine lenders to get capital injections
this week from U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's $250
billion plan to restore confidence in the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the New York Stock Exchange, JPMorgan closed down $2.22,
or 5.5 percent, at $38.49, while Wells Fargo fell 17 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $33.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The KBW Bank Index .BKX, which includes both banks, slid
7.2 percent. Broader indexes fell even more after bleak data on
U.S. retail sales and overall economic activity, and comments
by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that the economy faces
a significant threat, fanned fears of a recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMORGAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quarterly profit at New York-based JPMorgan fell to $527
million, or 11 cents per share, from $3.37 billion, or 97
cents, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding items, the bank had a loss of 6 cents per share,
compared with the average analyst forecast for a loss of 29
cents, Reuters Estimates said. Net revenue fell 9 percent to
$14.74 billion, topping the average $14.62 billion forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan nearly tripled the amount it set aside for credit
losses, to $6.66 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wrote off $3.6 billion for mortgage debt and leveraged
loans in its investment bank, lost $642 million on Fannie Mae
FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N preferred stock, and took a
$248 million charge to buy back auction-rate securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition of Washington Mutual, once the largest U.S.
savings and loan, gave Dimon some 5,400 branches and fulfilled
his longtime goal of expanding to the western United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With $2.25 trillion of assets, JPMorgan may have surpassed
Citigroup Inc (C.N) to become the largest U.S. bank for now.
Citigroup reports quarterly results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said, though, that quarterly mortgage and home
equity losses could top $1.5 billion early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank is absorbing an estimated $31 billion of loan
losses from Washington Mutual, and Dimon said overall earnings
might be reduced over the next few quarters. "We necessarily
need to be prepared for a bad environment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WELLS FARGO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, profit dropped to $1.64
billion, or 49 cents per share, from $2.17 billion, or 64
cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent to $10.38
billion, while expenses fell 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average expected profit of 34 cents per share
on revenue of $11.08 billion. Results included $646 million of
charges related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock
and to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEHMQ.PK bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's largest investor is Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo set aside $2.5 billion for credit losses, and
net charge-offs more than doubled to $2 billion. It expects
home equity loan losses to be higher than normal until housing
prices stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The economy is weak and maybe is in a recession," Chief
Financial Officer Howard Atkins said in an interview. "Having
said that, the steps taken by the government will help over
time, and we'll see what happens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo was able to wrest Wachovia from the arms of
Citigroup largely because it never dove deeply into the risky
mortgages and exotic debt that strangled Wachovia, Washington
Mutual and IndyMac Bancorp Inc IDMC.PK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The merger is expected to close this quarter and create the
fourth-largest U.S. bank, with more than $1.4 trillion of
assets and about 6,600 branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Paramus, New Jersey's Hudson City Bancorp Inc
(HCBK.O) said third-quarter profit rose 64 percent to $121.9
million, or 25 cents per share, from $74.4 million, or 15
cents, a year earlier, as its home lending business thrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expected profit of 24 cents per share, and Hudson
City shares closed up 63 cents, or 3.9 percent, at $16.70 on
the Nasdaq. Hudson City will become the nation's largest thrift
following the expected sale of Sovereign Bancorp Inc SOV.N to
Spain's Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Joseph A. Giannone and Ellis

Citigroup reports quarterly results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said, though, that quarterly mortgage and home equity losses could top $1.5 billion early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is absorbing an estimated $31 billion of loan losses from Washington Mutual, and Dimon said overall earnings might be reduced over the next few quarters. "We necessarily need to be prepared for a bad environment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WELLS FARGO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, profit dropped to $1.64 billion, or 49 cents per share, from $2.17 billion, or 64 cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent to $10.38 billion, while expenses fell 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average expected profit of 34 cents per share on revenue of $11.08 billion. Results included $646 million of charges related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock and to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEHMQ.PK bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's largest investor is Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo set aside $2.5 billion for credit losses, and net charge-offs more than doubled to $2 billion. It expects home equity loan losses to be higher than normal until housing prices stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The economy is weak and maybe is in a recession," Chief Financial Officer Howard Atkins said in an interview. "Having said that, the steps taken by the government will help over time, and we'll see what happens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo was able to wrest Wachovia from the arms of Citigroup largely because it never dove deeply into the risky mortgages and exotic debt that strangled Wachovia, Washington Mutual and IndyMac Bancorp Inc IDMC.PK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The merger is expected to close this quarter and create the fourth-largest U.S. bank, with more than $1.4 trillion of assets and about 6,600 branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Paramus, New Jersey's Hudson City Bancorp Inc (HCBK.O) said third-quarter profit rose 64 percent to $121.9 million, or 25 cents per share, from $74.4 million, or 15 cents, a year earlier, as its home lending business thrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expected profit of 24 cents per share, and Hudson City shares closed up 63 cents, or 3.9 percent, at $16.70 on the Nasdaq. Hudson City will become the nation's largest thrift following the expected sale of Sovereign Bancorp Inc SOV.N to Spain's Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt; * Q3 EPS of 83 cents excl items tops view of 77 cents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Revenue up 9 pct; global volume up 5 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Coke shares end up 1.1 pct, Pepsi down 5.8 pct
 (Recasts to compare with Pepsi results, adds analysts)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Martinne Geller&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - As the cola wars spread to
other battlegrounds, Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) has come out ahead of
PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N), proving it can steal market share and grow
even as a financial crisis threatens the global economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While analysts recommend buying both stocks as part of a
defensive strategy during tumultuous times, third-quarter
results this week show that Coke's global penetration and
strong brands may do more to help it weather a spending
downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I like both companies. I just prefer Coca-Cola for their
international exposure and for not having the snack business,"
said Standard  Poor's beverage analyst Esther Kwon, who has a
"buy" rating on Pepsi and a "strong buy" rating on Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I just think right now Coke's portfolio and their model
works a little bit better than Pepsi's," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke posted a better-than-expected 14 percent rise in
quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by strong international
demand that offset declining sales at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results sent its shares up as much as 8.2 percent
before the market turned sharply lower on recession fears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A day earlier, Pepsi posted a disappointing profit and cut
its full-year forecast, saying U.S. consumers were drinking
more water from the kitchen tap to save money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke and Pepsi reported similarly weak results in North
America, where drink sales by volume fell as budget-conscious
consumers ate out less and made fewer trips to gas stations and
restaurants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main difference, according to Edward Jones analyst Jack
Russo, was that Coke's international reach gave it a bigger
cushion against the U.S. slowdown. Coke itself cited growth in
markets like China and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke "really relied upon the international platform that
they have and they are a little further along on that platform
versus Pepsi, especially on the beverage side," said Russo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He has a "buy" rating on both, due in part to the
companies' historically low valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUARTERLY SURPRISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pepsi, which also sells Frito-Lay snacks and Quaker
Oatmeal, derives less than half its total sales from outside
North America, versus more than 70 percent for Coke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What is more, Coke's drinks-only portfolio, which includes
vitaminwater, Fuze and Coke Zero, makes it less exposed to
commodity inflation than Pepsi, whose snack business has been
pressured by higher costs for grains and cooking oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke's net income rose 14 percent to $1.89 billion, or 81
cents per share, in the third quarter ended on Sept. 26.
Excluding items, profit was 83 cents a share, ahead of a Wall
Street forecast of 77 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose 9 percent to $8.39 billion, helped by the
relative weakness of the U.S. dollar, which boosts the value of
international sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global sales by volume rose 5 percent, driven by a 7
percent increase internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company pointed to double-digit sales gains in places
like Turkey, India, Nigeria and China, where it sponsored the
2008 Summer Olympics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke also said it gained market share in Russia, Latin
America and North America -- where a 2 percent volume decline
outperformed the industry. Pepsi's North American beverage
volume fell 2.5 percent in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CAUTION AHEAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke said its third-quarter currency benefit was bigger
than expected but should be weaker in the fourth quarter. It
declined to say how currency would impact results next year,
given recent volatility, but it warned of sales slowing ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect fourth quarter volume to trail the year-to-date
trend, due to the continued impacts of the economic slowdown
and bottler pricing actions," Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said
on a conference call about North American sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regarding international markets, Kent, who has been Coke's
CEO since July, said emerging markets would continue to grow
next year but that growth may slow. He expects further
difficulties in North America into 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello reiterated his
"overweight" rating on Coke shares, saying the quarter's
results show "it should be able to sustain solid operating
results in more challenging economic times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke shares, which had fallen nearly 29 percent this year
through Tuesday's close, closed up 1.1 percent at $44.21 on the
New York Stock Exchange on Wednesday after trading as high as
$47.33. Pepsi closed down 5.8 percent at $51.25.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 15 (Reuters) - Credit default swaps on U.S.
banks weakened on Wednesday, reversing some gains made earlier
in the week, as concerns about a global recession weighed on
the equity and credit markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) were among
the weaker performers after the American Bankers Association
erroneously reported the banks would not be eligible to
participate in a Federal Deposit Insurance Corp program to
guarantee unsecured bank debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ABA corrected the statement on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cost to insure Morgan Stanley's debt rose 50 basis
points to 480 basis points, or $480,000 per year for five years
to insure $10 million in debt, according to Phoenix Partners
Group. Its stock also dropped more than 16 percent to $18.05
per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) credit default swaps also weakened 40
basis points to 240 basis points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wider spreads may also be caused by investors buying
five-year protection on the banks, as the FDIC guarantee will
only last for three years, said Tim Backshall, chief strategist
at Credit Derivatives Research in Walnut Creek, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although counterparty risk is down on the week, it is
increasing today again as traders realize that their
over-the-counter transactions are generally for longer
maturities than three years and so buying five-year or longer
protection as a counterparty risk hedge still makes sense," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Concerns about bank health had encouraged many protection
buyers to purchase shorter-dated contracts, which in turn
became more expensive than 5-year swaps, and this is now
correcting, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch's MER.N swaps also widened 20 basis points
to 190 basis points, and Bank of America's (BAC.N) swaps were
15 basis points weaker at 110 basis points, Phoenix said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Wednesday the
turmoil in credit markets poses a "significant threat" to an
already slowing U.S. economy. For details, see
[ID:nN15308065].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark U.S. investment grade credit derivative index
widened 7.5 percent on Wednesday to around 190 basis points,
according to Markit Intraday.

&lt;p&gt;X1 Technologies Announces General Availability of Client Content Connector for Microsoft SharePoint 2007

       X1 Technologies Releases Second Enterprise Search Content
                Connector for Microsoft SharePoint 2007
PASADENA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
X1 Technologies, Inc., the innovator in enterprise search
solutions, today announced its follow-up enterprise search solution
for Microsoft SharePoint 2007. In August of 2008, X1 Technologies
announced a unique strategy to deliver enterprise search solutions to
Microsoft SharePoint 2007 customers. The first product was the X1
Content Connector for Microsoft SharePoint 2007 that works with the X1
Enterprise Server to provide a rich search experience by indexing
SharePoint data beyond that of Microsoft Search Server. The follow-up
product is a "light" Content Connector that allows X1 Professional
Client customers to connect directly to Microsoft SharePoint 2007 as a
target for search. Customers can search for documents, lists and sites
using both X1 search terminology along with SharePoint's Keyword Query
syntax. These searches can be federated (presented in a single results
view) with local and remote searches to provide a unified query
interface. The X1 Content Connector for Microsoft SharePoint 2007
client is now available and can be downloaded for trial at
http://www.x1.com/cs/mssp2007connector.zip.

   For customers who require a rich, full feature enterprise search
solution for Microsoft SharePoint 2007, X1 recommends the server based
connector that goes beyond the limitations of the native SharePoint
Query. Whether customers choose the Client or Server based Content
Connector for Microsoft SharePoint 2007, both allow them to
effortlessly search for any type of content that may reside in
SharePoint, email, personal computers, file servers or enterprise
applications, all from a simple yet elegant interface.

   "Given the rapid adoption of Microsoft SharePoint 2007, X1 felt
there was a need for multiple options to provide a unified means for
searching data in SharePoint and the rest of the enterprise," said
John Waller, President and COO X1 Technologies. "Customers who don't
need anything beyond basic search will find our client based connector
more than satisfactory whereas customers who require a feature rich,
extensible solution will opt for our scalable server based solution."

   X1 Technologies, the innovator in enterprise search solutions, was
founded in 2003 with the vision of providing a single user interface

&lt;p&gt;  AMSTERDAM, THE NETHERLANDS, Oct 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Dutch Customs and IBM (NYSE: IBM) have signed a 10-year contract for the
replacement of the current declaration systems with a new automated
declaration management system (DMS). Dutch Customs is part of the Dutch
Tax and Customs Administration.

    The new DMS will be able to incorporate the many changes required by
Customs following the modernization of the Dutch Customs legislation and
the eCustoms Program of the European Commission. This system enables Dutch
customs to comply with the requirements as stated in MASP (Multi Annual
Strategic Plan) by the European Commission.

    IBM will provide Dutch Customs licenses for DMS (Declaration Management
System). DMS is a standard asset and part of IBM's overall eCustoms
framework. This eCustoms framework is built to support an incremental
approach which enables our customers to enter the transformation without
changing everything at once.

    Advantages of our eCustoms framework are: out-of-the-box-compliance with
common demands (e.g. EC requirements), high flexibility for specific
requirements and future demands, reduced maintenance costs, reduced
development and maintenance costs by leveraging reuse capability, improved
integration capability by using state-of-the-art technology, platform
independence and improved internal and external interoperability.

    The assets offered within this framework follow common demands, global
trends and best practices. These assets are built to serve the common
demands according to the requirements and leave enough room to reflect the
customer specific demands.

    The IBM eCustoms framework is a joint development of IBM and Intrasoft and
is based on the IBM software group portfolio, like WebSphere Process
Server.

    The IBM solution will provide a more cost efficient, easy to use system
providing the capability to scale up quickly and efficiently.

    The contract was signed in September 2008. Work on the project has already
begun and the new system is expected to be operational by January 2010.

court approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan agreed to buy Washington Mutual Inc last month after
the owner of Washington Mutual Bank entered into receivership.
Following the transaction, the companies entered into a
standstill agreement limiting access to the deposits in order to
give the companies time to verify the amounts, according to the
documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual's holding company said in earlier court
filings that it had about $5 billion on deposit with its banking
subsidiaries prior to entering bankruptcy protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Creditor lawyers had been concerned that the funds in the
deposits would not be available to pay back their clients. When
the Seattle-based savings and loan company filed for bankruptcy
protection, it listed $32.9 billion in assets and $8 billion in
debt.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) has been named the most admired company in contract
management in a survey conducted by the International Association for
Contract &amp; Commercial Management (IACCM), a non-profit foundation
recognized as the international authority on the role of contracting
management in the global networked economy.

    The first-of-a-kind IACCM study asked nearly 10,000 contracts, procurement
and legal professionals worldwide to nominate the companies they most
admire for the quality of their contract management performance. The
surveyed group identified more than 400 organizations, and IBM was named
the most admired contract management performer in the world ahead of
companies like Accenture and Hewlett Packard.

    "As the largest provider of IT services in the world, IBM manages
thousands of client and partner relationships in some 170 countries.
Effectively managing contracts of all durations across complex
jurisdictional, regulatory, corporate governance and risk management
requirements is fundamental to the value we bring to our clients,
partners and investors," said Rick Kaplan, vice president and assistant
general counsel, IBM Global Business Services.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, updates share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 15 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities upgraded Apple Inc
(AAPL.O) and IBM (IBM.N) to "overweight" from "neutral," but
downgraded the stocks of Dell Inc DELL.O, NetApp Inc (NTAP.O)
and Lexmark International Inc (LXK.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Mark Moskowitz said he favours stocks that could
offer relative downside protection to increasingly tenuous IT
spending conditions over the next six to nine months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We recommend stocks possessing diversified models, a high
level of recurring revenues, market share grab potential, and
margin protection," Moskowitz said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the analyst, Apple offers "strong relative
downside protection to the looming earnings reset" that he
expects to impact IT Hardware companies in coming weeks and
early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Retail expansion could sustain share gains and
international momentum," said Moskowitz, who believes
diversifying revenue streams will act as a major force for
Apple's growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst raised the stock of IBM, saying the company
offers long-term investors a "sturdy ship to navigate the
macroeconomic distress".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We highlight IBM as a lead beneficiary owing to its broad
services, hardware, and software reach," Moskowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage cut his ratings on Dell and NetApp to
"neutral" from "overweight" and on Lexmark to "underweight"
from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan believes Dell's high exposure to personal
computers (PC) and the heavy-lifting related to its nascent
two-tier distribution model could bring incremental volatility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's model presently depends on PCs for about 60
percent of revenues, and this high exposure stands to be a
hurdle to achieving consistent growth in coming quarters,
Moskowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Alongside ongoing cost-optimization activities, we
appreciate Dell's initiatives in blade servers, storage, and
value-add services, but we see these potential catalysts as
longer-term in nature," the analyst added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   Moskowitz said the trend of server virtualization may
hurt server revenue growth, but the networked storage space
would benefit from endless data creation, priority status in IT
budgets, and virtualization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Estimates stand to come down across the board in October
and November, but we think bigger cuts come in the January and
February season," he added citing concerns over a weak economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Apple were trading up about 1 percent at $105.36
on Nasdaq, while those of IBM were down about a percent at
$92.91 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Shrutika Verma in Bangalore; Editing by

&lt;p&gt; * Shares higher as results top forecasts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Credit losses rise, may remain elevated&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Elinor Comlay and Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 15 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) posted better-than-expected
earnings on Wednesday despite higher credit losses, underlining
their standing as among the strongest big banks in the battered
U.S. financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Third-quarter profit fell 84 percent at JPMorgan, which
bought Washington Mutual Inc's WAMUQ.PK banking units for
$1.9 billion late last month. Profit dropped 25 percent at
Wells Fargo, which is buying Wachovia Corp WB.N in a
transaction originally valued at $15.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are betting they can handle the
risks stemming from their acquisition targets, which were
felled by losses tied to home loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both banks are well-capitalized and are adding deposits as
nervous customers flee weaker rivals. They are receiving even
more capital as part of the U.S. government plan to inject $250
billion into the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are realizing there are interesting tools being put
in place to deal with the credit crisis, but there's going to
be a lag time to get them to work," said Arthur Hogan, chief
market analyst at Jefferies  Co in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of both banks fell in pre-market trade after a
government report showing disappointing September U.S. retail
sales heightened recession fears. But at mid-morning JPMorgan
was up 63 cents to $41.34, while Wells Fargo added 58 cents to
$34.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMORGAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Profit at New York-based JPMorgan tumbled to $527 million,
or 11 cents per share, from $3.37 billion, or 97 cents, a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding one-time items, the bank had a loss of 6 cents
per share, compared with the average analyst forecast for a
loss of 29 cents, Reuters Estimates said. Net revenue fell 9
percent to $14.74 billion, topping the average forecast of
$14.62 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan nearly tripled the amount it set aside for credit
losses, to $6.66 billion, including a $1.98 billion adjustment
related to how Washington Mutual accounted for loan losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results also included losses of $642 million on Fannie Mae
FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N preferred stock, and $248
million to buy back auction-rate securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition of Washington Mutual, once the largest U.S.
savings and loan, gave JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon
some 5,400 branches and fulfilled his longtime goal of
expanding to the western United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With $2.25 trillion of assets, JPMorgan may have surpassed
Citigroup Inc (C.N) to become the largest U.S. bank for now.
Citigroup reports quarterly results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said, though, that quarterly mortgage and home
equity losses could top $1.5 billion early next year. The bank
is absorbing an estimated $31 billion of loan losses from
Washington Mutual, and Dimon said overall earnings might be
"reduced" over the next few quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We necessarily need to be prepared for a bad environment,"
Dimon said on a conference call. "We don't necessarily know
what the environment will be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WELLS FARGO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, profit dropped to $1.64
billion, or 49 cents per share, from $2.17 billion, or 64
cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent to $10.38
billion, while expenses fell 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average expected profit of 34 cents per share
on revenue of $11.08 billion. Results included $646 million of
charges related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock
and to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEHMQ.PK bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo's largest investor is Warren Buffett's
Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank set aside $2.5 billion for credit losses, in large
part for consumer credit losses, while net charge-offs more
than doubled to $2 billion. It said home equity loan losses
will be higher than normal until home prices stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The economy is weak and maybe is in a recession," Chief
Financial Officer Howard Atkins said in an interview. "I don't
know how deep or how long it will last, but it is a good
working assumption. Having said that, the steps taken by the
government will help over time, and we'll see what happens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo was able to wrest Wachovia from the arms of
Citigroup largely because it never dove deeply into the risky
mortgages and exotic debt that strangled Wachovia, Washington
Mutual and IndyMac Bancorp Inc IDMC.PK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wachovia merger is expected to close this quarter and
create the fourth-largest U.S. bank, with more than $1.4
trillion of assets and about 6,600 branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're known and admired for our conservative financial
position and a disciplined acquisition strategy that will not
change," Chief Executive John Stumpf said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Paramus, New Jersey's Hudson City Bancorp Inc
(HCBK.O) said third-quarter profit rose 64 percent to $121.9
million, or 25 cents per share, from $74.4 million, or 15
cents, a year earlier, as its home lending business thrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hudson City will become the nation's largest thrift
following the expected sale of Sovereign Bancorp Inc SOV.N to
Spain's Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co posted a better-than-expected quarterly profit on strong international demand that offset a drop in volume at home, sending shares of the world's largest soft-drink maker up 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coke's results on Wednesday bolstered investors' hopes that the company would prove resilient in a weak U.S. economy. Rival PepsiCo Inc posted a disappointing profit a day earlier and cut its full-year forecast, saying consumers were drinking more water from the kitchen tap to save money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke's net income rose 14 percent to $1.89 billion, or 81 cents per share, in the third quarter ended on September 26 from $1.65 billion, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding restructuring charges and costs from productivity initiatives, the company earned 83 cents a share, topping the analysts' average forecast of 77 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ongoing global slowdown is not yet evidenced in Coke's business," wrote Deutsche Bank analyst Marc Greenberg in a research note, though he questioned "whether it was the last great quarter or if Coke runs the last great consumer staples business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 9 percent to $8.39 billion, helped by the relative weakness of the U.S. dollar, which boosts the value of international sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our international operations, in particular the emerging markets, continue to drive our growth, more than offsetting the challenges that we are addressing in North America," Chief Executive Muhtar Kent said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company pointed to double-digit sales increases in countries like China, Turkey, India and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke expects operating conditions in North America to remain difficult into 2009, Kent said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global sales by volume increased 5 percent. International volume rose 7 percent, but that growth was partly offset by a 2 percent decline in North America, where cash-strapped consumers are dining out less often and making fewer trips to gas stations and convenience stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbonated soft drinks such as Coca-Cola, Fanta and Sprite saw volume increase 3 percent worldwide in the quarter, while beverages like Minute Maid juice and Glaceau vitaminwater grew 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Gary Fayard said the third-quarter currency benefit was bigger than expected and should be a bit weaker in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the recent fluctuations in currency trading, Fayard said "it would be impractical" to say how currency would impact sales and profits in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke said it was on track for its productivity initiatives to deliver $400 million to $500 million in annual savings by the end of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke shares, which had fallen nearly 29 percent this year through Tuesday's close, were up $2.65 at $46.38 on the New York Stock Exchange. Pepsi slipped 30 cents to $54.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 15 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded General
Mills Inc (GIS.N) to "overweight" from "neutral," citing the
company's strong growth position in certain categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The maker of Cheerios cereal, Betty Crocker baking mixes
and Green Giant vegetables appears to be gaining share in the
cereal category, and double-digit growth continues in the
yogurt and snacks categories, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Continued execution, additional innovation and pricing
seem poised to maintain the fundamental momentum, establishing
Mills as perhaps the best top-line story in our large cap
group," analyst Terry Bivens wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While margin compression is likely in the fiscal second
quarter, the forward outlook is brighter with most of the
company's main inputs like fuel, wheat, flour and milk likely
to be down when contracts are renewed, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bivens, who set a year-end 2009 price target of $78 on the
stock, expects General Mills to top consensus earnings
estimates for the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were up 14 cents at $64.56 in morning
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Former Dell Infrastructure Specialist Brings Breadth of Microsoft
                    Exchange Knowledge to Mailtrust
BLACKSBURG, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Mailtrust(TM), a leading business-email specialist and a division
of Rackspace(R) Hosting, (NYSE:RAX), the world's leader and specialist
in hosted IT services, today announced the company has hired David
Bjurman-Birr as the senior manager of engineering, custom solutions.
In this new role, Bjurman-Birr will be responsible for helping the
Mailtrust engineering team maintain and grow the architecture of the
company's Hosted Exchange solution. Bjurman-Birr will be responsible
for working closely with some of Mailtrust's largest Microsoft
Exchange customers, and architecting solutions that meet the needs of
this very complex customer base. He is a Microsoft Certified Architect
- Messaging (MCA-M), what some colloquially call 'Exchange Ranger.'

   "David's background with Dell and his wealth of Microsoft training
makes him a perfect addition to an already knowledgeable and technical
engineering team that has created our Exchange infrastructure," said
Pat Matthews, president, Mailtrust. "As an 'Exchange Ranger,' he has
received the most up-to-date and extensive training on Microsoft
Exchange and has been certified by his MCA-M peers. Given there are
less than 100 'Rangers' worldwide, David has a unique perspective and
knowledge that will be greatly beneficial to our customers. He will
also focus on finding deeper ways to integrate our Noteworthy platform
with Exchange, creating a seamless hybrid solution that is
customizable for any business."

   "As more and more businesses outsource their email services to us,
Mailtrust will require continuous infrastructure evolution and
maintenance to adapt and align with our customer's business
requirements, and I am excited to be a part of the talented team here
at Mailtrust," said Bjurman-Birr. "Microsoft Exchange is the standard
when it comes to business communication and collaboration. My training
and access to the 'Exchange Ranger' community will help our team take
the Mailtrust platform to the next level as we strive to increase
reliability, interoperability, and most importantly support.

   "Microsoft has created a great software product in Exchange that
we deliver with a rock-solid service commitment. As Microsoft steps
into the hosted Exchange market, it indicates that the
software-as-a-service market is reaching a critical mass where it is
becoming the clear choice for messaging and collaboration and
Microsoft sees the potential there. But as I expect them to be
primarily product and license focused, Mailtrust's 10-plus years in
the email hosting business has allowed us to create a dependable
service and support focus; built on a reliable and easily scalable
infrastructure. As Rackspace continues to offer more diverse hosted
solutions through Cloud and SaaS, we expect our Hosted Exchange to be
at the forefront of the email market."

   Prior to joining Mailtrust, Bjurman-Birr lead the Microsoft
Infrastructure Consulting Practice for Dell where he had worked since
2005, leading the planning, analysis, and implementation of enterprise
messaging and unified communications solutions that directly support
his customers' strategic initiatives. He has delivered sessions for
Microsoft TechEd, Dell TechSummit, and numerous regional technical
conferences and seminars.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's (JPM.N) quarterly profit fell 84 percent, due to mark-downs on underperforming loans, but the results still beat analysts' forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose shares slipped 2.5 percent in pre-market trading, was hit by weakness in its leveraged lending and mortgage-related portfolios, underscoring the strains of the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the uncertainty in the capital markets, housing sector and economy overall, it is reasonable to expect reduced earnings for our firm over the next few quarters," Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's adjusted loss of 6 cents per share, before an extraordinary gain related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual's banking operations, beat analyst expectations of a loss of 29 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third quarter net income fell to $527 million, or 11 cents a share, from $3.37 billion, or 97 cents a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's shares initially rose in premarket trading, but then turned lower and were down a bit less than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank, which is set to get a $25 billion cash injection from the U.S. government's financial rescue package, last month sold $10 billion of stock to fund its $1.9 billion acquisition of Washington Mutual Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The takeover, which followed seizure of WaMu by regulators, was JPMorgan's second this year of a financial institution on the verge of collapse. In March, it agreed to buy stricken investment bank Bear Stearns Cos Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchase of Wamu, the largest bank to fail in U.S. history, saddled the bank with the troublesome mortgages that caused painful write-downs and credit losses for the thrift. As part of the acquisition, JPMorgan wrote down more than $30 billion and said it would incur $1.5 billion in pre-tax costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank posted a write-down of $3.6 billion from its investment banking operations, taking its total credit losses and write-downs since the credit crunch began last year to $12.3 billion, still far below that of peers such as Citigroup Inc (C.N), which has posted over $50 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in JPMorgan fell $1.01 to $39.70 in pre-market trading, from $40.71 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

its flagship StorHouse(R) and Trusted Edge(R) Desktop Data Management
Suite family of products. StorHouse provides enterprise-class data
management solutions for large-volume applications such as digital

audit mechanism, and scalability to multiple petabytes with unlimited
object capabilities and no performance degradation.

   FileTek's Trusted Edge Desktop Data Management Suite provides
centralized, policy-driven Information Classification and Management
(ICM) for documents and email at the desktop level to improve
retention compliance, reduce litigation risk, and lower overall
enterprise storage costs. Trusted Edge reduces the amount of
non-relevant information clogging the system and intelligently routes

   "It is critical to our customers that we deliver data management
solutions that seamlessly integrate with the architecture of core
Microsoft technologies," said Bill Loomis, CEO of FileTek. "Achieving
Gold Certified Partner status demonstrates our focus on delivering
industry-leading solutions that support the Windows platform and will

   "Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the
gap between their business demands and technology capabilities," said
Allison Watson, corporate vice president of the Worldwide Partner
Group at Microsoft Corp. "They need to trust in a company that can act
as an expert adviser for their long-term strategic technology plans.
Microsoft Gold Certified Partners, which have certified expertise and

expertise in providing customer satisfaction using Microsoft products

   As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner
status, FileTek had to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft
Competencies are designed to help differentiate a partner's
capabilities with specific Microsoft technologies to customers looking
for a particular type of solution. Each Competency has a unique set of
requirements and benefits, formulated to accurately represent the
specific skills and services that partners bring to the technology
industry. Within select Competencies, there are Specializations that
focus on specific solution areas that recognize deeper expertise
within that Competency. Serving as a specialized path to earning those
Competencies, Specializations give direct access to the tools and
resources that support that specific area of focus.

   The ISV/Software Solutions Competency recognizes the skill and
focus partners bring to a particular solution set. Microsoft Gold
Certified Partners that have obtained this competency have a
successful record of developing and marketing packaged software based
on Microsoft technologies.

   "Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to
better enable ISVs to meet customer needs," said Sanjay Parthasarathy,
corporate vice president of the Developer and Platform Evangelism
Group at Microsoft Corp. "They allow ISVs to keep and win customers
through their deep knowledge of solutions-based Microsoft platform
technologies. Microsoft has a long history of working closely with ISV
partners to help them deliver compelling solutions and applications to
our mutual customers, and the Microsoft Competencies are an important
step in continuing to enhance vital relationships with ISVs
worldwide."

   The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and
represents Microsoft's ongoing commitment to the success of partners
worldwide. The program offers a single, integrated partnering
framework that recognizes partner expertise, rewards the total impact
that partners have in the technology marketplace, and delivers more
value to help partners' businesses be successful.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its third-quarter
profit view on small and mid-sized brokers and investment banks
on recent market declines and said investment banking trends
will remain relatively depressed over the near term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Investment banking statistics in financial advisory,
equities and debt have all been lackluster in the third-quarter
and are showing no signs of recovering in the short term,"
analyst William Tanona said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Within the small size brokers, Tanona expects firms with
asset management businesses to be hit harder and said he was
reducing his estimates for Greenhill and Co (GHL.N), Lazard Ltd
(LAZ.N) and Raymond James Financial Inc (RJF.N) more
aggressively than others in the group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tanona expects smid-cap and boutique advisory firms, under
his coverage, to fare somewhat better than the large-cap firms,
especially given their prior very low market share of large,
sponsor-related deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also lowered its 2009 and 2010 earnings
estimates on discount brokers by an average of 18 percent to
reflect further declines in the U.S. equity markets and on the
expactation that current market and economic uncertainties will
hurt retail trading activity.

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Oct 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Visa Canada, the National Hockey League Players' Association (NHLPA) and
the National Hockey League (NHL) today announced a new sponsorship naming
Visa as an official partner of the NHL and NHLPA in Canada. The
sponsorship also designates Visa as the official payment card of the
NHLPA and NHL. 

    "As a committed supporter of some of the world's most celebrated sporting
events, Visa is delighted to team up with the NHL and NHLPA as an
official partner," said Brenda Woods, Head of Marketing, Visa Canada.
"Canadians are passionate about hockey and through this sponsorship, Visa
cardholders will have opportunities that will help bring them closer to
the sport they love. We look forward to working with the NHL and NHLPA
beginning this 2008-2009 NHL season." 

    "The NHL is thrilled to align with Visa, one of the most powerful brands
in financial services," said Laurel Walzak, Director of Business
Development for the NHL. "We see many synergies with Visa as we
super-serve NHL fans with unique, exciting experiences." 

    "The NHLPA is excited to partner with Visa, an organization that is a
strong supporter of amateur and professional sports in Canada," said Mike
Ouellet, NHLPA Chief of Business Affairs. "NHLPA members look forward to
working with Visa to bring many unique hockey experiences to fans across
the country."

    The partnership, which runs until June 30, 2011, allows Visa to engage
with Canadian hockey fans nationwide and develop hockey-themed
opportunities. 

    Visa's partnership with the NHL and NHLPA strengthens Visa's commitment
to sport in Canada. In addition to its global sponsorships of the Olympic
and Paralympic Games and FIFA, Visa is a proud supporter of its Canadian
Team Visa athletes and is the title sponsor of Canada's national men's
and women's bobsleigh and skeleton teams. The NHLPA and NHL partnership
is yet another way for Visa to create Visa cardholder opportunities or
compliment those of its financial institution clients. The partnership
also allows Visa to promote its products and services in connection with
hockey, one of Canada's favourite pastimes.

NHL consists of 30 Member Clubs, each reflecting the League's
international makeup, with players from more than 20 countries
represented on team rosters. According to a Simmons Market Research
study, NHL fans are younger, more educated, more affluent, and access
content through digital means more than any other sport. The NHL
entertains more than 100 million fans each season in-arena and through
its partners in national television (VERSUS, NBC, TSN, CBC, RDS, RIS,
NASN, ASN and NHL Network) and radio (NHL Radio, Sirius XM Radio and XM

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JP Morgan (JPM.N) has cut its oil price forecast for the fourth quarter of 2008 to $79 a barrel and reduced its forecast for the average price in 2009 to $74.75 a barrel, the U.S. bank said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firm said the cuts reflected weaker economics, more expensive credit, more refining capacity and recovering non-OPEC supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan did not immediately give details of the size of these revisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This forecast is predicated on the assumption that we are currently in a global recession and that this will last at least through to the end of the first quarter," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There remains the possibility that the slowdown is both deeper and more protracted than assumed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank sees prices dipping to $70 a barrel in the second quarter and current volatility in the oil price could mean that U.S. crude could fall to $60 a barrel at some stage.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 15 (Reuters) - JP Morgan said on Wednesday it is
raising its price forecast for gold for 2008 and 2009 on
expectations investors will buy into bullion as a haven from
risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; However, it is trimming its expectations for platinum,
palladium and silver prices on fears over falling demand for the
more industrial precious metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank now sees gold prices at $904 an ounce in 2008,
against a previous forecast of $884, and at $875 an ounce next
year, up from $854 previously expectated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Gold and silver should continue to benefit from safe-haven
related interest," JP Morgan added in an emailed release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nonetheless the bank revised its silver prices lower, to
$15.40 an ounce from $16.10 in 2008 and to $12.30 from $12.50 an
ounce next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It made deeper cuts to its forecasts for platinum group
metals prices. It cut its 2008 forecast for platinum by 5
percent to $1,611 an ounce, and its expected palladium price by
4 percent to $354 an ounce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For 2009, it slashed its palladium price forecast by around
a third to $225 an ounce from $338, and cut its forecast
platinum price to $1,123 from $1,275.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prices of both platinum and palladium have more than halved
from the highs hit earlier this year.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NEW YORK, Oct 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Disney's timeless fairy, Tinker Bell, is taking the fantasy of Never Land
to the actual skies with the help of WowWee's award-winning FlyTech(TM)
technology. WowWee, an Optimal Group company (NASDAQ: OPMR) and leading
developer of innovative hi-tech consumer robotic and entertainment
products, and Disney Consumer Products have brought the sassy and
spirited Tinker Bell character to life, as a magical flying toy. Disney
Fairies fans will get big thrills as the Tinker Bell flyer flutters to
store shelves this month in anticipation of Walt Disney Pictures Tinker
Bell releasing on Disney DVD and Blu-Ray October 28th.

    Perfect for indoor flight, the Tinker Bell flyer powered with FlyTech
technology features graceful flight patterns and enchanting wing design
and is an elegant, easy-to-use vertical flyer. She is equipped with a
flower wand remote controller designed specifically for children's hands
and a decorative stand for storage when she needs to rest her wings. With
the wand, users control the height and speed of the Tinker Bell flyer
with ease, allowing her to soar, dive and glide. The wand also serves as
a power source with an LED charge indicator - 18 minutes of charging
gives Tinker Bell a magical power boost allowing for up to 4 minutes of
flight.

    The Tinker Bell flyer is constructed of light-weight, crash-resistant
materials that prevent her from getting into mischief. As an ideal
introduction to flight, she will entertain and delight children by
allowing them to interact with a "real" Disney character. Dual-band
infrared controls also allow users to fly up to two Tinker Bell flyers
together in one room.

    WowWee's award-winning FlyTech line of aeronautical products launched in
2007 with FlyTech Dragonfly(TM), the world's first commercially available
radio-controlled ornithopter and one of TIME Magazine's "Best Inventions
of the Year" (2007). Featuring the same dual wing design to provide lift
and propulsion, the Tinker Bell flyer from FlyTech brings the magic of
flight to a young generation of girls. The FlyTech line includes FlyTech
Bladestar(TM), the first flying toy with sensor-based navigation, and
other vertical indoor flyers including the FlyTech Bat(TM) and FlyTech
Dragon(TM). The line also includes the FlyTech Butterfly(TM), FlyTech
Mosquito(TM) and FlyTech Moth(TM) - flyers that feature a simple
launching dock instead of a remote controller.

    The Tinker Bell flyer from FlyTech is available for the suggested retail
price of $39.99 at major retailers nationwide including Toys"R"Us,
Wal-Mart, Radio Shack, Amazon.com, BarnesandNoble.com, and
DisneyShopping.com. The Tinker Bell flyer is appropriate for ages 6 years
and up and requires 4 "AA" batteries (not included).

    About Disney Fairies

    Disney Fairies is rooted in Disney's rich heritage of children's
storytelling. The franchise builds upon the enormous popularity of Tinker
Bell and introduces girls to her secret, magical world and a new circle
of enchanting fairy friends - each with an incredibly diverse talent,
personality and look. Launched just three years ago, the franchise

copies in 40 countries and an array of products from apparel and toys to
electronics, home decor and stationery has extended storylines into many

&lt;p&gt;Delivers complete RFID Solutions for Business Visibility
  leveraging IBM's Location Awareness Services enabled by the passive
              RFID RTLS capabilities of Mojix STAR System
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Mojix(R), Inc. announced today that the Mojix STAR(TM) system has
achieved certification with IBM's Ready for IBM WebSphere Premises
Server program. The new solution delivers business visibility from
RFID Solutions by combining the power of IBM enterprise software and
the Mojix STAR system for large-scale, high-volume and economical RFID
data collection.

   "Successful RFID deployments require the ability to easily
implement robust enterprise-class business solutions," said Ramin
Sadr, CEO &amp; Founder, Mojix. "The Mojix STAR system integration with
IBM WebSphere Premises Server signals that the broad new capabilities
and superior economics of the STAR system can be readily realized in
RFID solutions by customers around the globe."

   Introduced in April 2008, the Mojix STAR system uses advanced
digital signal processing and a flexible new RFID systems architecture
to deliver unprecedented EPC RFID range, reliability, scale and
utility. Among the advanced capabilities of the STAR system is the
newly announced Mojix eLocation(TM) solution, which provides real-time
location estimation and tracking using low-cost EPC passive RFID tags,
thus enabling organizations to leverage a single cost-effective RFID
system for all supply chain management and RTLS requirements.

   IBM WebSphere Premises Server integration enables a simple,
standards-based path for exploiting the Mojix STAR system's
revolutionary functionality with enterprise class business visibility
solutions. For example, the Mojix STAR system supports IBM WebSphere
Premises Server Location Aware Services (LAS) to visualize location
events using passive RFID tag data including both tag reads and
location data on goods and assets.

   IBM WebSphere Premises Server 6.1 is built upon the IBM SOA
foundation product set providing the scalability and reliability
expected of enterprise-class end-to-end sensor-based solutions.
Platform extensibility and flexibility enables multiple sensor types
(device services including active RFID, passive RFID and condition
sensors) to be supported on a single platform to enable new innovative
business processes that exploit the insights from sensor information.
Location Awareness Services enable the tracking of real time location
of goods and assets and the detection of location based events that
can trigger proactive and remedial processes.

   Together IBM WebSphere Premises Server and the Mojix STAR system
enable the deployment of end-to-end RFID solutions that deliver
on-demand access to business information in supply chains, optimally
manage inventory, and keep track of valuable assets in real time.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported third-quarter 2008 net income of
$527 million, compared with net income of $3.4 billion in the third quarter of
2007. Earnings per share were $0.11, compared with $0.97 in the third quarter of
2007. Current-quarter results include a charge of $1.2 billion (after-tax) to
conform loan loss reserves and an extraordinary gain of $581 million
(after-tax), related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual's banking
operations, which closed on September 25, 2008.

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on the quarter:
"Our third quarter financial results declined sharply, driven by markdowns on
mortgage trading positions and leveraged loans, and higher credit costs due to
continued deterioration in our home-lending portfolio. In this environment, we
have kept our focus on meeting our clients' needs and deploying capital wisely.
We continue to see numerous examples of organic growth, including in Investment
Banking market share, new checking accounts, net flows in Asset Management and
increased loan and liability balances in Commercial Banking and Treasury &amp;
Securities Services."

Mr. Dimon further remarked: "I am pleased that we were in a position during the
quarter to purchase Washington Mutual's banking operations, becoming the largest
U.S. depository institution, with more than $900 billion in deposits. We welcome
Washington Mutual employees to JPMorgan Chase and look forward to bringing
together the best of both firms. This acquisition adds more than 2,200 branches,
allowing us to expand nationwide - both in our existing markets and into
attractive new ones, in states like California, Florida and Washington - and to
further grow our other business lines through our enhanced branch network."

"We expect the Washington Mutual transaction to create long-term value for
shareholders while also being immediately accretive, adding 50 cents per share
to earnings in 2009. In light of the unprecedented challenges and risks facing
the housing market, we have incorporated expectations of significant credit
losses from Washington Mutual's home-lending portfolio into the structure of the
transaction. We also raised $11.5 billion of common equity to support the
transaction and add to our already substantial capital base."

Dimon added: "Given the uncertainty in the capital markets, housing sector and
economy overall, it is reasonable to expect reduced earnings for our firm over
the next few quarters. However, with a total loan loss allowance of $19 billion
(including Washington Mutual) and an 8.9% Tier 1 capital ratio, we feel
well-positioned to handle the turbulent environment and, most importantly, to
continue to invest in our businesses and serve our clients well."

"Finally, I want to express how proud I am of our employees - their outstanding
efforts and commitment to building a great company under extremely stressful
circumstances has made a tremendous difference in our ability to manage risk and
execute complex transactions. Together, we will continue to focus on creating a
stronger and more profitable franchise in the years to come."

In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a
firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with
GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the
firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded, and for
each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a
tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other
non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of
each line of business, see Notes 1 and 2 (page 13).

The effects of Washington Mutual's banking operations are not included in the
discussion of the results of the business segments below, as such operations did
not have a material effect on the results of the quarter ended September 30,
2008, except as follows: (1) for JPMorgan Chase as a firm and for the
Corporate/Private Equity segment, the charge to conform Washington Mutual's loan
loss reserves and the extraordinary gain related to the transaction are
reflected, and (2) for consolidated information as of September 30, 2008, such
as the period end balance sheet, credit related statistics, capital ratios and
headcount, the amounts presented reflect the acquisition of these banking
operations.

The following discussion compares the third quarter of 2008 with the third
quarter of 2007 unless otherwise noted.

*T

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $882 million, an increase of $586 million from the prior year.
The improved results reflected an increase in net revenue and the benefit of
reduced deferred tax liabilities offset largely by increased noninterest
expense.

Net revenue was $4.0 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 37%, from the
prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.6 billion, up 20% from the prior
year. Advisory fees were $576 million, down 3% from the prior year, reflecting
decreased levels of activity. Debt underwriting fees were $499 million, up 7%.
Equity underwriting fees were $518 million, up 94% from the prior year. Fixed
Income Markets revenue was $815 million, up 19% from the prior year. The
increase was driven by record results in rates and currencies, and strong
performance in credit trading, emerging markets, and commodities, as well as
gains of $343 million from the widening of the firm's credit spread on certain
structured liabilities. Largely offsetting these results were mortgage-related
net markdowns of $2.6 billion, as well as $1.0 billion of net markdowns on
leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments. Equity Markets revenue was a
record $1.7 billion, up by $1.1 billion from the prior year, driven by strong
trading results and client revenue, as well as a gain of $429 million from the
widening of the firm's credit spread on certain structured liabilities. Credit
Portfolio revenue was a loss of $23 million, down $415 million from the prior
year, reflecting net markdowns due to wider counterparty credit spreads and
fewer gains from loan workouts, largely offset by higher net interest income and
increased revenue from risk management activities.

The provision for credit losses was $234 million, compared with $227 million in
the prior year, reflecting a weakening credit environment. Net charge-offs were
$13 million, compared with $67 million in the prior year. The allowance for loan
losses to total loans retained was 3.85% for the current quarter, an increase
from 1.80% in the prior year.

Average loans retained were $69.0 billion, an increase of $7.1 billion, or 11%,
from the prior year, largely driven by growth in acquisition finance activity,
including leveraged lending. Average fair value and held-for-sale loans were
$17.6 billion, up $297 million, or 2%, from the prior year.

Noninterest expense was $3.8 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion, or 60%, from
the prior year, largely driven by higher compensation expense and additional
operating costs relating to the Bear Stearns merger.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $247 million, a decrease of $392 million, or 61%, reflecting a
significant increase in the provision for credit losses in Regional Banking and
higher noninterest expense in Mortgage Banking. These factors were offset
partially by revenue growth in all businesses.

Net revenue was $4.9 billion, an increase of $674 million, or 16%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $3.1 billion, up $463 million, or 17%, due
to higher loan and deposit balances and wider deposit spreads. Noninterest
revenue was $1.7 billion, up $211 million, or 14%, as higher net mortgage
servicing revenue and increased deposit-related fees were offset partially by
declines in education loan sales.

The provision for credit losses was $1.7 billion, as housing price declines have
continued to result in significant increases in estimated losses, particularly
for high loan-to-value home equity and mortgage loans. Home equity net
charge-offs were $663 million (2.78% net charge-off rate), compared with $150
million (0.65% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net
charge-offs were $273 million (7.65% net charge-off rate), compared with $40
million (1.62% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Prime mortgage net
charge-offs (including net charge-offs reflected in the Corporate segment) were
$177 million (1.51% net charge-off rate), compared with $9 million (0.11% net
charge-off rate) in the prior year. The current-quarter provision includes an
increase in the allowance for loan losses of $450 million due to increases in
estimated losses in the subprime and home equity mortgage portfolios. An
additional $250 million increase in the allowance for loan losses for prime
mortgage loans has been reflected in the Corporate segment.

Noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, an increase of $303 million, or 12%, from
the prior year, reflecting higher mortgage reinsurance losses and increased
servicing expense.

Regional Banking net income was $218 million, down $393 million, or 64%, from
the prior year. Net revenue was $3.7 billion, up $363 million, or 11%, as the
benefits of higher loan and deposit balances, wider deposit spreads and higher
deposit-related fees were offset partially by declines in education loan sales.
The provision for credit losses was $1.6 billion, compared with $574 million in
the prior year. The provision reflected weakness in the home equity and mortgage
portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for credit
losses for further detail). Noninterest expense was $1.8 billion, up $13
million, or 1%, from the prior year.

Mortgage Banking reported a net loss of $50 million, compared with a net loss of
$48 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $666 million, up $260 million, or
64%. Net revenue comprises production revenue and net mortgage servicing
revenue. Production revenue was $254 million, up $78 million, reflecting lower
markdowns of $91 million on the mortgage warehouse and pipeline as compared with
markdowns of $186 million in the prior year. The current-year result was also
affected by an increase in reserves related to the offer to repurchase of
previously-sold loans. Net mortgage servicing revenue - which includes loan
servicing revenue, MSR risk management results and other changes in fair value -
was $412 million, an increase of $182 million, or 79%, from the prior year. Loan
servicing revenue was $695 million, an increase of $66 million on growth of 14%
in third-party loans serviced. MSR risk management results were $107 million,
compared with negative $22 million in the prior year. Other changes in fair
value of the MSR asset were negative $390 million compared with negative $377
million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $747 million, an increase of
$262 million, or 54%. The increase reflected higher mortgage reinsurance losses
and higher servicing costs due to increased delinquencies and defaults.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $292 million, a decline of $494 million, or 63%, from the prior
year. The decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses, partially
offset by lower noninterest expense.

End-of-period managed loans were $159.3 billion, an increase of $10.3 billion,
or 7%, from the prior year and $3.9 billion, or 3%, from the prior quarter.
Average managed loans were $157.6 billion, an increase of $8.9 billion, or 6%,
from the prior year and $4.7 billion, or 3%, from the prior quarter. The
increase from the prior year in both end-of-period and average managed loans
reflects organic portfolio growth.

Managed net revenue was $3.9 billion, an increase of $20 million, or 1%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $3.2 billion, up $133 million, or 4%,
from the prior year, driven by higher average managed loan balances and wider
loan spreads. These benefits were offset partially by the effect of higher
revenue reversals associated with higher charge-offs. Noninterest revenue was
$646 million, a decrease of $113 million, or 15%, from the prior year.
Interchange income increased, benefiting from a 5% increase in charge volume,
but was more than offset by increased rewards expense and higher volume-driven
payments to partners (both of which are netted against interchange income), as
well as a decrease in securitization income.

The managed provision for credit losses was $2.2 billion, an increase of $866
million, or 64%, from the prior year, due to a higher level of charge-offs and
an increase of $250 million in the allowance for loan losses. The managed net
charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.00%, up from 3.64% in the prior year and
4.98% in the prior quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 3.69%, up
from 3.25% in the prior year and 3.46% in the prior quarter.

Noninterest expense was $1.2 billion, a decrease of $68 million, or 5%, from the
prior year due to lower marketing expense.

*T

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $312 million, an increase of $54 million, or 21%, from the prior
year, driven by record net revenue, partially offset by an increase in the
provision for credit losses and higher noninterest expense.

Net revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of $116 million, or 11%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $737 million, up $18 million, or 3%, driven
by double-digit growth in loan and liability balances, predominantly offset by
spread compression in the liability and loan portfolios. Noninterest revenue was
$388 million, an increase of $98 million, or 34%, from the prior year,
reflecting higher deposit-related fees, investment banking fees, and other
income.

Middle Market Banking revenue was $729 million, an increase of $49 million, or
7%, from the prior year. Mid-Corporate Banking revenue was $236 million, an
increase of $69 million, or 41%. Real Estate Banking revenue was $91 million, a
decline of $17 million, or 16%.

The provision for credit losses was $126 million, an increase of $14 million, or
13%, compared with the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflects a
weakening credit environment and growth in loan balances. The allowance for loan
losses to total loans retained was 2.65% for the current quarter, in line with
the prior year and up from 2.61% in the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were
$572 million, up $438 million from the prior year and up $86 million from the
prior quarter, reflecting increases across all businesses and the effect of a
weakening credit environment. Net charge-offs were $40 million (0.22% net
charge-off rate), compared with $20 million (0.13% net charge-off rate) in the
prior year and $49 million (0.28% net charge-off rate) in the prior quarter.

Noninterest expense was $486 million, an increase of $13 million, or 3%, from
the prior year, due to higher performance-based compensation expense.

*T

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $406 million, an increase of $46 million, or 13%, from the prior
year, driven by higher net revenue and the benefit of reduced deferred tax
liabilities. This increase was predominantly offset by higher noninterest
expense. Net income decreased by $19 million, or 4%, from the prior quarter,
which benefited from seasonal activity in securities lending, depositary
receipts, and foreign exchange volumes.

Net revenue was $2.0 billion, an increase of $205 million, or 12%, from the
prior year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was $1.1 billion, an
increase of $88 million, or 9%, from the prior year. The growth was driven by
wider spreads on liability products and in securities lending and foreign
exchange, combined with increased product usage by new and existing clients
(largely in custody, fund services and alternative investment services). These
benefits were offset partially by market depreciation. Treasury Services net
revenue was a record $897 million, an increase of $117 million, or 15%,
reflecting higher liability balances as well as volume growth in electronic
funds transfer products and trade loans. TSS firmwide net revenue, which
includes Treasury Services net revenue recorded in other lines of business, grew
to $2.7 billion, an increase of $260 million, or 11%. Treasury Services firmwide
net revenue grew to $1.6 billion, an increase of $172 million, or 12%.

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $205 million, or 18%, from
the prior year, reflecting higher expense related to business and volume growth
as well as continued investment in new product platforms.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $351 million, a decline of $170 million, or 33%, from the prior
year, driven largely by lower net revenue.

Net revenue was $2.0 billion, a decrease of $244 million, or 11%, from the prior
year. Noninterest revenue was $1.6 billion, a decline of $331 million, or 17%,
due to lower performance fees and the effect of lower markets, including the
impact of lower market valuations of seed capital investments; these effects
were offset partially by the benefit of the Bear Stearns merger and increased
revenue from net asset inflows. Net interest income was $380 million, up $87
million, or 30%, from the prior year, predominantly due to higher loan and
deposit balances and wider deposit spreads.

Private Bank revenue was $631 million, relatively flat compared with the prior
year, as increased loan and deposit balances and higher assets under management
largely offset the effect of lower markets and lower performance fees.
Institutional revenue declined 19% to $486 million due to lower performance
fees, partially offset by growth in assets under management. Retail revenue
decreased 38% to $399 million due to the effect of lower markets, including the
impact of lower market valuations of seed capital investments and net equity
outflows. Private Wealth Management revenue grew 4% to $352 million due to
higher loan and deposit balances and growth in assets under management. Bear
Stearns Brokerage contributed $93 million to revenue.

Assets under supervision were $1.6 trillion, an increase of $23 billion, or 1%,
from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.2 trillion, down $10
billion, or 1%, from the prior year. The decrease was predominantly due to lower
equity markets and equity product outflows, offset by liquidity product inflows
across all segments and the addition of Bear Stearns assets under management.
Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were $409 billion, up
$33 billion, driven by the addition of Bear Stearns Brokerage.

The provision for credit losses was $20 million, compared with $3 million in the
prior year, reflecting an increase in loan balances and a lower level of
recoveries.

Noninterest expense of $1.4 billion was flat compared with the prior year as the
effect of the Bear Stearns merger and increased headcount were offset by lower
performance-based compensation.

Discussion of Results:

Net loss for Corporate/Private Equity was $2.0 billion, compared with net income
of $513 million in the prior year.

Net loss included a charge of $1.2 billion (after-tax) to conform loan loss
reserves and an extraordinary gain of $581 million (after-tax) related to the
acquisition of Washington Mutual's banking operations, which closed on September
25, 2008. Net loss also included $95 million (after-tax) of continuing Bear
Stearns merger-related items.

Net loss for Private Equity was $164 million, compared with net income of $409
million in the prior year. Net revenue was negative $216 million, a decrease of
$949 million, reflecting Private Equity losses of $206 million, compared with
gains of $766 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $41 million, a
decline of $54 million from the prior year, reflecting lower compensation
expense.

Excluding the above merger-related items, the net loss for Corporate was $1.1
billion, compared with net income of $142 million in the prior year. Net revenue
was negative $1.5 billion, compared with revenue of $268 million in the prior
year. This decrease reflects a higher level of trading losses, including losses
of $1.0 billion on preferred securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a $375
million charge related to the offer to repurchase auction-rate securities, and
the absence of a $115 million gain from the sale of MasterCard shares in the
prior year. These losses were offset partially by securities gains of $440
million. Excluding the provision related to Washington Mutual, the
current-quarter provision for credit losses of $378 million includes an increase
in the allowance for loan losses of $250 million for prime mortgage (see Retail
Financial Services' discussion of the provision for loan losses for further
detail). Noninterest expense was negative $127 million, a decrease of $23
million from the prior year, driven by lower litigation expense.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $527 million, a decrease of $2.8 billion, or 84%, from the prior
year. The decline in earnings was driven by a higher provision for credit losses
and increased noninterest expense.

Managed net revenue was $16.1 billion, a decrease of $889 million, or 5%, from
the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $5.2 billion, down $3.3 billion, or 39%,
due to lower principal transactions revenue, which reflected mortgage-related
net markdowns and net markdowns on leveraged lending funded and unfunded
commitments. Net interest income was $10.9 billion, up $2.4 billion, or 29%, due
to higher trading-related net interest income and higher loan and deposit
balances.

The managed provision for credit losses was $6.7 billion, including the $2.0
billion charge to conform Washington Mutual's loan loss allowance; however, this
charge is excluded from the following analyses. The managed provision for credit
losses was $4.7 billion, up $2.3 billion, or 98%, from the prior year. The total
consumer-managed provision for credit losses was $4.3 billion, compared with
$2.0 billion in the prior year, reflecting increases in the allowance for credit
losses related to home equity, subprime and prime mortgage and credit card
loans, as well as higher net charge-offs. Consumer-managed net charge-offs were
$3.3 billion, compared with $1.7 billion in the prior year, resulting in managed
net charge-off rates of 3.40% and 1.96%, respectively. The wholesale provision
for credit losses was $398 million, compared with $351 million in the prior
year, due to an increase in the allowance for credit losses reflecting the
effect of a weakening credit environment and loan growth. Wholesale net
charge-offs were $52 million, compared with net charge-offs of $82 million,
resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.10% and 0.19%, respectively. The firm had
total nonperforming assets of $15.9 billion at September 30, 2008, up from the
prior-year level of $3.0 billion. The amount at September 30, 2008 included $8.1
billion of nonperforming assets from the acquisition of Washington Mutual's
banking operations.

Noninterest expense was $11.1 billion, up $1.8 billion, or 19%, from the prior
year. The increase was driven by higher compensation expense and additional
operating costs relating to the Bear Stearns merger.

Notes:

1. In addition to analyzing the firm's results on a reported basis, management
analyzes the firm's results and the results of the lines of business on a
managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm's definition of
managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the
following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis
excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the
provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The
presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit
card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still
remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are
classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the
balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the
credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed
credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made about
allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed
financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing
risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized
loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to
a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the
customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer's
credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained
on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed-basis information is
useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks
associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm's retained
interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and
net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a
tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and
investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a
basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows
management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and
tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items
is recorded within income tax expense. See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase's Earnings
Release Financial Supplement (third quarter of 2008) for a reconciliation of
JPMorgan Chase's income statement from a reported basis to a managed basis.

2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total
net revenue, which is, in management's view, a comprehensive measure of pretax
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into
consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate
the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors.

(a) The third quarter of 2008 included an accounting conformity loan
 loss reserve provision related to the acquisition of Washington
 Mutual banking operations.
(b) JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of Washington
 Mutual for $1.9 billion. The fair value of Washington Mutual net
 assets acquired exceeded the purchase price which resulted in
 negative goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 141, nonfinancial assets
 that are not held for sale were written down against that negative
 goodwill. The negative goodwill that remained after writing down
 nonfinancial assets was recognized as an extraordinary gain.
(c) On September 30, 2008, the Firm issued $11.5 billion, or 284
 million shares, of its common stock at $40.50 per share.
(d) Ratios are based upon annualized amounts.
(e) Net income applicable to common stock divided by total average
 common equity (net of goodwill). The Firm uses return on equity less
 goodwill, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating
 performance of the Firm. The Firm also utilizes this measure to
 facilitate comparisons to competitors.
(f) The third quarter of 2008 included an accounting conformity loan
 loss reserve provision and an extraordinary gain related to the
 Washington Mutual transaction, as well as losses on preferred equity
 interests in Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") and
 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"). Prior periods
 included the after-tax impact of material litigation actions, tax
 audit benefits, equity earnings related to Bear Stearns and merger
 costs.
(g) Common equivalent shares have been excluded from the computation
 of diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2008, as the
 effect would be antidilutive.
(h) Estimated.
(i) Includes headcount related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual
 banking operations of 41,785.

&lt;p&gt;--  Third quarter EPS of $0.81, an increase of 14 percent; and
        $0.83 on a comparable basis, an increase of 17 percent.

   --  Third quarter net revenue growth of 9 percent; and 11 percent
        excluding impact from the disposal of certain bottlers.

   --  Worldwide unit case volume increased 5 percent in the quarter,
        led by 7 percent growth in International.

   --  Global volume and value share gains continue.

   --  Operating income increased 20 percent on a reported basis in
        the quarter; up 17 percent on a comparable basis.
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today reported third quarter earnings per
share of $0.81, an increase of 14 percent versus the prior year
quarter on a reported basis. After considering items impacting
comparability, earnings per share in the quarter were $0.83, an
increase of 17 percent. Earnings per share for the quarter included a
net charge of $0.02 per share for restructuring charges and costs
related to global productivity initiatives partially offset by a gain
on the sale of a portion of the Company's investment in the Pakistan
bottler. Earnings per share for the third quarter of 2007 were $0.71
and included a charge of $0.03 per share, primarily related to
restructuring charges, which was offset by a $0.03 per share gain
primarily related to the sale of a portion of the Company's investment
in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited.

   "We once again demonstrated our ability to perform consistently,
delivering our eighth consecutive quarter of double-digit comparable
earnings growth, despite an incredibly challenging economic
environment," said Muhtar Kent, president and chief executive officer,
The Coca-Cola Company. "We are managing our business for the future
with continued investment behind our brands and an increased focus on
effectiveness and efficiency. These efforts support long-term growth
while providing additional flexibility to enable sustainable results.
Importantly, our strategies are working as we diligently work
alongside our bottling partners to continue to deliver global volume
and value share gains.

   "Our system's ability to adapt to changing economic and consumer
environments was key to our success during the quarter, and we believe
that this adaptability will continue to be crucial to the business
going forward. Our International operations, in particular the
emerging markets, continue to drive our growth, more than offsetting
the challenges that we are addressing in North America. We anticipate
that the operating environment, especially in North America, will
continue to be challenging as we finish 2008 and move into 2009.
However, we have been diligent in taking the evolving landscape into
account as we are planning for 2009, and believe that the solid
fundamentals of our business, our strong balance sheet and cash
generating capability, the experience of our management team and the
strength of our brands will drive the business through these difficult
economic times. With our continued focus on superior execution and
driving productivity, I remain confident that the Coca-Cola system is
well positioned for the future."

   Financial Highlights

   --  Third quarter net operating revenues increased 9 percent.
        Revenue growth reflected a 3 percent increase in concentrate
        sales, a 2 percent benefit from pricing and mix and a 6

        and high single-digit growth in the Middle East and North and
        West Africa. In the quarter, Russia's unit case volume
        declined 3 percent, primarily reflecting the impact from
        continuing adverse weather conditions as well as a more
        challenging economic environment, and South Africa was up 1
        percent. Share gains continued for the group led by volume and
        value share gains in Russia and Turkey in nonalcoholic
        ready-to-drink beverages.

        reflecting the higher net revenues while continuing to invest
        behind key marketing initiatives across the group.

        growth in Northwest Europe and high single-digit growth in
        Eastern Europe. Europe delivered balanced growth with unit
        case volume for sparkling beverages up 3 percent and for still

        volume growth of 8 percent in the quarter, successfully

        economic environment. Retail unit case volume declined 1
        percent and Foodservice and Hospitality declined 3 percent.
        Net revenues for the quarter decreased 2 percent, reflecting a
        3 percent decrease in concentrate sales, partially offset by
        positive pricing and mix of finished goods. Operating income
        decreased 12 percent in the quarter reflecting the decrease in

        businesses, unfavorable mix and continued investment behind
        strategic marketing programs.

   --  Sparkling beverage unit case volume declined 2 percent in the

        share reflecting the benefits of the strong, integrated
        Olympics program in the quarter. The continued successful
        execution of the three-cola strategy resulted in Coca-Cola
        Classic, Diet Coke and Coca-Cola Zero combined gaining volume
        and value share in the U.S. Coca-Cola Zero continued to
        deliver strong performance, increasing unit case volume 30
        percent in the quarter, cycling strong double-digit growth in
        the prior year quarter.

   --  Still beverage unit case volume was even in the quarter and
        achieved volume and value share gains, due to the continued
        strong performance of glaceau and Fuze as well as strong
        growth in chilled warehouse juices and juice drinks behind the
        success of Trademark Simply and Minute Maid Enhanced Juices.

   --  The Pacific Group increased unit case volume 7 percent in the
        quarter, successfully cycling 11 percent growth in the prior
        year quarter. Net revenues increased 6 percent, reflecting a 9
        percent increase in concentrate sales, positive pricing and a
        high single-digit currency benefit, partially offset by
        unfavorable country mix. Operating income increased 15 percent
        reflecting the increase in net revenues while investing in key
        business initiatives, including the Olympics activation.

   --  In Japan, unit case volume increased 1 percent in the quarter,
        successfully cycling 4 percent growth in the prior year
        quarter, while achieving value share gains in nonalcoholic
        ready-to-drink beverages. Trademark Coca-Cola delivered unit
        case volume growth of 6 percent driven by the continued
        success of Coca-Cola Zero and the execution of the three-cola
        strategy. Georgia Coffee unit case volume increased 4 percent
        in the quarter and 3 percent year-to-date, its fourth
        consecutive quarter of growth led by growth in core flavors.
        Unit case volume declines in Sokenbicha and Aquarius reflected
        unfavorable weather in the quarter.

   --  In China, unit case volume increased 17 percent in the
        quarter, successfully cycling 20 percent growth in the prior
        year quarter. The results were led by double-digit unit case
        volume growth in Trademark Coca-Cola, Trademark Sprite and
        Minute Maid along with the successful launch of Yuan Ye, an
        original green leaf tea. The strong performance across the
        brands, supported by the successful execution of a fully
        integrated Olympics program, resulted in volume and value
        share gains in both sparkling and still beverages. In the
        third quarter, the Company announced its intention to purchase
        China Huiyuan Juice Group Limited for a total value of
        approximately $2.4 billion and continues to work with the
        local regulatory authorities to secure the necessary
        approvals.

   --  In the Philippines, unit case volume declined 9 percent in the
        quarter, reflecting the continuing pressure from the impact of
        food and fuel inflation on consumer discretionary spending as
        well as poor weather conditions. Despite the unit case volume
        decline, as a result of refocused marketing and successful
        in-market execution, volume and value share gains were
        achieved in nonalcoholic ready-to-drink beverages and in
        sparkling beverages.

   --  The Bottling Investments Group's unit case volume increased 7
        percent in the quarter, reflecting growth across most of the
        group, partially offset by the impact of structural changes.
        Net revenues increased 12 percent in the quarter as a result
        of the unit case volume increase, a high single-digit currency
        benefit and structural changes. Operating income increased 14
        percent in the quarter reflecting the net revenue increase and
        the benefits of supply chain efficiencies and controlled
        operating expenses, partially offset by continued investments
        to enhance market execution capabilities and higher input
        costs.

   Financial Review

   Operating Results

   Net operating revenues in the quarter increased 9 percent,
reflecting a 3 percent increase in concentrate sales, a 2 percent
benefit from pricing and mix and a 6 percent positive currency impact,
partially offset by a 2 percent decrease from structural changes
resulting primarily from the sale of certain bottlers.

   Cost of goods sold increased 5 percent in the quarter, reflecting
a 3 percent increase in concentrate sales, a 5 percent increase from
currency and increases in commodity-based input and freight costs,
partially offset by a 4 percent decrease from structural changes
resulting primarily from the sale of certain bottlers.

   Selling, general and administrative expenses in the quarter
increased 8 percent reflecting a 6 percent increase from currency. The
Company continued to achieve expense leverage through investing in
marketing to support brand growth while effectively managing general
and administrative expenses through productivity initiatives.

   The Company had other operating charges in the quarter of $47
million related to restructuring charges and costs related to global
productivity initiatives.

   Operating income in the quarter increased 20 percent, reflecting
the growth in net revenues, the investments in marketing and effective
management of general and administrative expenses. After considering
items impacting comparability, operating income increased 17 percent.
Currency increased operating income in the quarter by 9 percent. Based
on current expectations of market rates for the remainder of the year
and benefits of hedging coverage in place, the Company continues to
expect at least a mid single-digit favorable currency impact on full
year 2008 operating income.

   In the quarter, the Company recorded a gain of $16 million on the
sale of a portion of the Company's investment in the Pakistan bottler
to Coca-Cola Icecek A.S.

   Effective Tax Rate

   The reported effective tax rate for the quarter was 22.7 percent
and the underlying effective tax rate on operations for the quarter
was 22.0 percent. The variance between the reported rate and the
underlying rate was due to the tax impact of various separately
disclosed items impacting comparability.

   The Company anticipates that its underlying effective tax rate on
operations for the full year 2008 will be 22.0 percent. The Company's
estimated underlying effective tax rate does not reflect the impact of
discrete events, which, if and when they occur, are separately
recognized in the appropriate period.

   New Operating Structure

   As previously communicated, effective July 1, 2008, the Company
made certain changes to its operating structure to align geographic
responsibility. The European Union Group was reconfigured to include
the Adriatic and Balkans Region and was renamed the Europe Group; and
the remaining Eurasia Group was combined with the Africa Group into
the new Eurasia and Africa Group. The changes in operating structure
did not impact the other existing geographic operating segments,
Bottling Investments or Corporate. Reporting on the new structure
began this quarter. Reclassified operating segment information can be
found in the Company's Current Report on Form 8-K filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission on September 8, 2008.

   Items Impacting Prior Year Results

   In 2007, the third quarter results included a $0.03 per share
charge primarily related to restructuring charges which was offset by
a $0.03 per share gain primarily related to the sale of a portion of
the Company's investment in Coca-Cola Amatil Limited. In 2007, the
second quarter results included a net charge of $0.05 per share
primarily related to restructuring charges and a non-cash impairment
charge at an equity investee. In 2007, the first quarter results
included a net charge of $0.02 per share primarily related to an asset
write-off in the Philippines bottler, partially offset by gains on the
sales of the equity interest in a Brazil bottler and real estate in
Spain.

   Conference Call

   The Company will host a conference call with investors and
analysts to discuss the third quarter results today at 8:30 a.m.
(EDT). The Company invites investors to listen to the live audiocast
of the conference call at the Company's Web site,
www.thecoca-colacompany.com in the "Investors" section. A replay in
downloadable MP3 format will also be available within 24 hours after
the audiocast on the Company's Web site. Further, the "Investors"
section of the Company's Web site includes a reconciliation of
non-GAAP financial measures that may be used periodically by
management when discussing the Company's financial results with
investors and analysts to our results as reported under GAAP.

 negatively impacting net income are reflected as increases to
 reported net income. Gains and accounting changes positively
 impacting net income are reflected as deductions to reported net
 income.

 comparability for the three months ended September 26, 2008 is 5%,
 which is calculated by subtracting gross profit growth after
 considering items impacting comparability of 12% from operating
 income growth after considering items impacting comparability of 17%.

(4) Operating income after considering items impacting comparability
 for the three months ended September 26, 2008 includes a positive
 currency impact of approximately 9%. Currency neutral operating
 income growth after considering items impacting comparability is 8%.

(5) Per share amounts do not add due to rounding.

   The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U. S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management
believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the
business may provide users of this financial information additional
meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior
operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial
measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying
trends of the business because they provide a comparison of historical
information that excludes certain items that impact the overall
comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures
in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in
evaluating the Company's performance. See the Tables above for
supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP
financial measures for the three months ended September 26, 2008 and
September 28, 2007. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in
addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported
results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

   The Company reports its financial results in accordance with U. S.
generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, management
believes that certain non-GAAP financial measures used in managing the
business may provide users of this financial information additional
meaningful comparisons between current results and results in prior
operating periods. Management believes that these non-GAAP financial
measures can provide additional meaningful reflection of underlying
trends of the business because they provide a comparison of historical
information that excludes certain items that impact the overall
comparability. Management also uses these non-GAAP financial measures
in making financial, operating and planning decisions and in
evaluating the Company's performance. See the Tables above for
supplemental financial data and corresponding reconciliations to GAAP
financial measures for the nine months ended September 26, 2008 and
September 28, 2007. Non-GAAP financial measures should be viewed in
addition to, and not as an alternative for, the Company's reported
results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported third-quarter 2008
net income of $527 million, compared with net income of $3.4 billion
in the third quarter of 2007. Earnings per share were $0.11, compared
with $0.97 in the third quarter of 2007. Current-quarter results
include a charge of $1.2 billion (after-tax) to conform loan loss
reserves and an extraordinary gain of $581 million (after-tax),
related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual's banking operations,
which closed on September 25, 2008.

   Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented on
the quarter: "Our third quarter financial results declined sharply,
driven by markdowns on mortgage trading positions and leveraged loans,
and higher credit costs due to continued deterioration in our
home-lending portfolio. In this environment, we have kept our focus on
meeting our clients' needs and deploying capital wisely. We continue
to see numerous examples of organic growth, including in Investment
Banking market share, new checking accounts, net flows in Asset
Management and increased loan and liability balances in Commercial
Banking and Treasury &amp; Securities Services."

   Mr. Dimon further remarked: "I am pleased that we were in a
position during the quarter to purchase Washington Mutual's banking
operations, becoming the largest U.S. depository institution, with
more than $900 billion in deposits. We welcome Washington Mutual
employees to JPMorgan Chase and look forward to bringing together the
best of both firms. This acquisition adds more than 2,200 branches,
allowing us to expand nationwide - both in our existing markets and
into attractive new ones, in states like California, Florida and
Washington - and to further grow our other business lines through our
enhanced branch network."

   "We expect the Washington Mutual transaction to create long-term
value for shareholders while also being immediately accretive, adding
50 cents per share to earnings in 2009. In light of the unprecedented
challenges and risks facing the housing market, we have incorporated
expectations of significant credit losses from Washington Mutual's
home-lending portfolio into the structure of the transaction. We also
raised $11.5 billion of common equity to support the transaction and
add to our already substantial capital base."

   Dimon added: "Given the uncertainty in the capital markets,
housing sector and economy overall, it is reasonable to expect reduced
earnings for our firm over the next few quarters. However, with a
total loan loss allowance of $19 billion (including Washington Mutual)
and an 8.9% Tier 1 capital ratio, we feel well-positioned to handle
the turbulent environment and, most importantly, to continue to invest
in our businesses and serve our clients well."

   "Finally, I want to express how proud I am of our employees -
their outstanding efforts and commitment to building a great company
under extremely stressful circumstances has made a tremendous
difference in our ability to manage risk and execute complex
transactions. Together, we will continue to focus on creating a
stronger and more profitable franchise in the years to come."

   In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan
Chase as a firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed
basis starts with GAAP results and includes the following adjustments:
for Card Services and the firm as a whole, the impact of credit card
securitizations is excluded, and for each line of business and the
firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a tax-equivalent basis. For
more information about managed basis, as well as other non-GAAP
financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of
each line of business, see Notes 1 and 2 (page 13).

   The effects of Washington Mutual's banking operations are not
included in the discussion of the results of the business segments
below, as such operations did not have a material effect on the
results of the quarter ended September 30, 2008, except as follows:
(1) for JPMorgan Chase as a firm and for the Corporate/Private Equity
segment, the charge to conform Washington Mutual's loan loss reserves
and the extraordinary gain related to the transaction are reflected,
and (2) for consolidated information as of September 30, 2008, such as
the period end balance sheet, credit related statistics, capital
ratios and headcount, the amounts presented reflect the acquisition of
these banking operations.

   The following discussion compares the third quarter of 2008 with
the third quarter of 2007 unless otherwise noted.

======================================================================
*T

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was $882 million, an increase of $586 million from the
prior year. The improved results reflected an increase in net revenue
and the benefit of reduced deferred tax liabilities offset largely by
increased noninterest expense.

   Net revenue was $4.0 billion, an increase of $1.1 billion, or 37%,
from the prior year. Investment banking fees were $1.6 billion, up 20%
from the prior year. Advisory fees were $576 million, down 3% from the
prior year, reflecting decreased levels of activity. Debt underwriting
fees were $499 million, up 7%. Equity underwriting fees were $518
million, up 94% from the prior year. Fixed Income Markets revenue was
$815 million, up 19% from the prior year. The increase was driven by
record results in rates and currencies, and strong performance in
credit trading, emerging markets, and commodities, as well as gains of
$343 million from the widening of the firm's credit spread on certain
structured liabilities. Largely offsetting these results were
mortgage-related net markdowns of $2.6 billion, as well as $1.0
billion of net markdowns on leveraged lending funded and unfunded
commitments. Equity Markets revenue was a record $1.7 billion, up by
$1.1 billion from the prior year, driven by strong trading results and
client revenue, as well as a gain of $429 million from the widening of
the firm's credit spread on certain structured liabilities. Credit
Portfolio revenue was a loss of $23 million, down $415 million from
the prior year, reflecting net markdowns due to wider counterparty
credit spreads and fewer gains from loan workouts, largely offset by
higher net interest income and increased revenue from risk management
activities.

   The provision for credit losses was $234 million, compared with
$227 million in the prior year, reflecting a weakening credit
environment. Net charge-offs were $13 million, compared with $67
million in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses to total
loans retained was 3.85% for the current quarter, an increase from
1.80% in the prior year.

   Average loans retained were $69.0 billion, an increase of $7.1
billion, or 11%, from the prior year, largely driven by growth in
acquisition finance activity, including leveraged lending. Average
fair value and held-for-sale loans were $17.6 billion, up $297
million, or 2%, from the prior year.

   Noninterest expense was $3.8 billion, an increase of $1.4 billion,
or 60%, from the prior year, largely driven by higher compensation
expense and additional operating costs relating to the Bear Stearns
merger.

*T

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was $247 million, a decrease of $392 million, or 61%,
reflecting a significant increase in the provision for credit losses
in Regional Banking and higher noninterest expense in Mortgage
Banking. These factors were offset partially by revenue growth in all
businesses.

   Net revenue was $4.9 billion, an increase of $674 million, or 16%,
from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.1 billion, up $463
million, or 17%, due to higher loan and deposit balances and wider
deposit spreads. Noninterest revenue was $1.7 billion, up $211
million, or 14%, as higher net mortgage servicing revenue and
increased deposit-related fees were offset partially by declines in
education loan sales.

   The provision for credit losses was $1.7 billion, as housing price
declines have continued to result in significant increases in
estimated losses, particularly for high loan-to-value home equity and
mortgage loans. Home equity net charge-offs were $663 million (2.78%
net charge-off rate), compared with $150 million (0.65% net charge-off
rate) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net charge-offs were $273
million (7.65% net charge-off rate), compared with $40 million (1.62%
net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Prime mortgage net charge-offs
(including net charge-offs reflected in the Corporate segment) were
$177 million (1.51% net charge-off rate), compared with $9 million
(0.11% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. The current-quarter
provision includes an increase in the allowance for loan losses of
$450 million due to increases in estimated losses in the subprime and
home equity mortgage portfolios. An additional $250 million increase
in the allowance for loan losses for prime mortgage loans has been
reflected in the Corporate segment.

   Noninterest expense was $2.8 billion, an increase of $303 million,
or 12%, from the prior year, reflecting higher mortgage reinsurance
losses and increased servicing expense.

   Regional Banking net income was $218 million, down $393 million,
or 64%, from the prior year. Net revenue was $3.7 billion, up $363
million, or 11%, as the benefits of higher loan and deposit balances,
wider deposit spreads and higher deposit-related fees were offset
partially by declines in education loan sales. The provision for
credit losses was $1.6 billion, compared with $574 million in the
prior year. The provision reflected weakness in the home equity and
mortgage portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the
provision for credit losses for further detail). Noninterest expense
was $1.8 billion, up $13 million, or 1%, from the prior year.

        intangibles) decreased to 45% from 49%.

   Mortgage Banking reported a net loss of $50 million, compared with
a net loss of $48 million in the prior year. Net revenue was $666
million, up $260 million, or 64%. Net revenue comprises production
revenue and net mortgage servicing revenue. Production revenue was
$254 million, up $78 million, reflecting lower markdowns of $91
million on the mortgage warehouse and pipeline as compared with
markdowns of $186 million in the prior year. The current-year result
was also affected by an increase in reserves related to the offer to
repurchase of previously-sold loans. Net mortgage servicing revenue -
which includes loan servicing revenue, MSR risk management results and
other changes in fair value - was $412 million, an increase of $182
million, or 79%, from the prior year. Loan servicing revenue was $695
million, an increase of $66 million on growth of 14% in third-party
loans serviced. MSR risk management results were $107 million,
compared with negative $22 million in the prior year. Other changes in
fair value of the MSR asset were negative $390 million compared with
negative $377 million in the prior year. Noninterest expense was $747
million, an increase of $262 million, or 54%. The increase reflected
higher mortgage reinsurance losses and higher servicing costs due to
increased delinquencies and defaults.

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was $292 million, a decline of $494 million, or 63%,
from the prior year. The decrease was driven by a higher provision for
credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense.

   End-of-period managed loans were $159.3 billion, an increase of
$10.3 billion, or 7%, from the prior year and $3.9 billion, or 3%,
from the prior quarter. Average managed loans were $157.6 billion, an
increase of $8.9 billion, or 6%, from the prior year and $4.7 billion,
or 3%, from the prior quarter. The increase from the prior year in
both end-of-period and average managed loans reflects organic
portfolio growth.

   Managed net revenue was $3.9 billion, an increase of $20 million,
or 1%, from the prior year. Net interest income was $3.2 billion, up
$133 million, or 4%, from the prior year, driven by higher average
managed loan balances and wider loan spreads. These benefits were
offset partially by the effect of higher revenue reversals associated
with higher charge-offs. Noninterest revenue was $646 million, a
decrease of $113 million, or 15%, from the prior year. Interchange
income increased, benefiting from a 5% increase in charge volume, but
was more than offset by increased rewards expense and higher
volume-driven payments to partners (both of which are netted against
interchange income), as well as a decrease in securitization income.

   The managed provision for credit losses was $2.2 billion, an
increase of $866 million, or 64%, from the prior year, due to a higher
level of charge-offs and an increase of $250 million in the allowance
for loan losses. The managed net charge-off rate for the quarter was
5.00%, up from 3.64% in the prior year and 4.98% in the prior quarter.
The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 3.69%, up from 3.25% in the
prior year and 3.46% in the prior quarter.

   Noninterest expense was $1.2 billion, a decrease of $68 million,
or 5%, from the prior year due to lower marketing expense.

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was $312 million, an increase of $54 million, or 21%,
from the prior year, driven by record net revenue, partially offset by
an increase in the provision for credit losses and higher noninterest
expense.

   Net revenue was $1.1 billion, an increase of $116 million, or 11%,
from the prior year. Net interest income was $737 million, up $18
million, or 3%, driven by double-digit growth in loan and liability
balances, predominantly offset by spread compression in the liability
and loan portfolios. Noninterest revenue was $388 million, an increase
of $98 million, or 34%, from the prior year, reflecting higher
deposit-related fees, investment banking fees, and other income.

   Middle Market Banking revenue was $729 million, an increase of $49
million, or 7%, from the prior year. Mid-Corporate Banking revenue was
$236 million, an increase of $69 million, or 41%. Real Estate Banking
revenue was $91 million, a decline of $17 million, or 16%.

   The provision for credit losses was $126 million, an increase of
$14 million, or 13%, compared with the prior year. The current-quarter
provision reflects a weakening credit environment and growth in loan
balances. The allowance for loan losses to total loans retained was
2.65% for the current quarter, in line with the prior year and up from
2.61% in the prior quarter. Nonperforming loans were $572 million, up
$438 million from the prior year and up $86 million from the prior
quarter, reflecting increases across all businesses and the effect of
a weakening credit environment. Net charge-offs were $40 million
(0.22% net charge-off rate), compared with $20 million (0.13% net
charge-off rate) in the prior year and $49 million (0.28% net
charge-off rate) in the prior quarter.

   Noninterest expense was $486 million, an increase of $13 million,
or 3%, from the prior year, due to higher performance-based
compensation expense.

======================================================================
*T

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was $406 million, an increase of $46 million, or 13%,
from the prior year, driven by higher net revenue and the benefit of
reduced deferred tax liabilities. This increase was predominantly
offset by higher noninterest expense. Net income decreased by $19
million, or 4%, from the prior quarter, which benefited from seasonal
activity in securities lending, depositary receipts, and foreign
exchange volumes.

   Net revenue was $2.0 billion, an increase of $205 million, or 12%,
from the prior year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was
$1.1 billion, an increase of $88 million, or 9%, from the prior year.
The growth was driven by wider spreads on liability products and in
securities lending and foreign exchange, combined with increased
product usage by new and existing clients (largely in custody, fund
services and alternative investment services). These benefits were
offset partially by market depreciation. Treasury Services net revenue
was a record $897 million, an increase of $117 million, or 15%,
reflecting higher liability balances as well as volume growth in
electronic funds transfer products and trade loans. TSS firmwide net
revenue, which includes Treasury Services net revenue recorded in
other lines of business, grew to $2.7 billion, an increase of $260
million, or 11%. Treasury Services firmwide net revenue grew to $1.6
billion, an increase of $172 million, or 12%.

   Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $205 million,
or 18%, from the prior year, reflecting higher expense related to
business and volume growth as well as continued investment in new
product platforms.

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was $351 million, a decline of $170 million, or 33%,
from the prior year, driven largely by lower net revenue.

   Net revenue was $2.0 billion, a decrease of $244 million, or 11%,
from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $1.6 billion, a decline
of $331 million, or 17%, due to lower performance fees and the effect
of lower markets, including the impact of lower market valuations of
seed capital investments; these effects were offset partially by the
benefit of the Bear Stearns merger and increased revenue from net
asset inflows. Net interest income was $380 million, up $87 million,
or 30%, from the prior year, predominantly due to higher loan and
deposit balances and wider deposit spreads.

   Private Bank revenue was $631 million, relatively flat compared
with the prior year, as increased loan and deposit balances and higher
assets under management largely offset the effect of lower markets and
lower performance fees. Institutional revenue declined 19% to $486
million due to lower performance fees, partially offset by growth in
assets under management. Retail revenue decreased 38% to $399 million
due to the effect of lower markets, including the impact of lower
market valuations of seed capital investments and net equity outflows.
Private Wealth Management revenue grew 4% to $352 million due to
higher loan and deposit balances and growth in assets under
management. Bear Stearns Brokerage contributed $93 million to revenue.

   Assets under supervision were $1.6 trillion, an increase of $23
billion, or 1%, from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.2
trillion, down $10 billion, or 1%, from the prior year. The decrease
was predominantly due to lower equity markets and equity product
outflows, offset by liquidity product inflows across all segments and
the addition of Bear Stearns assets under management. Custody,
brokerage, administration and deposit balances were $409 billion, up
$33 billion, driven by the addition of Bear Stearns Brokerage.

   The provision for credit losses was $20 million, compared with $3
million in the prior year, reflecting an increase in loan balances and
a lower level of recoveries.

   Noninterest expense of $1.4 billion was flat compared with the
prior year as the effect of the Bear Stearns merger and increased
headcount were offset by lower performance-based compensation.

   Discussion of Results:

   Net loss for Corporate/Private Equity was $2.0 billion, compared
with net income of $513 million in the prior year.

   Net loss included a charge of $1.2 billion (after-tax) to conform
loan loss reserves and an extraordinary gain of $581 million
(after-tax) related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual's banking
operations, which closed on September 25, 2008. Net loss also included
$95 million (after-tax) of continuing Bear Stearns merger-related
items.

   Net loss for Private Equity was $164 million, compared with net
income of $409 million in the prior year. Net revenue was negative
$216 million, a decrease of $949 million, reflecting Private Equity
losses of $206 million, compared with gains of $766 million in the
prior year. Noninterest expense was $41 million, a decline of $54
million from the prior year, reflecting lower compensation expense.

   Excluding the above merger-related items, the net loss for
Corporate was $1.1 billion, compared with net income of $142 million
in the prior year. Net revenue was negative $1.5 billion, compared
with revenue of $268 million in the prior year. This decrease reflects
a higher level of trading losses, including losses of $1.0 billion on
preferred securities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, a $375 million
charge related to the offer to repurchase auction-rate securities, and
the absence of a $115 million gain from the sale of MasterCard shares
in the prior year. These losses were offset partially by securities
gains of $440 million. Excluding the provision related to Washington
Mutual, the current-quarter provision for credit losses of $378
million includes an increase in the allowance for loan losses of $250
million for prime mortgage (see Retail Financial Services' discussion
of the provision for loan losses for further detail). Noninterest
expense was negative $127 million, a decrease of $23 million from the
prior year, driven by lower litigation expense.

*T

   Discussion of Results:

   Net income was $527 million, a decrease of $2.8 billion, or 84%,
from the prior year. The decline in earnings was driven by a higher
provision for credit losses and increased noninterest expense.

   Managed net revenue was $16.1 billion, a decrease of $889 million,
or 5%, from the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $5.2 billion, down
$3.3 billion, or 39%, due to lower principal transactions revenue,
which reflected mortgage-related net markdowns and net markdowns on
leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments. Net interest income
was $10.9 billion, up $2.4 billion, or 29%, due to higher
trading-related net interest income and higher loan and deposit
balances.

   The managed provision for credit losses was $6.7 billion,
including the $2.0 billion charge to conform Washington Mutual's loan
loss allowance; however, this charge is excluded from the following
analyses. The managed provision for credit losses was $4.7 billion, up
$2.3 billion, or 98%, from the prior year. The total consumer-managed
provision for credit losses was $4.3 billion, compared with $2.0
billion in the prior year, reflecting increases in the allowance for
credit losses related to home equity, subprime and prime mortgage and
credit card loans, as well as higher net charge-offs. Consumer-managed
net charge-offs were $3.3 billion, compared with $1.7 billion in the
prior year, resulting in managed net charge-off rates of 3.40% and
1.96%, respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was
$398 million, compared with $351 million in the prior year, due to an
increase in the allowance for credit losses reflecting the effect of a
weakening credit environment and loan growth. Wholesale net
charge-offs were $52 million, compared with net charge-offs of $82
million, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.10% and 0.19%,
respectively. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $15.9 billion
at September 30, 2008, up from the prior-year level of $3.0 billion.
The amount at September 30, 2008 included $8.1 billion of
nonperforming assets from the acquisition of Washington Mutual's
banking operations.

   Noninterest expense was $11.1 billion, up $1.8 billion, or 19%,
from the prior year. The increase was driven by higher compensation
expense and additional operating costs relating to the Bear Stearns
merger.

   Notes:

   1. In addition to analyzing the firm's results on a reported
basis, management analyzes the firm's results and the results of the
lines of business on a managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial
measure. The firm's definition of managed basis starts with the
reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the following adjustments:
First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis excludes the
impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the
provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The
presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that
credit card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance
with SFAS 140 still remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings
on the securitized loans are classified in the same manner as the
earnings on retained loans recorded on the balance sheet. JPMorgan
Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the credit
performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed
credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made
about allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon
managed financial information. In addition, the same underwriting
standards and ongoing risk monitoring are used for both loans on the
balance sheet and securitized loans. Although securitizations result
in the sale of credit card receivables to a trust, JPMorgan Chase
retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the customers may
continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer's credit
performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans
retained on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed-basis
information is useful to investors, enabling them to understand both
the credit risks associated with the loans reported on the balance
sheet and the firm's retained interests in securitized loans. Second,
managed revenue (noninterest revenue and net interest income) for each
of the segments and the firm is presented on a tax-equivalent basis.
Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and investments that
receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a basis
comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology
allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from
both taxable and tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax
impact related to these items is recorded within income tax expense.
See page 6 of JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release Financial Supplement
(third quarter of 2008) for a reconciliation of JPMorgan Chase's
income statement from a reported basis to a managed basis.

   2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense
divided by total net revenue, which is, in management's view, a
comprehensive measure of pretax performance derived by measuring
earnings after all costs are taken into consideration. It is,
therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate the
performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors.

(a) The third quarter of 2008 included an accounting conformity loan
 loss reserve provision related to the acquisition of Washington
 Mutual banking operations.
(b) JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of Washington
 Mutual for $1.9 billion. The fair value of Washington Mutual net
 assets acquired exceeded the purchase price which resulted in
 negative goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 141, nonfinancial assets
 that are not held for sale were written down against that negative
 goodwill. The negative goodwill that remained after writing down
 nonfinancial assets was recognized as an extraordinary gain.
(c) On September 30, 2008, the Firm issued $11.5 billion, or 284
 million shares, of its common stock at $40.50 per share.
(d) Ratios are based upon annualized amounts.
(e) Net income applicable to common stock divided by total average
 common equity (net of goodwill). The Firm uses return on equity less
 goodwill, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating
 performance of the Firm. The Firm also utilizes this measure to
 facilitate comparisons to competitors.
(f) The third quarter of 2008 included an accounting conformity loan
 loss reserve provision and an extraordinary gain related to the
 Washington Mutual transaction, as well as losses on preferred equity
 interests in Federal National Mortgage Association ("FNMA") and
 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation ("Freddie Mac"). Prior periods
 included the after-tax impact of material litigation actions, tax
 audit benefits, equity earnings related to Bear Stearns and merger
 costs.
(g) Common equivalent shares have been excluded from the computation
 of diluted earnings per share for the third quarter of 2008, as the
 effect would be antidilutive.
(h) Estimated.
(i) Includes headcount related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual
 banking operations of 41,785.

&lt;p&gt; * U.S. stock futures are pointing to a lower open on Wall
Street, following Tuesday's decline, as worries on the economy
and corporate profits begin to outweigh positive sentiment from
the banking bailout plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * At 0955 GMT, Dow Jones futures DJc1 and SP 500 futures
SPc1 were down 1.5 and 1.7 percent respectively. Futures for
the Nasdaq NDc1 were down 0.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Third-quarter earnings from investment banking giant JP
Morgan (JPM) are the corporate highlight, with analysts
forecasting a loss of 29 cents a share, compared with a profit
of 97 cents a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Intel Corp. (INTC.O) shares shot up more than 4 percent
after the bell on Tuesday after the microprocessor maker
reported earnings that exceeded analysts' expectations. For more
see [ID:nWNAB6996].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The stock rose to $16.72 in electronic trading after
closing the regular session down 6 percent to $15.93. The shares
were up 3.6 percent in Frankfurt (INTC.F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Macro data due includes producer prices for September, set
to show prices falling 0.4 percent, compared with a 0.9 percent
fall in August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Retail sales for September are likely to have fallen 0.7
percent, compared with a fall of 0.3 percent in August.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Internet auction company eBay (EBAY.O) is set to report a
profit of 41 cents a share, unchanged from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Others to report include Abbott Laboratories (ABT), and

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst

news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE), Simon

   Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:

   Pfizer Upgraded on Value &amp; Yield

   The relatively cheap price of Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE: PFE) stock, its
very attractive dividend yield (8.45%), strong balance sheet and less
cyclical product suite warrants a Buy recommendation. We expect the
dividend yield to be safe for at least the next 18 months, and a
relatively stable revenue base to result in Pfizer's shares
outperforming over the next 6 to 12 months. We also think that there
is some upside to our current $22 target price if Pfizer can
accelerate their growth rate via some significant M activity.

   We believe Pfizer continues to face an uphill battle in growing
its topline given the pharmaceutical company's sheer size and lack of
a significant pipeline. While near-term earnings growth will come in
the form of cost-cutting and share repurchases, the company lacks a
catalyst to increase revenues once Lipitor loses patent exclusivity.

   Simon Property in Prime Position

   Despite the 30% share price drop over the past six months, we are
maintaining our Buy recommendation on Simon Property Group (NYSE:
SPG). The company has good assets, geographic diversity, and a stable
balance sheet with plenty of cash, a must in the current credit
constrained environment.

   Share prices of regional mall REITs have fallen dramatically over
the past quarter, although there was somewhat of a recovery (Monday).
We are very cautious of retail in an environment where consumer
spending will continue to weaken. We expect a rough holiday shopping
season.

   Kroger Shares Have a Lot in Store

   Kroger Co. (NYSE: KR) is one of the largest grocery retailers in
the U.S. and also the top-rated stock in the Zacks Supermarket
Industry. The shares are down about 14% since October 1. We think this
sell-off is overdone and view this entry point as buying opportunity.
As such, we are upgrading the stock from Hold to Buy.

   On September 16, Kroger reported better-than-expected results for
the second quarter, beating on the top and bottom lines. Management
also maintained its full-year EPS guidance of $1.85-$1.90. Kroger's
low prices and private-label brands continue to help the company take
market share from competitors despite the weak economic environment.
The company's tight cost controls also help to offset the decline in
its gross margin.

   Satyam Attractive on Lower Rupee

   Satyam Computer Services, Ltd. (NYSE: SAY) reported a solid fiscal
first quarter of 2009 with revenues and earnings ahead of our
estimates, both on dollar and rupee terms, in the face of a weaker
rupee.

   The company continues to make selective strategic acquisitions
like that of Belgium-based S Management Consultants to strengthen
its supply chain strategy capabilities. It has also agreed to acquire
Caterpillar, Inc.'s (NYSE: CAT) Market Research and Customer Analytics
(MR) operations. Satyam has employed a long-term strategy of
increasing the proportion of offshore services to increase
profitability of contracts.

&lt;p&gt;Dassault Systemes Announces Accelerated Simulation Performance with Microsoft's Windows HPC Server 2008

      R Systems Achieves Significant Speed-Up for Abaqus FEA from
             SIMULIA Using Flexible Cluster Configuration
PARIS &amp; PROVIDENCE, R.I.--(Business Wire)--
Dassault Systemes (DS) (Paris:DSY) (NASDAQ:DASTY) (Nasdaq: DASTY;
Euronext Paris: #13065, DSY.PA), a world leader in 3D and Product
Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions, today announced that R Systems,
a technology-leading IT solutions provider, in cooperation with
SIMULIA and Dana Holding Corporation, has completed a simulation
benchmark using Abaqus FEA software and Windows HPC Server 2008.

   "With Windows HPC Server 2008, Microsoft has made huge
advancements in performance and scaling that give users of realistic
simulation solutions more IT flexibility," stated Brian Kucic, VP of
business development for R Systems. "Using the analysis model provided
by Dana and the same 32-node compute cluster, we evaluated the
performance of Abaqus FEA software on both Linux and Windows.
Switching between the two operating systems was straightforward and
the performance of Windows HPC Server 2008 was highly competitive."

   Using 128 cores of a 256 core Intel Harpertown cluster with Quad
Data Rate Infiniband, R Systems performed the benchmark study of a
finite element analysis model provided by Dana to evaluate distributed
memory performance of Abaqus FEA on Windows. The analysis, which
normally takes a little over 2 days to complete using 8 cores, ran to
completion in just under 3.5 hours.

   "We were extremely pleased by the outcome of the R Systems study,"
stated Frank Popielas, manager advanced engineering, Sealing Products
Group, Dana Holding. "The combination of flexible computing clusters
and the power of parallel processing enabled by SIMULIA and Microsoft
will result in significant time and money savings for Dana and the
manufacturing industry as a whole."

   "SIMULIA is focused on optimizing the performance of our robust
and scalable simulation software for Windows HPC Server 2008," stated
Steve Crowley, director of product management, SIMULIA, Dassault
Systemes. "R Systems provided excellent computing resources for our
team to assess the performance of Windows HPC Server 2008 using Dana's
model. We were highly impressed with the results and believe Windows
HPC Server 2008 makes supercomputing more accessible by allowing our
end-users to harness the power of distributed computing through a
familiar Windows desktop environment."

   Running Abaqus FEA software on a Windows-based cluster provides
engineers with an integrated, efficient, and easily scalable
high-performance computing platform for solving some of the most
complex simulation and multiphysics analysis equations in less time by
leveraging the combination of Abaqus distributed-memory parallel
technology and Windows clustering solutions.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), the biggest technology services company, said it expects to meet long-term profit forecasts despite economic turmoil, partly due to continued growth in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company also said it had good access to funds, a strong liquidity position, and $10 billion in cash -- unchanged from June -- on top of its $10 billion revolving credit facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world's biggest maker of mainframe computers and No. 2 software producer, made the comments on Thursday while releasing quarterly results that confirmed preliminary figures released last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares rose 2.4 percent in after-market trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company posted a higher-than-expected third-quarter profit and reaffirmed its full-year outlook despite weaker quarterly revenue due to a stronger dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Mark Loughridge said on Thursday that IBM is not among the group of large corporations suffering from liquidity problems. He added that the business outlook remains strong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think we have shown real momentum," he said of the results for the third quarter ended Sept 30. "We are confident as we go into the fourth quarter and 2009."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM did not issue a profit forecast for next year, but it reiterated its outlook for 2008. Loughridge said the company remains on track to meet its goal of boosting profit to between $10 and $11 a share by 2010, despite the weakening economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIQUIDITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said on a conference call that IBM has about $4.5 billion in 1-to-3 month commercial paper that it could easily pay off if market conditions ever required it to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've had absolutely no problems at all with access to the market," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's steady performance has helped its stock hold up better than many tech shares that have been battered during the global financial crisis. IBM shares have lost 18 percent so far this year, versus a 37 percent drop in the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from IBM's services business, its largest segment, climbed 8 percent to $14.8 billion. Revenue at its software division, its most profitable, rose 12 percent to $5.2 billion. Hardware sales fell 10 percent to $4.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge said that the software division has a healthy pipeline of business prospects that should enable it to keep business growing even given the current weak economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales to companies in the financial services sector, IBM's largest group of customers, rose 7 percent to $7 billion. Within that group its revenue in the United States fell 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its government business rose 9 percent to $4 billion, while sales to small and mid-sized businesses rose 5 percent to $4.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York company said that third-quarter net income rose to $2.8 billion, or $2.05 per share, from $2.4 billion, or $1.68 per share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent to $25.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares were quoted at $93.75 in extended trade. They had climbed $3.23 to $91.52 on the New York Stock Exchange before the results were released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle, editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) expects sales in developing countries such as Brazil, Russia, India and China to continue to grow at a healthy clip for at least another six months, said Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest technology services company has seen sales in those countries and other emerging markets climb far faster than in the United States, Western Europe and other developed economies in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge said in an interview on Thursday that he expects the trend to continue as governments, public agencies and large corporations hire IBM to help them with projects to modernize infrastructure such as telecommunications, banking and transportation systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we look at the headlights, we have our strongest headlights extending about six months into the future. We see very strong opportunities here," he said. "There are big opportunities for the roll-out of these infrastructure projects."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the third quarter ended Sept 30, IBM reported a 51 percent surge in revenue in Russia, a 28 percent jump in Brazil and a 24 percent spike in India. Overall sales rose 13 percent in emerging markets during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That compares with revenue gains of just 1 percent in the United States, 10 percent in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region, and 6 percent in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge said that revenue only climbed 3 percent during the quarter in China, but he attributed the slow growth to the Olympic Games, saying business in the country slowed down in August as the country tuned in to the Games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China ... was very strong at the beginning of quarter. (There was a) pause during the Olympics. We expect that will come back in Q4," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), the world's biggest technology services company, posted a higher quarterly profit on Thursday as an increase in services and software revenue offset a decline in computer hardware sales.&lt;/p&gt;

IBM shares have lost 18 percent so far this year, versus a 37 percent drop in the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue from IBM's services business, its largest segment, climbed 8 percent to $14.8 billion. Revenue at its software division, its most profitable, rose 12 percent to $5.2 billion. Hardware sales fell 10 percent to $4.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York company said that third-quarter net income rose to $2.8 billion, or $2.05 per share, from $2.4 billion, or $1.68 per share, a year earlier.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said a Web search advertising deal with Yahoo Inc makes economic sense and may still be possible, though the two sides are not in any discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo jumped as much as 17 percent as investors hoped Ballmer's comments could lead to the two sides returning to the negotiating table. But gains were pared back to about 12 percent after Microsoft issued a statement saying it had no interest in buying Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between the two broke off in July after Yahoo rejected Microsoft's proposal to buy its search advertising business and enact a revenue-sharing partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo had also rebuffed in May a full acquisition bid from Microsoft that was priced at $33 per share, or $47.5 billion. Instead, Yahoo signed a search advertising pact with Web leader Google Inc, which is being scrutinized by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perhaps there will continue to remain opportunities to partner around search," Ballmer told a Gartner Inc conference in Orlando, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not in any discussions with them. We'll see. They want to remain independent. There are probably still opportunities around search. I think it would still make sense economically for their shareholders and ours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since talks broke off, Yahoo shares have plunged to a 5-1/2-year low of $11.37, weighed by concerns over the outlook for Web display advertising, as major advertisers such as banks and automakers cut back spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We offered 33 bucks not too long ago and it's 11 and a half. So I don't know what price might have got the job done," Ballmer said, responding to a question from Gartner analyst David Smith on whether Microsoft might take another stab at buying Yahoo now that its stock price is so low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that Yahoo did not want to sell the company. It did not want to sell when we offered 33 ... They probably think it's worth at least 33 today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo declined comment. Its shares rose to as high as $13.73 on Thursday, before settling at around $13.16 in late trading on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our position hasn't changed. Microsoft has no interest in acquiring Yahoo; there are no discussions between the companies," a spokesman for Microsoft said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 3.6 percent at $23.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the market's excitement, any pursuit of new talks would be impeded by several issues, including Yahoo's severely depressed stock price and the poor outlook for the advertising market due to the weak economy, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The larger issue is strategic fit," Cross Research analyst Richard Williams said. "Microsoft clearly has spent money and changed its focus to 'build' rather than 'buy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that for businesses driven by advertising, such as Microsoft and Yahoo's Internet operations, it is the wrong time for a deal with markets reeling and consumer confidence plummeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Going into a recession is about the worst time to buy an advertising firm," Williams said.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst quote, updates stock prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Franklin Paul&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 16 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer said a Web search advertising deal with
Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) makes economic sense and may still be
possible, though the two sides are not in any discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Yahoo jumped as much as 17 percent as investors
hoped Ballmer's comments could lead to the two sides returning
to the negotiating table. But gains were pared back to about 12
percent after Microsoft issued a statement saying it had no
interest in buying Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks between the two broke off in July after Yahoo
rejected Microsoft's proposal to buy its search advertising
business and enact a revenue-sharing partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo had also rebuffed in May a full acquisition bid from
Microsoft that was priced at $33 per share, or $47.5 billion.
Instead, Yahoo signed a search advertising pact with Web leader
Google Inc (GOOG.O), which is being scrutinized by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Perhaps there will continue to remain opportunities to
partner around search," Ballmer told a Gartner Inc conference
in Orlando, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are not in any discussions with them. We'll see. They
want to remain independent. There are probably still
opportunities around search. I think it would still make sense
economically for their shareholders and ours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since talks broke off, Yahoo shares have plunged to a
5-1/2-year low of $11.37, weighed by concerns over the outlook
for Web display advertising, as major advertisers such as banks
and automakers cut back spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We offered 33 bucks not too long ago and it's 11 and a
half. So I don't know what price might have got the job done,"
Ballmer said, responding to a question from Gartner analyst
David Smith on whether Microsoft might take another stab at
buying Yahoo now that its stock price is so low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's clear that Yahoo did not want to sell the company. It
did not want to sell when we offered 33 ... They probably think
it's worth at least 33 today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo declined comment. Its shares rose to as high as
$13.73 on Thursday, before settling at around $13.16 in late
trading on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our position hasn't changed. Microsoft has no interest in
acquiring Yahoo; there are no discussions between the
companies," a spokesman for Microsoft said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares were up 3.6 percent at $23.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the market's excitement, any pursuit of new talks

News Quotes

    Director of BreakingPoint Labs, H D Moore

    "The second Tuesday of every month is a busy time at BreakingPoint; myself
and the rest of the security team drop everything and focus entirely on
the patches released by Microsoft. Our team grabs the patches as soon as
they drop, often hours before actual security bulletins are posted. We
split up the patches across the team and get to work, analyzing the
patched binaries, reproducing the flaws, and writing exploit code. Each
exploit is expanded into specific test cases, which are then uploaded by
the BreakingPoint Labs team to the Strike Center for our users to update
their BreakingPoint product. Within 24 hours of the Microsoft Tuesday
release, our customers are using these Strikes to verify their security
solutions and write new signatures when necessary."

    CTO and Co-founder of BreakingPoint Systems, Dennis Cox

    "Every Tuesday companies scramble to patch their networks and protect
themselves, a demanding process in terms of time and cost. The same
certainly goes for network equipment manufacturers and service providers,
who actually have the unique problem of testing a plethora of disparate
network equipment, quickly and realistically, to determine which is
vulnerable. Making it quick and easy to test your equipment with these
bugs, and just as quickly understanding your vulnerabilities, is what we
provide BreakingPoint users. Testing is a necessity for performance and
security, but it also should be as painless as possible."

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details, share movement)

 Oct 16 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded eBay
Inc (EBAY.O) while at least 7 other brokerages cut their price
targets on the stock Thursday, a day after the online auction
leader gave a disappointing fourth-quarter outlook.

 Shares of the company fell as much as 11 percent to 13.69,
their lowest in more than five years, but pared some losses and
were down $1.20 at $14.12 in midday trade on Nasdaq.

 "We believe eBay's biggest challenge is an inferior
technology platform, which is making it difficult for the
company to compete with other eCommerce platforms, such as
Amazon's (AMZN.O)," J.P. Morgan analyst Imran Khan said.

 Khan downgraded the stock to "neutral" from "overweight."

 The company's future growth will be inhibited, even after
the economy recovers, if it fails to improve user experience,
he wrote in a note to clients.

 The brokerage cut its earnings estimates for eBay for the
second time in a week said it expects the company's GAAP
earnings will be up only 3 percent next year.

 "We expect margins to contract, resulting in anemic
operating income growth," Khan said.

 STRUGGLE TO CONTINUE

 Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay, who cut his
price target on the stock to $22 from $31, said the steady
gains in metrics such as number of active users were being
offset by declining sales rates and falling gross merchandise
volume.

 Analysts at Stifel Nicolaus, RBC and Jefferies  Co also
voiced their concerns on the same, saying decline in gross
merchandise volume demonstrated continued struggle.

 The company's gross merchandise volume (GMV) for the third
quarter decreased by 1 percent to $14.28 billion.

 "...The GMV weakness that appeared in the third quarter at
eBay and projected by management to reoccur in the fourth
quarter will continue into 2009," brokerage Soleil said. It cut
its price target on the stock to $16 from $25.

 EBay's fourth quarter is usually its strongest due to the
holiday sales but on Wednesday the company forecast adjusted
fourth-quarter earnings well below Wall Street estimates.
[ID:nN13459713]

 Sanford analyst Lindsay said he expects a recessionary
environment to persist through much of 2009, both at home and
abroad, and anticipates eBay's 2009 revenue growth of only 3
percent and earnings of $1.72 per share.

 The analyst, however, said he remains positive on the
prospects of the company and the stock, and maintained his
"outperform" rating.

 The following is the list of price target changes:

 Brokerage                  Price Target

                        Current        Previous

 Sanford C. Bernstein   $22            $31

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 16 (Reuters) - Today's tumultuous market
represents the best buying opportunity of the past decade for
secondary private equity assets, the head of listed investment
trust JP Morgan Private Equity Ltd BPLE.L said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan Private Equity is one of a number of the group's
private equity funds and the former quoted private equity fund
of Bear Stearns, the first banking casualty of the credit
crunch. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It focuses on buying interests of up to $25 million in other
high-performance private equity funds from distressed investors
or forced sellers and has around $600 million dollars of assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is the best buying opportunity we have seen in the
last 10 years or so because there are many more motivated
sellers or distressed sellers who are looking for liquidity in
these markets," said Senior Managing Director Gregory S.
Getschow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added the JP Morgan fund, which targets investors three
or four years into the private equity investment cycle, can
aquire the fund interests "at much better prices today than we
ever have been able to".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Getschow said the amount of funds ploughed into private
equity in the last three to four years - and higher levels of
distress - have meant a great supply of assets as banks,
insurance companies, pension endowments and high net worth
individuals put portfolios on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Getschow said the majority of sellers are now approaching
the private equity fund, compared with a couple of years ago
when the fund sought out 80 to 90 percent of forced sellers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Matching of buyer and seller can be very inefficient and
that can be one of the big opportunities - if you are the
holder, you're not really sure who to go to to sell it and
you're not really sure what these assets are worth," he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Wells
Fargo  Co (WFC.N) may emerge as long-term winners in the quake
that has shaken up U.S. banks. Their staying power will be
tested by their ability to complete their high-risk mergers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's $1.9 billion purchase of Washington Mutual Inc's
WAMUQ.PK banking units and Wells Fargo's planned purchase of
Wachovia Corp WB.N, originally valued at $15.1 billion, add
large, powerful retail branch networks to what were already two
of the biggest banks in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both purchase prices are only a small fraction of what the
targets were once worth and reflected evaporating investor
confidence that Wachovia and Washington Mutual would have the
time and capital to combat soaring mortgage losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While JPMorgan and Wells Fargo quarterly results topped
forecasts on Wednesday, their continued prosperity may be at
risk as the economy slides into what some expect will be a deep
recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Trying to integrate companies in the midst of a difficult
operating environment is challenging, to say the least," said
Chris Hagedorn, who helps invest $21.4 billion at Fifth Third
Asset Management in Cincinnati. "These companies have done big
integrations in the past and I would give them the benefit of
the doubt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has had three large mergers in recent years: Chase
Manhattan Corp's 2000 purchase of JP Morgan  Co, the 2004
purchase of Bank One Corp and May's rescue of Bear Stearns Cos.
Wells Fargo has not had one since 1998, when Norwest Corp
bought the old Wells Fargo and took its name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the success of the Washington Mutual and
Wachovia takeovers depends on their acquirers' abilities to
live up to their past records at merger integration and a
presumption they properly assessed credit risks. JPMorgan is
writing down $31 billion for Washington Mutual loans, while
Wells Fargo expects to write off $74 billion from Wachovia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ECONOMY SAGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But economic conditions are not good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We necessarily need to be prepared for a bad environment,"
JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call.
He later added: "If you are not fearful, you're crazy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Wells Fargo Chief Financial Officer Howard
Atkins said it is a "good working assumption" that the economy
is in recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The steps taken by the government will help over time and
we'll see what happens," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Richard Moroney, chief investment officer of Horizon
Investment Services LLC in Hammond, Indiana, said JPMorgan and
Wells Fargo are "taking on huge risks, but getting huge
opportunities. It depends on how bad mortgages, car loans and
credit cards are going to get. There are also integration
issues: getting computers to work, getting people to work
together. We've seen those things go awry at other banks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; THE GOOD AND THE BAD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, Wachovia itself has seen both sides of the coin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before buying the former Wachovia in 2001 and taking its
name, First Union Corp lost thousands of customers when it
botched the takeover of Philadelphia's CoreStates Financial. It
also lost $2 billion when it shut down Money Store, a lender to
people with poor credit histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ken Thompson, the former chief executive of First Union and
later Wachovia, at first shed that bank's reputation for poor
integrations, smoothly absorbing the old Wachovia, as well as
Alabama's SouthTrust Corp, a 2004 purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he shattered that progress with a $24.2 billion
purchase of California mortgage lender Golden West Financial
Corp in October 2006, just as the housing market was about to
crash. Many analysts at first thought Wachovia overpaid,
although even they did not see the scope of the eventual
deterioration at Golden West, once regarded as a conservative
lender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual, meanwhile, last month became the largest
U.S. bank ever to fail, following rapid expansion into subprime
mortgages, home equity loans and option adjustable-rate
mortgages, the latter also a Golden West specialty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Michael Cavanagh told
analysts the integration of Washington Mutual, acquired three
weeks ago, is "progressing well." He also said Washington
Mutual -- now backed by JPMorgan -- has staunched the deposit
outflows that prompted regulators to seize it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Atkins said a key feature of the Wachovia
takeover "is to combine our sales and cross-sell culture with
Wachovia's service culture." Wells Fargo emphasizes selling
several products to each customer, while Wachovia usually ranks
near the top of independent customer satisfaction surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Wells Fargo is a company known for going slow in
integrating deals and, if it is smart, will move quickly to
identify and retain much of Wachovia's key talent," wrote Kevin
Fitzsimmons, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill  Partners LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Elinor Comlay and Dan Wilchins;

   Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:

   What a Deal!

   This is an extraordinarily sweet deal for the big banks that are
part of this (Treasury's infusion of capital), including JP Morgan
(NYSE: JPM), Citigroup (NYSE: C), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Wells
Fargo (NYSE: WFC), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), and others.

   In this environment, 5% is very cheap capital. There is no
prepayment penalty, but not that it matters -- they would be nuts to
add something like that. The banks can continue paying dividends on
the common, so as the money comes in the front door, it can go right
out the back. Eliminating common dividends is one of the quickest and
fairest ways of increasing the capital of a bank.

&lt;p&gt; * U.S. stock futures were pointing to a slightly higher open
on Wall Street on Thursday -- following the previous session,
which was its worst day since the stock market crash of 1987 --
as investors awaited a flurry of corporate earnings and economic
data that will shed light on the economic outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * By 0800 GMT, SP 500 futures SPc1 were up 1.2 percent,
Dow Jones futures DJc1 up 0.7 percent and Nasdaq 100 futures
NDc1 up 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Wall Street tumbled on Wednesday, as dismal economic data
fuelled worries that all the government efforts to unlock credit
markets may not stave off a severe recession. U.S Federal
Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke added to those concerns when he
said the economy faced a "significant threat" from paralyzed
credit markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slid 733.08
points, or 7.87 percent, to 8,577.91, while the Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX tumbled 90.17 points, or 9.03 percent,
to 907.84. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC sank 150.68
points, or 8.47 percent, to 1,628.33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asian stocks plummeted overnight, with the Nikkei average
falling 11.4 percent, while Europe's benchmark FTSEurofirst 300
.FTEU3 index dropped nearly 6 percent in early trade, before
trimming losses, still down 2.2 percent at 0800 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * The focus will be on a flurry of quarterly results from
companies such as Citigroup (C.N), Merrill Lynch MER.N, IBM
(IBM.N), Google (GOOG.O) and United Technologies Corp (UTX.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Citigroup is expected to post a net loss of about $3.5
billion, as it writes down toxic assets and sets aside more
money for credit losses. The largest U.S. bank by assets has not
posted a profit since the second quarter of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Merrill Lynch is expected to uncover heavy writedowns from
its portfolio of mortgage securities when it announces quarterly
earnings. Investors are looking for an update on the performance
of its wealth management unit, which has so far held up well
during the credit crunch but may have lost advisors since the
announcement of its acquisition by Bank of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Tech bellwether IBM reports third-quarter results that
should confirm the higher-than-expected preliminary quarterly
profit and full-year outlook affirmation issued in its surprise
preliminary report last Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * On the macro front, investors will focus on weekly jobless
claims, consumer prices data and the Philadelphia Fed survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Blaise Robinson)

&lt;p&gt; * Credit losses rise, may remain elevated&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan and Wells Fargo shares fall less than markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Hudson City results also top views, shares rise&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, paragraphs 4, 8-9, 26)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Elinor Comlay and Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Wells
Fargo  Co (WFC.N) posted better-than-expected earnings on
Wednesday despite higher credit losses, underlining their
standing as among the strongest big banks in the battered U.S.
financial sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The banks are the first major U.S. lenders to report
results for the third quarter, a difficult period for banks
that grew dire in late September as credit markets seized up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you are not fearful, you're crazy," JPMorgan Chief
Executive Jamie Dimon said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though quarterly profit fell 84 percent at JPMorgan and 25
percent at Wells Fargo, the banks' shares fell less than rivals
as investors were heartened that tighter credit and a souring
economy didn't hurt results more. Both banks added deposits as
nervous customers fled weaker rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you were a bull, the results confirm these companies
will be survivors," said Richard Moroney, chief investment
officer of Horizon Investment Services LLC in Hammond, Indiana.
"They both had major deterioration in credit, and that's hardly
a pretty picture, but results didn't seem that bad."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both banks are making big bets on the economic outlook with
acquisitions of major lenders felled by risky home loans.
JPMorgan last month bought Washington Mutual Inc's WAMUQ.PK
bank units for $1.9 billion, and Wells Fargo is buying Wachovia
Corp WB.N in a takeover originally valued at $15.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite being well capitalized, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo
were among the initial nine lenders to get capital injections
this week from U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson's $250
billion plan to restore confidence in the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the New York Stock Exchange, JPMorgan closed down $2.22,
or 5.5 percent, at $38.49, while Wells Fargo fell 17 cents, or
0.5 percent, to $33.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The KBW Bank Index .BKX, which includes both banks, slid
7.2 percent. Broader indexes fell even more after bleak data on
U.S. retail sales and overall economic activity, and comments
by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke that the economy faces
a significant threat, fanned fears of a recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMORGAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quarterly profit at New York-based JPMorgan fell to $527
million, or 11 cents per share, from $3.37 billion, or 97
cents, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding items, the bank had a loss of 6 cents per share,
compared with the average analyst forecast for a loss of 29
cents, Reuters Estimates said. Net revenue fell 9 percent to
$14.74 billion, topping the average $14.62 billion forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan nearly tripled the amount it set aside for credit
losses, to $6.66 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wrote off $3.6 billion for mortgage debt and leveraged
loans in its investment bank, lost $642 million on Fannie Mae
FNM.N and Freddie Mac FRE.N preferred stock, and took a
$248 million charge to buy back auction-rate securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition of Washington Mutual, once the largest U.S.
savings and loan, gave Dimon some 5,400 branches and fulfilled
his longtime goal of expanding to the western United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With $2.25 trillion of assets, JPMorgan may have surpassed
Citigroup Inc (C.N) to become the largest U.S. bank for now.
Citigroup reports quarterly results on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said, though, that quarterly mortgage and home
equity losses could top $1.5 billion early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank is absorbing an estimated $31 billion of loan
losses from Washington Mutual, and Dimon said overall earnings
might be reduced over the next few quarters. "We necessarily
need to be prepared for a bad environment," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WELLS FARGO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, profit dropped to $1.64
billion, or 49 cents per share, from $2.17 billion, or 64
cents, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5 percent to $10.38
billion, while expenses fell 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average expected profit of 34 cents per share
on revenue of $11.08 billion. Results included $646 million of
charges related to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac preferred stock
and to Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEHMQ.PK bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's largest investor is Warren Buffett's Berkshire
Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) (BRKb.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo set aside $2.5 billion for credit losses, and
net charge-offs more than doubled to $2 billion. It expects
home equity loan losses to be higher than normal until housing
prices stabilize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The economy is weak and maybe is in a recession," Chief
Financial Officer Howard Atkins said in an interview. "Having
said that, the steps taken by the government will help over
time, and we'll see what happens."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo was able to wrest Wachovia from the arms of
Citigroup largely because it never dove deeply into the risky
mortgages and exotic debt that strangled Wachovia, Washington
Mutual and IndyMac Bancorp Inc IDMC.PK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The merger is expected to close this quarter and create the
fourth-largest U.S. bank, with more than $1.4 trillion of
assets and about 6,600 branches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Paramus, New Jersey's Hudson City Bancorp Inc
(HCBK.O) said third-quarter profit rose 64 percent to $121.9
million, or 25 cents per share, from $74.4 million, or 15
cents, a year earlier, as its home lending business thrived.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expected profit of 24 cents per share, and Hudson
City shares closed up 63 cents, or 3.9 percent, at $16.70 on
the Nasdaq. Hudson City will become the nation's largest thrift
following the expected sale of Sovereign Bancorp Inc SOV.N to
Spain's Banco Santander SA (SAN.MC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Joseph A. Giannone and Ellis

&lt;p&gt;George M. Keller, Former Chevron Chairman and CEO, Remembered as ``A True Leader and Visionary''

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
David J. O'Reilly, chairman and chief executive officer of Chevron
Corporation (NYSE:CVX), commented today on the passing of George M.
Keller, the company's former chairman and chief executive officer.
Keller was 84.

   "George was a true leader and visionary, and he was deeply
respected by all those who had the fortune to work with him," said
O'Reilly. "His tireless efforts in leading the acquisition of Gulf Oil
created the foundation for the Chevron we know today. On behalf of our
board of directors and 59,000 employees around the globe, we are truly
saddened by his passing."

   Keller joined Chevron in 1948 after serving in the U.S. Army Air
Force during World War II and graduating as a chemical engineer from
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He served in positions of
increasing responsibility, starting as a design and construction
engineer on refinery and chemical facilities.

   In 1967, Keller was named assistant vice president of Foreign
Operations. The following year he was promoted to assistant to the
president. He was named vice president of the corporation in July
1969; a director in August 1970; vice chairman in February 1974; and
chairman of the board in May 1981. He retired from the company on Dec.
31, 1988.

   Keller was a director of SRI International (chairman 1989-1993).
He was also a member of The Business Council, World Affairs Council,
Commonwealth Club of California and the Metropolitan Life Insurance
Company's Directors' Advisory Council. He served on the board of
trustees of Notre Dame de Namur University (Belmont, CA - chairman
1982-1994), the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (1981-1986) and
the Coyote Point Museum. He was a director of the Bay Area Council
(chairman 1985-1988) and chair emeritus of Stanford Institute for
Economic Policy Research (1987-1988). He was president of the George
M. and Adelaide M. Keller Foundation.

   Keller was former chairman of the Board of the American Petroleum
Institute and chairman of the board of directors of the United Way of
the Bay Area. He has also served as a director for the Boeing Co.,
First Interstate Bancorp, First Interstate Bank of California,
McKesson Corp., the Chronicle Publishing Co., and Metropolitan Life
Insurance Co.

   Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated
energy companies, with subsidiaries that conduct business across the
globe. The company's success is driven by the ingenuity and commitment
of approximately 59,000 employees who operate across the energy
spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude oil and

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Bolivia, the world's third largest cocaine producer, is blocking U.S. efforts to combat the drug trade, the top White House drug policy official said on Friday, Washington's latest dig at leftist President Evo Morales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Bolivia's done a very bad job," John Walters told reporters while on a visit to Mexico City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Bolivian government has not made any ... reasonable effort to combat cocaine trafficking despite our efforts to continue to engage," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In September, Washington for the first time put Bolivia -- along with Venezuela and Myanmar -- on a list of countries that have failed to help in the fight against illegal drug trafficking, but said it would not cut off bilateral aid to the Andean country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter's comments could further strain U.S.-Bolivian relations after Morales expelled the U.S. ambassador last month, accusing him of fomenting opposition protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States says it has been forced to remove anti-drug agents from the country's largest coca-growing region because of safety reasons and earlier this year supporters of Morales expelled U.S. development workers from the same area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales recently issued a ban on all U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration flights over Bolivia's territory, hampering the transport of Bolivian and U.S. officials for counternarcotics missions in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolivia's first indigenous president rose to prominence as a fiery union leader of the coca farmers and wants to promote a legal market for the plant's leaves, used by natives for millennia in religious rites and as a herbal remedy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States, the chief market for South American cocaine, says coca cultivation in Bolivia has risen by 14 percent in the last year, increasing potential cocaine output from 115 to 120 metric tons. Only Colombia and Peru produce more of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morales' government admits that coca plantings have gone up but says only by 5 percent in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters said Bolivia's lower quality cocaine does not usually find its way to U.S. streets but has a bigger market in Europe and South America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bolivia's bad behavior infects Europe, it infects Africa, because some of these routes are now going through Africa, and the Southern Cone. That's why we need cooperation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eduardo Garcia in La Paz; Editing by Eric Beech)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new client agreements in growth markets
across the Asia Pacific region, reflecting IBM's strategic focus on
delivering technology and services to help businesses in growth markets
solve complex business problems, as well as tough industry and societal
issues.

    To tap market opportunities in high potential markets worldwide, IBM has
formed a "Growth Markets" organization based in Shanghai with regional
headquarters in Dubai and Sao Paulo. It covers about 50 countries across
Asia, Africa, Eastern Europe and Latin America.

    Today's announcements by IBM include:


--  Bharti Platinum, India's largest private telecom services provider,
signed a strategic outsourcing agreement in September to further enhance
its customer service experience for its top-end Platinum customers. The
six-year contract for outsourcing of its contact services to IBM's Managed
Business Process Services (MBPS) unit will involve augmentation of Bharti
Airtel's sales, customer service, and back office capabilities. IBM Daksh
Business Process Services, a wholly-owned subsidiary of IBM, also will
provide a suite of services covering both voice and such back office
operations as customer service, collections, customer retention and other
relevant customer services for Bharti Airtel's Platinum customers from its
centers.

--  Kookmin Bank, Korea's largest financial services institution, awarded a
contract to IBM in September to implement its Next Generation Banking
System (NGBS). To be completed in 2010, this bank-wide NGBS project will
consolidate all of the company's different business units around the world,
providing a highly flexible platform to transform Kookmin Bank into a
leading global bank. This implementation agreement includes 20 projects in
such areas of Application Integration, Application Management Service and
System Integration.

--  Philippine National Bank (PNB), a government-owned banking institution,
signed a three-year contract renewal in September. As part of the
agreement, IBM will provide remote and onsite help desk and IT equipment
support services for PNB's hardware.  This project ultimately will help
achieve excellence in IT operations by creating a stable, dynamic, flexible
and efficient IT environment for PNB.

--  Tianjin Economic Technological Development Area (TEDA) Administrative
Commission, China, awarded an e-Learning contract to IBM in August. This
three-year project will see IBM training 3,000 selected graduates from six
universities in Tianjin City to become IT service professionals for
mainframe and Java-based systems. Such training will enable the TEDA ePark
to tap into a pool of talent to provide outsourcing services in areas such
as software development, financial back office services, financial
outsourcing, administration and human resources. Using the Saba e-Learning
Management System, virtual classroom training will be provided via the
Internet.

--  In September, Vietnam Technology and Telecommunications Joint Stock
Company (VNTT) signed a contract with IBM to build a cloud computing
environment using IBM software, services and hardware. IBM will build a
cloud computing center using IBM System x, BladeCenter and System Storage
managed by IBM Blue Cloud technologies. In addition to data center
services, VNTT will provide its customers with cloud-based collaboration
services such as email on Lotus Domino, intranet service on WebSphere
Portal Express and company server on Lotus Foundations, managed by Tivoli
software. VNTT's clients will be able to take advantage of a more flexible,
cost effective infrastructure, but still access computing resources and
services at any time -- just as they use other shared services.

    
As announced, in the third quarter of 2008, IBM's revenue was up six
percent year over year in Asia Pacific and up thirteen percent in growth
markets.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said on Friday it plans to pay $894 million to settle lawsuits alleging that its withdrawn Bextra painkiller and widely used Celebrex arthritis drug harmed U.S. patients and defrauded consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said the money would be paid out under three separate tentative settlements -- including one that resolves claims by 33 states and the District of Columbia primarily related to Bextra marketing practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's good that Pfizer is settling the majority of these cases because these things tend to drag on for five to 10 years and take a lot of focus off running the company," said Jon LeCroy, an analyst with Natixis Bleichroeder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LeCroy said Wall Street has closely followed the Bextra and Celebrex cases because Bextra was sold only briefly. Moreover, he said Celebrex has not been shown to have the same cardiovascular risks as Vioxx, a similar drug that Merck  Co Inc withdrew in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer said it has taken a pretax charge of $894 million in the third quarter for the proposed settlements, and that the funds should also be sufficient to cover personal injury cases that have not yet been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which still sells Celebrex, said it decided to settle to eliminate the legal distractions, although it admitted no wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Putting all these matters behind Pfizer makes good sense from the company point of view and with respect to patients and doctors," Amy Schulman, Pfizer's general counsel, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charge includes $745 million to resolve personal injury claims, $60 million to settle with the states over Bextra marketing practices and $89 million to resolve consumer fraud class-action cases that allege Bextra and Celebrex promotions caused financial harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bextra and Celebrex belong to the same class of painkillers as Vioxx, which was withdrawn after being linked to heart attacks among long-time users. Merck has resolved claims from most of the thousands of U.S. patients who said they were harmed by its drug with a $4.85 billion settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked Pfizer to withdraw Bextra from U.S. drugstores, citing a possible risk of causing heart problems and reports of a potentially fatal skin reaction called Stevens-Johnson syndrome in people taking the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's Schulman declined to break down how much of the money being set aside would satisfy Bextra claims or Celebrex lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she said federal and state courts have ruled there is no reliable scientific evidence that Celebrex increases risk of heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time that Bextra was withdrawn, the FDA ordered that all prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including Celebrex, carry a "black box" warning about potential increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and stomach problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA also required that all over-the-counter NSAIDs, including naproxen and ibuprofen, include more information about those risks, as well as the risk of serious skin reactions.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 17 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on
Friday it plans to pay $894 million to settle lawsuits
alleging that its withdrawn Bextra painkiller and widely used
Celebrex arthritis drug harmed U.S. patients and defrauded
consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said the money would be paid out under three
separate tentative settlements -- including one that resolves
claims by 33 states and the District of Columbia primarily
related to Bextra marketing practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's good that Pfizer is settling the majority of these
cases because these things tend to drag on for five to 10 years
and take a lot of focus off running the company," said Jon
LeCroy, an analyst with Natixis Bleichroeder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LeCroy said Wall Street has closely followed the Bextra and
Celebrex cases because Bextra was sold only briefly. Moreover,
he said Celebrex has not been shown to have the same
cardiovascular risks as Vioxx, a similar drug that Merck  Co
Inc (MRK.N) withdrew in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based Pfizer said it has taken a pretax charge of
$894 million in the third quarter for the proposed settlements,
and that the funds should also be sufficient to cover personal
injury cases that have not yet been resolved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which still sells Celebrex, said it decided to
settle to eliminate the legal distractions, although it
admitted no wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Putting all these matters behind Pfizer makes good sense
from the company point of view and with respect to patients and
doctors," Amy Schulman, Pfizer's general counsel, said in an
interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The charge includes $745 million to resolve personal injury
claims, $60 million to settle with the states over Bextra
marketing practices and $89 million to resolve consumer fraud
class-action cases that allege Bextra and Celebrex promotions
caused financial harm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bextra and Celebrex belong to the same class of painkillers
as Vioxx, which was withdrawn after being linked to heart
attacks among long-time users. Merck has resolved claims from
most of the thousands of U.S. patients who said they were
harmed by its drug with a $4.85 billion settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2005, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration asked Pfizer
to withdraw Bextra from U.S. drugstores, citing a possible risk
of causing heart problems and reports of a potentially fatal
skin reaction called Stevens-Johnson syndrome in people taking
the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's Schulman declined to break down how much of the
money being set aside would satisfy Bextra claims or Celebrex
lawsuits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she said federal and state courts have ruled there is
no reliable scientific evidence that Celebrex increases risk of
heart attack and stroke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the time that Bextra was withdrawn, the FDA ordered that
all prescription nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs),
including Celebrex, carry a "black box" warning about potential
increased risk of heart attacks, strokes and stomach problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDA also required that all over-the-counter NSAIDs,
including naproxen and ibuprofen, include more information
about those risks, as well as the risk of serious skin
reactions. The label changes do not apply, however, to aspirin
or acetaminophen -- the active ingredient of Johnson 
Johnson's Tylenol painkiller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares were down 3 cents to $16.94 on the New York
Stock Exchange on Friday.

   Fitch does not rate the following classes: $19.0 million class P,
$3.2 million class Q, $ 9.6 million class T and $25.4 million class
NR.

   The affirmations are the result of stable performance and minimal
paydown since issuance. Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction
of any rating changes over the next one to two year. As of the
September 2008 distribution date, the pool's certificate balance has
decreased 0.18% to $2.539 billion from $2.543 billion at issuance. Of
the pool, 98 loans (85.9% of the pool) are interest-only or partial
interest-only and there are no near term maturities.

   The largest loan, Centro-New Plan Pool 1 (11.68% of the pool)
consists of 18 cross collateralized and cross defaulted retail
properties spread across 12 states and is sponsored by Centro Watt
America REIT, Inc. The servicer-reported debt service coverage ratio
(DSCR) for year-end (YE) 2007 was 1.58 times (x).

   The second largest loan, The Gurnee Mills Mall, is a 1.56 million
sf regional mall located in Gurnee, IL. The servicer-reported DSCR and
occupancy for YE2007 was 1.53x and 95%, respectively.

   The Portola Plaza Hotel (1.56% of the pool) and 1564 Broadway
(0.77% of the pool) maintain investment-grade shadow ratings based on
stable performance. The Portola Plaza Hotel is a full service hotel
located in Monterey, CA. The servicer reported DSCR as of YE2007 is
4.4x.

   1564 Broadway is 100% occupied by the Palace Theater. The servicer
reported DSCR as of YE2007 is 4.18x. The Palace's Theater feature
production, Legally Blond, will be ending in October 2008. Fitch will
monitor this loan.

   Fitch identified 10 loans (5.06% of the pool) as loans of concern.
The largest loan of concern is the Baldwin Park Retail Center (1.62%
of the pool), a newly constructed retail center in a master planned
community in Orlando, Florida. The property was in lease-up at
issuance. The servicer-reported YE2007 DSCR was 0.60x. The loan does
not have any debt service reserves.

&lt;p&gt;MINNEAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
U.S. Bank and Toyota have teamed up to offer the Toyota Rewards

vehicle purchase or lease. Also, new cardholders will receive 2,500
bonus points when they make their first purchase using the card.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said a Web search advertising deal with Yahoo Inc makes economic sense and may still be possible, though the two sides are not in any discussions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo jumped as much as 17 percent as investors hoped Ballmer's comments could lead to the two sides returning to the negotiating table. But gains were pared back to about 12 percent after Microsoft issued a statement saying it had no interest in buying Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between the two broke off in July after Yahoo rejected Microsoft's proposal to buy its search advertising business and enact a revenue-sharing partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo had also rebuffed in May a full acquisition bid from Microsoft that was priced at $33 per share, or $47.5 billion. Instead, Yahoo signed a search advertising pact with Web leader Google Inc, which is being scrutinized by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Perhaps there will continue to remain opportunities to partner around search," Ballmer told a Gartner Inc conference in Orlando, Florida.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not in any discussions with them. We'll see. They want to remain independent. There are probably still opportunities around search. I think it would still make sense economically for their shareholders and ours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since talks broke off, Yahoo shares have plunged to a 5-1/2-year low of $11.37, weighed by concerns over the outlook for Web display advertising, as major advertisers such as banks and automakers cut back spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We offered 33 bucks not too long ago and it's 11 and a half. So I don't know what price might have got the job done," Ballmer said, responding to a question from Gartner analyst David Smith on whether Microsoft might take another stab at buying Yahoo now that its stock price is so low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that Yahoo did not want to sell the company. It did not want to sell when we offered 33 ... They probably think it's worth at least 33 today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo declined comment. Its shares rose to as high as $13.73 on Thursday, before settling at around $13.16 in late trading on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our position hasn't changed. Microsoft has no interest in acquiring Yahoo; there are no discussions between the companies," a spokesman for Microsoft said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 3.6 percent at $23.48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the market's excitement, any pursuit of new talks would be impeded by several issues, including Yahoo's severely depressed stock price and the poor outlook for the advertising market due to the weak economy, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The larger issue is strategic fit," Cross Research analyst Richard Williams said. "Microsoft clearly has spent money and changed its focus to 'build' rather than 'buy.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that for businesses driven by advertising, such as Microsoft and Yahoo's Internet operations, it is the wrong time for a deal with markets reeling and consumer confidence plummeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Going into a recession is about the worst time to buy an advertising firm," Williams said. "It's hard to know how hard they are going to be hit and how low they are going to go."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Anupreeta Das in New York and Jim Finkle in Boston; editing by Gunna Dickson, Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 17 (Reuters) - Wachovia Capital Markets lowered its
2008 and 2009 earnings estimates for Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to reflect recent capital
raises and much softer earnings expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both the companies are to receive $10 billion each under
the U.S. Treasury's bailout plan, which should go a long way
into improving sentiment around their long-term viability,
analyst Douglas Sipkin wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The injections likely remove going concern risk and appear
quite favorable from a capital standpoint," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. officials announced on Tuesday a plan to inject $250
billion capital by acquiring preferred stock and warrants to
purchase significant stakes across a number of banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the plan, Goldman and Morgan will get the capital in
exchange for senior preferred shares that pay a 5 percent
annual dividend for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Treasury will also get $1.5 billion in warrants from
both firms, Sipkin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the warrants were exercised at current prices, existing
shareholders for Goldman Sachs would be diluted by about 3
percent and for Morgan Stanley by about 6.5 percent, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Over-the-counter derivative trading is certainly on the
decline as is the level of hedge fund assets, private equity
assets, and general risk taking, the analyst added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The hope is that profitability returns to vanilla

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, background)

 Oct 17 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded
department store operator Macy's Inc (M.N) to "overweight" from
"neutral", citing favorable valuation, while dismissing fears
in the company's ability to pay down debt.

 "This upgrade is not for the faint of heart as the
fundamentals at M (and across most of retail for that matter)
remain extremely stressed," analyst Charles Grom said in a note
to clients.

 The brokerage also raised upscale retailer Saks Inc SKS.N
to "neutral," a month after it started the company at
"underweight," saying the retailer's woes were reflected in its
stock price, following a 50 percent drop over the past month.

 The brokerage had initiated Saks in September, saying that
material job losses on Wall Street and the rising dollar,
worsened by the retailer's cloudy same-store sales outlook,
could crimp sales at its flagship Fifth Avenue store in New
York.

 On Macy's, J.P. Morgan's Grom said the store operator had
enough cash and an untapped $2 billion credit line to meet any
borrowing needs.

 Further, by cutting its earnings guidance by 21 percent,
Macy's had removed risks of missing market estimates, the
brokerage said in a note to clients.

 Grom also believes that Macy's is likely to reduce capital
expenditure and shut stores, and "both moves would be perceived
positively by investors."

 Shares of Macy's closed at $10.05 Thursday on the New York
Stock Exchange, while those of Saks closed at $5.40.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Reaches Agreements in Principle to Resolve Litigation Involving Its NSAID Pain Medications

 $894 Million Settlements To Resolve Personal Injury Cases, Consumer Fraud Cases
                       and State Attorneys General Claims
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc announced today that it has reached agreements in principle to
resolve substantially all of the personal injury cases, consumer fraud cases and
state attorneys general claims involving its non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
(NSAID) pain medication Bextra, which Pfizer voluntarily withdrew from the U.S.
market in 2005. Additionally, following key court rulings in favor of Celebrex,
claims regarding Celebrex, an effective pain treatment for millions of patients,
will also be resolved as part of the settlement.

"We are pleased by the favorable rulings we have achieved in this litigation and
believe that now is the right time to resolve these matters," said Amy W.
Schulman, senior vice president and general counsel of Pfizer. "Inevitably,
litigation can be distracting and putting these matters behind us helps our
shareholders and, most importantly, patients and doctors."

"Pfizer stands by the safety and efficacy profile of Celebrex. It is one of the
most rigorously- and continuously-studied drugs in the world, as evidenced by
its approval and use in 111 countries during the past 10 years across several
different pain indications," said Joseph M. Feczko, chief medical officer for
Pfizer. "We believe that putting these matters substantially behind us should
better enable physicians to consider Celebrex purely on the strength of its
clinical data, and its ability to meet the diverse needs of patients in pain."

Key Rulings in Favor of Celebrex Set Stage for Personal Injury Settlements

Today's announcement follows favorable rulings in which federal and New York
state court judges overseeing a majority of the personal injury cases ruled that
the plaintiffs' lawyers failed to present reliable scientific evidence to prove
Celebrex can cause heart attacks or strokes at its most commonly prescribed
dose. These rulings would have likely limited the scope of these cases had the
litigation continued. By settling these matters now, the parties are minimizing
the future cost and disruption inevitably associated with litigation.

These rulings within the past year are consistent with the conclusion reached by
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2005 that, based on the available
data, the benefits of Celebrex outweigh its risks for appropriate patients at
approved doses. The FDA requires that all prescription NSAIDs carry the same
cardiovascular boxed warnings.

Settlements Resolve Substantial Litigation

The personal injury settlements will resolve more than 90 percent of the known
personal injury claims brought by law firms representing persons who allege that
Pfizer's NSAID pain medications were the cause of a heart attack, stroke or
other injury. Pfizer will work to finalize agreements with each of the law firms
with which it has agreements in principle before the end of the year.

Pfizer also has reached an agreement in principle to settle payor class action
consumer fraud cases involving Bextra and Celebrex in which plaintiffs allege
economic loss relating to the promotion of these medications. The settlement
will resolve these cases on a nationwide basis and is subject to approval by the
appropriate courts.

In addition, Pfizer has reached agreements in principle to resolve claims
brought by 33 states and the District of Columbia, primarily relating to alleged
Bextra promotional practices. Under these settlements, Pfizer will make a total
payment of $60 million to the states and adopt compliance measures that
complement policies and procedures previously established by the company.

Pfizer has insurance coverage for a portion of the personal injury settlements
and is seeking to recover payments to which it believes it is entitled from its
insurance carriers.

Pfizer will reflect these significant, non-recurring items as a third quarter
pre-tax charge of $894 million ($640 million after-tax) to reported earnings.
The charge includes amounts of (i) $745 million applicable to personal injury
claims, which Pfizer believes will be sufficient to resolve the remaining
pending personal injury claims, (ii) $60 million applicable to state attorneys
general settlements and (iii) $89 million applicable to consumer fraud class
action claims.

"The agreements in principle that we are announcing today enable us to focus on
what is core to our business - providing innovative medicines to treat patients
suffering from some of the world's most widespread and debilitating diseases,"
Ms. Schulman said.

   Where do you see oil prices heading in the near term?

   While downside risks still remain, particularly if the global
economic weakness turns out to be more protracted than currently
anticipated, oil prices are expected to consolidate around current
levels. We expect crude oil prices to bottom around $70 a barrel.

   We are strong believers in the secular underpinnings of the oil
cycle - the current downturn is just a pause in a long secular cycle
that still has plenty of room to go.

   In which areas would you advise investors to look for oil stocks?

   The large-cap integrateds - Exxon (NYSE: XOM), Chevron (NYSE: CVX)
- remain the best positioned given their energy conglomerate business
structures, stellar balance sheets, substantial free cash flows, and
growing dividends.

   The underlying business fundamentals of integrated oilfield
service companies such as Baker Hughes (NYSE: BHI), as well as
deepwater-capable drilling contractors like Transocean (NYSE: RIG) and
Diamond Offshore (NYSE: DO) still remain robust. Oil prices will need
to drop even further and then stay there to materially impact their
operating outlook.

&lt;p&gt;Kirstie Kelly for Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings - Red Label for
  Women Sizes 16w-32w to Grace the Runway at Bridal Week in New York
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
In celebration of the princess in every woman, Disney and renowned
designer Kirstie Kelly are launching the "Red Label" collection of
plus size bridal gowns designed specifically for plus size women.
Kirstie Kelly for Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings - Red Label, will be
showcased in glamorous style at the New York Bridal Market during a
runway show at the Waldorf Astoria. Since the initial launch of the
Disney Princess-inspired bridal collection in April 2007, the line has
expanded to include Maidens for bridesmaids, Princess Blossoms for
flower girls, Jewels, jewelry and veils and now the Red Label
collection, each inspired by the Disney Princess franchise.

   The new Red Label bridal line consists of 15 new dresses and
caters to women who wear a size 16 or larger. Today more than 48
percent of women are considered plus size, and according to the U.S.
market research firm NPD Group, plus size merchandise accounts for one
in five women's apparel purchases, a growth of 20 percent between 2003
and 2007.

   Kirstie Kelly incorporated luxurious appliques and treatments that
accentuate the natural femininity and beauty of women who are taller
and fuller and every bit as much of a princess as the Disney Princess
characters Ariel, Aurora/Sleeping Beauty, Belle, Cinderella, Disney's
Princess Jasmine and Snow White. Each Red Label gown allows the
princess within to shine through with a couture sensibility and
detailed fabrications including silk chiffon, satin, taffeta and
elegant accents with touches of crystal and pearl, ribbon and
exquisite embroidery and delicate beadwork.

   "The Red Label collection is designed to allow the essence of each
woman to come through in a very natural way," said Kelly. "These gowns
are designed to flatter and fit the curves of a rubenesque figure,
creating an elegant silhouette and enhancing a woman's body style."

   The launch of the Red Label collection continues the runaway
success of the Kirstie Kelly for Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings line.
Now available in more than 140 salons in the U.S. and nine countries
globally, the line gives women the chance to realize the dream of
royalty on their special day in a line of fashion forward gowns that
bring out the princess in every woman.

   "With a new line of fashion forward bridal gowns designed
specially for plus size women, Kirstie Kelly has helped make the
dreams of women come true," said Pam Lifford, executive vice
president, global fashion and home, Disney Consumer Products. "By
expanding the line with the Red Label collection, we have invited all
women to fulfill their dream of being a princess on their wedding
day."

   Kirstie Kelly For Disney's Fairy Tale Weddings will also unveil
the latest platinum gown in the line which is inspired by Sleeping
Beauty/Aurora. This special gown reflects the essence of this most
romantic Disney Princess with a crystal-beaded strapless ball gown
with delicately beaded illusion sleeves and a cathedral train.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Two of the most recognized U.S. sports teams -- the New York Yankees and the Dallas Cowboys -- have formed a stadium operations company with Goldman Sachs Group Inc and a Texas private equity firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, CIC Partners LP in Dallas and the two teams said on Monday that Legends Hospitality Management LLC would offer a broad range of sports business services. It will focus initially on catering, concessions, retail merchandising and other services for major sports and entertainment facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The teams will each own a third of the venture, with Goldman owning most of the rest, according to a source familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified. Legends raised $100 million about two weeks ago in a debt sale managed by Goldman, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legends' creation was not a surprise, given how much Major League Baseball's Yankees and the National Football League's Cowboys have riding on drawing fans to their new stadiums even as they raise ticket prices in the increasingly weak U.S. economy, said Robert Boland, professor of sports management at New York University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly, the economy is telling us this is getting harder and harder for teams to sell these tickets, and it's important they come forward with a reason to show fans that these are more than just tickets, that there's something else attached," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The one problem that every pro team is facing right now is they're charging more than their fans can afford," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major League Baseball reported a decline of almost 1 percent in per-game attendance during the regular season, and the commissioners in baseball and the NFL have warned about the economy's impact on fan spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials for both the Yankees and Cowboys seemed to recognize that dynamic in forming Legends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The old model of stadium concessions is broken," Yankees Co-Chairman Hal Steinbrenner said in a statement. "Fans want and deserve a better experience for their sports entertainment dollar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based in Newark, New Jersey, Legends will be led by Michael Rawlings, former president of Pizza Hut Inc, a unit of Yum Brands Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legends will expand beyond its founding teams to offer services to other pro and college teams and event venues worldwide, the companies said. It also will broaden its capabilities through a combination of acquisitions, strategic partnerships and continued internal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Legends was founded on the principle that enhancing the stadium experience will result in a more satisfied fan base," Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. "Satisfied fans attend more games and show greater loyalty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legends has been granted exclusive rights on a multiyear basis to operate concessions, catering and merchandising services at the Yankees' and Cowboys' new stadiums, both of which will open next year at a cost of more than $1 billion each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and CIC Partners also provided financing for and serve as financial advisers to Legends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman in recent years has emerged as the Wall Street firm closest to the Yankees. It is part owner of YES Network, the Yankees' cable television network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two Goldman executives helped broker the contract that allowed the team to retain all-star third baseman Alex Rodriguez last year after he filed for free agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Klayman; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Dave Zimmerman and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

economy, said Robert Boland, professor of sports management at
New York University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly, the economy is telling us this is getting harder
and harder for teams to sell these tickets, and it's important
they come forward with a reason to show fans that these are more
than just tickets, that there's something else attached," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The one problem that every pro team is facing right now is
they're charging more than their fans can afford," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major League Baseball reported a decline of almost 1 percent
in per-game attendance during the regular season, and the
commissioners in baseball and the NFL have warned about the
economy's impact on fan spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Officials for both the Yankees and Cowboys seemed to
recognize that dynamic in forming Legends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The old model of stadium concessions is broken," Yankees
Co-Chairman Hal Steinbrenner said in a statement. "Fans want and
deserve a better experience for their sports entertainment
dollar."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based in Newark, New Jersey, Legends will be led by Michael
Rawlings, former president of Pizza Hut Inc, a unit of Yum
Brands Inc (YUM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Legends will expand beyond its founding teams to offer
services to other pro and college teams and event venues
worldwide, the companies said. It also will broaden its
capabilities through a combination of acquisitions, strategic
partnerships and continued internal growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Legends was founded on the principle that enhancing the
stadium experience will result in a more satisfied fan base,"
Cowboys owner Jerry Jones said. "Satisfied fans attend more
games and show greater loyalty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Legends has been granted exclusive rights on a multiyear
basis to operate concessions, catering and merchandising
services at the Yankees' and Cowboys' new stadiums, both of
which will open next year at a cost of more than $1 billion
each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and CIC Partners also provided financing for
and serve as financial advisers to Legends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman in recent years has emerged as the Wall Street firm
closest to the Yankees. It is part owner of YES Network, the
Yankees' cable television network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two Goldman executives helped broker the contract that
allowed the team to retain all-star third baseman Alex Rodriguez
last year after he filed for free agency.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a new family of products for archiving
email, classifying content and searching multiple information sources --
independent of where and how the content was created, processed and
archived. IBM Content Collection and Archiving products are designed to
help clients take back control and unlock the business value of their
content, while enforcing regulatory compliance and operational policies
and reducing total cost of ownership.

    The new family of products deliver comprehensive Content Collection and
Archiving capabilities that make information more accessible, manageable
and, ultimately, usable by making it easier to locate and analyze
information and to extract knowledge and insights.

    IBM Content Collection and Archiving offerings will help clients move
beyond e-mail archiving to provide organizations with comprehensive
management capabilities for virtually all their business content,
including file systems, Lotus Quickr, Microsoft SharePoint, instant
messages and other information. These products offer more advanced
functionality to meet new legal eDiscovery and records management
requirements as well as de-duplication and integration with records
retention services, helping to reduce storage and electronic discovery
costs.

    Yorkshire Water, a subsidiary of Kelda Group, manages the collection,
treatment and distribution of water, supplying around 1.24 billion liters
of drinking water each day. With a combined IBM and Neocol UK offering,
Yorkshire Water is using IBM software to help them integrate e-mail
content with other documents and facilitate retention and archiving with
associated storage management.

    "IBM's Content Collection and Archiving offerings will help us to simplify
tasks, including managing email archives and records management, while
leveraging our existing content management platform to manage and control
content over the long run," said Ian Marshall, Senior Technical Analyst,
Yorkshire Water.

    "Today, many organizations' needs have outgrown the limited business value
of e-mail archiving as they seek better control and management of their
content in support of their business goals," said Ken Bisconti, vice
president, product and strategy, IBM Enterprise Content Management. "Our
Content Collection and Archiving products will help enable clients make
more complete use of all their information and content, providing
simplified, consistent usability while reducing costs and improving
productivity for both business users and IT."

    IBM Content Collection and Archiving Family

    IBM's Content Collection and Archiving products are based on a modular,
extensible architecture and are designed to collect content from nearly
any source, including email or file attachments, enhance the content by
applying modular tasks, and mange the content in an Enterprise Content
Management (ECM) repository to be controlled -- consistently and
cost-effectively.

    IBM Content Collector and Archiving is based on a secure and scalable IBM
ECM platform, and is pre-built to take advantage of IBM ECM capabilities
such as advanced classification, records management, and eDiscovery search
and analytics to fully optimize the lifecycle of compliant information
management.

    IBM Content Collector and Archiving plays a key role in implementing IBM's
vision for a new Information Infrastructure in which key technologies and
services tackle the massive growth and mobility of data, skyrocketing
energy use, growing security concerns and more demanding consumers with
the compliance, availability, reliability and scalability clients need
today.

    IBM's Content Collection and Archiving family consists of:

    IBM Content Collector for Email: An automated, flexible and scalable
offering that is designed to expand e-mail information usage for
compliance, ECM, Business Process Management and Business Intelligence
applications. 

    IBM Content Collector for File Systems: An enterprise offering for
controlling documents on a network file share drives, enabling file
system control, archiving, and eDiscovery collection. 

    IBM Content Collector Preload Edition: A hardware and software offering
that will enable clients to quickly install and automate an e-mail
management solution, helping users to improve e-mail system performance
and to easily and quickly retrieve email to satisfy compliance audit
reviews and legal discovery requirements. 

    IBM Content Collector Enterprise Bundle: A single Content Collection &amp;
Archiving bundle that collects, enhances and manages casually created
content types that drive the most potential cost and risk -- e-mail
(Domino or Exchange), file systems (Windows NTFS), and SharePoint --
delivered together with advanced Contextual Classification capabilities.

    Key ECM business partners that are supporting IBM Content Collector and
Archiving and extending the reach of the new offerings include: Cenit,
Electronic Evidence Discovery, Inc., FaceTime, Fritz &amp; Macziol, FTI
Consulting, ImageMaker, Integro, Iron Mountain, Neocol, Orchestria and
Workgroup Connections.

    IBM Content Collection and Archiving is also supported by IBM Global
Technology Services, with new services to provide planning, design and
implementation services specifically for archive and retention of
information and a new comprehensive enterprise archiving assessment
including workshops and roadmaps.

    IBM Content Collection and Archiving is part of IBM's Information on
Demand initiative, which applies the company's broad spectrum of global
software, hardware, research and industry consulting expertise to provide
clients with the means to address their increasing, industry-specific
information management challenges, including managing the explosion of
application-specific information silos.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 20 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) chief
executive said on Monday it was too early to predict the impact
of the oil price drop on capital spending plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at the annual meeting of the American Petroleum
Institute in Scottsdale, Arizona, Chevron CEO Dave O'Reilly
said, "Prices always rise and fall. We don't set our plans on
any certain price level."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price of oil has fallen from a record $147 a barrel in
July to $73 a barrel on Monday as the global credit squeeze and
economic weakness are roiling financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result, demand for oil products has fallen, with
consumer confidence at the lowest level since 1952, and U.S.
government data showing that new home construction had also
fallen to the lowest level since 1991.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly said that Chevron would not set its capital
spending budget until December, when it normally sets the next
year's spending.

&lt;p&gt;Next-generation solutions will help prevent cross-channel fraud
               linked to stolen and synthetic identities
CONCORD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Memento, Inc., a leader in enterprise fraud management, today
announced an agreement with IBM (NYSE: IBM) to deliver fraud detection
solutions to the financial services industry. The two companies will
jointly develop, market and sell innovative, next-generation solutions
for monitoring, detecting and investigating a wide variety of fraud
types, including deposit account fraud, new account fraud and insider
fraud.

   Fraud is a widespread problem affecting banks and other types of
financial institutions. According to analyst firm TowerGroup, 20 to
35% of the $55 billion in operational losses incurred by financial
institutions are due to fraud. Cross-channel fraud - involving
multiple banking products (e.g., checks, debit cards, wire transfers)
and account access methods (online, branch visits, call centers) - is
a growing part of the problem.

   In addition, fraud is increasingly a business, characterized by
highly leveraged schemes and groups of professional, organized
criminals using stolen and synthetic identities, and real identities
of vulnerable individuals to open accounts for the sole purpose of
committing fraud. Existing financial crime detection systems are often
ineffective against these advanced fraud schemes because they rely on
relatively simple screening, detection and compliance monitoring
techniques.

   IBM's InfoSphere(TM) Global Name Recognition is an enterprise tool
designed to help organizations understand, analyze and process
multi-cultural names to provide name processing and matching
capabilities for mission critical and corporate wide applications. GNR
provides enterprises with the tools to get multi-cultural name
information, analytics and high performance name matching through a
series of flexible, easy-to-integrate, SOA enabled interfaces,
enabling customers to unlock and unleash the wealth of information in
a name.

   "New products and channels expose financial institutions to ever
more sophisticated types of fraud, and effective defenses have taken
too long to develop," says Rob Thomas, vice president, IBM Information
Management. "IBM InfoSphere Global Name Recognition software plays a
powerful role in detecting fraud through its world-class name
recognition, analysis and matching capabilities. Now embedded with
InfoSphere GNR, Memento will deliver even greater value for our joint
customers."

   Memento's flagship offering, Memento Security(TM), is a unified
software platform that integrates data management, advanced analytics,
case management, and forensics--the critical capabilities financial
institutions need to effectively combat fraud. Powered by the IBM
InfoSphere Global Name Recognition software, Memento Security provides
comprehensive methods for managing and analyzing identity information
used to detect suspicious linkages between customer accounts and known
fraudsters. The result is a more accurate, flexible, and
cost-effective way for financial institutions to monitor and detect
new and emerging types of fraud.

   "Cross-channel fraud committed by groups of professional criminals
is a critical problem for financial institutions today," says BC
Krishna, CEO and President of Memento. "We look forward to working
with IBM to deliver comprehensive fraud prevention solutions to help
protect our customers from both financial loss as well as loss of
customer confidence."

   About Memento

   Memento, Inc. (www.mementosecurity.com) is a recognized leader in
enterprise fraud management. Memento Security - the company's
award-winning solution - is an innovative platform for monitoring,

quick to implement. By detecting inappropriate activities early and

information.

   "Hubspan's on-demand platform makes for faster and easier

corporate customers," said Robert Mahowald, director of the IDC
software as a service (SaaS) and on-demand research program. "By

institution clients have an easily-executed accounts payable file
integration solution for improved transaction speed and business

&lt;p&gt;  ANDOVER, MA, Oct 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Enterasys Networks Inc., the Secure Networks Company(TM), today announced
that it has joined the Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP). MAPP
is a new program from the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) that
provides vulnerability information to security software providers in
advance of Microsoft's monthly security update release. Through this
program, Enterasys will receive vulnerability information early, enabling
the company to provide customers with advanced, updated protections
during the window of time between the release of Microsoft security
updates and customers applying them to their system.

    "Our partners share our passion for industry collaboration to protect a
world full of Internet users," said Mark Miller, Director of Microsoft's
Trustworthy Computing product management. "No one company can accomplish
this by itself. That is why we are partnering with Enterasys to advance
and improve security."

    The Enterasys Dragon(R) network- and host-based intrusion prevention
system (IPS) leverages signature adaptive pattern matching, protocol
analysis and behavioral analysis to automatically sense and respond to
threats in real-time across multi-vendor wired and wireless networks.
Dragon is unique in its ability to extend IPS to every LAN edge access
port to detect threats, mitigate or stop any attack and, most
importantly, automatically contain and/or remove the source of the threat
from the network. The operational advantage is that Dragon delivers
network security protections everywhere, not just somewhere, for unified
communications environments.

    The amount of time between the release of a Microsoft security update and
the release of exploit code for that update continues to shorten. Through
the efforts of MAPP, Enterasys and other security software providers have
early access to vulnerability information and can pass this knowledge
along to customers. This information is shared in a secure and
confidential manner to prevent it from being used maliciously. Before
this program, security software providers would have to wait until the
public release of the Microsoft security bulletin to deploy protections.
The early release enables Enterasys and Microsoft to protect mutual
customers more quickly.

    "Enterasys is pleased to be selected by Microsoft to join MAPP based on a
stringent list of eligibility criteria for security software providers,"
said Trent Waterhouse, VP of Marketing for Enterasys. "This collaboration
framework with Microsoft at both the application and network layers
delivers improved defense-in-depth and diversity-of-defense protections
while testing and deploying Microsoft security updates. It's another
tangible example of Enterasys delivering on our promises to proactively
protect customer and partner information assets without sacrificing the
performance of voice, video or data applications."

    About Enterasys Networks

    Enterasys is part of a joint venture with Siemens Enterprise
Communications led by The Gores Group, LLC. The joint venture is a
multi-billion dollar provider of hardware, software, and services to
deliver service-oriented networks that enable service-oriented

insight and expertise. No one knows their fans better and has a
greater interest in providing them a great game-day experience. With
both the Yankees and the Cowboys moving into new stadiums next season,
this is certainly the right time to rethink our approach. Beyond that
base, we are confident that other facilities and teams will be
interested in what Legends can offer. I look forward to building a
business with Jerry."

   Jerry Jones, Owner and General Manager of the Dallas Cowboys,
stated, "Fans are increasingly voicing their opinion that they want
and deserve more from a stadium experience - they want a winning team,
but they also want a venue that truly complements the game and
elevates the experience. We couldn't agree more. Legends was founded
on the principle that enhancing the stadium experience will result in
a more satisfied fan base. Satisfied fans attend more games and show
greater loyalty to their home team, which ultimately benefits
franchises, players and their communities."

   "The old model of stadium concessions is broken," stated Hal
Steinbrenner, Co-Chairman of the New York Yankees. "Fans want and
deserve a better experience for their sports entertainment dollar.
Working with Legends to leverage the talent and experience resident in
the Yankees' and Cowboys' organizations will enable us to set a higher
bar for sports franchises while delivering greater value to fans. When
the new Yankee Stadium opens for the 2009 season, our fans will be
able to experience first-hand the enhancements to our menus,
concessions, retail operations and fan spaces that Legends has
overseen."

   "Our focus is on the fans," said Stephen Jones, Chief Operating
Officer of the Dallas Cowboys. "From a casual dining experience to
feeding large crowds in mass quantities, or from selling the latest
fan fashions at our specialty retail shops, our service delivery
systems will be engineered to enable us to deliver quality services."

   Mike Rawlings, Chairman &amp; CEO of Legends, added "Quality is the
hallmark of the Legends brand, and I am confident that the team of
experienced professionals we have assembled will set the highest
standards of quality and service in the industry. We are thrilled to
be partnering with the New York Yankees and Dallas Cowboys - two teams
with reputations for innovation and value creation - as we create a
new paradigm in sports concessions that will deliver unparalleled and
affordable stadium experiences for fans."

   Legends, which will be headquartered in Newark, NJ, will be led by
a strong and experienced management team. In addition to Mike
Rawlings, Marty Greenspun will serve as President of Legends, and
Daniel Smith will serve as Chief Operating Officer. Prior to joining
Legends, Greenspun has served as the New York Yankees' Senior Vice
President, Strategic Ventures, and prior to that, among his other
positions, he was Chief Operating Officer of the Los Angeles Dodgers,
and Smith was Senior Vice President for Eastern Area Operations for
Centerplate. Legends' Board of Directors will initially be comprised
of 10 members, including representatives from the Yankees, the
Cowboys, Goldman Sachs and CIC Partners.

   Said Rawlings, "Our mission at Legends is simple. We want to
become the authority on fan experience so that we can provide team and
stadium owners, athletic directors and venue operators with innovative
ways to build business value for their sports franchises off the
playing field. While we'll leverage the experience of our leadership
team and the Yankees and Cowboys organizations, we also fully intend
to broaden and deepen our capabilities in the coming years through a
combination of acquisitions, strategic partnerships and continued
internal growth."

   Goldman Sachs and CIC Partners LP, a Dallas-based, mid-sized
private equity firm, also provided financing for and served as
financial advisors to Legends.

   Press Conference

   Legends will hold a press conference today at 620 Loft at
Rockefeller Center, 620 Fifth Avenue (entrance on 50th Street), New
York, New York. The press conference will begin at 11:00 a.m. (ET).

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and UCB Announce Formation of New Company 'Cyclofluidic' to Accelerate Drug Discovery Process

        UK Government's Technology Strategy Board to Invest in
                           Cyclofluidic R
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Ltd (NYSE:PFE) (LSE:PFZ) and UCB today announced the
formation of Cyclofluidic, a breakthrough technology company
established with the aim of significantly accelerating the drug
discovery process by allowing researchers to test a greater range of
potential new medicines in a shorter time. The UK Government's
Technology Strategy Board has helped facilitate this innovative
arrangement between Pfizer and UCB and will continue to support
Cyclofluidic by co-funding its R

   The aim of Cyclofluidic is to develop technologies that automate
and integrate processes known as flow chemistry and flow biology to
help pharmaceutical companies shorten timelines within the drug
development process.

   Explaining the background to the Technology Strategy Board's
support, its Chief Executive, Iain Gray, said: "Our role is to
stimulate the development and deployment of technologies which, as
well as benefiting society, also provide global business opportunities
for the UK. Cyclofluidic is an excellent example of the private and
public sectors working together to develop world-leading technologies
which have the potential to bring enormous benefit to patients in the
UK and around the world. We are delighted to offer our support and
investment."

   "Cyclofluidic's entry into the rapidly evolving microfluidic
technology area has the potential to radically transform the medicinal
chemistry and biology interface." Says Dr Neil Weir, Senior Vice
President Research at UCB. "It's an exciting opportunity for UCB and
Pfizer to collaborate and offers real potential for improved
productivity, underlining our commitment to innovation for patients."

   Dr Annette Doherty, Vice President and Research Head at Pfizer's
European R Headquarters said "We are extremely pleased to
collaborate with UCB and the Technology Strategy Board to help improve
efficiency in the drug development process. We are excited by the
potential of this new partnership to help us identify the most
effective medicines for later stages of development and - ultimately -
create new and improved therapies for patients."

   Peter Luke, Senior Director, Worldwide Business Development at
Pfizer said, "This is a great example of how public-private
partnerships can provide innovative technologies to speed medicines to
market. We are impressed by the way the Technology Strategy Board has
initiated a novel and creative deal structure."

   Cyclofluidic will be jointly owned by Pfizer and UCB, with each
company having both a seat and scientific observer rights on the
board.

   Currently, it takes between 12-15 years and a cost of up to GBP
500 million to develop a new medicine. One of the most time-intensive
and skilful parts of pharmaceutical research is the screening of
potential medicines against therapeutic targets.

   Cyclofluidic will develop a microfluidic closed loop lead
optimisation platform which will enable researchers to access state of
the art expertise in flow chemistry, flow screening and microfluidic
engineering. This will be addressed through extensive collaboration
with key academics and component manufacturers

   Cyclofluidic will also provide training for both flow chemistry
and biology scientists at its facility, to be located in the South of
England.

&lt;p&gt;Visa Introduces New Accounts Payable Automation and Data Integration Services Designed to Boost Efficiency of B2B Payment Process

   Alliances formed with global ERP provider Lawson and data
integration solutions leader Hubspan; U.S. Bank pilots data
integration services
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
In response to the growing trend of businesses seeking to
streamline expense management systems(1), Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today
announced the introduction of Visa Accounts Payable (AP) Automation, a
new service designed to help large and mid-sized businesses reduce
costs associated with expense management, purchasing and accounts
payable processes.

   Visa AP Automation is an enhancement to Visa's portfolio of
commercial payment products and services. The integration capabilities
are enabled by Visa Data Integration Services, a suite of new
commercial payment tools and applications that includes connectivity,
file mapping, data enrichment and transformation solutions that can
help businesses and banks eliminate time-consuming data integration
implementations. Specifically, this service provides solutions that
are designed accelerate time-to-market for new products and services
while decreasing internal resource requirements.

   "Helping businesses save time and money through more efficient B2B
payment solutions has always been at the core of Visa's strategy to
provide industry-leading commercial payment products and services,"
said Darren Parslow, head of Global Commercial Solutions, Visa Inc.
"With the introduction of Visa AP Automation, it is now even easier
for companies to eliminate costly check and paper-based processes and
enjoy the potential cost saving and efficiency improvements associated
with Visa Purchasing card transactions."

   Electronic purchasing card transactions can be more efficient
because they require less time and fewer resources than traditional
invoice processing and reconciliation. According to the recent Visa AP
Automation white paper(2), companies can achieve significant cost
saving by automating the accounts payable function. Specifically,
research by Aberdeen estimates that fully automated companies can save
$10.87 per payment - approximately $1.1 million in savings for
businesses processing 100,000 B2B payments per year. Visa purchasing
card programs also provide detailed invoice reconciliation reports to
help match invoices to payments more easily, helping companies save
both time and money.

   Integration with ERP Solutions and Expense Management Platforms

   As a central component of these new solutions, Visa AP Automation
integrates directly with enterprise resource planning (ERP) solutions
and company expense management technologies to automatically convert
existing paper based invoices and payments to more efficient
electronic transactions. To help enable seamless access to Visa
Purchasing card services, Visa has established alliances with global
ERP provider Lawson and data integration solutions leader Hubspan.
Using Lawson and Hubspan technologies, companies can more efficiently
generate accounts payable files that integrate with Visa's AP
Automation solution.

   "With today's competitive business environment, companies need to
maximize their investment in ERP systems," said Terry Plath, Vice
President Business Development at Lawson. "Integrating B2B payments
into those systems can immediately extend that investment and provide
a ripple effect in streamlining operations across departments and even
extended supply chains."

   "The ability to seamlessly integrate data has been an impediment
to more companies automating their payment processes," said Trisha
Gross, President and CEO at Hubspan. "Our alliance with Visa can help
eliminate these hurdles by providing companies with the on demand data
integration solutions designed to meet the needs of even the most
complex business environment utilizing a proven and rapid
implementation model."

   U.S Bank Pilot Visa Data Integration Services

   "U.S. Bank is committed to providing its customers with innovative
payment solutions, and exceptional customer service backed by the best
tools technology can provide," said Jeff Pape, Senior Vice President
of Product Management at U.S. Bank. "Visa's new data integration
services allow us to effectively integrate our existing Payment Plus
automation product and provide our customers with access to
best-in-class tools to manage their expenses and reduce operating
costs."

   Controlling Spending and Optimizing Cash Flow

   By integrating purchasing cards with accounts payable
transactions, Visa can dynamically adjust payment parameters to
provide flexible authorization and payment terms, match approved
invoices and help reduce the risk of unauthorized card usage. Data
integration can also provide better visibility into company expenses
and greater control over outgoing payments. Because suppliers charge a
Visa account, businesses can make consolidated payments after
receiving a statement from their financial institution, thus providing
more flexibility in the timing of payments and managing cash flow.

   Automating Supplier Payments

   The Visa AP Automation service requires minimal effort for company
accounts payable professionals to use. Companies simply provide their
approved supplier accounts payable files and Visa AP Automation turns
payments to accepting suppliers into electronic transactions through a
Visa Purchasing card account. Once the data is converted to a
consistent electronic format, the service enables streamlined
processing of approved supplier accounts payable files, matching
purchasing card payment parameters with invoices, sending remittances
to suppliers, and providing detailed payment data reports for account
reconciliation.

&lt;p&gt; * Adjusted EPS of 62 cents vs estimate of 60 cents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Analysts call for more aggressive deal-making&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Narrows 2008 profit forecast&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares close unchanged
 (adds closing share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Oct 21 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) posted a
better-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday on aggressive
cost cuts, but analysts cautioned the company has been overly
tame in buying new products to offset looming sales declines
for its Lipitor cholesterol fighter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lipitor delivered $3.1 billion in third-quarter worldwide
sales, a decrease of 1 percent in the increasingly competitive
field. The slide in the U.S. market was more pronounced, down
13 percent from a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's ongoing aggressive cost cuts are meant to help the
company remain competitive after Lipitor goes off-patent in
late 2011 and cheaper generics wrest away most of the branded
product's sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is now an organization where a focus on productivity
and efficiency is a way of life," company Chief Executive Jeff
Kindler said in an interview. "We need a cost structure that is
appropriate for our revenues."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Kindler said Pfizer aims to boost its revenue
through acquisitions. Although the value of many smaller
drugmakers may have fallen during the economic downturn, he
said Pfizer still has strict guidelines for deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It has to be strategic, at the right price and done in a
way that minimizes disruption to our productivity," said
Kindler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts have said Kindler, in his two years at the
helm of Pfizer, has been too cautious in buying companies or
products that could help replace Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly he hasn't done anything radical and I think that's
what people are looking for," said Natixis Bleichroeder analyst
Jon LeCroy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LeCroy said investors are growing increasingly impatient
with Pfizer and Kindler since company shares are trading at
11-year lows, having tumbled 26 percent in the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Pfizer deems its cash flow and cash holdings as
adequate to protect its industry-topping dividend, some
analysts say more of it should be used to buy drugmakers or
their products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The most troubling aspect of the story is the massive
patent 'cliff' Pfizer faces that will put its earnings growth
from 2012-2015 into sharply negative territory," Sanford
Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It will likely be difficult for Pfizer to effectively
replace these lost revenue streams, suggesting that a merger or
acquisition may lay in the company's future," Anderson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said it had net income of $2.28 billion, or 34 cents
per share, in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That compared with $761 million, or 11 cents per share, in
the year-earlier period, when the company took a hefty charge
to end its involvement with an inhaled insulin drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 62 cents per share,
topping analysts' average expectations by 2 cents, according to
Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue was barely changed at $11.97 billion. Foreign
exchange aided reported revenue by about $620 million, or 5
percent, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer's ability to match our 62 cents estimate and exceed
consensus of 60 cents seems in part due to expense management,
which should bode well for future estimates," Catherine Arnold,
an analyst for Credit Suisse, said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of Lyrica for neuropathic pain and fibromyalgia
jumped 45 percent to $675 million for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results were hurt by a 24 percent decline -- 49 percent in
the United States -- in sales of Chantix to help smokers quit,
which has been dogged by reports of psychiatric side effects.
Results also were reduced by the loss this year of patent
protection on allergy medicine Zyrtec and the cancer drug
Camptosar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer now expects by the end of the year to achieve
cumulative cost cuts of $2 billion compared with 2006, up $300
million from its prior estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company narrowed its full-year adjusted profit per
share forecast to $2.36 to $2.41, from its previous view of
$2.35 to $2.45. That would reflect earnings growth of 7.2
percent to 9.5 percent over last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares closed unchanged at $17.34 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the expansion of its end-to-end loan
fulfillment services to include new components and technology that will
help lenders make better use of outsourcing services such as loan
origination and loan fulfillment.

    A recent IBM-conducted survey that sampled senior mortgage executives at a
range of lending businesses found that 36% of lenders plan to increase use
of outsourcing services for mortgage origination over the next 18 months.
According to the survey these senior lending executives believe a large
proportion of mortgage origination tasks have the potential to be
outsourced.

    IBM's new and expanded services for lenders will be initially available in
the U.S. and include:

    New Outsourced Federal Housing Administration (FHA) Loan Fulfillment
Capabilities:

    Lenders today are struggling to adapt to the rapid increase in FHA loan
volume and the complexities of FHA processing. Now, IBM's private label
end-to-end mortgage loan fulfillment offering has been enhanced with the
addition of outsourced FHA fulfillment services. IBM, through its
wholly-owned subsidiary, IBM Lender Business Process Services, Inc. (IBM
LBPS), will offer a turnkey approach to ramping up FHA volume with minimal
disruption to operations.

    New Component Business Process Services:

    IBM now offers borrower and collateral verification services that can
mitigate fraud risk and improve loan quality as well as vendor management
services that can strengthen integration through the mortgage supply
chain, improving cycle times and accuracy. Other component business
process services include pre and post closing quality assurance to reduce
defects and improve adherence to investor guidelines. In addition,
document capture and data extraction can facilitate process automation
and reduce costs.

    New Levels of Flexibility in Lending Technology:

    IBM now offers lenders increased flexibility to leverage its lending
technology platform in whole or in individual components through a
technologically advanced loan origination platform that employs SOA
principles and web services. IBM's enhanced technology offerings include
improved configurability and functionality in IBM's core Loan Origination
System (LOS) and an Electronic Loan File solution that leverages IBM's
FileNet platform. As well, IBM provides web portals that improve
customer/broker experience at client web sites and browser-based
point-of-sale solutions that help sales teams close business. Web-based
mortgage training can improve knowledge of products, compliance and
lending fundamentals.

    "IBM's enhanced and expanded portfolio gives our lender clients a diverse
set of solutions to address their specific business needs in this
turbulent market," said Eric Ray, general manager for Financial Services
Solutions, IBM Managed Business Process Services. "IBM focuses on
providing our lender clients with business solutions that will improve
their agility, flexibility and competitiveness to manage their business
more effectively through dynamic market cycles."

    IBM is working with lenders to restructure their business models in order
to capture market share and strengthen competitiveness. IBM's lender
clients can derive benefits and advantages in the marketplace through
improved mortgage loan quality, risk management and compliance via
automation. Other benefits include improved borrower experience by
increasing consumer visibility and control and improved speed to market
and faster cycle times for new products, channels, geographies. Clients
can access leading edge lending technology and services without steep
upfront capital investments and recognize 20% to 40% lower cost by
shifting to a more variable cost structure.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the results of its annual Global Location
Trends study which reveals that multinational companies are increasingly
widening their investments to include a number of emerging countries,
with notable increases in Latin America and Africa.

    The study, conducted by IBM's Plant Location International-Global Location
Strategies service, was released today at the annual conference of the
International Economic Development Council in Atlanta, GA. The study's
findings reveal that Africa and Latin America together received
approximately 17 percent of the global jobs created from foreign
investment and expansion projects in 2007, compared to 13 percent in 2006.

    Africa in particular saw considerable growth in jobs created from foreign
investment, primarily in South Africa and in Morocco and Egypt in North
Africa. The continent's share of worldwide job creation from foreign
investment increased to 5 percent in 2007 from a little over 3.5 percent
in 2006. In Latin America, job creation from foreign investment increased
by almost 6 percent compared to 2006, with the continent receiving almost
12 percent of global jobs created through foreign investment.

    Within the different geographic regions, many economically emerging
countries are becoming serious contenders for investment. Southeast Europe
and Serbia in particular have become new major recipients of investment,
as these locations increasingly are seen as alternatives to traditional
Eastern European "hot spots." An analysis of jobs created from foreign
investment compared to population size reveals that Bulgaria, Romania and
Serbia are all ranked in the top 10 globally.

    "There has been a significant amount of investment going to a range of
locations that were previously 'off the map' for foreign investment
projects," said Roel Spee, global location strategies leader, IBM Global
Business Services. "This is a testament to the focus emerging markets have
placed on building out their infrastructure to spur economic development
and growth, and represents the next evolutionary step of globalization."

    The widening of investment activity also is evidenced by the fact that the
top 15 countries receiving jobs from foreign investment projects are
receiving less than 70 percent of global jobs created, compared to 73
percent in 2006 and 85 percent in 2005.

    Top-ranked sectors

    Overall, the top-ranked sector in which jobs are being created through
foreign investment is transport equipment (mainly automotive and
aerospace), with 200,000 jobs globally. The US was a leading investment
destination for this sector with almost 22,000 new jobs, second only to
Mexico with nearly 26,000 jobs. Electronics with 190,000 jobs, and
Information Communications Technology with 180,000 jobs, were the second
and third ranking sectors globally.

    The renewable energy sector is also quickly developing into an industry of
importance. Notably the solar energy sub-sector is quickly developing into
a very powerful engine for economic development in multiple regions around
the world, with almost 15,000 jobs created from the foreign projects
announced during 2007.

    Additional findings:

    The US remains the leading economy for job creation around the world,
with US headquartered companies responsible for 25 percent of the 1.2
million jobs created through foreign investment in 2007; Japan and Germany
follow with 12 and 11 percent respectively.

    India and China gradually have increased their role as job generating
economies -- combined they are responsible for 6.5 percent of the jobs,
created through foreign investment in 2007, compared to 3.7 percent in
2006.

    Indian companies focus their job creation mostly on China and the US,
whereas Chinese companies show a wide distribution of their global
investment activity.

    Methodology:

    The Global Location Trends report is derived from the IBM Global
Investment Locations Database (GILD), which is a unique database of IBM's
Global Location Strategies unit Plant Location International. The GILD
records investment project announcements around the world on an ongoing
basis, with the objective to monitor the location decisions that
corporate executives are making. It monitors corporate investments at the
project level. GILD records announcements of new and expansion projects
by companies globally. Mergers &amp; Acquisitions and other forms of
investment are not included, unless they lead to a new or expansion
project.

    IBM's Strategy &amp; Change service line, part of IBM Global Business
Services, uses GILD to inform corporate investor clients where recent
investment is going, and to provide key input for identifying location
options. GILD allows a very detailed analysis of recent investment trends
by geography, sub-sector and activity.

services including helpdesk, end user computing, network, telecom,
mainframe, data center and transformation services using IBM's global

&lt;p&gt;SALT LAKE CITY--(Business Wire)--
Interbank FX (www.IBFX.com), a leading provider of online
off-exchange retail foreign currency (Forex/FX) trading, today
announced that J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. has become the newest
dealer participant in IBFX's unique multibank liquidity feed, bringing
the total number of contributing major money center banks to seven.
This proprietary order routing system provides IBFX customers
unparalleled access to liquidity and automatically executes trades
with a collection of the world's largest financial institutions,
including Bank of America, Citigroup and Goldman Sachs, among others.

   J.P. Morgan proved particularly appealing to IBFX because of its
strong reputation as a market leader in the global foreign exchange
markets. According to the company's website, the firm is a market
maker in 200 currency pairs in spot, outright forwards, NDFs, option
contracts, cross-currency swaps and exotic currencies.

   "J.P. Morgan is a major player in the FX realm and we're thrilled
to welcome them as our newest liquidity provider," said IBFX Chairman
and President Todd Crosland. "We strongly believe that the firm's vast
expertise in currency products as well as their ability to provide
fast, competitive and consistent pricing will greatly enhance our
customer's trading experience, as well as grant them even greater
access to increased liquidity and world-class trading technology."

   J.P. Morgan's price stream is available now on IBFX's trading
platform, which enables both retail and institutional customers to
trade Forex without the hidden obstacles or potential conflicts of
interest of a dealing desk broker.

   The advantages of trading with agency-based IBFX as compared to a
single market maker platform, or "Dealing Desk," include:

   --  Competitive spreads

   --  Transparent pricing from major money center banks

   --  Anonymous order execution

   --  Smart routing to leading financial institutions

in the United States.

riskiest forms of investment available in the financial markets and
suitable for sophisticated individuals and institutions. The
possibility exists that you could sustain a substantial loss of funds
and therefore you should not invest money that you cannot afford to
lose.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Global private equity faces a dry spell in takeovers for at least two years due to the credit market crisis and firms will need to innovate to survive, a private equity specialist at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We won't get signs of a pickup in activity until 2010 at the earliest, maybe even 2011," said Martin Hintze, Managing Director at Goldman Sachs responsible for its buyout business in German-speaking Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The private equity branch is in a correction phase after the bursting of the credit market bubble," Hintze told Reuters on the margins of a financial conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said banks' reluctance to lend had made financing difficult even for deals worth less than 1 billion euros ($1.33 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The credit crisis had also pushed down the potential selling price for companies, making it a poor moment for private equity to exit from their investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity companies traditionally made money by taking over and restructuring companies, then selling them to other investors or floating them on the stock market at a large profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They borrowed most of the money they needed to buy a company, but that kind of funding has largely dried up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Buyout firms were now likely to hold on to their corporate investments longer as a result, perhaps for five to seven years, rather than the previous horizon of two to five years, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will be no more quick flips," Hintze said, adding that the return on the equity capital invested by private equity firms in the short term was bound to fall below the average of 17 percent posted between 1997 and 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Returns rose to more than 30 percent in the boom years 2006 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INNOVATION THROUGH DESPERATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dearth of financing and jittery investors were leading private equity firms to seek new avenues to make money, with the focus now on non-performing loans, infrastructure investments, financial services and minority stakes, Hintze said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Desperation makes you innovative," he said. "The classic credit-financed deal will not be on the agenda for the next six months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs's private equity activities will also focus on improving operations at the companies it currently holds in its portfolio, Hintze said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Germany, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners is invested in forklift truck maker Kion, building materials supplier Xella and specialty chemicals firm Cognis COGN.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the financial crisis broke out, private equity firms have been unable to carry out any deals over 10 billion euros, and the overall volume of credit available for buyouts has plunged by 87 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier, Hintze said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs banker also predicted that there would be some consolidation among private equity firms before the market turns up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There will be a process of selection.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT Oct 21 (Reuters) - Global private equity faces a
dry spell in takeovers for at least two years due to the credit
market crisis and firms will need to innovate to survive, a
private equity specialist at U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We won't get signs of a pickup in activity until 2010 at
the earliest, maybe even 2011," said Martin Hintze, Managing
Director at Goldman Sachs responsible for its buyout business in
German-speaking Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The private equity branch is in a correction phase after
the bursting of the credit market bubble," Hintze told Reuters
on the margins of a financial conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said banks' reluctance to lend had made financing
difficult even for deals worth less than 1 billion euros ($1.33
billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The credit crisis had also pushed down the potential selling
price for companies, making it a poor moment for private equity
to exit from their investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity companies traditionally made money by taking
over and restructuring companies, then selling them to other
investors or floating them on the stock market at a large
profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They borrowed most of the money they needed to buy a
company, but that kind of funding has largely dried up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buyout firms were now likely to hold on to their corporate
investments longer as a result, perhaps for five to seven years,
rather than the previous horizon of two to five years, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There will be no more quick flips," Hintze said, adding
that the return on the equity capital invested by private equity
firms in the short term was bound to fall below the average of
17 percent posted between 1997 and 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Returns rose to more than 30 percent in the boom years 2006
and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; INNOVATION THROUGH DESPERATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dearth of financing and jittery investors were leading
private equity firms to seek new avenues to make money, with the
focus now on non-performing loans, infrastructure investments,
financial services and minority stakes, Hintze said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Desperation makes you innovative," he said. "The classic
credit-financed deal will not be on the agenda for the next six
months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs's private equity activities will also focus on
improving operations at the companies it currently holds in its
portfolio, Hintze said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Germany, Goldman Sachs Capital Partners is invested in
forklift truck maker Kion, building materials supplier Xella and
specialty chemicals firm Cognis [COGN.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the financial crisis broke out, private equity firms
have been unable to carry out any deals over 10 billion euros,
and the overall volume of credit available for buyouts has
plunged by 87 percent in the third quarter compared with a year
earlier, Hintze said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman Sachs banker also predicted that there would be
some consolidation among private equity firms before the market
turns up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There will be a process of selection. A few firms invested
too much in the boom times," Hintze said.

&lt;p&gt;CA's Mainframe Management Solutions to Provide Support for New IBM z10 Business Class Mainframe

      Solutions Will Help Customers Implementing Administration,
 Security, and Performance Tools Recognize Enhanced Business Benefits
                     and Fulfill "Green IT" Goals
ISLANDIA, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
CA, Inc. (NASDAQ: CA) today announced that it plans to provide
essential support for the new IBM System z10(TM) Business Class (z10
BC) mainframe in its portfolio of mainframe management solutions. This
support will help CA customers choosing this new platform better
manage, govern, and secure their mainframe environments in order to
maximize business value and fulfill their "Green IT" objectives.

   CA customers who participated in IBM's early testing program are
already implementing current CA solutions in conjunction with their
initial z10 BC implementations.

   "Enterprise IT organizations have long depended on CA for the
tools and solutions they need to drive down the cost of IBM mainframe
ownership and optimize performance from their data center hardware
investments," said Chris O'Malley, executive vice president and
general manager of CA's Mainframe Business Unit. "This is especially
important today--as mainframe staffs take on greater burdens without
being allocated commensurately greater budgets."

   Customers have been relying on CA management solutions for IBM
mainframes for more than three decades. The benefits of these
management solutions have become even more important to IT
organizations as mainframe workloads have continued to grow in recent
years.

   The IBM z10 BC has particular appeal for IT organizations that
have to shoulder growing computing workloads while keeping energy
costs and consumption under control. CA solutions help customers
achieve "more with less" by optimizing performance and
efficiency--while reducing wasteful resource utilization and service
outages.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs reinstated Citigroup Inc (C.N) with a "sell" rating and recommended a "paired" trade in which investors sell Citigroup short, betting on a decline, and buy Morgan Stanley (MS.N) shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Citigroup, the giant U.S. bank, fell 5 percent to&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;$14.35, while those of Morgan Stanley rose 3 percent to $20.36 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe weak economic data will keep the (Citigroup) stock under pressure over the next six months and it is tough to see why the stock would head higher over this period," analyst William Tanona wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding Citigroup to Americas Conviction Sell list, Tanona said it will be difficult for the company to generate profitability over the next 12 months primarily due to additional write-downs and deteriorating credit market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as Tanona expects government investment to help the company's overall capital position, he does not see Citigroup returning to profitability until the second half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup, the nation's largest bank by assets until the third quarter, posted its fourth straight quarterly loss and $13 billion of write-downs and credit losses, driven by housing and credit market turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has not only been hit by rising losses from its traditional lending operations, but also by slowing profitability from emerging markets and its stock has lost 64 percent of its value over the past one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tanona has a six month price target of $11 on Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Morgan Stanley, the analyst said the company has very limited exposure to consumer credit, which is an area the brokerage believes will provide the most significant headwinds for Citigroup in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the third quarter, Morgan Stanley's profit beat expectations, helped by robust equity and commodities trading results and record prime brokerage fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley will generate profits over the next four quarters, thus adding to its capital base, whereas Citigroup will lose money, thus reducing its capital base, Tanona added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sweta Singh in Bangalore, Editing by Dinesh Nair, Deepak Kannan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, as the world's largest drug maker better controlled costs and benefited from the weaker dollar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, whose shares rose 3 percent in premarket trading, said it earned $2.28 billion, or 34 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That compared with $761 million, or 11 cents per share in the year-earlier period, when the company took a big charge to end its involvement with an inhaled insulin drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, Pfizer earned 62 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 60 cents a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue was barely changed at $11.97 billion. Foreign exchange favorably impacted reported revenue by about $620 million, or 5 percent, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also narrowed its full-year adjusted profit forecast to $2.36 to $2.41 per share, from its previous view of $2.35 to $2.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW Oct 21 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) said on
Tuesday it has agreed to raise gas supplies from its Russian
Sakhalin-1 project to Russia's Far East, yielding to pressure
from Gazprom (GAZP.MM) to prioritise the domestic market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil said it would increase gas supplies to Russia's
Pacific regions by 50 percent from 2012 in addition to the 3
billion cubic metres (bcm) a year it has already promised,
conditional on the timely development of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Neftegas Ltd confirms the Sakhalin-1 consortium is
prepared to supply an additional 1.5 bcm a year of gas to the
Russian domestic market for gasification of Primorsky region,
starting in 2012, in addition to the contracts already committed
with Khabarovsk region buyers," said spokeswoman Dilyara
Sydykova.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom, Russia's state-controlled gas export monopoly, has
long said it needs the gas produced at Sakahlin-1 to cover
domestic needs, while Exxon was planning to export the fuel to
China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sakhalin-1, which along with Exxon includes Russian state
oil firm Rosneft (ROSN.MM), Japan's Itochu (8001.T) and Marubeni
(8002.T) and India's ONGC (ONGC.BO), has signed a deal to supply
China with 8 bcm of gas a year and had hoped to start supplies
in the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source close to the talks told Reuters Exxon had not given
up its export plan and was still in talks with Gazprom, which
has said it would be prepared to pay market price for Sakahlin-1
gas. Exxon has said it would choose the most competitive offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gazprom, the world's largest gas producer, itself has a
rival plan to supply China from East Siberia via two links but
talks have been stalled for a year due to price disagreement.

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - British chip designer ARM, card network Visa, Chinese technology group Huawei and nine others said on Tuesday they planned to join the Symbian Foundation to get free access to its software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since June 2008, 52 companies have said they plan to join the foundation, including all major mobile phone makers, ATT said in a statement, giving it an edge over Google's Android in a battle over who will dominate the mobile phone software market in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia, the world's No.1 mobile phone maker, said in June it would buy out other shareholders of UK-based smartphone software maker Symbian for $410 million and make its software royalty-free to other phone makers in response to new rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia would contribute Symbian's assets to the not-for-profit organization, the Symbian Foundation, uniting with leading handset makers, network operators and communications chipmakers to create an open-source platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia has said it sees the Symbian Foundation as a faster way to bring new products to the markets. Foundation members also avoid having to pay fees to outside software developers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nokia expects to release the first unified Symbian Foundation software next year and introduce a completely new platform by June 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tarmo Virki; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities widened its fourth-quarter loss estimates for automakers General Motors Corp and Ford Motor Co, citing what it called a fundamentally altered credit environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brokerage said simultaneous weakness on both sides of the Atlantic, including a potential 15 percent fall in Western European auto sales in 2009, makes 2009 uniquely painful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"General Motors and Ford are both likely to survive, but we now see higher 09 cash burn rate," the brokerage added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage widened General Motors' 2008 loss estimate to $21 a share from $20.25 a share, and the 2009 loss estimate to $16.25 a share from $11 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Ford Motors it widened the 2008 loss estimate to $3.20 a share from $3 a share, and for 2009 to $1.90 loss per share from $0.95 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan also cut its earnings estimates on U.S. auto parts suppliers and downgraded four companies in its coverage, saying double-digit production declines on both sides of the Atlantic in 2009 may result in considerable balance sheet stress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies with low cash balances are likely to rely on revolving lines of credit, perhaps until 2010, to get through the downturn, but the share value of such suppliers could fall, the brokerage added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rating changes on U.S. auto parts suppliers are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPANY NEW RATING OLD RATING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Borgwarner Overweight Neutral&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRW Automotive Underweight Neutral&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lear Underweight Neutral&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;American Axle &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing Neutral Overweight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dana Neutral Overweight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Eric Yep in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

    "This partnership with Microsoft is a key milestone toward reaching our
shared goal of demonstrating the strong capabilities of our respective
platforms," said John Hart, senior vice president of business development
and marketing for IntelePeer. "Our jointly developed applications will
showcase the next wave of communications services that is possible without
incurring capital costs and risk. Prospective customers will be able to
see how voice, data and rich-media services can be blended into existing
products, delivering a new surge of communications-enabled business
processes that transform the user experience and enhance productivity."

    "Microsoft is working with IntelePeer to enable third-party media and
content providers to voice-enable applications using Microsoft's Live
Services and the IntelePeer AppworX platform," said Joseph Hofstader,
architect, Microsoft Communications Sector group. "Through their Web
services interface, IntelePeer has simplified access to their
carrier-grade network to enable rich media communications while
abstracting the complexities of telephony services."

    Personalized Rich Media Widget

    The white-labeled widget will showcase how a user can use a single login
to register and maintain preferences across multiple sites or
applications, such as configuring conference call parameters (bridge
numbers, PIN numbers, callback numbers), or registering to become a
member of any social or business network (SMS-enabled numbers, cell
phone, etc.). When a user logs into an "IntelePeer Powered Site" using
their Microsoft LiveID, all their communications preferences (how and
when to receive calls, on what device, etc.) will already be known.

    The widget will feature a mashup of business collaboration applications
and social networking sites, enhanced with voice, streaming video, music,
communication and conferencing capabilities. To make these features easy
to use, the user will see and work with a familiar interface built on
Microsoft Live Messenger. The mashup is valuable for business users in
search of higher team collaboration and productivity as well as
entertainment artists looking for better ways to engage their fan groups
and promote their events. Users will also be able to drag and drop their
registered contacts into a window to initiate a one-to-one or a conference
call between their existing Live Messenger friends, or to send them all a
text or voice message or other rich media content.

    This widget will integrate the IntelePeer SuperRegistry(TM),
Bridge-to-Services, Conference On-Demand, and Voice and SMS Blast with
Microsoft Live ID, Microsoft Messenger(TM), Microsoft Contacts(TM) and
Microsoft Silverlight(TM). IntelePeer is making this widget and others,
along with applets and Web services, available to software platform and
carrier partners' end users, branded and "skinned" to complement the
partners' applications.

    Available now, the IntelePeer AppworX open communications platform
integrates the IntelePeer global carrier-grade network and the
SuperRegistry depository of rich user data with a Web services-based
developer suite featuring applets, widgets and a rich set of APIs.

communications-enabled business processes through enhanced voice and
multimedia features from within any Web or IP-based application to any
phone or network-connected device. A communications-as-a-service (CaaS)

Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for third-quarter 2008.
The Company recorded reported revenues of $12.0 billion, consistent with the
year-ago quarter, despite the negative impact of the loss of U.S. exclusivity
for Zyrtec, which Pfizer ceased selling in late January 2008, and for Camptosar
in February 2008. Zyrtec and Camptosar third-quarter 2008 revenues decreased by
$549 million ($428 million and $121 million, respectively), compared with the
year-ago quarter. Foreign exchange favorably impacted reported revenues by
approximately $620 million or 5%, as did the solid performance of many key
products. Reported revenues in third-quarter 2008 were negatively impacted by a
$217 million adjustment to prior years' liabilities for product returns. U.S.
reported revenues accounted for 41% of the total compared with 48% in the
year-ago quarter, while international reported revenues accounted for 59% of the
total compared with 52% in the year-ago quarter. In the U.S., reported revenues
were $4.9 billion, a decrease of 15%, while international reported revenues were
$7.1 billion, an increase of 13%, compared to third-quarter 2007. The increase
in international reported revenues reflects the favorable impact of foreign
exchange of 10% and operational growth of 3%.

For third-quarter 2008, Pfizer posted reported net income of $2.3 billion,
compared with $761 million in the prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS
of $0.34, compared with $0.11 in the prior-year quarter. These increases were
primarily attributable to the after-tax charges of $2.1 billion related to the
decision to exit Exubera in the year-ago quarter, which was partially offset by
the after-tax charge in third-quarter 2008 of approximately $640 million
resulting from the previously announced agreements in principle to resolve
certain litigation involving the Company's non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
(NSAID) pain medicines as well as the after-tax charge of approximately $150
million associated with the aforementioned adjustment to prior years' product
returns liabilities.

For the first nine months of 2008, Pfizer recorded reported revenues of $36.0
billion, an increase of 1% compared with $35.5 billion in the same period in
2007, despite the loss of U.S. exclusivity of Norvasc (March 2007), Zyrtec
(January 2008) and Camptosar (February 2008), which collectively decreased
revenues by $2.1 billion. Foreign exchange favorably impacted revenues by
approximately $2.0 billion or 6%, as did the solid performance of many key
products. U.S. reported revenues accounted for 42% of the total compared with
49% in the year-ago period, while international reported revenues accounted for
58% of the total compared with 51% in the year-ago period. In the U.S., reported
revenues were $15.2 billion, a decrease of 13%, while international reported
revenues were $20.8 billion, an increase of 15% compared to the year-ago period.
The increase in international reported revenues reflects the favorable impact of
foreign exchange of 11% and operational growth of 4%.

For the first nine months of 2008, the Company posted reported net income of
$7.8 billion, compared with $5.4 billion in the prior-year period, and reported
diluted EPS of $1.16, compared with $0.78 in the prior-year period. These
increases were primarily attributable to the previously mentioned after-tax
charges of $2.1 billion related to Exubera in the year-ago quarter, lower
restructuring charges associated with cost-reduction initiatives, as well as
savings generated by those initiatives, which were partially offset by the
previously mentioned after-tax charge of approximately $640 million associated
with the resolution of certain NSAID litigation in third-quarter 2008.

Adjusted Revenue(1), Adjusted Income(1) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(1) Results

For third-quarter 2008, Pfizer posted adjusted revenues (1) of $12.2 billion, an
increase of 2% compared with $12.0 billion in the year-ago quarter. For the
first nine months of 2008, Pfizer posted adjusted revenues(1) of $36.0 billion,
an increase of 2% compared with $35.4 billion in the first nine months of 2007.
Adjusted revenues(1) were positively impacted by foreign exchange and the solid
performance of many key products, and negatively impacted by the loss of U.S.
exclusivity of Norvasc, Zyrtec and Camptosar.

For third-quarter 2008, Pfizer recorded adjusted income(1) of $4.2 billion, an
increase of 5% compared with $4.0 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted
diluted EPS(1) of $0.62, an increase of 7% compared with $0.58 in the year-ago
quarter. For the first nine months of 2008, Pfizer recorded adjusted income(1)
of $12.0 billion, an increase of 2% compared with $11.7 billion in the year-ago
period, and adjusted diluted EPS(1) of $1.77, an increase of 5% compared with
$1.68 in the year-ago period. In third-quarter 2008, adjusted income(1) and
adjusted diluted EPS(1) were positively impacted by foreign exchange and savings
associated with cost-reduction initiatives, which were partially offset by a
decrease in net interest income. In the first nine months of 2008 compared with
the same period in 2007, adjusted income(1) and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were
impacted by the aforementioned factors in addition to the 2007 payment to
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in connection with the apixaban collaboration, as
well as the 2008 favorable income tax adjustments.

Reported and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were also positively impacted by the full
benefit of Pfizer's purchase of $10.0 billion of the Company's common stock in
2007.

Executive Commentary

"We remain on-track to meet our 2008 objectives, despite the turbulent global
economy," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Jeff Kindler. "We continued
to deliver steady results this quarter, with many of our most important
medicines performing well around the world, including Lyrica, Celebrex, Viagra,
Sutent, Zyvox and Geodon, as well as Lipitor in a highly competitive market.
Looking ahead, we are making progress on our growth strategies, including
increasing the number of programs in our Phase 3 portfolio from 16 to 25 in the
last six months. With the formation of the Primary Care, Specialty Care and
Emerging Markets units, which join the existing Oncology and Established
Products units, we continue to evolve our pharmaceutical operations into
smaller, more focused units that can anticipate and respond more quickly to our
customers' and patients' changing needs."

Frank D'Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Based on our year-to-date
performance and outlook for the remainder of 2008, we are raising the lower end
of our guidance range for full-year 2008 revenues to $48.0 to $49.0 billion from
$47.0 to $49.0 billion. In addition, we have increased our guidance to at least
a $2.0 billion reduction of absolute adjusted total costs(2) at the end of 2008
compared with 2006 on a constant currency basis(3). At the end of third-quarter
2008, cost reductions under this program totaled $1.7 billion. We are pleased
with our progress and continue to look for new opportunities to further reduce
and more effectively manage our costs. Finally, with our strong balance sheet
and operating cash flow, we remain confident that we have the financial
flexibility to successfully execute our strategies and meet our financial
objectives in the face of the current macroeconomic environment."

Pharmaceutical

Pharmaceutical revenues for third-quarter 2008 were $11.0 billion, a decrease of
1% compared with the prior-year quarter, including the favorable impact of
foreign exchange of approximately $570 million or 5%. Third-quarter 2008
revenues from in-line and new products(6) increased 8% compared with the
year-ago quarter, which excludes the impact of the loss of U.S. exclusivity of
Norvasc, Zyrtec and Camptosar, which collectively decreased revenues by $627
million compared with the year-ago quarter. Additionally, pharmaceutical
revenues were impacted by a $217 million adjustment to the prior years' product
returns liabilities.

Lipitor revenues in third-quarter 2008 were $3.1 billion, a decrease of 1%
compared with the prior-year quarter. In the U.S., Lipitor revenues were $1.6
billion, a decrease of 13% compared with the prior-year quarter, while revenues
from international markets were $1.6 billion, an increase of 16%. The increase
in international revenues reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange of
approximately $130 million, or 10%, and operational growth of 6%. The global
statin market remains highly competitive, marked by decelerating market growth
and increasing cost constraints. Pfizer continues to respond to these market
dynamics by focusing on Lipitor's differentiated clinical profile backed with
strong landmark outcomes data. Pfizer recently launched a new multi-channel
"Heart to Heart" direct-to-consumer campaign featuring patient testimonials to
motivate new patients to speak with their physicians.

Lyrica revenues in third-quarter 2008 were $675 million, an increase of 45%
compared with the prior-year quarter, driven by high patient and physician
satisfaction globally demonstrated by strong physician prescribing patterns, as
well as growth in the U.S. fibromyalgia market, where we continue to expand our
leadership position. In the U.S., Lyrica revenues rose to $379 million, an
increase of 40% compared with the prior-year quarter, while international
revenues grew to $296 million, an increase of 51% primarily from operational
growth.

Celebrex revenues in third-quarter 2008 were $625 million, an increase of 8%
compared with the year-ago quarter, supported by continued educational and
promotional efforts highlighting the benefit-risk proposition of Celebrex, as
well as the favorable impact of foreign exchange. In the U.S., Celebrex revenues
were $450 million, an increase of 4% compared with the prior-year quarter, while
international revenues were $175 million, an increase of 21%.

Sutent revenues in third-quarter 2008 were $226 million, an increase of 49%
compared with the year-ago quarter, demonstrating continued strong performance
and market leadership in its approved indications. In the U.S., Sutent revenues
were $62 million, an increase of 4% compared with the prior-year quarter, while
international revenues were $164 million, an increase of 79%. Sutent is now
available in all major markets and is supported by efficacy, survival and
cost-effectiveness data. Further, our robust life cycle plan currently includes
Phase 3 clinical trials in cancers with unmet medical need, such as breast,
lung, colorectal, liver and prostate cancers.

Chantix (known as Champix outside the U.S.) revenues in third-quarter 2008 were
$182 million, a decrease of 24% compared with third-quarter 2007. In the U.S.,
Chantix revenues were $96 million, a decline of 49% compared with the prior-year
quarter, while international revenues were $86 million, an increase of 60%.
Third-quarter 2008 U.S. results continued to be negatively impacted by the
changes to the Chantix U.S. label in prior quarters. Pfizer continues its
educational and promotional efforts focused on the Chantix benefit-risk
proposition, the significant health consequences of smoking and the importance
of physician-patient dialogue in helping patients quit smoking. In September,
the U.S. branded direct-to-consumer campaign was re-launched with print,
television and web advertising. Chantix has now been either approved or launched
in all major markets.

Animal Health

Animal Health revenues for third-quarter 2008 were $708 million, an increase of
11% compared with $636 million in the year-ago quarter. The increase was driven
by the favorable impact of foreign exchange, which increased revenues by
approximately $35 million or 6%, in addition to strong global livestock and
companion animal product performance.

Costs and Expenses

In third-quarter 2008, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of revenues was
14.5% compared with 15.1% in third-quarter 2007. This improvement reflects the
benefits from our cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by a less
favorable geographic mix.

Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI) expenses(1) were $3.4
billion in third-quarter 2008, a decrease of 6% compared with the prior-year
quarter, due to the continued favorable impact of our cost-reduction
initiatives, which was partially offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange compared with the year-ago period.

Adjusted research and development (R) expenses were $1.8 billion in
third-quarter 2008, an increase of 2% compared with the prior-year period. This
primarily reflects increased spending on Phase 3 programs, partially offset by
the favorable impact of cost-reduction initiatives.

Overall, foreign exchange increased adjusted total costs(2) by $242 million or
3% in third-quarter 2008 compared with the prior-year period. Excluding the
impact of foreign exchange, adjusted total costs(2) decreased by approximately
$460 million, or 6%, compared with the year-ago quarter. The operational
improvement was driven partially by the reduction in workforce to 83,400 at the
end of third-quarter 2008, a decline of 3,600 compared with the end of
third-quarter 2007, as well as manufacturing and research and development site
exits.

At the end of third-quarter 2008, Pfizer achieved its goal to reduce absolute
adjusted total costs(2) by at least $1.5 to $2.0 billion at the end of 2008
compared with 2006 on a constant currency basis(3), having realized a total
reduction of $1.7 billion. Pfizer now expects to reduce absolute adjusted total
costs(2) by at least $2.0 billion by the end of 2008. These initiatives span
essentially all divisions, functions, markets and sites, and reflect a workforce
reduction of 14,600 since the target was established in January 2007.

Financial Guidance

For full-year 2008, Pfizer's financial guidance, at current exchange rates(9) is
summarized below. Revenue guidance has been narrowed to a range of $48.0 to
$49.0 billion from $47.0 to $49.0 billion, adjusted SI expenses(1) guidance
has been narrowed to a range of $14.4 to $14.7 billion from $14.4 to $14.9
billion, and adjusted diluted EPS(1) guidance has been narrowed to a range of
$2.36 to $2.41 from $2.35 to $2.45. Additionally, reported diluted EPS(10)
guidance has been reduced to a range of $1.61 to $1.71 from $1.73 to $1.88,
reflecting in part the charges associated with the previously mentioned
resolution of certain NSAID litigation.

For additional details, please see the attached financial schedules, product
revenue tables, supplemental information and disclosure notice.

(1) "Adjusted income" and its components and "adjusted diluted earnings per
share (EPS)" are defined as reported net income and its components and reported
diluted EPS excluding purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related
costs, discontinued operations and certain significant items. Adjusted Revenues,
Adjusted Cost of Sales, Adjusted SI expenses and Adjusted R expenses are
income statement line items prepared on the same basis, and therefore,
components of the overall Adjusted Income measure. As described under Adjusted
Income in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations section of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ended
June 29, 2008, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set
performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We
believe that investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by
disclosing this measure. Reconciliations of third-quarter 2008 and 2007, first
nine months of 2008 and 2007, and full-year 2007 adjusted income and its
components and adjusted diluted EPS to reported net income and its components
and reported diluted EPS, as well as reconciliations of full-year 2008 adjusted
income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance to full-year 2008 reported net income
and reported diluted EPS guidance, are provided in the materials accompanying
this report. The adjusted income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS
measures are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net
income and its components and diluted EPS.

(2) Represents primarily the total of Adjusted Cost of Sales(1), Adjusted SI
expenses(1) and Adjusted R expenses(1).

(3) Constant currency basis means that the applicable projected financial
measure is based upon the actual foreign exchange rates in effect during 2006.

(4) Represents worldwide revenues for all pharmaceutical products, excluding
revenues included in notes (5) and (7).

(5) Represents worldwide revenues for pharmaceutical products launched since
2006: Chantix/Champix, Eraxis, Selzentry/Celsentri, Sutent, Thelin and Toviaz.

(6) Total worldwide pharmaceutical revenues excluding the revenues of major
products that have lost exclusivity in the U.S. in 2007 and 2008 as described in
note (7). See the table accompanying this report.

(7) Represents worldwide revenues for pharmaceutical products that lost
exclusivity in the U.S. in 2007 and 2008: Camptosar, Norvasc and Zyrtec.

(8) Includes Consumer Healthcare business transition activity, Capsugel and
Pfizer Centersource.

(9) Current exchange rates approximate rates at the time of the third-quarter
earnings press release (October 2008).

(10) Excludes the potential effects of business-development transactions not
completed as of September 28, 2008, and of litigation-related matters not
substantially resolved as of September 28, 2008, as we do not forecast those
items.

1. The above financial statements present the three-month and nine-
    month periods ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007.
    Subsidiaries operating outside the United States are included for
    the three-month and nine-month periods ended August 24, 2008 and
    August 26, 2007.
2. The financial results for the three-month and nine-month periods
    ended September 28, 2008 are not necessarily indicative of the
    results which ultimately might be achieved for the current year.
3. The financial results for the three-month and nine-month periods
    ended September 30, 2007, include charges associated with the
    impairment of Exubera assets and the decision to exit and stop
    additional investment in the product. These charges include
    approximately $1.1 billion of intangible asset impairments, $661
    million of inventory write-offs, $454 million of fixed asset
    impairments, and $584 million of other exit costs. The charges are
    primarily included in Cost of Sales ($2.6 billion), Selling,
    informational and administrative expenses ($83 million), and
    Research and development expenses ($131 million).
4. As required, the estimated value of Acquisition-related in-process
    research and development charges (IPR) is expensed at
    acquisition date. In the first nine months of 2008, we expensed
    $567 million of IPR, primarily related to our acquisitions of
    Serenex, Inc., Encysive Pharmaceuticals Inc., CovX, Coley
    Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and two smaller acquisitions related to
    Animal Health. In the first nine months of 2007, we expensed $283
    million of IPR, primarily related to our acquisitions of
    BioRexis Pharmaceutical Corp. and Embrex, Inc.
5. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that
    contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market
    and distribute our products are included in Amortization of
    intangible assets as they benefit multiple business functions.
    Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that
    are associated with a single function are included in Cost of
    sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses or
    Research and development expenses, as appropriate.
6. Other (income)/deductions--net for the three-month and nine-month
    periods ended September 28, 2008, includes approximately $900
    million related to our agreements in principle to resolve certain
    litigation involving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain
    medicines.
7. Provision for taxes on income includes tax benefits in the first
    nine months of 2008 of approximately $305 million related to
    favorable tax settlements and of approximately $426 million
    related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies
    (Esperion Therapeutics Inc.), both recorded in the second quarter
    of 2008. Provision for taxes on income in the third quarter and
    first nine months of 2007 include a tax benefit ($681 million)
    relating to charges associated with Exubera.

Certain amounts and percentages may reflect rounding adjustments.

(1) Represents an adjustment to the prior years' liabilities for
 product returns.

(2) Total in-line and new products Pharmaceutical revenues, which
 exclude the revenues of major products that have lost exclusivity in
 the U.S. since the beginning of 2007 and the prior years' returns
 liabilities adjustment (1), is an alternative view of our
 Pharmaceutical revenues, and we believe that investors' understanding
 of Pharmaceutical revenues is enhanced by disclosing this performance
 measure. Norvasc lost its U.S. exclusivity in March 2007 and
 Camptosar lost its U.S. exclusivity in February 2008, and as is
 typical in the pharmaceutical industry, this has resulted in a
 dramatic decline in revenues due to generic competition.
 Zyrtec/Zyrtec D lost its U.S. exclusivity in January 2008 and we
 ceased marketing the product in late January 2008. We believe that
 excluding the impact of these products and the prior years' returns
 liabilities adjustment (1) assist the reader in understanding the
 dynamics of our diverse Pharmaceutical product portfolio in 2008.
 Because of its non-standardized definition, this total in-line and
 new products Pharmaceutical revenues measure has limitations as it
 may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures of
 other companies. This additional revenue measure is not, and should
 not be viewed as, a substitute for the U.S. GAAP comparison of
 Pharmaceutical revenues.

                            SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

1) Change in Revenues

The weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the
euro, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar, favorably impacted our revenues by
approximately $620 million, or 5%, in third-quarter 2008, compared to the same
period in 2007, and by approximately $2.0 billion, or 6%, in the first nine
months of 2008, compared to the same period in 2007.

Reported revenues in third-quarter 2008 include a reduction of $217 million to
adjust our prior years' liabilities for product returns. We previously accrued
for returns based on our overall returns experience, as well as our
understanding of the amount of product in the wholesale and retail channel.
After a recent detailed review of our returns experience, we determined that our
previous methodology needed to be revised, as the lag time between product sale
and return was actually much longer than we had previously assumed. Although
fully recorded in the current period, virtually all of the adjustment relates
back several years. We have also reviewed our expense calculations for the prior
years and determined that the expense recorded in those years was not materially
different from what would have been recorded under our revised approach.

2) Change in Cost of Sales

Reported cost of sales decreased 54% in third-quarter 2008, compared to the same
period in 2007, and decreased 26% in the first nine months of 2008, compared to
the same period in 2007. The decreases primarily reflect a $2.6 billion charge
in third-quarter 2007 related to our decision to exit Exubera and the savings
impact of our cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by the unfavorable
impact of foreign exchange, and for the first nine months of 2008, higher
implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives.

Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $172 million for third-quarter 2008, $520 million
for the nine months ended September 28, 2008, $173 million for third-quarter
2007, and $437 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.

Reported cost of sales also included $38 million for third-quarter 2008, $131
million for the nine months ended September 28, 2008, $41 million for
third-quarter 2007, and $121 million for the nine months ended September 30,
2007, related to business-transition activities associated with the sale of our
Consumer Healthcare business, completed in December 2006. This continuing
activity is transitional in nature and generally results from agreements that
seek to facilitate the orderly transfer of operations of our former Consumer
Healthcare business to the new owner.

Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 20.8 percentage
points to 17.7% in third-quarter 2008, compared to third-quarter 2007,
reflecting a $2.6 billion charge in third-quarter 2007 related to our decision
to exit Exubera and the favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives,
partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange.

3) Change in Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI) Expenses and
Research &amp; Development (R) Expenses

Reported SI expenses decreased 7% in third-quarter 2008, and decreased 1% in
the nine months ended September 28, 2008, compared to the same periods in 2007,
reflecting the savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and a $83
million charge in third-quarter 2007 related to our decision to exit Exubera,
partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange and the impact of higher
implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives.

Reported SI expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $95 million for third-quarter 2008, $270 million
for the nine months ended September 28, 2008, $70 million for third-quarter
2007, and $198 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.

Reported R expenses, excluding acquisition-related in-process research and
development charges (IPR), decreased 6% in third-quarter 2008, and decreased
3% in the nine months ended September 28, 2008, compared to the same periods in
2007. The decreases were primarily due to collaboration payments made to
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in second-quarter 2007 in connection with our
collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban and a $131 million charge in
third-quarter 2007 related to our decision to exit Exubera, in addition to the
realization of savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives. These
decreases were partially offset by higher R spending related to Phase 3
clinical trials in third-quarter 2008 and the unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange.

Reported R expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $108 million for third-quarter 2008, $348 million
for the nine months ended September 28, 2008, $130 million for third-quarter
2007, and $292 million for the nine months ended September 30, 2007.

IPR charges of $567 million in the first nine months of 2008 primarily related
to our acquisitions of Serenex, Inc., Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CovX,
Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and two smaller acquisitions related to Animal
Health. IPR charges in the first nine months of 2007 of $283 million,
primarily related to our acquisitions of BioRexis Pharmaceutical Corp. and
Embrex, Inc.

4) Asset Impairment Charges and Other Costs Associated with Exiting Exubera

In third-quarter 2007, after an assessment of the financial performance of
Exubera, an inhalable form of insulin for the treatment of diabetes, as well as
its lack of acceptance by patients, physicians and payers, we decided to exit
the product.

Total pre-tax charges for the third quarter and first nine months of 2007 were
$2.8 billion and were primarily included in Cost of sales ($2.6 billion),
Selling, informational and administrative expenses ($83 million), and Research
and development expenses ($131 million). Total pre-tax charges for the third
quarter and first nine months of 2008 were not significant.

*Certain prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation.

(a) The decreases in net interest income in the third quarter and first nine
months of 2008, compared to the same periods in 2007, were due primarily to
lower net financial assets and lower interest rates.

(b) In third-quarter 2008, we recorded litigation-related charges of
approximately $900 million related to our agreements in principle to resolve
certain litigation involving our non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain
medicines.

6) Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and minority interests for third-quarter
2008 was a 17.0% cost compared to a 25.4% benefit in third-quarter 2007, and in
the first nine months of 2008 was a 13.8% cost compared to a 12.7% cost in the
first nine months of 2007, reflecting tax benefits in second-quarter 2008 of
$305 million related to favorable tax settlements for multiple tax years and
$426 million related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies
(Esperion Therapeutic Inc.), higher acquired IPR expenses in 2008, which are
not deductible for tax purposes, and a tax benefit in third-quarter 2007 of $681
million related to charges associated with Exubera.

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was a cost of 22.3% in
third-quarter 2008, a cost of 21.4% in the first nine months of 2008, a cost of
21.7% in third-quarter 2007, and a cost of 21.8% in the first nine months of
2007. The lower rate on adjusted income(1) in the first nine months of 2008
reflects the $305 million in tax benefits related to the resolution of tax
issues noted above, partially offset by a change in geographical mix of income.

On October 3, 2008, the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act
(the Extenders Act) extended the research and development tax credit from
January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009. We estimate that this research and
development credit will reduce income tax expense in fourth-quarter 2008 by
approximately $120 million to $150 million. Certain provisions of the Tax
Increase and Prevention Reconciliation Act (TIPRA) have been extended through
2010. These provisions reduce our U.S. tax cost on certain types of foreign
income and were originally due to expire for us in 2009.

(1) "Adjusted income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are
defined as reported net income and reported diluted EPS excluding
purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued
operations and certain significant items. As described under Adjusted Income in
the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations section of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 29,
2008, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance
goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that
investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this
measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not, and
should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and diluted EPS.

   Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for
third-quarter 2008. The Company recorded reported revenues of $12.0
billion, consistent with the year-ago quarter, despite the negative
impact of the loss of U.S. exclusivity for Zyrtec, which Pfizer ceased
selling in late January 2008, and for Camptosar in February 2008.
Zyrtec and Camptosar third-quarter 2008 revenues decreased by $549
million ($428 million and $121 million, respectively), compared with
the year-ago quarter. Foreign exchange favorably impacted reported
revenues by approximately $620 million or 5%, as did the solid
performance of many key products. Reported revenues in third-quarter
2008 were negatively impacted by a $217 million adjustment to prior
years' liabilities for product returns. U.S. reported revenues
accounted for 41% of the total compared with 48% in the year-ago
quarter, while international reported revenues accounted for 59% of
the total compared with 52% in the year-ago quarter. In the U.S.,
reported revenues were $4.9 billion, a decrease of 15%, while
international reported revenues were $7.1 billion, an increase of 13%,
compared to third-quarter 2007. The increase in international reported
revenues reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange of 10% and
operational growth of 3%.

   For third-quarter 2008, Pfizer posted reported net income of $2.3
billion, compared with $761 million in the prior-year quarter, and
reported diluted EPS of $0.34, compared with $0.11 in the prior-year
quarter. These increases were primarily attributable to the after-tax
charges of $2.1 billion related to the decision to exit Exubera in the
year-ago quarter, which was partially offset by the after-tax charge
in third-quarter 2008 of approximately $640 million resulting from the
previously announced agreements in principle to resolve certain
litigation involving the Company's non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
(NSAID) pain medicines as well as the after-tax charge of
approximately $150 million associated with the aforementioned
adjustment to prior years' product returns liabilities.

   For the first nine months of 2008, Pfizer recorded reported
revenues of $36.0 billion, an increase of 1% compared with $35.5
billion in the same period in 2007, despite the loss of U.S.
exclusivity of Norvasc (March 2007), Zyrtec (January 2008) and
Camptosar (February 2008), which collectively decreased revenues by
$2.1 billion. Foreign exchange favorably impacted revenues by
approximately $2.0 billion or 6%, as did the solid performance of many
key products. U.S. reported revenues accounted for 42% of the total
compared with 49% in the year-ago period, while international reported
revenues accounted for 58% of the total compared with 51% in the
year-ago period. In the U.S., reported revenues were $15.2 billion, a
decrease of 13%, while international reported revenues were $20.8
billion, an increase of 15% compared to the year-ago period. The
increase in international reported revenues reflects the favorable
impact of foreign exchange of 11% and operational growth of 4%.

   For the first nine months of 2008, the Company posted reported net
income of $7.8 billion, compared with $5.4 billion in the prior-year
period, and reported diluted EPS of $1.16, compared with $0.78 in the
prior-year period. These increases were primarily attributable to the
previously mentioned after-tax charges of $2.1 billion related to
Exubera in the year-ago quarter, lower restructuring charges
associated with cost-reduction initiatives, as well as savings
generated by those initiatives, which were partially offset by the
previously mentioned after-tax charge of approximately $640 million
associated with the resolution of certain NSAID litigation in
third-quarter 2008.

   Adjusted Revenue(1), Adjusted Income(1) and Adjusted Diluted
EPS(1) Results

   For third-quarter 2008, Pfizer posted adjusted revenues (1) of
$12.2 billion, an increase of 2% compared with $12.0 billion in the
year-ago quarter. For the first nine months of 2008, Pfizer posted
adjusted revenues(1) of $36.0 billion, an increase of 2% compared with
$35.4 billion in the first nine months of 2007. Adjusted revenues(1)
were positively impacted by foreign exchange and the solid performance
of many key products, and negatively impacted by the loss of U.S.
exclusivity of Norvasc, Zyrtec and Camptosar.

   For third-quarter 2008, Pfizer recorded adjusted income(1) of $4.2
billion, an increase of 5% compared with $4.0 billion in the year-ago
quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(1) of $0.62, an increase of 7%
compared with $0.58 in the year-ago quarter. For the first nine months
of 2008, Pfizer recorded adjusted income(1) of $12.0 billion, an
increase of 2% compared with $11.7 billion in the year-ago period, and
adjusted diluted EPS(1) of $1.77, an increase of 5% compared with
$1.68 in the year-ago period. In third-quarter 2008, adjusted
income(1) and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were positively impacted by
foreign exchange and savings associated with cost-reduction
initiatives, which were partially offset by a decrease in net interest
income. In the first nine months of 2008 compared with the same period
in 2007, adjusted income(1) and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were impacted
by the aforementioned factors in addition to the 2007 payment to
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in connection with the apixaban
collaboration, as well as the 2008 favorable income tax adjustments.

   Reported and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were also positively impacted
by the full benefit of Pfizer's purchase of $10.0 billion of the
Company's common stock in 2007.

   Executive Commentary

   "We remain on-track to meet our 2008 objectives, despite the
turbulent global economy," said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Jeff Kindler. "We continued to deliver steady results this quarter,
with many of our most important medicines performing well around the
world, including Lyrica, Celebrex, Viagra, Sutent, Zyvox and Geodon,
as well as Lipitor in a highly competitive market. Looking ahead, we
are making progress on our growth strategies, including increasing the
number of programs in our Phase 3 portfolio from 16 to 25 in the last
six months. With the formation of the Primary Care, Specialty Care and
Emerging Markets units, which join the existing Oncology and
Established Products units, we continue to evolve our pharmaceutical
operations into smaller, more focused units that can anticipate and
respond more quickly to our customers' and patients' changing needs."

   Frank D'Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, commented, "Based on our
year-to-date performance and outlook for the remainder of 2008, we are
raising the lower end of our guidance range for full-year 2008
revenues to $48.0 to $49.0 billion from $47.0 to $49.0 billion. In
addition, we have increased our guidance to at least a $2.0 billion
reduction of absolute adjusted total costs(2) at the end of 2008
compared with 2006 on a constant currency basis(3). At the end of
third-quarter 2008, cost reductions under this program totaled $1.7
billion. We are pleased with our progress and continue to look for new
opportunities to further reduce and more effectively manage our costs.
Finally, with our strong balance sheet and operating cash flow, we
remain confident that we have the financial flexibility to
successfully execute our strategies and meet our financial objectives
in the face of the current macroeconomic environment."

   Pharmaceutical

   Pharmaceutical revenues for third-quarter 2008 were $11.0 billion,
a decrease of 1% compared with the prior-year quarter, including the
favorable impact of foreign exchange of approximately $570 million or
5%. Third-quarter 2008 revenues from in-line and new products(6)
increased 8% compared with the year-ago quarter, which excludes the
impact of the loss of U.S. exclusivity of Norvasc, Zyrtec and
Camptosar, which collectively decreased revenues by $627 million
compared with the year-ago quarter. Additionally, pharmaceutical
revenues were impacted by a $217 million adjustment to the prior
years' product returns liabilities.

   Lipitor revenues in third-quarter 2008 were $3.1 billion, a
decrease of 1% compared with the prior-year quarter. In the U.S.,
Lipitor revenues were $1.6 billion, a decrease of 13% compared with
the prior-year quarter, while revenues from international markets were
$1.6 billion, an increase of 16%. The increase in international
revenues reflects the favorable impact of foreign exchange of
approximately $130 million, or 10%, and operational growth of 6%. The
global statin market remains highly competitive, marked by
decelerating market growth and increasing cost constraints. Pfizer
continues to respond to these market dynamics by focusing on Lipitor's
differentiated clinical profile backed with strong landmark outcomes
data. Pfizer recently launched a new multi-channel "Heart to Heart"
direct-to-consumer campaign featuring patient testimonials to motivate
new patients to speak with their physicians.

   Lyrica revenues in third-quarter 2008 were $675 million, an
increase of 45% compared with the prior-year quarter, driven by high
patient and physician satisfaction globally demonstrated by strong
physician prescribing patterns, as well as growth in the U.S.
fibromyalgia market, where we continue to expand our leadership
position. In the U.S., Lyrica revenues rose to $379 million, an
increase of 40% compared with the prior-year quarter, while
international revenues grew to $296 million, an increase of 51%
primarily from operational growth.

   Celebrex revenues in third-quarter 2008 were $625 million, an
increase of 8% compared with the year-ago quarter, supported by
continued educational and promotional efforts highlighting the
benefit-risk proposition of Celebrex, as well as the favorable impact
of foreign exchange. In the U.S., Celebrex revenues were $450 million,
an increase of 4% compared with the prior-year quarter, while
international revenues were $175 million, an increase of 21%.

   Sutent revenues in third-quarter 2008 were $226 million, an
increase of 49% compared with the year-ago quarter, demonstrating
continued strong performance and market leadership in its approved
indications. In the U.S., Sutent revenues were $62 million, an
increase of 4% compared with the prior-year quarter, while
international revenues were $164 million, an increase of 79%. Sutent
is now available in all major markets and is supported by efficacy,
survival and cost-effectiveness data. Further, our robust life cycle
plan currently includes Phase 3 clinical trials in cancers with unmet
medical need, such as breast, lung, colorectal, liver and prostate
cancers.

   Chantix (known as Champix outside the U.S.) revenues in
third-quarter 2008 were $182 million, a decrease of 24% compared with
third-quarter 2007. In the U.S., Chantix revenues were $96 million, a
decline of 49% compared with the prior-year quarter, while
international revenues were $86 million, an increase of 60%.
Third-quarter 2008 U.S. results continued to be negatively impacted by
the changes to the Chantix U.S. label in prior quarters. Pfizer
continues its educational and promotional efforts focused on the
Chantix benefit-risk proposition, the significant health consequences
of smoking and the importance of physician-patient dialogue in helping
patients quit smoking. In September, the U.S. branded
direct-to-consumer campaign was re-launched with print, television and
web advertising. Chantix has now been either approved or launched in
all major markets.

   Animal Health

   Animal Health revenues for third-quarter 2008 were $708 million,
an increase of 11% compared with $636 million in the year-ago quarter.
The increase was driven by the favorable impact of foreign exchange,
which increased revenues by approximately $35 million or 6%, in
addition to strong global livestock and companion animal product
performance.

   Costs and Expenses

   In third-quarter 2008, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage
of revenues was 14.5% compared with 15.1% in third-quarter 2007. This
improvement reflects the benefits from our cost-reduction initiatives,
partially offset by a less favorable geographic mix.

   Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI)
expenses(1) were $3.4 billion in third-quarter 2008, a decrease of 6%
compared with the prior-year quarter, due to the continued favorable
impact of our cost-reduction initiatives, which was partially offset
by the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange compared with the
year-ago period.

   Adjusted research and development (R) expenses were $1.8 billion
in third-quarter 2008, an increase of 2% compared with the prior-year
period. This primarily reflects increased spending on Phase 3
programs, partially offset by the favorable impact of cost-reduction
initiatives.

   Overall, foreign exchange increased adjusted total costs(2) by
$242 million or 3% in third-quarter 2008 compared with the prior-year
period. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted total
costs(2) decreased by approximately $460 million, or 6%, compared with
the year-ago quarter. The operational improvement was driven partially
by the reduction in workforce to 83,400 at the end of third-quarter
2008, a decline of 3,600 compared with the end of third-quarter 2007,
as well as manufacturing and research and development site exits.

   At the end of third-quarter 2008, Pfizer achieved its goal to
reduce absolute adjusted total costs(2) by at least $1.5 to $2.0
billion at the end of 2008 compared with 2006 on a constant currency
basis(3), having realized a total reduction of $1.7 billion. Pfizer
now expects to reduce absolute adjusted total costs(2) by at least
$2.0 billion by the end of 2008. These initiatives span essentially
all divisions, functions, markets and sites, and reflect a workforce
reduction of 14,600 since the target was established in January 2007.

   Financial Guidance

   For full-year 2008, Pfizer's financial guidance, at current
exchange rates(9) is summarized below. Revenue guidance has been
narrowed to a range of $48.0 to $49.0 billion from $47.0 to $49.0
billion, adjusted SI expenses(1) guidance has been narrowed to a
range of $14.4 to $14.7 billion from $14.4 to $14.9 billion, and
adjusted diluted EPS(1) guidance has been narrowed to a range of $2.36
to $2.41 from $2.35 to $2.45. Additionally, reported diluted EPS(10)
guidance has been reduced to a range of $1.61 to $1.71 from $1.73 to
$1.88, reflecting in part the charges associated with the previously
mentioned resolution of certain NSAID litigation.

   For additional details, please see the attached financial
schedules, product revenue tables, supplemental information and
disclosure notice.

   (1) "Adjusted income" and its components and "adjusted diluted
earnings per share (EPS)" are defined as reported net income and its
components and reported diluted EPS excluding purchase-accounting
adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued operations and
certain significant items. Adjusted Revenues, Adjusted Cost of Sales,
Adjusted SI expenses and Adjusted R expenses are income statement
line items prepared on the same basis, and therefore, components of
the overall Adjusted Income measure. As described under Adjusted
Income in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer's Form 10-Q for
the fiscal quarter ended June 29, 2008, management uses adjusted
income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to measure
the performance of the overall company. We believe that investors'
understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing this
measure. Reconciliations of third-quarter 2008 and 2007, first nine
months of 2008 and 2007, and full-year 2007 adjusted income and its
components and adjusted diluted EPS to reported net income and its
components and reported diluted EPS, as well as reconciliations of
full-year 2008 adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS guidance to
full-year 2008 reported net income and reported diluted EPS guidance,
are provided in the materials accompanying this report. The adjusted
income and its components and adjusted diluted EPS measures are not,
and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and
its components and diluted EPS.

   (2) Represents primarily the total of Adjusted Cost of Sales(1),
Adjusted SI expenses(1) and Adjusted R expenses(1).

   (3) Constant currency basis means that the applicable projected
financial measure is based upon the actual foreign exchange rates in
effect during 2006.

   (4) Represents worldwide revenues for all pharmaceutical products,
excluding revenues included in notes (5) and (7).

   (5) Represents worldwide revenues for pharmaceutical products
launched since 2006: Chantix/Champix, Eraxis, Selzentry/Celsentri,
Sutent, Thelin and Toviaz.

   (6) Total worldwide pharmaceutical revenues excluding the revenues
of major products that have lost exclusivity in the U.S. in 2007 and
2008 as described in note (7). See the table accompanying this report.

   (7) Represents worldwide revenues for pharmaceutical products that
lost exclusivity in the U.S. in 2007 and 2008: Camptosar, Norvasc and
Zyrtec.

   (8) Includes Consumer Healthcare business transition activity,
Capsugel and Pfizer Centersource.

1. The above financial statements present the three-month and nine-
    month periods ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007.
    Subsidiaries operating outside the United States are included for
    the three-month and nine-month periods ended August 24, 2008 and
    August 26, 2007.
2. The financial results for the three-month and nine-month periods
    ended September 28, 2008 are not necessarily indicative of the
    results which ultimately might be achieved for the current year.
3. The financial results for the three-month and nine-month periods
    ended September 30, 2007, include charges associated with the
    impairment of Exubera assets and the decision to exit and stop
    additional investment in the product. These charges include
    approximately $1.1 billion of intangible asset impairments, $661
    million of inventory write-offs, $454 million of fixed asset
    impairments, and $584 million of other exit costs. The charges are
    primarily included in Cost of Sales ($2.6 billion), Selling,
    informational and administrative expenses ($83 million), and
    Research and development expenses ($131 million).
4. As required, the estimated value of Acquisition-related in-process
    research and development charges (IPR) is expensed at
    acquisition date. In the first nine months of 2008, we expensed
    $567 million of IPR, primarily related to our acquisitions of
    Serenex, Inc., Encysive Pharmaceuticals Inc., CovX, Coley
    Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and two smaller acquisitions related to
    Animal Health. In the first nine months of 2007, we expensed $283
    million of IPR, primarily related to our acquisitions of
    BioRexis Pharmaceutical Corp. and Embrex, Inc.
5. Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that
    contribute to our ability to sell, manufacture, research, market
    and distribute our products are included in Amortization of
    intangible assets as they benefit multiple business functions.
    Amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets that
    are associated with a single function are included in Cost of
    sales, Selling, informational and administrative expenses or
    Research and development expenses, as appropriate.
6. Other (income)/deductions--net for the three-month and nine-month
    periods ended September 28, 2008, includes approximately $900
    million related to our agreements in principle to resolve certain
    litigation involving non-steroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain
    medicines.
7. Provision for taxes on income includes tax benefits in the first
    nine months of 2008 of approximately $305 million related to
    favorable tax settlements and of approximately $426 million
    related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies
    (Esperion Therapeutics Inc.), both recorded in the second quarter
    of 2008. Provision for taxes on income in the third quarter and
    first nine months of 2007 include a tax benefit ($681 million)
    relating to charges associated with Exubera.

 measure. Norvasc lost its U.S. exclusivity in March 2007 and
 Camptosar lost its U.S. exclusivity in February 2008, and as is
 typical in the pharmaceutical industry, this has resulted in a
 dramatic decline in revenues due to generic competition.
 Zyrtec/Zyrtec D lost its U.S. exclusivity in January 2008 and we
 ceased marketing the product in late January 2008. We believe that
 excluding the impact of these products and the prior years' returns
 liabilities adjustment (1) assist the reader in understanding the
 dynamics of our diverse Pharmaceutical product portfolio in 2008.
 Because of its non-standardized definition, this total in-line and
 new products Pharmaceutical revenues measure has limitations as it
 may not be comparable with the calculation of similar measures of
 other companies. This additional revenue measure is not, and should
 not be viewed as, a substitute for the U.S. GAAP comparison of
 Pharmaceutical revenues.

(3) Total in-line and new products Pharmaceutical international
 revenues reflect a favorable impact in the third quarter and first
 nine months of 2008 due primarily to changes in foreign exchange
 rates.

                       SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

   1) Change in Revenues

   The weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies,
primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar, favorably
impacted our revenues by approximately $620 million, or 5%, in
third-quarter 2008, compared to the same period in 2007, and by
approximately $2.0 billion, or 6%, in the first nine months of 2008,
compared to the same period in 2007.

   Reported revenues in third-quarter 2008 include a reduction of
$217 million to adjust our prior years' liabilities for product
returns. We previously accrued for returns based on our overall
returns experience, as well as our understanding of the amount of
product in the wholesale and retail channel. After a recent detailed
review of our returns experience, we determined that our previous
methodology needed to be revised, as the lag time between product sale
and return was actually much longer than we had previously assumed.
Although fully recorded in the current period, virtually all of the
adjustment relates back several years. We have also reviewed our
expense calculations for the prior years and determined that the
expense recorded in those years was not materially different from what
would have been recorded under our revised approach.

   2) Change in Cost of Sales

   Reported cost of sales decreased 54% in third-quarter 2008,
compared to the same period in 2007, and decreased 26% in the first
nine months of 2008, compared to the same period in 2007. The
decreases primarily reflect a $2.6 billion charge in third-quarter
2007 related to our decision to exit Exubera and the savings impact of
our cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by the unfavorable
impact of foreign exchange, and for the first nine months of 2008,
higher implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction
initiatives.

   Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to
our cost-reduction initiatives of $172 million for third-quarter 2008,
$520 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2008, $173
million for third-quarter 2007, and $437 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2007.

   Reported cost of sales also included $38 million for third-quarter
2008, $131 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2008, $41
million for third-quarter 2007, and $121 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2007, related to business-transition activities
associated with the sale of our Consumer Healthcare business,
completed in December 2006. This continuing activity is transitional
in nature and generally results from agreements that seek to
facilitate the orderly transfer of operations of our former Consumer
Healthcare business to the new owner.

   Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 20.8
percentage points to 17.7% in third-quarter 2008, compared to
third-quarter 2007, reflecting a $2.6 billion charge in third-quarter
2007 related to our decision to exit Exubera and the favorable impact
of our cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by the impact of
foreign exchange.

   3) Change in Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI)
Expenses and Research &amp; Development (R) Expenses

   Reported SI expenses decreased 7% in third-quarter 2008, and
decreased 1% in the nine months ended September 28, 2008, compared to
the same periods in 2007, reflecting the savings associated with our
cost-reduction initiatives and a $83 million charge in third-quarter
2007 related to our decision to exit Exubera, partially offset by the
impact of foreign exchange and the impact of higher implementation
costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives.

   Reported SI expenses included implementation charges related to
our cost-reduction initiatives of $95 million for third-quarter 2008,
$270 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2008, $70 million
for third-quarter 2007, and $198 million for the nine months ended
September 30, 2007.

   Reported R expenses, excluding acquisition-related in-process
research and development charges (IPR), decreased 6% in
third-quarter 2008, and decreased 3% in the nine months ended
September 28, 2008, compared to the same periods in 2007. The
decreases were primarily due to collaboration payments made to
Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in second-quarter 2007 in connection with
our collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban and a $131
million charge in third-quarter 2007 related to our decision to exit
Exubera, in addition to the realization of savings associated with our
cost-reduction initiatives. These decreases were partially offset by
higher R spending related to Phase 3 clinical trials in
third-quarter 2008 and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange.

   Reported R expenses included implementation charges related to
our cost-reduction initiatives of $108 million for third-quarter 2008,
$348 million for the nine months ended September 28, 2008, $130
million for third-quarter 2007, and $292 million for the nine months
ended September 30, 2007.

   IPR charges of $567 million in the first nine months of 2008
primarily related to our acquisitions of Serenex, Inc., Encysive
Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CovX, Coley Pharmaceutical Group, Inc. and two
smaller acquisitions related to Animal Health. IPR charges in the
first nine months of 2007 of $283 million, primarily related to our
acquisitions of BioRexis Pharmaceutical Corp. and Embrex, Inc.

   4) Asset Impairment Charges and Other Costs Associated with
Exiting Exubera

   In third-quarter 2007, after an assessment of the financial
performance of Exubera, an inhalable form of insulin for the treatment
of diabetes, as well as its lack of acceptance by patients, physicians
and payers, we decided to exit the product.

   Total pre-tax charges for the third quarter and first nine months
of 2007 were $2.8 billion and were primarily included in Cost of sales
($2.6 billion), Selling, informational and administrative expenses
($83 million), and Research and development expenses ($131 million).
Total pre-tax charges for the third quarter and first nine months of
2008 were not significant.

*T

   *Certain prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the
current period presentation.

   (a) The decreases in net interest income in the third quarter and
first nine months of 2008, compared to the same periods in 2007, were
due primarily to lower net financial assets and lower interest rates.

   (b) In third-quarter 2008, we recorded litigation-related charges
of approximately $900 million related to our agreements in principle
to resolve certain litigation involving our non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain medicines.

   6) Effective Tax Rate

   The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing
operations before provision/(benefit) for taxes on income and minority
interests for third-quarter 2008 was a 17.0% cost compared to a 25.4%
benefit in third-quarter 2007, and in the first nine months of 2008
was a 13.8% cost compared to a 12.7% cost in the first nine months of
2007, reflecting tax benefits in second-quarter 2008 of $305 million
related to favorable tax settlements for multiple tax years and $426
million related to the sale of one of our biopharmaceutical companies
(Esperion Therapeutic Inc.), higher acquired IPR expenses in 2008,
which are not deductible for tax purposes, and a tax benefit in
third-quarter 2007 of $681 million related to charges associated with
Exubera.

   The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was a cost of 22.3%
in third-quarter 2008, a cost of 21.4% in the first nine months of
2008, a cost of 21.7% in third-quarter 2007, and a cost of 21.8% in
the first nine months of 2007. The lower rate on adjusted income(1) in
the first nine months of 2008 reflects the $305 million in tax
benefits related to the resolution of tax issues noted above,
partially offset by a change in geographical mix of income.

   On October 3, 2008, the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax
Relief Act (the Extenders Act) extended the research and development
tax credit from January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009. We estimate
that this research and development credit will reduce income tax
expense in fourth-quarter 2008 by approximately $120 million to $150
million. Certain provisions of the Tax Increase and Prevention
Reconciliation Act (TIPRA) have been extended through 2010. These
provisions reduce our U.S. tax cost on certain types of foreign income
and were originally due to expire for us in 2009.

   (1) "Adjusted income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share
(EPS)" are defined as reported net income and reported diluted EPS
excluding purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs,
discontinued operations and certain significant items. As described
under Adjusted Income in the Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations section of Pfizer's Form
10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 29, 2008, management uses
adjusted income, among other factors, to set performance goals and to
measure the performance of the overall company. We believe that
investors' understanding of our performance is enhanced by disclosing
this measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures
are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net
income and diluted EPS.

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Interview Highlights: Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Bank of America, Citigroup and Wells Fargo.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Analyst Interview. Today's interview
is with senior analyst Eric Rothmann, who discusses Goldman Sachs
(NYSE: GS), JP Morgan Chase (NYSE: JPM), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC),
Citigroup (NYSE: C) and Wells Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE: WFC).

   The investing public has had some time to absorb the ghastly
economic situation we currently find ourselves in. What pearls of
wisdom can you offer us?

   Banks have been great lenders, but lousy as owners of real estate.
While a "bailout" was inevitable, much like the "Brady Plan," it
leaves much to be desired. Of the $250 billion to be invested in the
financial institutions, approximately half goes to about nine big
banks, among them Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), JP Morgan Chase (JPM,
NYSE), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Citigroup (NYSE: C) and Wells
Fargo &amp; Co. (NYSE: WFC). One would think Hank Paulson (given his
experience on Wall Street) could have gotten at least competitive
terms (similar to Warren Buffett's) for the big fistful of money he
was handing out.

   So your verdict is that Buffett worked himself a better deal than
did Secretary of the Treasury?

   Paulson negotiations yielded preferred stock with a 5.0% dividend
for five-years, rising to 9.0% in the sixth year and there after.
While preferred dividends must be paid on this stock before common
stock, appears to be no other dividend restriction. In addition, the
government's preferred stock has no voting rights, unless the
institution misses six straight quarters of payments. Buffett
negotiations yielded preferred stock with a 10% dividend.

   For Paulson, preferred stock may be redeemed at par after three
years, or earlier if the bank is able to raise private capital. For
Buffett, there is a 10% pre-payment penalty. In Paulson's deal,
warrants equate to 15% of the par value of preferred stock, versus
warrants equating to 100% of the par value of the preferred stock in
the Buffett deal. Finally, for Paulson, all current executives can
keep their jobs, but no golden parachutes. Beyond this, there are only
minimal other restrictions on executive compensation.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI Oct 21 (Reuters) - British chip designer ARM (ARM.L), card network Visa (V.N), Chinese technology group Huawei [HWT.UL] and nine others said on Tuesday they planned to join the Symbian Foundation to get free access to its software.  Since June 2008, 52 companies have said they plan to join the foundation, including all major cellphone makers, AT said in a statement, giving it an edge over Google's (GOOG.O) Android in a battle over who will dominate the cellphone software market in coming years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nokia (NOK1V.HE), the world's No.1 cellphone maker, said in June it would buy out other shareholders of UK-based smartphone software maker Symbian for $410 million and make its software royalty-free to other phone makers in response to new rivals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nokia would contribute Symbian's assets to the not-for-profit organisation, the Symbian Foundation, uniting with leading handset makers, network operators and communications chipmakers to create an open-source platform.    Nokia has said it sees the Symbian Foundation as a faster way to bring new products to the markets. Foundation members also avoid having to pay fees to outside software developers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nokia expects to release the first unified Symbian Foundation software next year and introduce a completely new platform by June 2010. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Reporting by Tarmo Virki; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((tarmo.virki@reuters.com, +358-9-680 50 235, Reuters messaging: tarmo.virki.reuters.com@reuters.net))  Keywords: SYMBIAN GROUP/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2008.

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Sell List Highlights: General Electric Co, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co, eBay and Acuity Brands

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases details on a group of stocks that are currently
members of the exclusive Zacks #5 Rank List - Stocks to Sell Now.
These stocks are currently rated as a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell):
General Electric Co (NYSE: GE) and Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co (NYSE: ANF).
Further, Zacks announced #4 Rankings (Sell) on two other widely held
stocks: eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY) and Acuity Brands Inc (NYSE: AYI). To
see the full Zacks #5 Rank List - Stocks to Sell Now visit:
http://at.zacks.com/?id=92.

   Since inception in 1988, the S 500 has outperformed the Zacks #5
Rank List -- Stocks to Sell Now by 81% annually (+2% versus +11%).
While the rest of Wall Street continued to tout stocks during the
market declines of the last few years, Zacks told investors which
stocks to sell or avoid.

   Here is a synopsis of why GE and ANF have a Zacks Rank of #5
(Strong Sell) and should most likely be sold or avoided for the next
one to three months. Note that a #5 Strong Sell rating is applied to
5% of all the stocks in the Zacks Rank universe:

   General Electric Co (NYSE: GE) reported a 22% drop in
third-quarter profit, as the global credit crunch hurt the company's
finance arm. Quarterly profit was $4.31 billion, or 43 cents per
share, down from $5.56 billion, or 54 cents, a year earlier. The
company saw 2008 earnings falling up to 12% as rising defaults on
credit cards and other loans would force it to set aside about $1
billion to cover losses this year. Analysts expect General Electric to
earn $1.96 per share in 2008, down 25 cents from their forecasts a
month ago.

   Abercrombie &amp; Fitch Co (NYSE: ANF) saw a 14% fall in September
same-store sales and said its earnings in the second half of the year
would be 'appreciably below' the $3.40 to $3.45 a share it had
forecast it August. The retailer also issued third-quarter guidance
significantly below Street expectations proving yet again that even
the niche players are not immune to the economic slowdown. While
consensus estimates for 2008 profit has been reduced by 68 cents to
$4.27 per share in the last month, the most accurate estimate is more
bearish at $4.11.

   Here is a synopsis of why EBAY and AYI have a Zacks Rank of 4
(Sell) and should also most likely be sold or avoided for the next one
to three months. Note that a #4 Sell rating is applied to 15% of all
the stocks ranked by Zacks;

   eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY) cut its annual guidance recently and said
lackluster consumer spending would continue in 2009. The company now
sees profit of $1.69 to $1.71 per share in 2008, down from $1.72 to
$1.77 earlier. The fee changes made by the company in the beginning of
the year have hurt the business of many of its longtime merchants.
While its flagship auction business slowed sharply, eBay said the
strength of the U.S. dollar, recent acquisitions and tough economic
conditions would weigh on its futures earnings.

   Acuity Brands Inc (NYSE: AYI) missed Street forecasts in the
fourth quarter due to weakness in housing and retail construction
markets and high raw material costs. The lighting maker saw net income
dropping 19% to $41.9 million, or $1.02 per share from $51.5 million,
or $1.16, a year ago. To withstand slowing demand, the company is now
trying to lower operating expenditure by consolidating plants and
cutting 800 jobs. Analysts have slashed their 2009 earnings forecast
by 34 cents to $3.88 per share in the last month.

   Truly taking advantage of the Zacks Rank requires the
understanding of how it works. The free special report; "Zacks Rank
Guide: Harnessing the Power of Earnings Estimate Revisions" is
available to provide this insightful background. Download a free copy

   About the Zacks Rank

   Since 1988, the Zacks Rank has proven that "Earnings estimate
revisions are the most powerful force impacting stock prices." Since
inception in 1988, #1 Rank Stocks have generated an average annual
return of +30%. During the 2000-2002 bear market, Zacks #1 Rank stocks
gained +43.8%, while the S 500 tumbled -37.6%. Also note that the
Zacks Rank system has just as many Strong Sell recommendations (Rank
#5) as Strong Buy recommendations (Rank #1). Since 1988, Zacks Rank #5
stocks have underperformed the S 500 by 81% annually (+2% versus
+11%). Thus, the Zacks Rank system allows investors to truly manage
portfolio trading effectively.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Completes Settlement Agreements with State Attorneys General Regarding its NSAID Pain Medications

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc announced today that it has finalized agreements with 33 states and
the District of Columbia to resolve claims primarily related to alleged
promotional practices for Bextra, a medication Pfizer voluntarily withdrew from
the United States market in 2005. Last week Pfizer announced agreements in
principle to resolve these state claims, indicating that it would pay $60
million and adopt compliance measures as part of the settlement that complement
policies and procedures previously established by the Company.

"As we announced last week, these settlements avoid the disruption and expense
of litigation and put these matters behind us," said Amy W. Schulman, senior
vice president and general counsel of Pfizer. "Bextra brought effective pain
relief to millions of arthritis patients who did not find relief with other
treatment therapies. This medicine was rigorously studied and tested by the
Company and independent medical experts, and information about its benefits and
risks was fully disclosed to the FDA."

Under the settlements agreed to by the States, Pfizer denies the allegations in
the complaints that its promotional practices violated state laws. In response
to allegations contained in documents filed by the States, the Company said:

    --  It shared with the FDA in a timely manner all of the data in its
        possession regarding the safety and efficacy of Bextra, as well as the
        Company's approved materials describing such data.

    --  In addition, the Bextra label, which set forth the approved indications
        and contained all of the scientific data deemed to be relevant by the
        FDA, was widely available to physicians.

    --  All of the studies discussed in the complaints and provided to
        physicians were principally authored by doctors who did not work at the
        Company, and were subjected to rigorous peer review before they were
        published in respected journals.

    --  The CABG studies referenced in the complaints involved the
        investigational use of an intravenous form of Bextra, and are not
        applicable to settings outside of CABG. Specifically, the CABG study
        safety findings were not replicated in other studies in general or other
        surgical settings. Indeed, in 2005, the FDA acknowledged that it could
        not determine the significance of the CABG data for patients in other
        contexts. The FDA also stated that the totality of the Bextra data did
        not demonstrate that Bextra posed a different level of cardiovascular
        risk than other prescription NSAIDs.

    --  Pfizer provided physicians with truthful and material information about
        the safety and efficacy of Bextra. When responding to doctors' questions
        about Bextra with a medical information letter, the Company included a
        copy of the Bextra label.

    --  Pfizer's support of Continuing Medical Education programs complies with
        the national standards adopted by the ACCME. Pfizer has also adopted
        strict guidelines regarding its promotional programs for prescribers
        that require compliance with all applicable laws. Pfizer's relationships
        with doctors, moreover, are also governed by industry-adopted standards.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail, background, efforts to seek reaction, dateline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 22 (Reuters) - A top U.S. lawmaker is
probing whether a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
official gave information to a JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
executive about SEC investigations into Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sen. Chuck Grassley, the ranking Republican on the Senate
Finance Committee, wrote to SEC Chairman Christopher Cox,
citing "anonymous but specific" information about what he
called inappropriate contact between the SEC's enforcement
director and JPMorgan's general counsel while the investment
bank was mulling a bid for Bear Stearns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC "enforcement director gave information to the
(General Counsel) of JPMorgan Chase (himself a former SEC
enforcement director) about the state of various investigations
into Bear," Grassley wrote in his letter dated Oct. 21, citing
the anonymous information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Linda Thomsen is the SEC's enforcement director, while
former SEC enforcement director Stephen Cutler is general
counsel at JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, the Federal Reserve backed JPMorgan's firesale
purchase of ailing investment bank Bear Stearns for $2 a share,
after Bear had previously traded at $30.85 per share. JPMorgan
later agreed to raise the price to about $10 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This inside information, gotten through a personal
relationship, would be critical in helping Morgan put together
a low-ball bid to Bear and the US government," Grassley's
letter continued, citing his anonymous tip. "This could have
materially affected the amount of guarantees that Morgan was
able to negotiate from the Federal Reserve."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An SEC spokesman declined to comment on Grassley's letter.
JPMorgan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, SEC staff declined, in a publicly released
letter, to assure JPMorgan that there would be no future
enforcement actions regarding Bear Stearns' statements ahead of
their merger announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC has been hammered in recent weeks by reports of
improprieties in its enforcement division. The SEC's inspector
general found earlier this month that an SEC regional director
failed to vigorously enforce securities laws in a 2003
investigation into Bear Stearns' pricing of collateralized debt
obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The inspector general found in a separate report in October
that the SEC should discipline Thomsen and two supervisors for
their role in an insider trading probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in another inspector general report in September, the
internal watchdog said the SEC failed to adequately supervise
Bear Stearns and limit the amount of risk it took on.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is expected to cut its forecasts for the remainder of the year as customers curtail software spending amid the economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares have plunged to an eight-year low and its rivals such as SAP AG (SAPG.DE) have warned of tighter demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the current macro-economic situation, I think there is an expectation that it will use this opportunity to bring down guidance a little bit," said Pat Becker Jr., portfolio manager at Becker Capital Management. Microsoft is the largest holding of the $62 million Becker Value Equity Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer confirmed what most investors already suspected: the world's largest software maker is not immune to the economic downturn gripping the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is already bracing for Microsoft to fall short of expectations in fiscal 2009 or come in at the low-end of the forecast range that it issued in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Reuters Estimates, analysts on average expect fiscal 2009 earnings of $2.12 per share -- the bottom of Microsoft's own forecast range of between $2.12 and $2.18 per share. Wall Street sees revenue at $66.7 billion, below the company's estimated range of $67.3 billion to $68.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has long pushed the idea that its products make up a small but essential part of corporate technology spending and that its software and its markets are diverse and not overly exposed to any one area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, many investors expect the current financial crisis to run longer and cause a deeper economic downturn than any in recent memory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McAdams Wright Ragen analyst Sid Parakh, who has a "buy" rating on Microsoft, said a spending slowdown could hit personal computer sales, which are closely coupled with revenue at the company's Windows business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Considering the turbulence in the financial markets as well as increased caution over the global economic outlook, we expect customers to pull back on IT spending," Parakh wrote in a note to clients on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESILIENT PC DEMAND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the September quarter, worldwide PC shipments remained strong, rising 15 percent from a year ago, driven by demand outside of North America for lower-cost laptops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Semiconductor giant Intel Corp (INTC.O) also provided some comfort to technology investors, posting a 12 percent profit rise for the September quarter and beating expectations. It issued a conservative -- but not awful -- outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Resilient PC demand and new product launches from its computer server business bodes well for Microsoft's earnings from the quarter ended September 30. Analysts expect profit to rise about 3 percent, to 47 cents per share, on an 8 percent rise in revenue to $14.8 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is forecasting earnings per share of 55 cents in the current quarter on revenue of $18 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The December quarter is usually known for being a busy period for Microsoft's entertainment and devices division as consumers snap up Xbox 360 consoles and video game titles during the holiday shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company cut Xbox 360 prices in September, lowering the price of its entry-level console to below $200 -- a key mass-market price level that Microsoft has said historically accounted for more than 75 percent of all machine sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like we are going to have a really difficult holiday season with the U.S. consumer pulling back a lot. So the Xbox business might be weak going forward," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares have fallen about 10 percent since the company last reported results on July 17. The stock has fared better than the broader market with the SP 500 and Nasdaq down more than 20 percent during that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares touched an eight-year low at $20.65 on October 10, but it has clawed back to above $24 since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA and ARMONK, NY, Oct 22 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it has signed a one-year extension to its
contract with Australian government agency, Medicare, for the provision
of IT infrastructure services.

    Under the agreement, valued at approximately AUD$70 million, IBM will
continue to provide mainframe, midrange, desktop, data warehouse and call
center support, building on a relationship with Medicare which dates back
to 2000.

    Since that time, IBM has assisted Medicare in transforming its service
provision to Australian healthcare constituents. Examples include
supporting Medicare Australia Online Services, in which viewers can view,
update and request information held by Medicare Australia, and enhancing
the delivery of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, whereby payments are
made to pharmacists to subsidize certain essential medicines.

    During 2007, IBM supported more than four million mainframe transactions
and two million web e-business transactions each day as thousands of
entities, including pharmacies, general practitioners, health insurers,
hospitals and individuals, connected with Medicare to deliver improved
health outcomes for Australia.

    "IBM is delighted to continue its relationship as a key partner to
Medicare, enabling it to transform service delivery to become more
flexible and responsive in meeting Australia's healthcare needs," said
Steve Bond, General Manager for Public Sector, IBM Australia and New
Zealand.

    "As more and more Australians turn to the internet for provision of
government services, IBM has a key role to play in providing Medicare with
the robust, scaleable and secure technology it needs to deliver high
quality government services to the Australian community."

    The agreement was signed in October 2008.

&lt;p&gt;Aetna and Microsoft HealthVault Empower Aetna Members to Create a Portable Record of Their Personal Health

      --Collaboration Helps People Take Control of Their Health--
HARTFORD, Conn. &amp; REDMOND, Wash.--(Business Wire)--
Aetna (NYSE: AET) and Microsoft Corp. today announced a
collaboration to provide Aetna members with portability of their
personal health information. Aetna members will soon be able to
transfer the information in their Aetna CareEngine(R)-powered Personal
Health Record (PHR) directly to Microsoft HealthVault, a
security-enhanced, Web-based consumer health platform. Information
stored in HealthVault will be available to members - even if they
change jobs or health plans - creating a truly portable record of
their health.

   "We've made significant investments in health information
technology capabilities because we believe these tools can help
advance quality in the health care system, reduce waste and improve
the overall health of our members," said Aetna President Mark
Bertolini. "Through our PHR, we have been able to offer our members a
tool to help them take control of their health, based on the belief
that members own their information and should have access to that
information in a secure, easy to use online record. By teaming up with
Microsoft, we can now offer them continuous access to their health
information."

   Beginning in November, Aetna members will be able to log in to
their Aetna PHR and transfer the information to a HealthVault account,
where it can be stored, accessed and shared, as directed by the
member, with health care providers, health plans or a variety of Web
applications to help improve health and wellness. In 2009, members
will be able to import personal health data from their HealthVault
account to their Aetna PHR.

   "Our relationship with Aetna represents an important first step in
reaching our shared goal of providing consumers with resources to
become more informed and engaged in making health and wellness
decisions for themselves and their families," said Peter Neupert,
corporate vice president of the Health Solutions Group at Microsoft.
"Today, Microsoft and Aetna are collaborating to make it easy for
members to use their health information regardless of their employer
or health plan. We will continue to work together to explore new ways
to bring consumers innovative and practical tools for improving their
health."

   Aetna's PHR, available to approximately six million Aetna members,
is pre-populated with a wide variety of health information gathered
from across the health care spectrum - such as physician offices,
labs, diagnostic treatments and pharmacies. That information is
combined with user-entered information such as family health history
or allergies, and housed in a secure, online location. In addition, it
uses the patented CareEngine technology to identify and alert members
to potential gaps in care, helping them achieve their optimal health.
Aetna's PHR is also integrated with other wellness resources offered
by Aetna, including Aetna's online wellness program, Simple Steps to a
Healthier Life(R) and Aetna Health Connections(SM) disease management
programs. Click here to learn more about the Aetna PHR.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 22 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities revised its
ratings and price targets on several companies in the U.S.
electronics manufacturing services sector, and said though the
market was pricing in a very bleak outlook for tech, it would
not be as bad as the last onein 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage cited three reasons for its optimistic view -
fairly lean inventories, no mergers and acquisitionor capacity
expansion binge to delay the recovery, and companies are much
more diversified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It, however, downgraded CTS Corp (CTS.N) and TTM
Technologies (TTMI.O), saying factors such as unfavorable
exposures, andlack of catalysts leave these stocks vulnerable
to further stock declines and a lackof a bounce back when the
markets begin to improve again. It also cut price targets on
number of companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage downgraded CTS to "underweight" from
"neutral" and TTM Technologiesto "neutral" from "overweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage upgraded Nam Tai Electronics NTE.N and
Jabil (JBL.N) to "overweight" from "neutral," saying in JBL's
case it was the very compelling risk/reward profile that really
stood out, while for NTE it was its secure dividend payment and
yield that has ballooned to 11.1 percent that was the catalyst
for the upgrade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It  also maintained "overweight" rating on Plexus (PLXS.O)
and Flextronics International (FLEX.O) and said it is the two
best positioned companies in its coverage.
 The brokerage said overall, none of the companies in its
coverage are suffering from being over levered and added in
fact a few actually have too much cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The following is the list of price target cuts by JP

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Oct 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Aberdeen Group, a Harte-Hanks Company (NYSE: HHS),
today announced the availability of a new online information security
assessment tool designed specifically for midmarket organizations. The
tool, which utilizes Aberdeen's primary research in IT Security, helps
midsize companies identify potential security issues such as safeguarding
critical data, securing IT infrastructure and meeting compliance demands,
and recommends solutions to resolve those issues.

    The simple assessment helps midsize companies determine their security
posture by benchmarking against Best-in-Class organizations, as identified
through Aberdeen's PACE(TM) (Pressures, Actions, Capabilities &amp; Enablers)
research model. By completing a 10-minute online survey, midsize companies
receive a personalized summary of how they compare and helps them to
quickly identify the IT Security strategies, capabilities, and
technologies used by companies with Best-in-Class performance. The
companies can then implement those strategies to improve their security
infrastructure.

    "Together with Aberdeen, IBM has developed an online tool that can help
midsize companies find security holes quickly and prioritize their
strategic actions," said Marc Dupaquier, General Manager, IBM Global
Midmarket. "Not only does this new security assessment tool help identify
security issues, it also will help clients solve those issues and comply
with government regulations."

    "Aberdeen is pleased to partner with IBM and enable midsize organizations
to make timely, informed decisions on their security needs based on our
industry research," said Stephen Gold, President of Aberdeen. "The
Assessment Tool Series, launched in 2004, has proven to be a very
effective format to share research in a very personalized way."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today extended its most widely used software, Lotus
Notes, to new markets through delivery as a hosted service, Lotus Notes
Hosted Messaging.

    IBM has been driving Lotus Notes and Domino into new markets such as
iPhone users, social networking and unified communications clients and
many other new businesses around the world.

    Lotus has led IBM into the nascent cloud services market with offerings
such as Sametime Unyte Web conferencing software and IBM's "Bluehouse"
extranet collaboration service. IBM is extending its cloud services
strategy to its flagship Lotus Notes franchise to attract new customers
including more retail, global manufacturing and insurance companies. Lotus
Notes Hosted Messaging can be customized to the needs of each company by
an IBM services team.

    Using a hosting service, there is no need to purchase, house or supply
energy to new hardware needed to run the software. Customers of Lotus
Notes messaging software can instead focus their IT resources on other
strategic business projects.

    Priced starting at less than $10 per user per month, new IBM Lotus Notes
Hosted Messaging is designed primarily for companies with 1,000 to 10,000
employees. However, IBM can tailor software and service plans for smaller
and larger companies as well.

    The new hosted Notes Messaging service is supported by a dedicated IBM
team and features two service level agreement options, spam and virus
filtering and back up and restore services.

    "Software delivery models such as cloud computing, software-as-a-service
and hosting are evolving because companies want flexibility," said Kevin
Cavanaugh, vice president, IBM Messaging and Collaboration. "The new
hosted Notes is another option IBM is providing to customers. There is
high demand for this approach because of the way it is delivered, and its
competitive pricing," he added.

    For additional terms and conditions of the new hosted software and
service, visit
www.ibm.com/software/lotus/notesanddomino/hosted-licensing.html.

    IBM also announced today that Global Hyatt Corporation has chosen IBM
Lotus Notes Domino and Sametime collaboration and unified communications
software for its 365 hotels worldwide. For more information, visit
http://www.ibm.com/press/us/en/presskit/25100.wss.

    IBM Lotus Notes and Domino has grown to 140 million licensed users
worldwide, has increased its user base across small- and medium-sized
businesses, and is used by more than half of the largest 100 corporations
in the world, and 80 percent of the top 10 global companies in banking,
telecommunications, aerospace and defense, consumer products, electronics,
insurance and pharmaceuticals. Lotus Sametime, IBM's industry-leading
unified communications and collaboration platform, has more than 100
million users. It has been purchased by 29 of the Global Fortune 50, 12 of
the top 15 worldwide banks, eight of the top 10 worldwide pharmaceutical
firms, and four of the five most profitable companies in the world. An
Osterman Research report* states that IBM Lotus Sametime is the number one
instant messaging software used by corporations. For more information,

by tens of thousands of companies worldwide, now has new features that
lead to significant storage savings.

standardize on IBM Lotus Notes and Domino and Lotus Sametime software for
unified communications and collaboration among its thousands of employees
and its 365 managed, operated and franchised hotels in 45 countries. The
deal includes e-mail, document sharing, calendaring and the ability to
combine unified communications and collaboration across a range of
information technology (IT) environments to make it easier to find, reach
and collaborate with employees and customers.

    "We need to enable our associates to be more collaborative and versatile
with open tools that have the best return on investment. This is why we
chose IBM's collaboration software," said Cliff Tamplin, vice president of
IT, Infrastructure and Operations, Global Hyatt Corporation. He added, "It
is easier and faster to share documents and schedule meetings using the
on-line tools from IBM."

    Global Hyatt is rolling out IBM Lotus Notes version 8.0 software to its
North American hotels this year and its international hotels in 2009 so
that it can reap the benefits of the technology named by many customers as
"the desktop of the future." The new software features built-in Web 2.0
capabilities such as composite applications, which draw their
functionality and uniquely combine information from several different
sources and live text. Live text enables Lotus Notes to recognize
patterns in text in any document and then perform actions on that text.
Examples include mapping an address, looking up a name in a corporate
directory, checking a stock, looking up a part number, checking a flight
status, and tracking a package.

    The IBM Lotus Notes software has an easy-to-use interface, allowing
Hyatt's staff to quickly access their e-mail and calendar entries. In
this latest version, Sametime instant messaging is built right into the
main screen, right next to the email in-box. Hotel staff can also take
advantage of the software's message recall feature, which allows them to
recall e-mails sent to the wrong recipient or which contain the wrong
information. In addition, Global Hyatt worked with IBM to give its staff
access to team rooms, which are repositories where documents can be
stored and retrieved by user communities through Lotus Notes.

    Global Hyatt is also making the latest IBM Lotus Sametime functionality
available to all of its employees worldwide so they can all be on the same
system. When fully deployed in 2009, 25,000 Global Hyatt employees will
use Sametime version 8 software to communicate with their coworkers,
vendors and suppliers, through multiple media such as instant messages,
visuals and voice. Global Hyatt purchased IBM Sametime Web conferencing
licenses as well, so that corporate offices and hotels can now host
conferences on-line. In addition, Sametime software can easily interface
with other common instant messaging systems such as Yahoo! Messenger and
AOL Instant Messenger.

    "IBM is defining and delivering the next-generation collaboration
environment that will help people drive better business results in the
global economy," said Bob Picciano, general manager, IBM Lotus Software.
"Global Hyatt Corporation has invested in its people by establishing a
culture of collaborative innovation. Through this investment, Hyatt
employees will experience the future of work -- today."

    Global Hyatt is not alone in choosing IBM Lotus software for its unified
communications. IBM Lotus Notes and Domino has grown to 140 million
licensed users worldwide, has increased its user base across small- and
medium-sized businesses, and is used by more than half of the largest 100
corporations in the world, and 80 percent of the top 10 global companies
in banking, telecommunications, aerospace and defense, consumer products,
electronics, insurance and pharmaceuticals. Lotus Sametime, IBM's
industry-leading unified communications and collaboration platform, has
more than 100 million users. It has been purchased by 29 of the Global
Fortune 50, 12 of the top 15 worldwide banks, eight of the top 10
worldwide pharmaceutical firms, and four of the five most profitable
companies in the world. An Osterman Research report* states that IBM
Lotus Sametime is the number one instant messaging software used by
corporations. For more information, visit www.ibm.com/lotus.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today extended its most widely used software, Lotus
Notes, to new markets through delivery as a hosted service, Lotus Notes
Hosted Messaging.

    IBM has been driving Lotus Notes and Domino into new markets such as
iPhone users, social networking and unified communications clients and
many other new businesses around the world.

    Lotus has led IBM into the nascent cloud services market with offerings
such as Sametime Unyte Web conferencing software and IBM's "Bluehouse"
extranet collaboration service. IBM is extending its cloud services
strategy to its flagship Lotus Notes franchise to attract new customers
including more retail, global manufacturing and insurance companies. Lotus
Notes Hosted Messaging can be customized to the needs of each company by
an IBM services team.

    Using a hosting service, there is no need to purchase, house or supply
energy to new hardware needed to run the software. Customers of Lotus
Notes messaging software can instead focus their IT resources on other
strategic business projects.

    Priced starting at less than $10 per user per month, new IBM Lotus Notes
Hosted Messaging is designed primarily for companies with 1,000 to 10,000
employees. However, IBM can tailor software and service plans for smaller
and larger companies as well.

    The new hosted Notes Messaging service is supported by a dedicated IBM
team and features two service level agreement options, spam and virus
filtering and back up and restore services.

    "Software delivery models such as cloud computing, software-as-a-service
and hosting are evolving because companies want flexibility," said Kevin
Cavanaugh, vice president, IBM Messaging and Collaboration. "The new
hosted Notes is another option IBM is providing to customers. There is
high demand for this approach because of the way it is delivered, and its
competitive pricing," he added.

    For additional terms and conditions of the new hosted software and
service, visit
www.ibm.com/software/lotus/notesanddomino/hosted-licensing.html.

    IBM also announced today that Global Hyatt Corporation has chosen IBM
Lotus Notes Domino and Sametime collaboration and unified communications
software for its 365 hotels worldwide. For more information, visit

worldwide, has increased its user base across small- and medium-sized
businesses, and is used by more than half of the largest 100 corporations
in the world, and 80 percent of the top 10 global companies in banking,

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Defense Coalition: San Francisco Journalist Writing Blogs for Chevron to Discredit Indigenous Groups

       Pat Murphy Also Works for Chevron's PR Firm, Don Solem &amp;
                              Associates
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
A San Francisco editor and publisher of an online publication that
regularly criticizes the lawsuit against Chevron for oil contamination
in the Ecuadorian rainforest also works for Chevron's public relations
firm, Don Solem &amp; Associates.

   Pat Murphy, editor and publisher of the San Francisco Sentinel,
provides a steady stream of negative commentary and misleading facts
in his online publication about the lawsuit, filed on behalf of 30,000
Ecuadorians who live in the area that Texaco explored and drilled for
oil between 1964 and 1990. Chevron bought Texaco in 2001.

   Murphy has never disclosed that he works for Chevron. Many of his
blogs criticizing the lawsuit are "google bombed" so they appear at
the top of search engines above more established media outlets that
have covered the landmark class action case.

   Murphy, for example, has published a series of long interviews
with Chevron's public relations representatives without providing any
information rebutting the assertions, many of which are misleading.
For example, Murphy never mentions the 64,000 chemical sampling
results from Chevron's former sites in Ecuador that show levels of
toxic contamination and were used as a basis for an independent,
court-appointed expert to assess damages at between $7.2 billion and
$16.3 billion.

   "Pat Murphy masquerades as journalist but he is shilling for
Chevron's public relations firm without disclosure," said Kevin
Koenig, a campaigner with the environmental group Amazon Watch.

   On the Sentinel's web site, Murphy says "his writing skill has
been employed by marketing agencies, including Don Solem &amp;
Associates". Solem &amp; Associates lists the Chevron Corporation as one
of its clients under the Energy and Public Utilities industry client
listing.

   Murphy also has a small note on his website saying it is
"fee-based".

   Earlier this year, two Ecuadorians who represent the plaintiffs in
the lawsuit against Chevron won the CNN Hero Award and the prestigious
Goldman Environmental Prize. At the time, Chevron undertook a campaign
to discredit the Ecuadorians - Pablo Fajardo and Luis Yanza -- with
top-ranking officials at the Goldman Foundation, saying he had
"conned" the Goldman jury.

   When that pressure did not work, Chevron turned to the news media
- Murphy in particular -- and tried to taint Fajardo and Yanza as
people who cared only about money and not about the people of Ecuador.

   In court, Chevron has admitted that Texaco dumped 18.5 billion
gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways and abandoned over 900
waste pits while it operated the oil concession. Tens of thousands of
people now live in the middle of the contamination, some directly on
top of waste pits Chevron covered with dirt without cleaning out
contaminants.

   Health problems and cancer rates in the region have skyrocketed in
recent years, according to scientific evidence presented by the
plaintiffs. Neither Texaco nor Chevron has ever conducted a single
health study of the area nor published a map for local residents
detailing the sites of its covered waste pits - facts Murphy, not
surprisingly, has failed to mention in his blogs.

   A final decision in the case is expected in 2009.

   About the Amazon Defense Coalition

   The Amazon Defense Coalition represents dozens of rainforest
communities and five indigenous groups that inhabit Ecuador's Northern
Amazon region. The mission of the Coalition is to protect the
environment and secure social justice through grass roots organizing,
political advocacy, and litigation.

&lt;p&gt;Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Network Satellite, in
 combination with IBM System z, provides improved flexibility, boosted
  performance and reliable management for Arizona utilities provider
RALEIGH, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT), the world's leading provider of open
source solutions, today announced that Salt River Project (SRP), one
of Arizona's largest utilities providers that delivers power and water
to more than 935,000 customers in the Phoenix metropolitan area, has
migrated to Red Hat Enterprise Linux on IBM System z mainframe servers
for increased flexibility, manageability, cost savings and boosted
performance.

   In 2006, SRP began to accelerate its investigation of Linux
solutions after upgrading its System z mainframe. Though SRP's Power
division had been testing Linux in-house for approximately three years
and had a desire to move to a Linux-based environment in the future,
it didn't have any Linux solutions in production at the time. "We had
a long-standing desire to look for solutions outside of our previous
environment," said Kevin Masaryk, senior Linux/Unix administrator at
SRP. "We were very interested in Linux on the mainframe for the
enhanced utilization, flexibility, workload consolidation and
management capabilities offered there. Above all, it could help us
mitigate the risk of server sprawl that was plaguing our traditional
environment. In fact, whether on the mainframe or a distributed
architecture, Linux would allow us to run more workloads per server
than our previous environment."

   After deciding to evaluate various Linux solutions for the
mainframe, SRP selected Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which the SRP IT
team had been evaluating during its in-house Linux testing. SRP
decided it would prefer to use one reliable Linux distribution in both
its mainframe and distributed environments. "When evaluating Linux
mainframe solutions, we experimented with SUSE because it had an early
relationship with IBM for that architecture, but Red Hat had become
very mature in the mainframe environment, too. Since we were already
leaning toward Red Hat in our distributed environment, choosing Red
Hat on the mainframe coincided with our desire to have one corporate
standard for Linux," said Masaryk. "The implementation of Red Hat
Enterprise Linux on our IBM System z mainframe was straightforward and
didn't take long at all."

   Today, SRP has nearly 50 Red Hat Enterprise Linux-based servers
and the implementation is on-going. The SRP team leveraged Red Hat
Training offerings to expand internal knowledge of Red Hat's products
and services in production environments, and utilizes Red Hat Network
Satellite to mange its Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems. "We use RHN
Satellite, which is a key component to the management of all of our
Red Hat servers, whether on the mainframe or in our distributed
environments. Our use of Satellite has grown with us and we're pleased
with how much time it has saved us and how efficient it has made our
administrators. I'd recommend setting up RHN Satellite as soon as
possible for others who want to go down that road; it pays off very
quickly," said Masaryk.

   Red Hat Enterprise Linux on IBM System z mainframe servers has
provided SRP with a very stable and predictable solution that can be
easily managed via Red Hat Network Satellite. It has enabled cost
savings through the elimination of licensing costs, and has also
provided boosted performance for its servers. "The ability to
consolidate multiple workloads into one instance of Red Hat Enterprise
Linux as opposed to running in our environment, where each workload
would have to run on a separate server; That's a huge benefit for us,"
said Masaryk.

   For the future, SRP has plans to continue to expand its use of Red
Hat solutions. "We're planning to move forward with implementing
additional Red Hat Enterprise Linux-based machines as fast as we can.
We're also investigating the use of JBoss solutions," said Masaryk.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese Internet users have expressed fury at Microsoft's launch of an anti-piracy tool targeting Chinese computer users to ensure they buy genuine software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "Windows Genuine Advantage" program, which turns the user's screen black if the installed software fails a validation test, is Microsoft's latest weapon in its war on piracy in China, where the vast majority of 200 million computer users are believed to be using counterfeit software, unwittingly or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why is Microsoft automatically connected with my computer? The computer is mine!" one angry blogger wrote on popular Chinese web portal Sina.com. "Microsoft has no right to control my hardware without my agreement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another blogger railed over the cost of authorized versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the price of genuine software was lower than the fake one, who would buy the fake one?" he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A visitor to a Beijing internet cafe said Microsoft was violating people's rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If, when I'm programing, the computer screen goes black, that will probably cause some important information to be lost," he said. "Who will pay me for my loss then?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dong Zhengwei, 35, a Beijing lawyer, described Microsoft as the "biggest hacker in China with its intrusion into users' computer systems without their agreement or any judicial authority," the China Daily said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's measure will cause serious functional damage to users' computers and, according to China's criminal law, the company can stand accused of breaching and hacking into computer systems," he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I respect the right of Microsoft to protect its intellectual property, but it is taking on the wrong target with wrong measures. They should target producers and sellers of fake software, not users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software giant defended the program on its website as part of its "commitment to help protect its intellectual property and to help you avoid problems before they happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The purpose ... is to help our customers to determine (if) genuine software is installed on their computers," Microsoft told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Nick Macfie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Interview Highlights: Colgate Palmolive, Procter &amp; Gamble, Estee Lauder, Anheuser Busch and Molson Coors

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Analyst Interview. Today's interview
is with senior analyst Steven Ralston, who talks about Colgate
Palmolive (NYSE: CL), Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG), Estee Lauder (NYSE:
EL), Anheuser-Busch (NYSE: BUD) and Molson Coors (NYSE: TAP).

   A synopsis of today's Analyst Interview is presented below. The
full article can be read at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.

   Which particular companies in your coverage do you expect may
perform best, looking ahead?

   Generally speaking, food companies generate earnings growth at a
mid-to-high single-digit rate. Beverage companies, however, are
structurally able to grow faster at the high single-digit to low
double-digit rate. But, personal product companies can grow earnings a
percentage point or two above beverage companies. The earnings of
these personal product companies, like Colgate Palmolive (NYSE: CL),
Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG), and Estee Lauder (NYSE: EL), have the
potential to stand out during a recession. All three companies are
rated Buy.

   Where do you see some pitfalls with investing in this general
sector?

   Over the last two years, I have been a table-pounding buyer of
Anheuser-Busch (NYSE: BUD) under $50. With a friendly offer of $70 per
share from InBev on July 14th, I finally downgraded the rating to a
Sell. However, more is brewing in the beer industry: a structural
change is about to occur. With the merger, excess costs will be wrung
out of Anheuser-Busch by InBev.

   In addition, a joint venture between Molson Coors (NYSE: TAP) and
SABMiller should produce a more competitive brewer with greater scale,
resources, and distribution synergies from the optimization of
production and distribution networks. Therefore, the cost
rationalization at Anheuser-Busch (instigated by the merger with
InBev) and the joint venture between Molson Coors and SABMiller are
expected to spark more intense competition, resulting in the loss of
the positive pricing trends enjoyed by the industry for the last two
years, in other words, a beer war.

   Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:

   Coca-Cola FEMSA Retains Its Buy

   We are keeping our Buy recommendation on Coca-Cola FEMSA (NYSE:
KOF). The company posted slightly better-than-expected results for the
second quarter of 2008, and the results in the Mercosur division were
particularly impressive.

   We believe that going forward new lines of business, combined with
the recent acquisitions, will enhance its top-line growth despite the
difficult economic environment throughout the world, including Mexico.
Being a producer of a daily use cheap product, focused on domestic
markets, Coca-Cola FEMSA is less exposed to the international crisis.

   Montpelier Re a Buy Pre-Earnings

   Incorporated in 2001, Montpelier Re (NYSE: MRH) was formed by
White Mountains Insurance Group, Ltd. and Benfield Holdings, Ltd. to
take advantage of the enhanced insurance demand following the
September 11 attacks. The company went public in October 2002.

   While we remain concerned about the general softening in the
reinsurance industry and increased competition, the company has begun
to experience the benefits from its new initiatives -- premium
declines from Bermuda have been replaced by premiums generated by the
new Lloyds (NYSE: LYG) and U.S. platforms, with the London operation
issuing an operating underwriting profit for the first time.

   Journal Comm at a Good Value

   Journal Communications (NYSE: JRN) is a diversified media company
with publishing, broadcasting (TV &amp; radio) printing, and direct
marketing businesses. Its telecommunications business was sold in
February 2007.

   Journal Communications plummeting stock price has propelled its
dividend yield to 11.4%. We believe that the dividend is safe, given
the company's manageable leverage (debt is 32% of capital and 2.5x
2009E EBITDA) and excess free cash flow, which is growing as capital
expenditures shrink faster than revenue and operating cash flow.

   Telesp (TSP) Upgraded to a Buy

   We are changing our recommendation on Telesp (NYSE: TSP) from Hold
to Buy.

   Telesp has been growing in its broadband business, and the Pay TV
segment is quite encouraging. The core wireline business has stagnated
and competition has been increasing. However, the company has now an
attractive valuation; it is not cyclical; and it generates huge cash
flows. It seems to be the right stock for a difficult economic
environment.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Kitty Bu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Oct 22 (Reuters) - Chinese Internet users have
expressed fury at Microsoft's launch of an anti-piracy tool
targeting Chinese computer users to ensure they buy genuine
software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "Windows Genuine Advantage" programme, which turns the
user's screen black if the installed software fails a
validation test, is Microsoft's latest weapon in its war on
piracy in China, where the vast majority of 200 million
computer users are believed to be using counterfeit software,
unwittingly or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Why is Microsoft automatically connected with my computer?
The computer is mine!" one angry blogger wrote on popular
Chinese web portal Sina.com. "Microsoft has no right to control
my hardware without my agreement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another blogger railed over the cost of authorised
versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If the price of genuine software was lower than the fake
one, who would buy the fake one?" he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A visitor to a Beijing internet cafe said Microsoft was
violating people's rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If, when I'm programming, the computer screen goes black,
that will probably cause some important information to be
lost," he said. "Who will pay me for my loss then?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dong Zhengwei, 35, a Beijing lawyer, described Microsoft as
the "biggest hacker in China with its intrusion into users'
computer systems without their agreement or any judicial
authority", the China Daily said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft's measure will cause serious functional damage
to users' computers and, according to China's criminal law, the
company can stand accused of breaching and hacking into
computer systems," he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I respect the right of Microsoft to protect its
intellectual property, but it is taking on the wrong target
with wrong measures. They should target producers and sellers
of fake software, not users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The software giant defended the programme on its website
as part of its "commitment to help protect its intellectual
property and to help you avoid problems before they happen".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The purpose ... is to help our customers to determine (if)
genuine software is installed on their computers," Microsoft
told Reuters.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 22 (Reuters) - A partnership between health insurer
Aetna Inc (AET.N) and software maker Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
will allow patients covered by the insurer to transfer medical
records to Microsoft health platform HealthVault, the Wall
Street Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Starting next month, people enrolled in Aetna's plans will
be able to move information from their Aetna "personal health
record" -- an online repository of data that includes claims,
diagnoses, test results and prescriptions -- to HealthVault, the
paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Patients can pick and choose what they would like to
transfer between Aetna's and Microsoft's sites, the Journal
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To begin with, the program will be available to around 6
million people who have Aetna's personal health record, the
paper said, adding that it will be made available to more Aetna
customers next year. Aetna has 17 million members.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Calls to Aetna and Microsoft seeking comment were not
immediately returned.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Oct 22 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
has hired two senior ex-Lehman Brothers LEHMQ.PK employees to
head its global oil trading and marketing divisions, according
to an internal company note obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The note said that JPMorgan had hired Jeff Frase as its
head of global oil trading, while Roy Salame has joined the
bank as its head of global oil marketing. Both Frase and Salame
will be based in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank has been expanding in Asia and other regions, and
recently made its first foray into physical oil trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan added 50 people to its commodities and energy
trading and investment team last year and is on track to hire a
similar number this year, taking the strength of the total team
globally to 450, Blythe Masters, the bank's global head of
commodities, told Reuters earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It hired former Goldman Sachs banker Oral Dawe in May as
managing director and CEO of its Asia commodities group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy protection last month
after collapsing from its exposure to risky subprime mortgage
securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, sources told Reuters that Standard
Chartered (STAN.L) had hired Arun Murthy, former Asia head of
Lehman Brothers' commodities team in Singapore, as its new
global head of energy.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds sales growth details, forecast, share price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Oct 23 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster
Televisa posted a 9.7 percent decline in third-quarter net
majority profit on Thursday, hurt by a jump in financing costs,
but its pay television units kept growing at a strong pace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grupo Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) earned 2.067 billion
pesos ($189 million) in the July-Sept period compared with
2.287 billion pesos in nominal terms in the same period last
year. Accounting for inflation, net profit in the third quarter
of last year was 2.4 billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts in a Reuters survey were expecting a quarterly net
profit of 2.682 billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quarterly revenue rose 21 percent to 12.459 billion pesos,
driven by the expansion of its cable television business
Cablevision (CABLECPO.MX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's satellite television service SKY and other
businesses including publishing distribution and gaming,
contributed strongly to overall sales growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its core broadcasting television unit posted sales growth
of 6 percent in the period as its Beijing Summer Olympics
transmissions brought in extra advertising money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa also announced it had promoted Jose Baston to
president of television and content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baston, previously a vice president, has been responsible
for many of Televisa's recent programming deals across the
globe, including soap opera co-productions in China and
France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa kept its 2008 forecast for broadcast television
sales and operating income growth of 4.5 percent in nominal
terms. The company's shares fell 5.02 percent to close at 38.22
pesos on Thursday.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase Bank on
Thursday accused a New York recruitment agency in a lawsuit of
helping Citadel Investment Group LLC entice executives to leave
the financial institution.&lt;/p&gt;

Patrik Edsparr, "one of JPMorgan's most senior and valued

IDW "directly or indirectly solicited, induced, recruited and
enticed multiple JPMorgan employees to leave JPMorgan for
positions elsewhere including at Citadel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representatives of neither IDW nor Citadel could
immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Edsparr, who was global head of rates, foreign exchange,
securitized products, fixed-income exotics and hybrids, among
other responsibilities, resigned from JPMorgan in March for
Citadel. The executive had reported directly to Steve Black,
the head of JPMorgan's (JPM.N) investment bank, the complaint
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said from January through March this year, IDW arranged
several meetings between the executive and Citadel's senior
management, including President and CEO Ken Griffin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On information and belief, IDW encouraged Edsparr to
accept an offer to become a highly compensated employee of
Citadel," according to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Edsparr now serves as Citadel's CEO for Europe and head of
global fixed income business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's complaint said that after Edsparr left, between
April 22 and July 11, five more employees within the investment
bank -- Derek Kaufman, William King, Jorge Picazo, John
Niccolai and John Naud -- resigned to join Citadel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan accused IDW of repeatedly breaching its
obligations under four agreements signed between the two firms
in 2007 and is seeking damages in a trial by jury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is also asking the court to prevent the agency from
using or disclosing confidential, proprietary and personal
information and ordering any such information to be returned to
JPMorgan.

of last year was 2.4 billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts in a Reuters survey were expecting a quarterly net
profit of 2.682 billion pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quarterly revenue rose 21 percent to 12.459 billion pesos,
driven by the expansion of its cable television business
Cablevision (CABLECPO.MX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its core broadcasting television unit posted sales growth
of 6 percent in the period as its Beijing Summer Olympics
transmissions brought in extra advertising money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa also announced it had promoted Jose Baston to
president of television and content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baston, previously a vice president, has been responsible
for many of Televisa's recent programming deals across the
globe, including soap opera co-productions in China and
France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($10.9490 as of end Sept)

&lt;p&gt;Check Point SmartDefense Secures Enterprise Networks from Latest
                                Attacks
REDWOOD CITY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Check Point(R) Software Technologies Ltd. (Nasdaq:CHKP), the
worldwide leader in securing the Internet, today announced Check Point
SmartDefense(R) Services protects Check Point users of VPN-1(R) NGX
R65 and R62, VSX NGX R65, and IPS-1 NGX R65 from a new Microsoft
Server service zero-day exploit. SmartDefense Services subscribers can
gain immediate protection against the vulnerability well before
deploying the patch provided by Microsoft.

   The vulnerability (CVE-2008-4250) was announced today in the
Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-067 and affects users of Microsoft
Windows based desktops, laptops and servers (for a full list of
vulnerable products visit:
www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08-067.mspx). When
exploited the vulnerability allows a hacker to execute arbitrary code
on a target system.

   Due to an issue with the Windows Server service, it improperly
handles specially crafted Remote Procedure Call (RPC) requests. A
remote unauthenticated attacker could exploit the issue by creating a
malicious RPC request and sending it to a vulnerable system, granting
the attacker complete control of the system. The vulnerability could
potentially be used to create an exploit that would propagate as a
worm.

   "By enabling the protection, SmartDefense will detect and block
malformed RPC requests sent to vulnerable systems," said Oded Gonda,
vice president of network security products at Check Point. "The
protection demonstrates Check Point's commitment to providing total
security against zero-day threats to customers through SmartDefense
services."

   Check Point SmartDefense provides intrusion prevention
capabilities that are integrated into Check Point gateways.
SmartDefense is updated by SmartDefense Services, which provide
ongoing and real-time updates and configuration advisories for
defenses and security policies. SmartDefense protections are developed
and distributed by SmartDefense Research and Response Centers located
around the globe.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and a diverse group of technology companies posted quarterly results that met or beat Wall Street forecasts on Thursday in a good sign for the sector in the face of deepening economic gloom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft, whose products range from the Windows operating system to the Xbox video game system, rose about 1 percent in extended trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company continues to set reasonable expectations and meet or beat them as they did here," said David Katz, chief investment officer of Matrix Asset Advisors. "The expectation was that they would bring down guidance, they only did that in a modest way. They seem to have a grasp on all their business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Manufacturing services provider Flextronics International Ltd's adjusted result met analysts' forecast and its shares added 4 percent after closing at $3.74.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hilliard Lyons analyst Thomas Carpenter said Flextronics' results were likely better than people were looking for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a little bit of slowing in the quarter, mostly toward the end, and things are slowing further in this quarter. I think this is going to be a multi-quarter slowdown as we unwind the credit crunch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Digital Corp, the world's second-largest maker of hard disk drives, said its net profit more than tripled, while revenue edged past analysts' average forecast. The company's shares were largely unchanged in after-hours trading after closing at $13.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology firms over the past few weeks have repeatedly complained of poor visibility into the December quarter and beyond, and storm clouds over the global economy have prompted many to issues cautious forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Computer hardware maker Ingram Micro Inc on Wednesday elected to end its practice of issuing forecasts altogether, citing the "unpredictability" of global markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ingram, whose quarterly profit and sales fell from last year, said it expects the global economy's softness to continue into next year.

 (Adds byline, analyst, Microsoft CFO comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) reported
better than expected quarterly profit and reduced its outlook less
than many investors had feared in the face of tough economic
conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While demand for its products softened near the end of the
September quarter as uncertainty from financial crisis took hold,
Microsoft said new releases of computer server software and
database software pushed revenue higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investors were prepared for the worst given the credit
crisis. Investors should be pleased with Microsoft's decent first
quarter and only a modest reduction in full-year 2009 guidance,"
said Andy Miedler, analyst at Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft posted a net profit of $4.37 billion, or 48 cents
per diluted share, in its fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30
versus a profit of $4.29 billion, or 45 cents per diluted share,
in the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose 9 percent to $15.06 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, were forecasting Microsoft to earn 47
cents per share on revenue of $14.8 billion, according to Reuters
Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software maker said it saw technology
spending deteriorate in September, with that downturn extending
into October. The company expects the spending slowdown to
continue until the end of its fiscal year in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're taking a more conservative stance going forward. That's
clearly appropriate given all the news we see and what we see out
there in the market," Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris
Liddell said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the full-year ending June 2009, Microsoft forecast
earnings per share to range between $2.00 to $2.10 on revenue from
$64.9 billion to $66.4 billion. Microsoft's previous estimates
called for earnings per share from $2.12 to $2.18 and revenue
ranging from $67.3 billion to $68.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street analysts were already forecasting earnings more
conservative than the company's own previous estimates. According
to Reuters Estimates, analysts, on average, forecast Microsoft to
earn $2.11 per share on revenue of $66.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's no surprise that they're guiding down. Microsoft likes
to set achievable goals for themselves," said Kim Caughey, a
senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the December quarter, traditionally Microsoft's biggest
quarter by revenue, the company forecast earnings per share to
range between 51 cents and 53 cents on revenue between $17.3
billion and $17.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts were forecasting Microsoft to report earnings per
share of 55 cents on revenue of $17.9 billion, according to
Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BELT-TIGHTENING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's Liddell said it plans to lower expenses by $500
million compared to its original spending plans through scaling
back new hires, reducing travel and lowering marketing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said the company plans to reduce capital expenditures
this year on items such as data centers to $3.7 billion from an
original estimate for $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If macroeconomic conditions worsen, we will adjust operating
expenses accordingly," Liddell said on a conference call with
analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft executives have said in recent weeks that the
company is not immune to a downturn in spending from consumers and
corporate customers even as they promote the view that the
company's products and markets are diverse enough to better
withstand an industry downturn than its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Every business unit exceeded expectations except for the
Windows Vista business, which was a little bit light," said
Katherine Egbert, analyst at Jefferies  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue at the Windows business rose 2 percent, while the
unit's operating profit fell 4 percent due to the growing
popularity of low-end laptop computers called netbooks. Microsoft
sells as many copies of Windows for netbooks as for other
machines, but makes less money per unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The server and tools division posted a 17 percent rise in
revenue, while operating income rose 20 percent. The Office
business division reported a 20 percent gain in revenue and a 23
percent surge in profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One of the things we look at Microsoft for is their outlook
for how business are doing, and it seems as if their
business-oriented division did pretty well in the quarter," said
Fort Pitt Capital's Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which announced a $40 billion share buyback plan
in September, again reiterated that it plans to grow revenue
faster than the broader technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft have fallen 19 percent since it last
reported earnings on July 17. Microsoft stock closed at $22.32, up
3.7 percent, on the Nasdaq. They remained mostly unchanged  in
extended trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Anupreeta Das and Gabriel Madway in

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) plans to cut 10 percent of its total staff, or almost 3,300 jobs, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has suffered less than most of its peers from the global financial crisis and remains the leading adviser to mergers and initial public offerings worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its transition from an investment bank to a traditional bank holding company means the Federal Reserve will use its new regulatory authority to limit the bank's risk taking and encourage longer-maturity funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect the New York-based bank to shrink businesses in prime brokerage and securitization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Goldman laid off hundreds of support staff and junior bankers due to slowing markets following a round of cuts in leveraged lending and mortgage securities jobs in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had 32,569 employees worldwide at the end of August. Compensation and benefits accounted for 57 percent of its total operating expenses in the three months to August, down from 67 percent in the second quarter and 73 percent a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's move comes as Wall Street firms saw the worst September in the capital markets in decades including the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the bailout of AIG (AIG.N), the acquisition of Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N by Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and the takeover of Wachovia by Citi (C.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's job force peaked at 200,300 in December 2000 and stood at about 181,000 workers in July 2008, according to the state Labor Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City Comptroller William Thompson estimates there could be 35,000 job losses in the securities industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London will suffer an even bigger hit. The Center for Economics and Business Research (CEBR) expects the credit crunch to cost 62,000 financial jobs in 2008 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Quentin Bryar and Jason Neely)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is seeking a New York charter for its commercial banking unit, but that doesn't mean the financial giant's ambitions must stop at the state line, New York's bank regulator said in an interview on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which became a bank holding company last month, surprised the industry on October 13 when it applied for a state charter for its deposit-taking unit, Goldman Sachs Bank USA. Analysts speculated the decision would limit the means by which it could expand the banking business and how it could amass deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But New York Superintendent of Banks Richard Neiman told Reuters the specific terms of Goldman's state charter -- and the changes it must make -- are under discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see the charter as an inhibiting factor if they want to engage in other states," he said. "We want to insure parity for the state charter, both in terms of powers and the ability to operate across state lines."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, New York changed its rules to allow state-chartered banks to start up branches in states with reciprocal agreements -- an arrangement that now spans 25 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also a pact allowing New York banks to operate branches in the neighboring states of New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut, but still remain subject to New York rules, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York banking laws also permit the state to examine a holding company's affiliated activities, such as private equity and trading businesses, if they could have an impact on the safety of deposits, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going through these issues, deciding which activity will be housed with the bank and which outside the bank," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neiman said the charter application was being reviewed on "an expedited basis," though he declined to say when a decision would be announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If approved, Goldman Sachs would immediately be one of the largest banks supervised by the state, with $150 billion in assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has declined to comment on its talks with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp posted stronger-than-expected quarterly results and cut its outlook by less than investors had feared amid the economic slump, sending its shares higher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other technology companies that reported quarterly results on Thursday include Flextronics International Ltd, Ingram Micro Inc and Juniper Networks Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY ON MICROSOFT:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOAN TRAN, ANALYST, MORNINGSTAR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft reported a very solid Q1. What people were expecting was for them to take down guidance and they did. But it was only marginally lower. I think people were expecting much worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone was worried about the guidance. If you are a Microsoft investor you should be happy that Microsoft thinks they will weather the storm relatively well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the things we look at Microsoft for is their outlook for how business are doing, and it seems as if their business-oriented division did pretty well in the quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's no surprise that they're guiding down. Microsoft likes to set achievable goals for themselves. But I do think that spending overall is going to be muted in the future and this is what they're trying to portray."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DAVID KATZ, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, MATRIX ASSET ADVISORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically I would say that we're pleased. The company continues to set reasonable expectations and meet or beat them as they did here. The expectation was that they would bring down guidance, they only did that in a modest way. They seem to have a grasp on all their business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company's balance sheet is very strong. It's critical to put this in perspective- the stock is down about 30 percent in the year, it's coming down close to where people thought it'd be. In our opinion, the decline is a massive overshoot on the reality of the business. They have a spectacular balance sheet and a huge market share, that's rare for a company this size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that over the next 12 months the stock will move meaningfully higher and get back in the $30 range. The key is that it is doing well in a very difficult environment. The outlook is very, very reasonable and it allows for very good earnings. It's important to remember that Microsoft historically is very conservative in its outlook. If the company is shaving the outlook, there is a very good chance that it could beat it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRIP CHOWDHRY, ANALYST, GLOBAL EQUITIES RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People had already factored in that guidance would be lower. At about $22, it had been literally trading at a rock bottom price for Microsoft, given the potential that the company has."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody has factored in that macro conditions are bad, so I think people are now going to focus on what the company can do today to put it in a stronger position one or two years from now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Next week Microsoft is going to make many announcements regarding cloud initiatives and services that Microsoft will initiate over the next two years. Historically Microsoft has been a laggard. They missed on the Internet, they missed on search. But the cloud is probably a place where they can lead the industry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KATHERINE EGBERT, ANALYST, JEFFERIES  CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks good. Every business unit exceeded expectations except for the Windows Vista business, which was a little bit light. Online was about 10 percent more than expected. Xbox was good. The business division was really good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big thing is that they guided down for the remainder of the fiscal year. Given the backdrop, that's not a huge surprise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you think about it, pretty much everything that Microsoft sells is the lowest price product in its category. Xbox, ads on MSN, Office, SQL server, Windows Server. Every product they sell is the cheapest in their category. That certainly helps them out in this environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SID PARAKH, ANALYST, MCADAMS WRIGHT RAGEN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody was concerned about guidance and it seems to be kind of in line to slightly better than what the Street was fearing so I think the fear factor is subsiding a little. So from that standpoint I think it was a relief for some investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically there is caution and their guidance is just reflecting that caution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY ON INGRAM MICRO:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MATTHEW SHEERIN, ANALYST, THOMAS WEISEL PARTNERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been covering the stock eight years. This is the first time the company has not given revenue or earnings guidance. This is a sign visibility is extremely limited."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it's a surprise because nobody seems to have any visibility in demand whether it's the distributors or the suppliers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's been a virtual freeze on IT spending at corporate clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the results themselves were as bad as expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY ON FLEXTRONICS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHAWN HARRISON, ANALYST, LONGBOW RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The guidance they offered for topline and EPS was weaker than anyone anticipated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They generally see a pretty big ramp of their handset and consumer electronics business. That may not be occurring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're seeing lower-than-normal and very cautionary order patterns from original equipment manufacturers with regards to products being sold to the consumer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bottomline takeaway is, caution on the market is resulting in lower-than-normal demand forecasts and negatively impacting profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THOMAS CARPENTER, ANALYST, HILLIARD LYONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results were probably better than what people expected. Things slowed a little in September but not until the end of the quarter. But the outlook for December was lower than people were expecting a month or two ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The mobile unit is doing well. The infrastructure unit is down. Given Ericsson's good results, that points to Nortel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the third-quarter revenue guidance of $8 billion to $9 billion is an unusually wide range, suggesting that it does not have a clear view of demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenging thing is that it looks like Flextronics is also trying to put its arms around how long and deep the downturn is as reflected by their revenue outlook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-------------------------------------------------------&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY ON JUNIPER:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARK SUE, ANALYST, RBC CAPITAL MARKETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results are pretty good despite a difficult environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston, Gabriel Madway in San Francisco, and Sinead Carew, Ryan Vlastelica and John Tilak in New York; Compiled by Tiffany Wu)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp posted stronger-than-expected quarterly profits and revenues on Thursday, but cut its full-year outlook to reflect the continued economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Scaling back proprietary trading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cuts reflect slowdown in banking activity&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares down 9 pct in afternoon trading
 (Adds background, comments; changes dateline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Daisy Ku and Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON/NEW YORK, Oct 23 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) plans to cut 10 percent of its staff, or almost 3,300
jobs, the latest sign the global credit crisis continues to
weigh down banks and the economy, sources familiar with the
matter said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cuts are an about-face for a company that had a record
32,569 employees in August and insisted last month that
headcount would rise by single-digit percentages this year. The
latest cuts reduce headcount to the lowest since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cuts, which will affect every businesses and region,
reflect weakness in the economy, sluggish banking and trading
activity and a decision to rein in principal trading, one
person familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These are not the last job cuts you will see," said
Michael Williams, dean of Pepperdine University's Graziado
School of Business and Management. "There are significantly
lower levels of business activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The steep cuts show no bank can escape the fallout of a
market downturn well into its second year. The fallout has
eroded the value of assets held by banks and, as credit dried
up, slowed deal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman had largely avoided the kinds of massive mortgage
and credit losses that hobbled its peers with losses reaching
tens of billions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it cannot sidestep a global slowdown in investment
banking activity. Debt underwriting and mergers have virtually
ceased and there have been no initial public offerings in 11
weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LATEST ROUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like its rivals, Goldman has quietly tried to trim
headcount. The bank laid off hundreds of MA support staff and
junior bankers in June due to slowing markets, following an
round of leveraged lending and mortgage securities cuts in
April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early this year, Goldman cut 1,500 people, or 5 percent,
following year-end performance reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And as the trading environment grows more challenging,
Goldman has put less capital at risk for proprietary trading as
well as for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These moves also reflect drastic change in regulation. The
collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK and the
U.S. bailout of American International Group Inc (AIG.N) has
eroded investor confidence in the independent broker-dealer
model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman converted last month to bank holding company
supervised by the Federal Reserve and then raised $10 billion
from Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N). These
moves, together with a pending $10 billion investment by
Treasury, are expected to create a more stable company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it will be a Goldman that uses less leverage, takes
less risk and makes less money, analysts said. Goldman shares
were down $10.50 at $104.21 in late afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest moves, on top of continued consolidation among
Wall Street's top firms, means more Wall Street jobs losses are
coming. New York City Comptroller William Thompson estimates
there could be 35,000 job losses in the securities industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays Plc (BARC.L) plans to cut at least 3,000 jobs from
its payroll in the United States, including operations it
acquired from Lehman. Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N CEO John
Thain recently warned that "thousands" of Merrill's 61,000
employees would be laid off as the brokerage is absorbed into
Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which also has been cutting back in
many of the same areas, reduced employment by 4 percent to
46,383 from its peak in November 2007. These figures exclude
its former Discover credit card business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street's workforce peaked at 200,300 in December 2000
and stood at about 181,000 in July 2008, according to the U.S.
Labor Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; London will suffer an even bigger hit. The Centre for
Economics and Business Research (CEBR) expects the credit
crunch to cost 62,000 financial jobs in 2008 and 2009.

&lt;p&gt;  POUGHKEEPSIE, NY, Oct 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) Poughkeepsie has been named "Assembly Plant of the Year
2008" by the editors of Assembly Magazine.

    The Poughkeepsie plant, which develops and manufactures some of the
world's most powerful and complex servers, mainframes and supercomputers,
was honored for its manufacturing operations in System z and high-end
Power Systems.

    IBM manufacturing operations in Poughkeepsie and throughout the world are
focused on a wide diversity of processes designed to meet customer needs
and a long-time commitment to innovation. Poughkeepsie received the
prestigious award following a highly competitive nomination process that
centered on the following points:


--  Dedication to client value (product features, order responsiveness, and
product quality)
--  Creating a comprehensive LEAN culture (continuous improvement, process
optimization, and cultural transformation)
--  Acting with environmental responsibility, including practical
application of green philosophies.

    
For instance, the plant is unique in that it employs both a
build-to-plan, fabrication process as well as a build-to-order
fulfillment process for complex, configured customer orders. In fact, the
features offered on both System z and Power Systems are highly unique;
customizable almost to an infinite combination of configuration
possibilities.

    IBM Poughkeepsie's supply chain processes and logistics operations have
been recognized as world class. Independent supply chain consultants such
as AMR Research have consistently scored IBM in the top five corporations
for supply chain capabilities, as evaluated against all companies
globally.

    Poughkeepsie has been identified as an IBM pilot site for the Green Sigma
initiative. The plant reduces the environmental impact of end-to-end
supply chain operations by driving cost savings and productivity through
more efficient management of energy, materials and natural resources while
minimizing waste and emissions by-products.

    "The IBM Poughkeepsie plant was selected for our award this year because
of the way it has combined lean and green manufacturing initiatives to
stay innovative in today's global economy," said Austin Weber, senior
editor of Assembly Magazine. "We were also very impressed with the way
the facility leverages its supply chain and interacts with customers to
deliver just the right kind of products that they want, when they need
them."

    "IBM is honored to receive this award from Assembly Magazine," said Jim
King, IBM Poughkeepsie plant manager. "IBM Poughkeepsie has a strong
history of heritage and tradition, and adapts to new requirements while
achieving high performance standards. And most importantly, our employees
take pride in their workmanship, producing systems that represent the
flagship of the IBM Corporation."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc plans to cut 10 percent of its total staff, or almost 3,300 jobs, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs has suffered less than most of its peers from the global financial crisis and remains the leading adviser to mergers and initial public offerings worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its transition from an investment bank to a traditional bank holding company means the Federal Reserve will use its new regulatory authority to limit the bank's risk taking and encourage longer-maturity funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect the New York-based bank to shrink businesses in prime brokerage and securitization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In June, Goldman laid off hundreds of support staff and junior bankers due to slowing markets following a round of cuts in leveraged lending and mortgage securities jobs in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company had 32,569 employees worldwide at the end of August. Compensation and benefits accounted for 57 percent of its total operating expenses in the three months to August, down from 67 percent in the second quarter and 73 percent a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's move comes as Wall Street firms saw the worst September in the capital markets in decades including the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the bailout of AIG, the acquisition of Merrill Lynch  Co Inc by Bank of America Corp and the takeover of Wachovia by Citi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's job force peaked at 200,300 in December 2000 and stood at about 181,000 workers in July 2008, according to the state Labor Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York City Comptroller William Thompson estimates there could be 35,000 job losses in the securities industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London will suffer an even bigger hit.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and SANTA CLARA, CA, Oct 23 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Intel Corporation today announced they are extending
their collaboration in the blade server market to drive adoption of an
open industry specification for blade switches. This will enable switch
vendors to maximize return on their research and development by
developing products to a single design, reaching more customers with just
one product.

    Blade servers integrate servers, networks, storage, and business
applications in a single, highly efficient system. Switches are essential
components of every blade system, channeling data to and from the server.
As part of the agreement announced today, IBM will extend the BladeCenter
switch specification for blade servers to the Server Systems
Infrastructure (SSI) organization on a royalty-free basis, allowing
switch vendors to create one product that works across the BladeCenter
and SSI ecosystems and driving more switch products for clients to choose
from.

    The companies also plan to help SSI establish a third-party SSI Switch
Compliance Lab, where the developer community can test and verify their
blade server products for BladeCenter and SSI environments.

    The announcement today builds upon a history of IBM and Intel
collaboration on blade technology -- starting in 2002 with the
development of the first BladeCenter servers and continuing in 2006 when
IBM, Intel and other industry leaders formed Blade.org, the industry
consortium driving open innovation in blade-based solutions that today
has over 200 members.

    SSI is an industry organization established over 10 years ago to enable
server builders to develop compliant and interoperable building blocks for
servers, chassis and manageability software technology. The incorporation
of the open switch specification into SSI is intended to broaden the
market for switch module vendors as they collaborate on SSI-specified
blade switch solutions with Intel and IBM.

    In this segment, Blade Network Technologies, Brocade, NextIO, QLogic and
others have committed their support for the open specification. By
extending its switch specification and ecosystem to affiliated members of
SSI, IBM is driving greater adoption of BladeCenter-compatible switches.

    "The extension of the BladeCenter switch specification to SSI advances
open specifications for blade systems," says Alex Yost, vice president of
IBM BladeCenter. "Making the switch design in our open BladeCenter
specification available to a broader set of vendors demonstrates IBM's
commitment to foster openness in the blade server market."

    Demand for a common switch specification comes at a time when blade
servers are becoming a critical ingredient in IT infrastructure. The
availability of the open BladeCenter switch specification to SSI members
allows them access to the more than 25 specification-compliant switches
on the market today.

    "By working with IBM, we have expanded ecosystem support for SSI blade
specifications to over 70 vendors," says Kirk Skaugen, General Manager,
Server Platforms Group, Intel. "Continued IBM and Intel collaboration will
go further to expanding the entire blade server market. This is good for
customers who will benefit from increased choice from a breadth of server,
networking and storage vendors while enabling each product to maximize
return on the R invested."

    About IBM BladeCenter

    IBM has the broadest portfolio of blade offerings in the industry,
including five blade enclosures, five compatible server blades and five
I/O fabrics with a common architecture that allows clients to mix and
match offerings. IBM has also taken a unique approach in the industry by
opening up the IBM BladeCenter hardware architecture, which has created
market and revenue opportunities for hundreds of companies selling
peripherals like network and storage cards, switches and software. Since
opening the BladeCenter specifications in 2004, 500 companies have
downloaded the specifications for free. For more information about IBM
BladeCenter, please visit: www.ibm.com/bladecenter.

    About Intel Corporation

    Intel, the world leader in silicon innovation, develops technologies,
products and initiatives to continually advance how people work and live.
Additional information about Intel is available at
www.intel.com/pressroom.

    About SSI

    The Server Systems Infrastructure (SSI) is an industry initiative focused
on the provision of design reference architecture and specifications of
server systems and power supplies to the developer community. Established
in 1998, SSI has over 50 members and 185 adopters consisting of ODMs,
OEMs, VARs and Software Developers from around the world. It has
published over 45 design specifications to date.

&lt;p&gt;  YONKERS, NY, Oct 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CYBRA Corporation (OTCBB: CYRP), the developer of award-winning
MarkMagic(TM) Bar Code Labels, RFID Tags, and Electronic Forms Software
for IBM Power Systems (formerly known as System i), today announced that
Shop-Vac(R) Corporation, a Walmart top 600 vendor, has successfully
deployed its EdgeMagic(R) RFID Control Software for IBM Power Systems at
its Williamsport, Pennsylvania, manufacturing location and is currently
in testing. Shop-Vac Corporation, the recognized world leader in wet/dry
vacuum cleaners, replaced an IBM WebSphere RFID Premises Server
installation and selected EdgeMagic to track cases of vacuum cleaners and
accessories destined for End Caps and other special point of sale programs
of its trading partners such as Walmart.

    Customer Preferred Native RFID Solution

    According to Mike McConnell, Programmer Analyst at Shop-Vac, "When we
first investigated RFID for EPC compliance there was no native IBM System
i solution on the market. As a result we installed IBM WebSphere RFID
Premises Server which does not run on the IBM midrange server. When I
learned of CYBRA's native solution I became convinced that EdgeMagic
offered Shop-Vac a more fully functional System i implementation. We run
Infor BPCS and Manhattan Associates Transportation Execution products on
the IBM System i and EdgeMagic interfaces directly with these products.
The EdgeMagic product supports Alien fixed readers, Symbol mobile readers,
and Zebra RFID printers, the same hardware as WebSphere RFID Premises
Server so by replacing the IBM product with the CYBRA product we gained a
significant amount of flexibility particularly with regard to System i
application software integration. EdgeMagic allows my team to add new
functions with ease."

    According to Harold Brand, CEO of CYBRA, "EdgeMagic seamlessly integrates
RFID technology with the core IBM Power Systems business applications that
run the bread and butter of manufacturing and distribution worldwide.
Moreover, it is the framework for turning process data into real time,
actionable business information at the point of activity."

    Brand continues: "CYBRA recently conducted a survey of more than 500
System i shops to learn of their plans for RFID. When asked, 'On which
computing platform would you prefer RFID systems to be based?' the
response was 63% for System i and only 16% for Windows. Of customers who
run their WMS (Warehouse Management Systems) on the System i, the numbers
are dramatic: only 10% of System i WMS customers prefer to run their RFID
systems on a Windows, Linux, or Unix platform, while 79% prefer the
System i."

    Brand concludes: "System i customers overwhelmingly prefer the System i to
PC for RFID for obvious reasons. The things that the System i excels at:
generating EPC codes, printing RFID smart labels, generating manifests,
defining business rules, and storing configurations are easier to manage
on the System i because that's where the order and product information
is. Add the System i's superior high availability, security, simplified
systems management, and server consolidation, and long time System i
customers see RFID as a business application that needs to be hosted on
the same platform. Shop-Vac recognized this value and replaced the IBM
WebSphere RFID Premises Server with EdgeMagic precisely because it runs
on the IBM System i server."

    About CYBRA

    CYBRA Corporation is a world leader in bar code and RFID technology for
IBM midrange systems. An IBM Business Partner and Motorola/Symbol Partner,
CYBRA is represented by a network of value added resellers throughout the
United States and has international sales and support offices.

    MarkMagic(TM) Bar Code Labels, RFID Tags and Forms Software is used by
thousands of AS/400 and System i customers worldwide, and has been
selected as the bar code print engine of such leading System i software
developers as Manhattan Associates(TM), Infor(TM) and VAI(TM).

    CYBRA's latest product, EdgeMagic(TM) is the only integrated RFID control
solution for the IBM System i, but is not only for the System i. EdgeMagic
helps customers comply with the full range of RFID mandates as well as
closed loop RFID applications.

(MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Norddeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale in Hannover (NORD/LB) and IBM
(NYSE: IBM) have signed a five-year information technology (IT) services
contract. This is an extension to the agreement with NORD/LB in 2004 when
IBM was awarded sole responsibility for the bank's IT services.

    IBM will continue to manage the operation of the entire IT infrastructure
for more than 5,000 NORD/LB and Braunschweigischen Landessparkasse
employees, as well as of all NORD/LB international branches.

    As a part of the new agreement, IBM will modernize the IT processes,
launch and continuously enhance new IT technologies. IBM will also adapt
the IT processes to meet updated legal requirements particularly in terms
of security and compliance.

    As systems integrator, IBM will ensure the overall availability of all IT
systems. This includes the operation of local and distributed networks as
well applications and infrastructure servers, the storage infrastructure,
all trading systems, all workplace systems and monitoring of self-service
units. Bank employees will have access to IBM's central user help desk
which serves as a central information hub.

    NORD/LB will benefit from cost efficiencies, greater security and an
enhanced and flexible price structure. "With IBM we found a strong
partner, who guarantees the quality, flexibility and further development
of our IT systems. For us in the financial sector, this fact is essential
to survive in a market which is rapidly changing," said Volker Nagy,
NORD/LB department manager, Application Management/IT.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 23 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Securities upgraded DHT
Maritime (DHT.N) and General Maritime Corp GMR.N to
"overweight" from "neutral," saying the companies have
sufficient liquidity to meet capital commitments and are
attractively valued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe DHT's relatively high cash flow visibility and
dividend security reflecting the company's full-fleet contract
coverage and its sufficient liquidity to meet capital
commitments through at least year-end 2009," JP Morgan analyst
Jonathan Chappell wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chappell said General Maritime's shares will outperform the
peer group in the difficult spot rate environment on its
relatively secure cash flows and limited financing risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan Securities downgraded Frontline Ltd (FRO.N),
Nordic American Tanker Shipping (NAT.N) and Overseas
Shipholding Group OSG.N on a lower spot rate outlook for next
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage removed Nordic from the U.S. analyst focus
list and dropped its price target of $44 on the stock. Nordic
shares closed at $27.33 on Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 23 (Reuters) - JP Morgan upgraded power meters maker
Itron Inc (ITRI.O) to "overweight" from "neutral," saying 2009
estimates have been reined in and the stock now prices in
downside beyond the brokerage's below-consensus estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also said the stock is attractively valued
and it is time for long-term investors to start accumulating
again though it warned about a near-term risk of downside
revisions to the company's 2009 consensus earning per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're being super cautious here, and moderating the CY10
cyclical recovery, but even with the revised forecast, even
with modest risk of tripping the debt covenant, we think the
stock is now attractively valued and we recommend buying," JP
Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Itron's businesses are expected to re-accelerate in 2010
due to an overall recovery in the economy and re-focusing on
advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) systems program in North
America and Europe, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, JP Morgan lowered Itron's 2010 revenue growth to
8.1 percent from 11.7 percent, the lower end of the long-term
8-12 percent growth rate for the meter industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan has a revised December 2009 price target of
$67.50 on the company.

Coca-Cola FEMSA, S.A.B. de C.V. (NYSE: KOF) (BMV: KOFL) ("Coca-Cola
FEMSA" or the "Company"), the largest Coca-Cola bottler in Latin America
and the second-largest Coca-Cola bottler in the world in terms of sales
volume, announces results for the third quarter of
2008.


--  Total revenues reached Ps. 19,770 million in the third quarter of
    2008, an increase of 14.5% compared to the third quarter of 2007; excluding
    the positive effect of Refrigerantes Minas Gerais ("Remil"), total revenues
    would have increased 7.0% compared to the third quarter of 2007.
--  Driven by double digit operating income growth from our Mercosur
    division, consolidated operating income increased 10.3% to Ps. 3,194
    million for the third quarter of 2008. Our operating margin reached 16.2%

"In the face of today's challenging economic environment, our company
was able to deliver double-digit top-line growth this quarter. We
continued to integrate our new franchise territory into our existing
Brazilian operations with great results. In addition to the organic
growth of our existing Brazilian operations, this acquisition accounted
for half of our company's consolidated incremental top-line for the
quarter, reinforcing this important engine for growth. In August, our
company and The Coca-Cola Company entered into an agreement to jointly
acquire the Brisa bottled water business in Colombia from Bavaria, a
subsidiary of SAB Miller; this acquisition, once completed, will enable
us to expand our product portfolio to satisfy consumers' preferences and
advance our water strategy. We also started to distribute the Jugos Del
Valle line of juice-based beverages in Colombia, Panama, and Nicaragua.
This new line of business is helping us to introduce innovative new
products such as Vallefrut in Mexico," said Carlos Salazar Lomelin, Chief
Executive Officer of the company.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Digital video recorder maker TiVo is set to announce Thursday that hundreds of movie titles, most significantly from Disney, will be available to its broadband subscribers courtesy of deals with CinemaNow and Jaman.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TiVo is no stranger to delivering movies to TV screens by way of the Internet; it has been doing so through a relationship with Amazon Video on Demand, a service that has been up and running since last year, though under the name Unbox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon VOD, though, doesn't include Disney films. CinemaNow offers a service that includes movies from many studios, though TiVo users will only get Disney films. Thus, TiVo now can offer movies from all the major studios through a combination of Amazon VOD and CinemaNow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the past few years, TiVo has been repositioning itself as a retriever of entertainment content wherever it resides, as opposed to a simple recorder of TV shows. That's why it has struck several partnerships, including one with YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company views the strategy as a way to differentiate itself from other DVRs from cable and satellite TV companies that do less but are cheaper and more popular. There are about 36.2 million DVRs in U.S. homes, but only about 3.6 million of them are TiVos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like with Amazon VOD, the Jaman and CinemaNow services will allow users to choose movies -- either by way of their TV screens or by cell phones or computers -- and have them downloaded to their TiVo hard drives. The titles will show up as saved content similar to the TV shows they have recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CinemaNow rents movies for as little as $2.99 and includes such titles as "Dumbo," "The Fox and the Hound" and "Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jaman's contribution is a boatload of such independent titles as "Super Size Me" and "Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room." Jaman titles will rent for as low as $1.99, with some short films and more obscure titles being offered for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is to offer unlimited media content through one device with one easy-to-use interface, and these partnerships ensure that vision has become reality," TiVo GM of content services Tara Maitra said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC) announced today
that J.P. Morgan, the largest global agent bank in the syndicated loan
market, has joined a group of leading banks to support DTCC's
Loan/SERV and will begin using the new suite of services to automate
and streamline the processing of their syndicated commercial loans.

   "This is an opportunity - for the very first time - to bring major
new efficiencies and transparency to the syndicated loan market," said
Eric Rosen, managing director at J.P. Morgan. "Loan/SERV will help
solve many of the problems associated with the processing and tracking
of syndicated loans, and we look forward to working with DTCC on this
major undertaking."

   "J.P. Morgan is one of the most significant global loan market
players, and we're thrilled to have them on board with Loan/SERV,"
said Chris Childs, DTCC vice president, Global Loans Product
Management. "Their support of Loan/SERV is invaluable and will help as
we move forward in developing and introducing a broad range of
automated and integrated services for both the primary and secondary
markets of syndicated loans."

   DTCC has been working with a group of global banks for support and
guidance in the development and launch of Loan/SERV products on a
global basis. These banks are The Bank of New York Mellon, Barclays
Capital, Citi, Deutsche Bank and The Royal Bank of Scotland. With J.P.
Morgan, these banks historically account for more than a third of the
global syndicated loan market, according to Childs.

   DTCC also works with a European consultation group, which includes
12 European agent banks, five fund managers and three major
custodian/trustees, to assist with the European development and
deployment of Loan/SERV later in 2008.

   "Our focus is on providing a global solution that works in Europe,
North American, Asia and other markets. We need a global solution
because our customers are global," says Childs.

   DTCC launched the first of its Loan/SERV products - the Loan/SERV
Reconciliation Service - in September 2008 with Citi when more than
6,600 lender of record positions were posted for reconciliation. This
is the first service to automate the processing of syndicated
commercial loans by enabling agent banks and lenders to view and
reconcile loan positions on a daily basis.

   A second service - DTCC's Loan/SERV Messaging Service - will
provide a safe, secure and automated network for the transmission,
receipt and online storage of industry standard loan messages, such as
agent notices. The service, which will be launched later this year,
brings standardized loan-servicing language to the marketplace by
adopting FpML(TM) (Financial products Markup Language), the e-commerce
electronic language with widely-proven success in over-the-counter
derivatives trading. (FpML is a trademark of the International Swaps
and Derivatives Association.)

   The standardized messages are being developed by the industry
through The Loan Syndications and Trading Association (LSTA) and The
Loan Market Association (LMA). For maximum flexibility, Loan/SERV also
allows users to view FpML messages via a web-based interface. The
Loan/SERV Messaging Service will allow for message routing, workflow
management, processing and online storage. The service also allows
market participants who do not wish to receive messages directly into
their processing systems to manage their messages online via a message
hub.

&lt;p&gt;  WALCOTT, IA, Oct 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
What started as a truck stop with a small store, lube bay, and restaurant
in the quiet town of Walcott, Iowa, is today an international trucking
powerhouse boasting the world's largest truck stop.

    The Iowa 80 Group has 13 locations and 1,200 CAT Scale point-of-sale
locations in the U.S. and Canada, incorporating the latest ideas and
technology in fueling islands, service centers, truck washing, truck
weighing and the biggest trucker store in the U.S.

    Iowa 80 Group is owned and operated by the Moon family who will tell you
that the Iowa 80 Group's success is due, in large part, to their ability
to minimize the cost of daily operation through the skillful use of
innovative information technology.

    "We are experts on trucking business and by collaborating with the
innovators in other fields, like the technology industry, we have been
able to provide quality products and exceptional services at a fair
price," said Carolyn Moon, president of Iowa 80 Group. "Classic Software,
Inc. and IBM (NYSE: IBM) are the experts that we have partnered with to
help us achieve our mission."

    It truly is a partnership. Classic Software is the software architect.
"They are great listeners who understand our daily business challenges and
have helped us create a competitive edge," said Moon. "IBM has worked
closely with Classic Software to help the Iowa 80 Group create and
implement the hardware and software solutions that have supported our
rapid growth and allowed us to focus on customer satisfaction instead of
computer issues."

    This close relationship has allowed Iowa 80 Group to lead in innovative
state-of-the-art business practices while reducing employee training,
increasing productivity and enhancing customer service.

    IBM and Classic Software have been helping Iowa 80 Group not only with
technology but also with forming and implementing their business strategy
since the 1970s. Over the years Classic Software has developed every
component of Iowa 80 Group's corporate financial application software that
provides instant communication to and from remote locations, banking
partners, customers, vendors and government entities. The software
simultaneously interfaces with more than 1,200 point-of-sale locations
producing accurate electronic financial transactions allowing Iowa 80
Group to communicate vital information immediately, providing a real-time
view of critical financial information.

    Classic Software also provides, as part of Enterprise Resource Planning
(ERP) applications, a corporate payroll system that implements corporate
and government requirements for the entire enterprise. The application
allows secure access to their IBM Power Systems servers (System i) so
remote locations can print required forms, process new hires and report
hours worked for all employees. This allows corporate to review and
approve new hires and hours worked electronically. The system
automatically submits required reports to all levels of government. In
addition, the payroll system automatically interfaces with accounts
payable, producing payments for taxes, deductions and garnishments
automatically.

    "Efficiency is the key to productivity. Our software is principally
designed to optimize efficiency which allows our clients to increase
productivity, decrease cost, and augment customer satisfaction across the
board," explained Mike McCullough, CEO of Classic Software, Inc.

    IBM Power Systems i servers run seven days a week, 24 hours a day, just
like the trucking industry. IBM provides technical assistance and Classic
Software provides support to establish and support Iowa 80 Group's ERP
environment. IBM middleware provides a critical foundation for Iowa 80
Group's ERP environment including DB2 relational database and WebSphere
application servers.

    Iowa 80 Group also uses a Lotus Domino server that processes and handles
all company e-mail communications. Additional IBM systems manage credit
card processing and the company's Web site.

Classic Software, with IBM's Express Advantage portfolio of hardware,
software and services that are designed and priced for midsize companies.

&lt;p&gt;LinkedIn Raises $22.7 Million from Goldman Sachs, The McGraw-Hill Companies, SAP Ventures and Bessemer Venture Partners

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
LinkedIn Corporation today announced that it has secured $22.7
million in new funding from world-leading strategic investors Goldman
Sachs; The McGraw-Hill Companies; and SAP Ventures, a division of SAP
AG; as well as a re-investment by Bessemer Venture Partners. This
financing is a follow on of the Series D fundraising round LinkedIn
announced in June of 2008, in which the company raised $53 million in
funding led by Bain Capital Ventures. The valuation for the Series D
was just over 1 billion dollars for the $75.7 million raised.

   "We secured this investment with innovators in enterprise
software, investment banking and business information who see the
potential to create value and transform industries through the
LinkedIn platform," said LinkedIn CEO, Dan Nye. "These leading
companies understand that LinkedIn is building a network with broad
and enduring value."

   Over 30 million professionals use LinkedIn to solve business
problems, manage their professional relationships and control their
professional identities online. LinkedIn members represent more than
170 industries, 150 countries, and include executives from all of the
Fortune 500 companies. LinkedIn is currently growing at a rate of half
a million new members a week. Members experience the benefits of the
purpose-driven network by finding new ways to interact and do
business. While standard LinkedIn accounts are free, the company earns
revenue through advertising, premium subscriptions, corporate
solutions, and job listings. LinkedIn recently added a new line of
revenue with LinkedIn Surveys.

   "SAP Ventures is extremely excited to partner with one of the
leading Internet companies in the world," said Doug Higgins, partner
at SAP Ventures. "We made this investment because we believe that when
Web 2.0 technologies are thoughtfully applied to the enterprise, they
can produce significant efficiencies for small, medium and large
companies."

   "We are delighted to enhance our strategic partnership with
LinkedIn, which helps BusinessWeek readers network with others and
provides LinkedIn users with broader access to content," said Glenn S.
Goldberg, president of Information &amp; Media for The McGraw-Hill
Companies. "We look forward to developing additional opportunities to
connect business professionals and to serve their information needs
through BusinessWeek and our other respected franchises."

   "In today's economy we spend more time tending to our professional
networks, and so it's no surprise that LinkedIn continues to grow in
membership and engagement," said David Cowan, partner at Bessemer
Venture Partners.

(a) This non-GAAP financial information is provided to allow investors
 to more clearly evaluate operating performance and business trends.
 Management uses this information to review results excluding items
 that are not necessarily indicative of ongoing results.
*T

   The key factors influencing third quarter results include the
marketplace impact of a continued difficult North American economic
environment including declines in higher margin 20-ounce packages,
continued growth in Europe, increased fuel costs, and the
mark-to-market impact of fuel hedges. As a result, reported operating
income declined 4 1/2 percent in the third quarter, and comparable
operating income declined 2 percent. Currency translation contributed
approximately 1 cent to third quarter EPS results.

   "Our performance remains below our expectations as we work through
a combination of significant marketplace challenges, including a
weakened North American economic environment, changing consumer
purchasing patterns, and the impact of volatile fuel costs," said John
F. Brock, chairman and chief executive officer. "We continue to move
forward with the fundamental business review that we announced at the
end of the second quarter, seeking solutions to structural issues in
our business as we work to renew profit growth as soon as possible. We
look forward to sharing additional details of our review and its
benefits with investors in December.

   "We are taking the necessary steps within our Global Operating
Framework to achieve the higher levels of performance we believe CCE
can deliver," Mr. Brock said. "A key example is our recent agreement
for distribution of Monster energy drinks, the leading U.S. brand by
volume in this growth category. This agreement demonstrates solid
progress against our framework's first strategic objective - grow the
value of our brands."

   Third quarter consolidated physical case bottle and can volume
increased 2 1/2 percent, net pricing per case grew 3 1/2 percent, and
cost of sales per case increased 6 percent. Both pricing and cost of
sales results exclude the effects of currency translations. Pages 11
through 15 of this release provide a reconciliation of reported and
comparable operating results.

                       THIRD QUARTER PERFORMANCE

   In the third quarter, North American volume increased 1 1/2
percent, benefiting from the addition of glaceau, Fuze, and Campbell's
brands, and growth in key sparkling beverage brands, including
Coca-Cola classic, Coca-Cola Zero, and Sprite. Net pricing per case
grew 3 1/2 percent and cost of sales per case increased 7 1/2 percent.
Both pricing and costs were affected by the mix impact of increased
sales of higher cost purchased finished goods, while growth in costs
was also driven by higher commodity costs. Comparable operating
expenses grew 5 percent primarily reflecting increases in fuel costs
and the mark-to-market impact of fuel hedging.

   "North American volume growth was strengthened by promotional
activity planned prior to our decision to implement a September price
increase," Mr. Brock said. "This price increase was a key first step
in our work to maintain margins and cover the impact of increasing
costs in our business and seek ways to return to profit growth as soon
as possible.

   "Though this increase will limit our volume performance for the
near term, it is essential for two reasons. First, we must respond to
the ongoing high cost environment that we face as commodity cost
increases remain well above historical levels and continue to
contribute to margin erosion," Mr. Brock said. "Second, we believe the
long-term health of our company demands that we strengthen
profitability at all levels of the company, including the lower-margin
future consumption segment."

   Total European volume in the third quarter grew 5 1/2 percent,
benefiting from strong marketplace execution and hurdling a prior year
weather-related decline of 3 percent. This improvement includes mid
single-digit growth in Great Britain, driven by a 7 1/2 percent
increase in our trademark Coca-Cola brands, and 6 percent growth in
continental Europe. On the continent, volume reflects strength in our
core Coca-Cola trademark brands and solid improvement in France as we
recover from a second quarter 2008 labor disruption. Net pricing per
case grew 2 1/2 percent and European cost of sales per case grew at a
rate of 2 percent.

   "We continue to achieve important progress in Europe with strong
marketplace execution, the benefits of our three-cola strategy, and
the success of initiatives to drive improved efficiency and
effectiveness," Mr. Brock said. "Through the third quarter,
performance remains in-line with our expectations, though we continue
to monitor the marketplace and overall economic indicators closely."

                           FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

   Management now expects comparable 2008 earnings per diluted common
share in a range of $1.25 to $1.29 and a decrease in full year
operating income of approximately 10 percent. This reflects low
double-digit operating income growth in Europe and a decline in North
America in a low 20 percent range. The company expects full year free
cash flow from operations less capital spending of approximately $600
million, with capital spending of approximately $1 billion. The
comparable effective tax rate for 2008 is expected to be approximately
24 percent to 25 percent.

   This revised guidance excludes items affecting comparability,
excludes the fourth quarter impact of mark-to-market fuel hedging, and
includes expected currency translation impact. It also includes a $35
million reduction in funding from The Coca-Cola Company and a high
single-digit increase in North America concentrate costs, actions that
will significantly impact fourth quarter results.

   "We are working with The Coca-Cola Company on ways to revitalize
primary areas of our North American business," Mr. Brock said. "We
anticipate achieving mutually beneficial solutions to key issues as we
develop long-range plans that will restore growth to North America and
drive meaningful benefit to CCE shareowners."

(a)The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Net Pricing per
    Case" is used to more clearly evaluate bottle and can pricing
    trends in the marketplace. The measure excludes the impact of
    fountain gallon volume and other items that are not directly
    associated with bottle and can pricing in the retail environment.
    Our bottle and can sales accounted for approximately 91 percent of
    our net revenue during the first nine months of 2008.

(b)The non-GAAP financial measures "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can
    Net Pricing per Case" and "Currency-Neutral Bottle and Can Cost of
    Sales per Case" are used to separate the impact of currency
    exchange rate changes on our operations.

(c)The non-GAAP financial measure "Bottle and Can Cost of Sales per
    Case" is used to more clearly evaluate cost trends for bottle and
    can products. The measure excludes the impact of fountain
    ingredient costs as well as marketing credits and Jumpstart
    funding, and allows investors to gain an understanding of the
    change in bottle and can ingredient and packaging costs.

(d)"Comparable Bottle and Can Volume" excludes the impact of changes
    in the number of selling days between periods. The measure is used
    to analyze the performance of our business on a constant period
    basis. There was one less selling day in the first nine months of
    2008 versus the first nine months of 2007. There were the same
    number of selling days in the third quarter of 2008 versus the
    third quarter of 2007.

(e)The non-GAAP measure "Free Cash Flow" is provided to focus
    management and investors on the cash available for debt reduction,
   dividend distributions, share repurchase, and acquisition
    opportunities.

(f)The non-GAAP measure "Net Debt" is used to more clearly evaluate
    our capital structure and leverage.

&lt;p&gt;Software AG Reinforces Mainframe Commitment with Immediate Support for IBM's System z10 BC Platform


   --  Software AG extends current support for IBM's z10 to new
        midrange platform

   --  Adabas enhancements capitalize on new functionality, helping
        customers realize higher transaction rates without additional
        system capacity

   --  As part of the company's long-term commitment to the
        mainframe, Software AG's products continue to enhance the
        platform's throughput, reliability and cost-effectiveness
DARMSTADT, Germany--(Business Wire)--
Software AG, a global leader in business infrastructure software,
today announced its support for the newly-launched System z10 Business
Class (z10 BC) mainframe from IBM. This midrange server for mainframe
applications utilizes a smaller hardware footprint to reduce CPU
usage, energy consumption and operating costs. In production testing,
Software AG's Adabas database management system and Natural
programming language both delivered optimal performance using this
platform. Software AG's support for the System z10 BC platform, as
well as the company's earlier support for the IBM System z10(TM)
Enterprise Class (z10 EC), is meant to help customers capitalize on
the unsurpassed speed, performance and reliability of mainframe
systems at a lower operating cost.

   "The demands being placed on core transactional systems, such as
trading platforms, continue to grow to unprecedented levels. What
hasn't grown are the budgets required to support these
mission-critical systems," said Joe Gentry, Software AG's Chief
Technology Officer for the Enterprise Transaction Systems division.
"By moving assertively to support new and emerging platforms, Software
AG is helping customers take advantage of faster and more efficient
systems to meet these requirements."

   As one of the world's most widely deployed mainframe databases,
Adabas serves as the foundation for enterprise transactional systems
for one in five of the Global 500. Natural, Software AG's widely
adopted business application development and deployment environment,
is recognized for the speed and efficiency it offers for creating
highly-scalable enterprise systems running on either mainframe or open
systems platforms.

   Additional information on Adabas compatibility with IBM platforms,
including the results of production testing using the new System z10
BC, is available at softwareag.com.

   Optimizing Mainframe Performance

   Adabas was one of the first databases to exploit IBM's 64-bit
Virtual Storage architecture for mainframes and Software AG continues
to drive innovation across the IBM platform. In support of these
latest releases, Software AG has enhanced core functionality within
Adabas to capitalize on the newly offered Large Page functionality,
which was originally introduced with the z10 and is now available on
the IBM System z10 BC (with z/OS 1.9 or greater) as well.

   Specifically, the Adabas Parallel Sysplex and Adabas Cluster
Services have been updated to take advantage of large memory
configurations and can now exploit up to 4 terabytes of real memory.
The result is significantly increased performance as a result of
reduced I/Os and better CPU utilization. This means customers benefit
from higher transaction rates without the need to increase system
capacity. These steps are just one example of the ways in which
Software AG helps customers optimize mainframe performance,
reliability and efficiency. More details about performance and
monitoring products for Adabas and Natural are available at
softwareag.com.

   New Levels of Openness

   In addition to improving mainframe performance, Software AG has
also recently introduced new capabilities to enhance cross-platform
interaction. These include:

   --  Event Replicator for Adabas: Provides real-time updates on
        changed data - either to a hot-standby Adabas system for
        disaster recovery or to other enterprise systems that depend
        on Adabas information;

   --  Adabas SOA Gateway and Adabas SQL Gateway: Enable
        cross-platform, bi-directional communication and
        services-based interaction between Adabas and other enterprise
        platforms such as Oracle and .NET;

   --  Natural for Eclipse: Allows developers to use a single,
        unified development platform for working in Natural, Java, and
        other languages.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - One evening last August, hundreds of people filed into Hollywood's elegant El Capitan Theater to pay tribute to the late Ollie Johnston, the last surviving member of the "Nine Old Men," the pioneering animators who brought Walt Disney's classics to the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Among them was John Lasseter, chief creative officer of the Walt Disney Animation Studios and Pixar Animation Studios and also principal creative advisor for Walt Disney Imagineering. His voice trembling, Lasseter spoke of how thrilling it was getting to know Johnston when he first came to Disney in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We weren't embraced at that time by many of the people leading (Disney)," he recalled. "The Nine Old Men were starting to step away and retire. But it was the Nine Old Men who embraced us. They wanted to teach us everything that they knew. They recognized, more than anybody else, that they were handing the torch off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The torch has been passed. Over the past two decades, the 51-year-old Lasseter has become not only the most prominent successor to the Nine Old Men, but arguably the most important figure in animation since Disney himself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, he's a key player behind two animated films: "WALL-E," already hailed by many critics as a masterpiece, and "Bolt," debuting November 21.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One comes from the ever-inventive Pixar, the other from Disney's decades-old animation unit. If Lasseter is now pivotal to both, that is no coincidence: His groundbreaking work has never ignored its debt to the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's been an extraordinary force in innovating and renewing excitement about the animated feature in this country," says film historian Charles Solomon. And, he says, he did so "at a time when it was falling into the doldrums."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRAIN TRUST&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasseter's L-shaped office on the Pixar campus in Emeryville, Calif., brims with scripts, family pictures and a multitude of toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One wall serves as a shrine to Lasseter's favorite animation director, Japan's Hayao Miyazaki, with signed posters, pictures and mementos from films like his 2003 best animated feature Oscar winner "Spirited Away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His films are so specific," Lasseter says. "They have such heart. They're so inventive. They're always inspirational."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heart. Inventiveness. Inspiration. These are Lasseter's own hallmarks, visible in everything from the free education available to Pixar employees to the imaginative way he works with Pixar's "Brain Trust," a group of directors who play a pivotal role on each film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Brain Trust is critical to Pixar's success. It gets together regularly to look at work done by other directors and comment candidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's part of a strategy Lasseter calls "plussing," constantly adding input from all sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's always assumed there's a way to make it better at every stage," says Pete Docter, director of 2001's "Monsters, Inc." "John is great at saying, 'Well, what if you did this extra little gesture?' And suddenly it really sparkles and comes to life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it would be foolish to think this happens in some nebulous ether. Lasseter's boyish manner masks a far more driven figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His quest for perfection has led him to let go of actors who don't work out, as he did with one actress who was meant to play the title role of "Tinker Bell," a film in Disney's newest direct-to-DVD animated franchise, the Disney Fairies. It has also led him to part ways with filmmakers who don't share his vision -- as he did with Chris Sanders, who was originally attached to direct "Bolt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanders had conceived of "Bolt" under a different title, "American Dog." It was in development at Disney when Lasseter arrived in 2006, but he and the Brain Trust were critical of what they saw. Lasseter gave Sanders notes to improve the story, but the director resisted. The project remained at Disney, but Sanders was let go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"'Bolt' was a restart," says Ed Catmull, president of Pixar and Disney animation studios. "The roughest concept was kept, but the look was different, the characters were different."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The irony, of course, is that Lasseter has been there himself: Sitting back in his desk, he notes that in 1983, he was fired from the very Walt Disney Studios he now dominates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISNEY DREAMING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The son of a Chevy parts manager and a high school art teacher, Lasseter stumbled upon Bob Thomas' book "The Art of Animation" during his freshman year at Whittier High School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It dawned on me," he says, "(that) people actually make cartoons for a living."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not long after, Disney's 1963 movie "The Sword in the Stone" showed up in the local discount theater. When he got into his mother's car after watching it, he told her: "I'm going to work for Walt Disney."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around that time, Lasseter got a letter announcing a new major at the California Institute of the Arts in Valencia, Calif.: character animation, to be taught by the last of the original Disney animators. The summer before entering CalArts, he worked for the program's director, mostly copying the work of classic animators for use by the students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasseter thrived at CalArts, where he studied alongside classmates Brad Bird, Tim Burton and John Musker. While there, he won two Student Academy Awards -- and he remains the only two-time winner in history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also while at CalArts, Lasseter saw another film that would strongly impact his thinking: 1977's "Star Wars." He was there on opening weekend in a packed auditorium at the Chinese Theater in Hollywood. "You've never seen an audience as pumped to see a movie as that," he says. "I thought to myself, 'Animation can do this (too).' So I had deep in me this fundamental belief that animation is not just for kids."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STIFLED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when he started his "dream job" at Disney, his enthusiasm and idealism took an initial hit. After a training course, Lasseter was put to work on "The Fox and the Hound" (1981). He tried to make suggestions, but was told to keep quiet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was stifling," he recalls. "They really went to great effort to squish the young talent. The creative leadership at the time was these guys who were kind of second-tier animators. I didn't want control, power -- that's what they were into. I just wanted to make the movies better. The famous saying back then was, 'What would Walt do?' Walt died in 1966! The studio had been hermetically sealed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Lasseter tried to go around a powerful manager to pitch a project, he was fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But his time at Disney wasn't wasted -- he did get to meet Johnston and Frank Thomas, another of the Nine Old Men. He learned from them, and from a book they were writing, "Disney Animation: The Illusion of Life," which became the authoritative history of early Disney animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest thing I learned was to make your character really feel like it's thinking," he explains. "Every moment should create the idea that it was generated by that character's own thought process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the once-brilliant student was now out of a job, with no apparent future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had always dreamed of working at the Disney studio," he says. "It was just crushing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The devastating impact of that firing seems even clearer when one considers that Lasseter didn't mention it to anyone for years, not even to his friend Catmull, whom he ran into soon after the incident at a computer graphics conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't tell people I got fired until just recently," Lasseter admits. "When you're young, your identity is wrapped up in this dream. To have the rug pulled out from under me was so disheartening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPUTERS, CARTOONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Luckily, Catmull was working on some new ideas at Lucasfilm's computer graphics division, and he quickly invited Lasseter to join them for a month. He wound up staying much longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasseter had a vision of using computers in animation, but at the time they were largely relegated to creating backgrounds. Now at Lucasfilm, he and Catmull would explore computerized animation to brilliant effect, creating the very first computer-animated short, "The Adventures of Andre and Wally B."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasseter calls George Lucas a "visionary," but he wasn't drawn to computer animation. "Lucas wanted these tools for making films, but wasn't interested in the computer side of it," Lasseter explains. "So we started looking around (for new financing)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Disney insiders wanted to buy the company, but then-studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg nixed it. When Apple co-founder Steve Jobs found out about Lucas' group, he thought he sniffed a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1986, Jobs bought the computer graphics unit of Lucasfilm for the fire-sale price of $5 million, injected another $5 million of capital into it, and renamed it Pixar -- a made-up, Spanish-sounding word meaning to make pictures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Pixar thrived, making Oscar-winning shorts that became the talk of the entertainment community, the Walt Disney Co. wasn't blind to its success. In the 1990s, Disney tried to hire Lasseter back, but he stayed where he was.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wasn't making much money, but I felt I was on the edge of something," he says. "We were the cutting edge of this new technology."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So after his overtures failed to woo Lasseter back to the Disney fold, Katzenberg made a deal with Pixar for Lasseter to direct the first computer-animated feature film, which turned out to be 1995's "Toy Story."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISNEY SKEPTICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Katzenberg's enthusiasm, there was considerable skepticism at the studio. "They didn't think you could get the emotion out of the computer-created characters," recalls Disney Studios chairman Dick Cook. "When something new comes out, you're always going to have a certain amount of skepticism."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasseter had the opportunity on "Toy Story" to be the sole author of the screenplay, and to keep all the creative decisions to himself. Instead, he put together a core group that included Andrew Stanton, Docter and the late Joe Ranft -- the beginnings of what would come to be known as the Brain Trust -- who worked as a collective on every aspect of production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of that is his temperament," says Stanton, director of "WALL-E." "(John) thrives on others. The most anxious I have seen him is when he is alone too long on a problem."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As this was Pixar's first feature-length movie, Katzenberg gave lots of notes -- above all, to make the characters edgy so they would play to adults as well as kids. But when Pixar brought the first reels to Burbank, the studio's leaders hated them because the characters were too edgy -- bordering on unlikeable. Executives ordered production halted and people fired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Lasseter, determined not to break up Pixar, begged for time to fix the first reel and was given two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We said, 'Let's just make the movie we want,'" he recalls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks later they had turned the film around, and the rest is animation history.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Toy Story" launched a period of creativity unrivaled since Disney's golden era.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A Bug's Life" (1998) and "Toy Story 2" (1999) proved digital animation was no fluke. They were followed by "Monsters, Inc." (2001), "Finding Nemo" (2003), "The Incredibles" (2004), "Cars" (2006), "Ratatouille" (2007) and now "WALL-E."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They were films that transformed what anyone had imagined animation could do, picking up three best animated feature Oscars in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also transformed Pixar's financial standing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week after "Toy Story" opened, Jobs took the company public. In 1997, Pixar and Disney forged a new pact, splitting development costs and profits 50-50 on five feature-length films over 10 years. But after Pixar produced a few more box office hits, Disney found rival bidders on the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just who would get Pixar's films when the Disney contract ran out after "Cars" in 2006 led to hostility between Jobs and then-Disney chairman Michael Eisner, jeopardizing relations between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 29, 2004, Jobs surprised Eisner when he announced an end to negotiations with Disney on a new contract. It was only when Robert Iger replaced Eisner that relations started to improve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger moved quickly to open lines of communication and not long after sealed a deal to buy Pixar for $7.4 billion worth of Disney stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On May 5, 2006, the deal was closed. Not only did Jobs become Disney's biggest individual shareholder, but Lasseter was named to his current posts, making him one of the most powerful executives at the studio that had unceremoniously parted ways with the young animator 23 years prior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He manages to split his week between Disney facilities in Burbank and Glendale and the Pixar Studios in Emeryville. He attends meetings on movies in development and those in progress; on projects at Imagineering for theme parks; on products for merchandising and licensing; and still manages to consult on other creative activities throughout the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Lasseter, life is a juggling act between the executive he has become and the artist he remains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Working at Pixar is like being a trapeze artist, where you're looking across at the other guy to catch you," he noted. Like all great circus artists, he added, "you want to do something no one has ever done before."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese Internet users have expressed fury at Microsoft's launch of an anti-piracy tool targeting Chinese computer users to ensure they buy genuine software.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "Windows Genuine Advantage" program, which turns the user's screen black if the installed software fails a validation test, is Microsoft's latest weapon in its war on piracy in China, where the vast majority of 200 million computer users are believed to be using counterfeit software, unwittingly or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why is Microsoft automatically connected with my computer? The computer is mine!" one angry blogger wrote on popular Chinese web portal Sina.com. "Microsoft has no right to control my hardware without my agreement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another blogger railed over the cost of authorized versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the price of genuine software was lower than the fake one, who would buy the fake one?" he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A visitor to a Beijing internet cafe said Microsoft was violating people's rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If, when I'm programing, the computer screen goes black, that will probably cause some important information to be lost," he said. "Who will pay me for my loss then?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dong Zhengwei, 35, a Beijing lawyer, described Microsoft as the "biggest hacker in China with its intrusion into users' computer systems without their agreement or any judicial authority," the China Daily said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft's measure will cause serious functional damage to users' computers and, according to China's criminal law, the company can stand accused of breaching and hacking into computer systems," he was quoted as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I respect the right of Microsoft to protect its intellectual property, but it is taking on the wrong target with wrong measures. They should target producers and sellers of fake software, not users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software giant defended the program on its website as part of its "commitment to help protect its intellectual property and to help you avoid problems before they happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The purpose ... is to help our customers to determine (if) genuine software is installed on their computers," Microsoft told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Beijing Newsroom; Editing by Nick Macfie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Peabody Energy Corp., Pfizer Inc., SanDisk Corp., Everest Re Group, Ltd. and Biogen Idec Inc.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: Peabody Energy Corp. (NYSE:
BTU), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), SanDisk Corp. (Nasdaq: SNDK), Everest
Re Group, Ltd. (NYSE: RE) and Biogen Idec Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB).

   Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the
free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

   Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:

   BTU Forecast Highly Energized

   Peabody Energy (NYSE: BTU) reported Q3'08 earnings from continuing
operations of $1.38 per share, well above street consensus of $0.87
per share, on higher-than-expected production and per-ton prices,
particularly from its Australian operations.

   Although energy markets have pulled back significantly from their
mid-July highs, we believe that supply and demand fundamentals for the
coal industry have not changed. Peabody will generate a significant
amount of free cash flow due to favorable margin expansion in all
operating regions particularly Australia.

   Pfizer in Strong Financial Position

   Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) continues to face an uphill battle in growing
its top-line given the company's sheer size and lack of a significant
pipeline. While near-term earnings growth will come in the form of
cost-cutting and share repurchases, the company lacks a catalyst to
increase revenues once Lipitor loses patent exclusivity. We expect the
company to look to do a number of significant deals in the pharma and
biotech industry in order to build the franchise and invest for the
future.

   We recently upgraded our recommendation to Buy based on attractive
valuation and strong financial position. Although the shares are up
over 17% since we raised our recommendation on October 13th, we
continue to think Pfizer shares are undervalued at these levels.

   SanDisk Disappoints, Stays a Sell

   SanDisk (Nasdaq: SNDK) is the largest supplier of flash storage
card products based on NAND technology used in digital cameras,
multimedia cellular phones, USB flash drives, and a growing variety of
other digital consumer devices. SanDisk reported disappointing Q3
earnings results due to negative product gross margin and excess
inventory.

   We expect the company's earnings losses will be followed through
the first half of 2009 even with substantial cost-cutting and
restructuring efforts. We believe pricing is likely to remain weak
until demand improves, which is not likely until the consumer spending
picture strengthens.

   Everest Re Estimates Taken Down

   Everest Re (NYSE: RE) reported 3Q08 results of $0.21 per share,
versus $3.68 per share in the year ago quarter. The loss emanated from
the previously announced hurricane losses, write-downs associated with
the company's financial sector bond holdings and equity securities,
and net realized capital losses on the sales of securities. We
maintain our Hold recommendation on the shares.

   Based on 3Q08 results and prior to the conference call, we are
lowering our FY08E and FY09E EPS expectations are $8.89 per share and
$11.70 per share, respectively, down from $11.13 per share and $12.20
per share previously. The shares of Everest Re trade at 0.79x its 3Q08
book value of $82.02 per share.

   Biogen Significantly Undervalued

   Biogen (Nasdaq: BIIB) headquartered in Cambridge, Massachusetts
posted solid results in the third quarter of 2008, despite the
slowdown in Tysabri sales due to fears of PML. We think the Biogen
core business will remain strong over the next several quarters. We
believe that physicians are comfortable with the PML risk and that
Tysabri forecasts will probably surprise to the upside in the next few
quarters.

   In the meantime, the name is significantly undervalued and would
be a very attractive takeout candidate for a large-cap pharmaceutical
company looking for a great phase III pipeline. We expect 2009 to be
an eventful year on the pipeline front. As investors become more
comfortable with both Tysabri trends and emerging pipeline, we believe
shares will recover back into the high $50s.

&lt;p&gt;Investor Notice: The Rosen Law Firm Reminds General Electric Company
Shareholders of the December 2, 2008 Deadline in the GE Securities Class Action
-- GE

NEW YORK, Oct. 24, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Rosen Law Firm reminders
investors of the December 2, 2008 lead plaintiff deadline in the class action
lawsuit on behalf of all purchasers of General Electric Company ("GE" or the
"Company") (NYSE:GE) common stock and call options during the period beginning
September 25, 2008 through and including October 1, 2008 (the "Class Period").
The Rosen Law Firm initiated the first securities class action lawsuit on behalf
of this class of GE shareholders.

To join the GE class action, go to the website at http://rosenlegal.com or call
Laurence Rosen, Esq. or Phillip Kim, Esq. toll-free at 866-767-3653 or email
lrosen@rosenlegal.com or pkim@rosenlegal.com for information on the class
action.

NO CLASS HAS YET BEEN CERTIFIED IN THE ABOVE ACTION. UNTIL A CLASS IS CERTIFIED,
YOU ARE NOT REPRESENTED BY COUNSEL UNLESS YOU RETAIN ONE. YOU MAY ALSO REMAIN AN
ABSENT CLASS MEMBER.

The complaint charges GE and certain of its officers with violations of Section
10(b) and Section 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The complaint
asserts that during an investor conference call on September 25, 2008,
defendants falsely stated that GE would not require any additional fund raising
through debt, equity, or otherwise during fourth quarter-ended December 31,
2008.

On October 1, 2008 GE announced that it planned to offer at least $12 billion of
common stock in a public offering. On October 2, 2008, before market open, GE
announced the offering was to be priced at $22.25 per share, well-below the
stock's prior day closing price of $24.50 per share and below its 52 week low.
News that the stock offering was priced at less than the current market price
caused GE's stock price to fall over 9% on October 2, 2008, damaging
shareholders.

A class action lawsuit has already been filed on behalf of GE shareholders. If
you wish to serve as lead plaintiff, you must move the Court no later than
December 2, 2008. If you wish to join the litigation or to discuss your rights
or interests regarding this class action, please contact plaintiff's counsel,

practice in securities class actions and shareholder derivative litigation.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft MAPP Enables Fastest Possible Response to Threats and
                            Vulnerabilities
COLUMBIA, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Open source innovator and SNORT(R) creator, Sourcefire, Inc.
(Nasdaq:FIRE), a leader in Enterprise Threat Management, announced
that the Sourcefire(R) Vulnerability Research Team (VRT) delivered
rules to protect Sourcefire customers and Snort users from a critical
Microsoft vulnerability within 30 minutes of its public disclosure
yesterday. As a member of the new Microsoft Active Protections Program
(MAPP), Sourcefire now receives vulnerability information from
Microsoft in advance, which allows the company to quickly protect its
users from potential threats.

   As a partner in MAPP, a new program from the Microsoft Security
Response Center (MSRC) that provides early notification, the
Sourcefire VRT can better anticipate emerging threats and continue its
track record of delivering timely protection against new and dynamic
attacks.

   "Microsoft Active Protections Program (MAPP) has been designed to
help security software providers better protect our mutual customers.
For example, Sourcefire's speed in delivering high-quality signature
rules at such short notice is proof that this program is helping do
that by improving collaboration," said Mark Miller, Director of
Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing product management. "The release of
MS08-067 was a good indicator that by working together we can help
better protect customers from potential threats."

   "Sourcefire works diligently to ensure that our customers and
Snort users receive the industry's best protection, and with the new
MAPP disclosures, we can now provide our users with an even faster
response to critical threats," said Matt Watchinski, Senior Director
of the Sourcefire Vulnerability Research Team. "MAPP's launch could
not have come at a better time. The MAPP allowed us to provide
protection for yesterday's out-of-band vulnerability within minutes of
public disclosure."

   The Sourcefire VRT created, tested and delivered Snort rules
designed to detect attacks targeting the Microsoft vulnerability
listed below. These new rules are included in the latest Sourcefire
Security Enhancement Update (SEU) released at 2 pm EDT on October 23,
2008.

   --  Microsoft Security Bulletin MS08-067 -- Critical vulnerability
        in Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003
        could allow remote code execution if an affected system
        received a specially crafted RPC request. An attacker could
        exploit this vulnerability without authentication to run
        arbitrary code. It is possible that this vulnerability could
        be used to craft a wormable exploit.

   The Sourcefire VRT is a group of leading edge intrusion detection
and prevention experts working to proactively discover, assess and
respond to the latest trends in hacking activities, intrusion attempts
and vulnerabilities. This team is also supported by the vast resources
of the open source Snort community, making it the largest group
dedicated to advances in the network security industry.

&lt;p&gt;Environmental Group Asserts Oil Giant Paying Writers to Pose as
           Journalists as Part of Public Relations Campaign
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
The environmental group Amazon Watch today called on Chevron and
the San Francisco-based writer Pat Murphy to divulge their financial
relationship in light of disclosures that Murphy's website accepts
fees for editorial control of news articles written under Murphy's
byline.

   "Chevron's public relations office and Pat Murphy appear to be
engaged in an online deception," said Mitch Anderson, an Amazon Watch
official. "Murphy writes pro-Chevron articles under the masthead of a
commercial blog cleverly designed to look like a newspaper."

   The disclosure comes at an awkward time for Chevron, which on
Monday begins a trial in San Francisco federal court on charges it
helped the Nigerian military shoot and kill unarmed villagers who had
taken over an oil platform in an act of civil disobedience. Murphy was
slated to cover the trial as a self-styled "independent" journalist
with a press pass from the San Francisco Police Department.

   Murphy's website, the San Francisco Sentinel, has the look and
feel of an online newspaper and does not make it clear that it accepts
fees for control of editorial content. For several months Murphy has
been posting a steady stream of commentary and misleading facts to
discredit indigenous groups suing Chevron for environmental
contamination in Ecuador without disclosing he is being paid.

   Murphy has also written pro-Chevron blogs regarding the Nigerian
lawsuit that are riddled with inaccuracies and obfuscations, and
largely repeat the talking points prepared by the company's public
relations department.

   Although the San Francisco Sentinel is relatively insignificant in
the Bay Area - it ranked 171,939 in popularity among websites this
week compared to 851 for the San Francisco Chronicle - Murphy's blogs
on the Ecuador case are "google-bombed" to the top of search engines
above negative articles about Chevron by more established
publications. There are a number of companies that can be hired to
manipulate Google search results in this fashion.

   In a statement released Wednesday reacting to the revelation,
Murphy did not deny he has accepted fees from Chevron or any of its
outside public relations firms. He did deny that he currently works
for Don Solem and Associates, a Bay Area public relations firm which
lists Chevron as a client. Murphy's website boasted that he had worked
for Solem in the past.

   An independent court expert in Ecuador earlier this year assessed
damages in the Ecuador case at $16.3 billion for the clean-up of what
some experts call the "Amazon Chernobyl". Chevron has since launched
an intensive public relations and lobbying war to avoid paying any
judgment, including pressuring the U.S. Congress to deny trade
preferences for Ecuador and attacking the highly respected Goldman
Foundation for awarding environmental prizes to Amazon villagers who
brought the lawsuit.

   None of Chevron's efforts to avoid paying the judgment seem to be
bearing fruit, as Congress recently extended Ecuador's trade
preferences despite Chevron's lobbying and the Goldman Foundation
basically ignored the company. In Murphy's case, Chevron's strategy
apparently has backfired.

   In light of the revelations, Anderson called on Chevron's General
Manager for Public Affairs, Donald Samson, to "come clean" and
disclose whether Chevron or any of its outside public relations firms
have made payments to the San Francisco Sentinel or any other
journalist. The practice of blogging or writing articles on behalf of
clients without disclosing payments is considered highly unethical.

   "Neither Chevron nor any other responsible company should have a
policy of paying journalists or bloggers and then failing to disclose
it," said Anderson.

   Samson recently has become a public voice for Chevron on the
Ecuador case as the profile of the environmental disaster has risen in
the news media. He has signed several letters to the editor, including
one apologizing for a comment made by a Chevron lobbyist to Newsweek
that "little countries" like Ecuador should not be allowed to "screw
around" with big companies like Chevron.

   In the meantime, small links on the Sentinel website soliciting
"fee-based" coverage were removed just hours after a press release was
sent Wednesday to journalists calling attention to the practice. This
was an apparent attempt by Murphy to maintain the facade of
journalistic integrity, said Kevin Koenig, an Amazon Watch organizer.

   Koenig said his organization was contacting Google to alert them
to Chevron's manipulations of their search results. He also called on
the San Francisco Police Department to revoke Murphy's press pass
given that he is paid for his articles.

   Questions about Murphy's objectivity have been raised before. In
2005, the former co-owner of the San Francisco Sentinel, Luke Thomas,
charged that Murphy moved "away from objective news reporting into
sponsor-supported journalism" and that he secretly sought financial
sponsorship from the Committee on Jobs, a lobbying group for large
businesses in San Francisco.

   A final decision on the Ecuador case is expected in 2009.

&lt;p&gt;  RALEIGH, NC, Oct 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
North Carolina State University (NC State) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today
announced plans to provide every student in North Carolina access to
advanced educational resources through NC State's Virtual Computing Lab
(VCL), a cloud computing-based technology. Through this cloud -- which is
a set of Internet-based resources -- students at K-12 schools, colleges
around the state and the University of North Carolina system campuses
themselves will have access to the most advanced educational materials,
select software applications and computing and storage resources.

    NC State also announced that the code for its VCL technology is available
through the Apache open source community for free, and is in discussions
with a number of universities across the globe that wish to replicate
this cloud computing model.

    In support of this effort, the NC State Department of Computer Science and
Office of Information Technology announced the creation of a Center of
Excellence in Cloud Computing, an applied research and development
facility on the NC State campus that will spearhead collaboration
projects between NC State and the IBM "Blue Cloud" development team,
helping improve the quality of education provided through the VCL
platform and ensure reliability.

    The VCL solution allows users to remotely access a desired set of
applications and environments over the Internet -- using a personal
computer, laptop or mobile device -- from anywhere, at any time. To VCL
users, even the most demanding software applications, operating systems
and environments are easily accessible through license-honoring
technology in a click of the mouse. Access is instant, and offers a range
of options -- from single desktops to classroom-sized labs, to
collections of servers and storage, to high-performance computing
clusters.

    "NC State and IBM are inviting universities worldwide to participate in
the Virtual Computing Initiative," said Jai Menon, vice president of IBM
University Programs and vice chair of the IBM Academy of Technology.
"Through this collaboration, universities that participate in the program
have a tremendous opportunity to not only further enable their own
students, but to also improve the lives of students in economically
disadvantaged parts of the country and the world. The VCL technology is a
conduit that can greatly enhance students' education, self confidence and
overall quality of life."

    "We are excited to partner with IBM to offer schools across North Carolina
access to the academic resources of the NC State Virtual Computing Lab.
The VCL has the promise and track record to allow for improvements in wide
ranging activities from enhanced teaching and learning to improved
business continuity," said Dr. Marc Hoit, vice chancellor for information
technology and CIO of North Carolina State University. "Collaboration,
partnership across educational and industrial entities, and shared
innovation are hallmarks of NC State's approach and mission, so the cloud
computing and open source technology is a perfect fit."

    Using VCL, elementary school students will access content appropriate for
their advancement. For example, "Alice" -- an innovative educational
software environment with 3D animation and story-telling -- could provide
educational support for students across several functional areas. As
another example, Disney's MathQuest grade school software helps build
essential math skills like addition, subtraction, estimating, sorting and
understanding patterns, all through participating in virtual mazes and
expeditions. Microelectronics Center of North Carolina, the NC State
Friday Institute and Duke University are lead partners in the K-12 effort.

    Through the same system, university-level students can access high-end
applications such as SolidWorks, MatLab and SAS, as well as complex
networking simulators, mainframe computing facilities running IBM System
z, and specialized IBM Cell microprocessors to learn, for example, about
Service Oriented Architectures and IT Management.

    The content is projected through the VCL images, which consist of an
operating system and set of prepackaged applications, middleware or other
material that is securely stored in the cloud. Once a session is over and
the user has saved the data they want to keep, that user's "virtual space"
is wiped clean. This enables the computing resources to be re-provisioned
by other users as needed. The VCL consists primarily of a pool of IBM
BladeCenter servers, plus storage and software that can be shared by
geographically distributed users.

    With the creation of the Center of Excellence in Cloud Computing, NC State
hopes to lead the way in applying cloud computing technology to the
democratization of education for students in North Carolina, as well as
around the world. The center will serve as a focal point for the many
ongoing cloud computing research projects being conducted at NC State and
other local universities, including the open source Apache project.

    "We are excited that Apache.org has accepted the Virtual Computing Lab as
one of its open source projects," said Dr. Louis Martin-Vega, dean of the
College of Engineering at NC State. "As part of this prominent open source
community, the VCL will continue to add to the development of open source
computing and improve access to high-performance computing power across
the state."

    IBM and NC State collaborated to establish the VCL in 2004. Since then IBM
has also assisted in expanding the VCL with technical support from IBM
BladeCenter development teams in Research Triangle Park (RTP), North
Carolina, as well as through sustained funding from the IBM RTP Center for
Advanced Studies (CAS) and IBM corporate university relations -- with
several other corporations, and active support from The University of
North Carolina General Administration and the state legislature.

    The IBM WebSphere Technology Institute also assisted NC State in launching
the VCL Apache incubator project. Through support from RTP CAS and the
Academic Initiative, the VCL allows North Carolina faculty to create and
deliver advanced educational material in support of programs that are
preparing their students for the 21st century workforce. Through
fellowships, grants and technical collaborations, IBM is supporting local
faculty who are applying VCL in support of STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering and Math) outreach programs to North Carolina K-12 students
and teachers.

    As part of its Cloud Computing Initiative, IBM has built 13 cloud
computing centers around the world, many of which partner with
universities and other organizations. In addition, IBM is working with a
number of universities to help future computer scientists gain the skills
they need to build cloud applications.

    IBM and NC State will be showcasing the VCL capabilities at Educause 2008
in Orlando, Florida, October 28-31, and at Supercomputing 2008 in Austin,
Texas, November 15-21, 2008.

&lt;p&gt;The Law Firm of Goldman Scarlato &amp; Karon, P.C. Files Class Action Lawsuit Against AuthenTec, Inc.

CONSHOHOCKEN, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Scarlato &amp; Karon, P.C., a law firm with offices in
Pennsylvania and Ohio, announces that a lawsuit has been filed in the
United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida, on
behalf of persons who purchased or otherwise acquired publicly traded
securities of AuthenTec, Inc. ("AuthenTec" or the "Company")
(NASDAQ:AUTH) between April 28, 2008 and September 5, 2008, inclusive,
(the "Class Period"). The lawsuit was filed against AuthenTec and
certain officers and directors ("Defendants").

   If you are a member of this class and wish to view a copy of a
complaint and join this class action, please e-mail us at
info@gsk-law.com and request a copy of the complaint and a plaintiff
certification. If you are a member of the Class, you may move the
Court no later than December 8, 2008 to serve as a lead plaintiff for
the Class. Any member of the purported class may move the Court to
serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of their choice, or may choose
to do nothing and remain an absent class member. However, if you
choose to remain an absent class member, unless and until a class is
certified, you are not represented by counsel.

   The complaint alleges that Defendants violated Section 10(b) and
20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5
promulgated thereunder. Specifically, the complaint alleges that
Defendants mislead investors by withholding material information
regarding the Company's slowing sales growth, its lack of internal
financial controls, and by flooding its customers with unneeded
inventory. A short time after reassuring the market that revenue was
on track and that sales prospects were good, the Company revised
downward its previously issued financial guidance, causing the
Company's stock price to decline sharply.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY Oct 24 (Reuters) - Televisa said on Friday it
is moving forward with a lawsuit against its U.S. partner
Univision, as the Mexican media giant seeks a more profitable
way to tap the attractive U.S. Hispanic market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are not presently engaged in discussions or
negotiations with them to settle the lawsuit or to invest in
Univision," Televisa's Executive Vice President Alfonso de
Angoitia told analysts in a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two media companies are headed back to a U.S. federal
court in for a trial over royalty payments on Jan. 6, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa (TV.N)(TLVACPO.MX) sued Univision Communications
Inc in 2005 demanding royalty payments it said Univision had
withheld as part of a programming deal that expires in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trial has been postponed several times this year,
prompting analysts and legal observers to think that the two
were trying to settle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa reported a 9.7 percent decline in third-quarter
net majority profit on Thursday, hurt by a jump in financing
costs and expenditures for its month-long coverage of the
Beijing Summer Olympics. Revenue rose 21 percent driven by its
cable television units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked during Friday's call about the upfront sales
expectations, when Televisa lands most of its top clients for
the year ahead, Televisa officials declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa acknowledged the current financial crisis will hit
Mexico but said the company is well poised to face the turmoil
as it exports its productions across the globe and has a
manageable debt position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of the end of September, Televisa had a total debt of
32.3 billion pesos, including dollar-denominated debt of $1.9
billion. The average duration of that debt is 13.5 years and
Televisa has no significant maturities until 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If Televisa does not find a new investment to make in the
next few months, it may even consider increasing dividend
payments to shareholders. "But that will depend on the economic
environment," De Angoitia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's consolidated net cash position was 1.924 billion
pesos as of last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company shares were off 0.71 percent at 37.95 pesos on
Friday morning trading, while its U.S-traded stock fell 0.56
percent to $14.11 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (1 peso = 7.5 cents)

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Oct 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
In the news release, "JPMorgan Takes First Place Among Prime Brokerages
in Alpha Magazine's Annual Awards Survey," issued earlier today by
Institutional Investor, we are advised by the company that in the
headline and third paragraph "JPMorgan" should read "Morgan Stanley."
Complete corrected text follows.

    Morgan Stanley Takes First Place Among Prime Brokerages in Alpha
Magazine's Annual Awards Survey

    Hedge Fund Managers Also Rate the Top Law Firms, Accountants and
Administrators

    NEW YORK, NY -- October 24, 2008 -- Hedge funds are demanding more than
ever from service providers -- not just their prime brokers but their law
firms, accountants and administrators according to the results of the
fourth annual Alpha Awards(TM) Hedge Fund Service Providers survey.

    Full results in all categories are available online at www.iimagazine.com.

    For prime brokerages, unprecedented opportunity mixes with fear and
uncertainty among clients, who look for well-tested partners in a
turbulent environment. Morgan Stanley's franchise, especially its
dominance among long-short equity clients, remains strong, helping it
hold onto its No. 1 ranking, just ahead of Goldman Sachs at No. 2. Citi
takes the No. 3 spot.

    In Accounting, Rothstein Kass &amp; Co. is the clear favorite among both small
and large hedge fund firms. Part of the reason is the firm's aggressive
move to help clients interpret Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 157, or FAS No. 157, the new accounting rule that sets more
stringent standards for valuing assets. BDO Seidman drops one place this
year to No.2. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, No. 3 is the highest ranked of the
Big Four firms.

    Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. is the No. 1 Hedge Fund Administrator for a third
year in a row. Fund managers give Goldman the highest scores in Client
Service, Fund Accounting, Middle-Office Services and Technology and
Reporting. Tiny, Cayman Island-based Admiral Administration, which didn't
rank last year, grabbed the No. 2 spot. Citco Fund Services was ranked
No. 3.

    Top Onshore Law firm is Shartsis Friese. The firm ranks first in both
Client Service and Document Preparation &amp; Fund Formation. Close on its
heels is Sidley Austin, the Chicago-based firm that slips to second
overall after two years at No. 1. New York-based Seward &amp; Kissel is No. 3.

    Cayman Island-based Walkers took the No. 1 spot for Offshore Law Firms.
The number of hedge funds registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary
Association broke the 10,000 mark this summer, reaching 10,299 as of
September 30. Maples and Calder is a close second in the offshore race.
Ogier slips from the top spot it held for two years to No. 3, though the
firm still earns top honors in Document Preparation &amp; Fund Formation.

    Alpha compiled the 2008 Alpha Awards(TM) rankings of the tope hedge fund
service providers based on voting in the spring and early summer by more
than 1,000 hedge fund firms, which manage more than $1.5 trillion.

    About Alpha

    Institutional Investor magazine launched Alpha five years ago to bring to
the world of hedge funds the same brand of independent, unbiased reporting
and probing analysis for which Institutional Investor has long been known.
Alpha has become the leading hedge fund publication in the marketplace

&lt;p&gt;StoneGate Customers Have Had Full Protection Since August 2006
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Stonesoft, an innovative provider of integrated network security
and resilient connectivity solutions, has today announced its
StoneGate IPS (Intrusion Prevention System) provides pre-emptive
protection against the latest vulnerability announced by Microsoft
yesterday. StoneGate customers have had full protection against this
most recent vulnerability since August 2006.

   On Oct. 23, Microsoft provided an emergency fix for a critical
vulnerability in its system. The Stonesoft Vulnerability Analysis Team
discovered that Stonesoft already offers pre-emptive protection for
the vulnerability in question. Thus, all Stonesoft customers that use
the StoneGate Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to protect their
Windows networks are protected against this vulnerability.

   "StoneGate customers already have full protection against this
most recent vulnerability. This proves that StoneGate signatures cover
more than just one attack - they provide protection against many
variations of the attack that uses the same or similar
vulnerabilities. So, it is not the number of signatures that make the
difference, but instead the quality and coverage of the fingerprint
that matters," said Klaus Majewski, Vice President of Marketing at
Stonesoft.

   Microsoft released an out-of-band security advisory regarding a
critical security flaw that compromises the remote system level in the
server service that affects all supported versions of Windows. The
StoneGate IPS has a pre-emptive signature that terminates attacks
exploiting this vulnerability.

   "This fingerprint situation has been included in the Stonesoft
default policy since Aug. 11, 2006. Our customers do not have to do
anything. They have full protection against this vulnerability," says
Olli-Pekka Niemi, Vulnerability Expert and team leader of the
Vulnerability Analysis team at Stonesoft.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Announces Plans to Place Calorie Information on Front of Packages in the U.S.

   New Effort Communicates Important Consumer Information, Continues
                Company's "Live Positively" Philosophy
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola North America today announced it plans to place
calories-per-serving and servings-per-container information on the
front of all packages for its entire U.S. beverage portfolio. Research
shows that calorie information is an important tool to help people
make informed decisions about the calorie contribution of foods and
beverages to their total dietary intake, and thus is important
information in helping them achieve and/or maintain their healthy
weight. In 2003, the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Obesity
Working Group (OWG) concluded that "Calories Count" and more
prominence to calories on the food label should be given. This action
is designed to help consumers make dietary selections that enable them
to stay within their total daily calorie allotment. The new label,
which will begin appearing on packages next year, will highlight both
calories per serving and number of servings per container.

   "We view our label as a powerful tool for education, an
opportunity to communicate with consumers every time they choose one
of our products at the store or have a Coca-Cola beverage on their
table," said Celeste Bottorff, Vice President of Living Well. "We
listen to what consumers tell us they want, respond creatively and
encourage everyone to make informed decisions about what they drink,
choices that reflect a sense of balance and moderation. It's part of
our Live Positively philosophy."

   Coca-Cola has been at the forefront of labeling initiatives for
nearly 20 years, leading the way in adding per-package nutrition
information on labels, in addition to the per-serving information that
is required by regulation. Last year, the Company began including
caffeine-content information on the labels of products with added
caffeine. The new front-of-package labeling includes information that
was always located in the Nutrition Facts panel of Coca-Cola products,
but it is now easier for consumers to see this important information
at-a-glance.

   This voluntary action is the latest example of Coca-Cola's
commitment to Live Positively, an operating philosophy that guides the
Company's service to its customers, consumers and communities. This
guiding philosophy is the basis for the Company's consumer-focused
programs, products and packaging and efforts to help the environment.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Oct 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Hedge funds are demanding more than ever from service providers -- not
just their prime brokers but their law firms, accountants and
administrators according to the results of the fourth annual Alpha
Awards(TM) Hedge Fund Service Providers survey.

    Full results in all categories are available online at www.iimagazine.com.

    For prime brokerages, unprecedented opportunity mixes with fear and
uncertainty among clients, who look for well-tested partners in a
turbulent environment. JPMorgan's franchise, especially its dominance
among long-short equity clients, remains strong, helping it hold onto its
No. 1 ranking, just ahead of Goldman Sachs at No. 2. Citi takes the No. 3
spot.

    In Accounting, Rothstein Kass &amp; Co. is the clear favorite among both small
and large hedge fund firms. Part of the reason is the firm's aggressive
move to help clients interpret Financial Accounting Standards Board
Statement No. 157, or FAS No. 157, the new accounting rule that sets more
stringent standards for valuing assets. BDO Seidman drops one place this
year to No.2. Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu, No. 3 is the highest ranked of the
Big Four firms.

    Goldman, Sachs &amp; Co. is the No. 1 Hedge Fund Administrator for a third
year in a row. Fund managers give Goldman the highest scores in Client
Service, Fund Accounting, Middle-Office Services and Technology and
Reporting. Tiny, Cayman Island-based Admiral Administration, which didn't
rank last year, grabbed the No. 2 spot. Citco Fund Services was ranked
No. 3.

    Top Onshore Law firm is Shartsis Friese. The firm ranks first in both
Client Service and Document Preparation &amp; Fund Formation. Close on its
heels is Sidley Austin, the Chicago-based firm that slips to second
overall after two years at No. 1. New York-based Seward &amp; Kissel is No. 3.

    Cayman Island-based Walkers took the No. 1 spot for Offshore Law Firms.
The number of hedge funds registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary
Association broke the 10,000 mark this summer, reaching 10,299 as of
September 30. Maples and Calder is a close second in the offshore race.
Ogier slips from the top spot it held for two years to No. 3, though the
firm still earns top honors in Document Preparation &amp; Fund Formation.

    Alpha compiled the 2008 Alpha Awards(TM) rankings of the tope hedge fund
service providers based on voting in the spring and early summer by more
than 1,000 hedge fund firms, which manage more than $1.5 trillion.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp reported better than expected quarterly profit and reduced its outlook less than many investors had feared in the face of tough economic conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While demand for its products softened near the end of the September quarter as uncertainty from financial crisis took hold, Microsoft said new releases of computer server software and database software pushed revenue higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors were prepared for the worst given the credit crisis. Investors should be pleased with Microsoft's decent first quarter and only a modest reduction in full-year 2009 guidance," said Andy Miedler, analyst at Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted a net profit of $4.37 billion, or 48 cents per diluted share, in its fiscal first quarter ended September 30 versus a profit of $4.29 billion, or 45 cents per diluted share, in the year-ago period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 9 percent to $15.06 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, were forecasting Microsoft to earn 47 cents per share on revenue of $14.8 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker said it saw technology spending deteriorate in September, with that downturn extending into October. The company expects the spending slowdown to continue until the end of its fiscal year in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're taking a more conservative stance going forward. That's clearly appropriate given all the news we see and what we see out there in the market," Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the full-year ending June 2009, Microsoft forecast earnings per share to range between $2.00 to $2.10 on revenue from $64.9 billion to $66.4 billion. Microsoft's previous estimates called for earnings per share from $2.12 to $2.18 and revenue ranging from $67.3 billion to $68.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street analysts were already forecasting earnings more conservative than the company's own previous estimates. According to Reuters Estimates, analysts, on average, forecast Microsoft to earn $2.11 per share on revenue of $66.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's no surprise that they're guiding down. Microsoft likes to set achievable goals for themselves," said Kim Caughey, a senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the December quarter, traditionally Microsoft's biggest quarter by revenue, the company forecast earnings per share to range between 51 cents and 53 cents on revenue between $17.3 billion and $17.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts were forecasting Microsoft to report earnings per share of 55 cents on revenue of $17.9 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BELT-TIGHTENING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Liddell said it plans to lower expenses by $500 million compared to its original spending plans through scaling back new hires, reducing travel and lowering marketing costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said the company plans to reduce capital expenditures this year on items such as data centers to $3.7 billion from an original estimate for $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If macroeconomic conditions worsen, we will adjust operating expenses accordingly," Liddell said on a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft executives have said in recent weeks that the company is not immune to a downturn in spending from consumers and corporate customers even as they promote the view that the company's products and markets are diverse enough to better withstand an industry downturn than its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every business unit exceeded expectations except for the Windows Vista business, which was a little bit light," said Katherine Egbert, analyst at Jefferies  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue at the Windows business rose 2 percent, while the unit's operating profit fell 4 percent due to the growing popularity of low-end laptop computers called netbooks. Microsoft sells as many copies of Windows for netbooks as for other machines, but makes less money per unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The server and tools division posted a 17 percent rise in revenue, while operating income rose 20 percent. The Office business division reported a 20 percent gain in revenue and a 23 percent surge in profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the things we look at Microsoft for is their outlook for how business are doing, and it seems as if their business-oriented division did pretty well in the quarter," said Fort Pitt Capital's Caughey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company, which announced a $40 billion share buyback plan in September, again reiterated that it plans to grow revenue faster than the broader technology industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft have fallen 19 percent since it last reported earnings on July 17. Microsoft stock closed at $22.32, up 3.7 percent, on the Nasdaq. They remained mostly unchanged in extended trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Anupreeta Das and Gabriel Madway in San Francisco, Jim Finkle in Boston; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 24 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities cut its 2009
earnings outlook for European chemical companies by an average
of 13 percent, and downgraded four stocks in the sector, citing
a significantly weaker demand in developed markets and slower
growth in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it expects a destocking cycle to magnify
volume weakness as early as third quarter of 2008, driven by an
uncertain demand outlook, sharply falling oil price and
tightening credit coupled with a need to conserve cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said while fundamental value now exists for the
sector as a recent sell off has opened up good longer-term
valuation opportunities, it expects "value to continue to take
a back seat, in favour of earnings security and visibility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage downgraded BASF BASF.DE and Lanxess
(LXSG.DE) to "neutral" from "overweight" and Akzo Nobel NV
(AKZO.AS) and DSM (DSMN.AS) to "underweight" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, it raised Syngenta (SYNN.VX) to "overweight" from
"neutral" on reassuring strong third-quarter sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The following table lists the price target changes -&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COMPANY             PRICE TARGET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;                    Current    Previous&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Syngenta            270 Sfr*    252 Sfr&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Akzo Nobel          37 euros    45 euros&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BASF                48 euros    57 euros&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DSM                 33 euros    38 euros&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lanxess             22 euros    38 euros&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Swiss francs

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's experimental pill for rheumatoid arthritis appeared to be effective and well-tolerated in a mid-stage clinical study, the drugmaker said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The drug, known as CP-690,550, achieved the main goal of 20 percent improvement (ACR 20) of symptoms after 12 weeks in patients suffering from the painful joint-swelling condition at all but one of the tested doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly more patients reached the ACR 20 goal on the medicine than did those who received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Data from the interim analysis of the 509-patient, 6-month study were to be presented next week at the American College of Rheumatology meeting in San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis is an auto-immune disease, whose cause is unknown, but leads to pain, swelling and loss of function in joints. It affects 2.1 million Americans, according to the Arthritis Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although several years away from potentially reaching the market, CP-690,550 is part of a new class of rheumatoid arthritis therapies that could be more convenient for patients who must take most current medicines by injection or infusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The medicine's development also is being closely watched by stock analysts and investors, who are concerned that Pfizer lacks sufficient drugs in its experimental pipeline to make up for expected revenue declines when its Lipitor cholesterol medicine loses U.S. patent protection in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CP-690,550 arguably is Pfizer's most important mid-stage product, JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said in a research note last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phase 2b study involved patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis who failed to respond completely to methotrexate, an older medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study had six arms for patients on various doses of CP-690,550 taken either once or twice a day, and one arm with patients on a placebo. All patients in the study continued to take methotrexate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At doses of 3 milligrams, 5 mg, 10 mg and 15 mg twice a day, and 20 mg once a day about 60 percent of patients achieved at least the ACR 20 goal compared with 38 percent in the placebo group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 1 mg dose failed to reach statistical significance compared to a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Researchers noted an onset of efficacy at as early as two weeks into treatment with the Pfizer drug. Efficacy peaked at eight weeks and was maintained at 12 weeks, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most commonly reported adverse side effects in those taking the drug were nausea, headache and increased liver enzymes. Analysts have said that the liver enzyme issue could prove to be a stumbling block on the way to approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Incidence of adverse side effects were higher at higher doses, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only five patients in the study suffered serious infection, which is a fairly common side effect of anti-inflammatory&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;biotechnology medicines for rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CP-690,550 is part of a new class of drugs known as JAK3 inhibitors that work by blocking the JAK3 enzyme, which activates white blood cells critical to the immune system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer plans next year to start a larger Phase 3 study -- the last stage of human testing before the drug can be submitted to regulators for approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The idea of a medicine that's a simple tablet, just a pill that you can take once or twice a day compared to an infusion or injection, will be very, very appealing to many doctors and patients," said Gail Cawkwell, an executive medical director at Pfizer. "But our Phase 3 studies are really needed to compare to other existing treatments and to get a sense of how the drug performs in the long term."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer to Present Data on New Approaches to Pain and Inflammation Treatment at ACR Meeting

  Results from Clinical Trials Show Promise for Innovative Therapies
   in Rheumatoid Arthritis and Osteoarthritis Pain and Fibromyalgia
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer will present data on three investigational compounds that
represent potential new mechanisms for targeting pain and
inflammation. These data will highlight tanezumab, a molecule designed
to target nerve growth factor, a key pain mediator; CP-690,550, a
JAK-inhibitor that suppresses immune-related inflammatory response;
and esreboxetine, a highly-selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor
which plays a role in controlling the activity of this important
neurotransmitter. These data will be presented at the 2008 American
College of Rheumatology Scientific Meeting in San Francisco,
California.

   "Pfizer has an established track record of bringing innovative
therapies to patients suffering with pain and inflammation," said
Martin Mackay, Ph.D., president, Pfizer Global Research and
Development. "Data to be presented at ACR confirm our clinical
approaches in developing these three compounds - CP-690,550,
esreboxetine and tanezumab - as potential new medicines to provide
relief from these serious medical conditions."

   Rheumatoid Arthritis

   Data is being presented from several clinical trials studying
CP-690,550, an oral medication that inhibits the Janus Kinase enzyme
(JAK). This enzyme plays a major role in controlling the activation
and proliferation of white blood cells, key elements of the immune
system, which play a major role in rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
CP-690,550 has shown encouraging results for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis at doses that don't appear to be associated with
excessive immune suppression.

   Investigators will present interim results from a late-breaking
Phase 2B study evaluating the activity of CP-690,550 in combination
with methotrexate, the most commonly-used RA treatment. Approximately
60 percent of patients on doses at or above 3 mg of CP-690,550
responded to treatment as compared to 37.7 percent on placebo. These
data confirm and extend the promising data seen in an earlier phase 2A
study to this longer, 12 week study, and to patients who are already
taking methotrexate to treat their rheumatoid arthritis.

   Also being presented is a pharmacokinetic drug interaction study
which showed that CP-690,550 and methotrexate can be co-administered
without dose adjustment. In addition, preliminary results from an open
label extension study will be presented.

   In these studies, the most commonly reported adverse events were
nausea, headache, dizziness, disorientation, hot flushes, urinary
tract infections, diarrhea and liver function tests.

   Larger and longer phase 3 studies are expected to start in 2009 to
help further define the benefits and risks of CP-690,550 as a
potential treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.

   According to the Arthritis Foundation, 1.3 million Americans live
with rheumatoid arthritis, a type of arthritis that can be severe,
debilitating, deforming and even shorten life.

   Osteoarthritis Pain

   Pfizer continues to research new ways of treating osteoarthritis
pain. Two studies to be presented highlight a new compound in
development and new data for Celebrex (celecoxib) in the treatment of
osteoarthritis pain.

   Results from a Phase 2 study exploring the safety and efficacy of
tanezumab, a novel biologic designed to block nerve growth factor,
show that treatment once every eight weeks may significantly decrease
pain in patients suffering from moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain
in the knee. In the trial, approximately 75 percent of patients in
both the tanezumab 100 and 200 (mu)g/kg treatment groups experienced a
50 percent reduction in knee pain as compared to 26 percent of
patients in the placebo group. In the study, the most common adverse
events associated with tanezumab include headache, upper respiratory
tract infection, paresthesia (abnormal sensations), hypoesthesia
(decreased sensations) and arthralgia (joint aches).

   Another late-breaking study evaluated continuous use of daily
Celebrex treatment over a 22-week period compared to intermittent use
of the medicine in preventing spontaneous OA flares. The study showed
that continuous use resulted in 42 percent fewer OA flare episodes
than the intermittent use. The results from the study also
demonstrated that there were no significant differences in overall
adverse events between the intermittent and continuous use groups.

   According to the Arthritis Foundation, osteoarthritis affects 27
million Americans. Recent data show that one in two Americans are at
risk for knee osteoarthritis over their lifetime. Loss of joint
function as a result of osteoarthritis is a major cause of work

   Fibromyalgia

   Pfizer is a pioneer in the study of fibromyalgia, investing many
years of research into treatment options for this complex pain
condition. In June 2007, Lyrica (pregabalin) CV became the first
FDA-approved treatment for the management of fibromyalgia. Data
supporting that approval showed Lyrica patients experienced
significant reduction in pain as early as week one in some patients.

   While widespread pain is the cornerstone of fibromyalgia, the
condition is also characterized by other hallmark symptoms such as
fatigue and difficulty concentrating.

   Data presented at ACR will highlight the results of a phase 2
proof of concept study with esreboxetine, a highly selective
norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in a fibromyalgia population.

   Data from this study showed that esreboxetine may be effective in
relieving in key fibromyalgia symptoms, including pain, function and
fatigue and was generally well tolerated. In the study, 43 percent of
patients receiving esreboxetine reported their condition was much
improved or very much improved as compared to 23 percent of
placebo-treated patients.

   The most common side effects compared to placebo were
constipation, insomnia, dry mouth, headache and nausea. The proportion
of patients who discontinued as a result of adverse events was 8.2
percent in the esreboxetine group and 2.3 percent in the placebo
treatment group.

   Fibromyalgia has been recognized by the professional community for
over 30 years as a common, chronic widespread pain condition and is
now thought to affect up to six million Americans. Recent evidence
suggests a neurological basis to fibromyalgia, as demonstrated by
brain scans and altered levels of certain neurotransmitters.

   About Pfizer's Investor Briefing at ACR

   On Tuesday, October 28 at 6:00 p.m. PCT, Pfizer will host a

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's Novel HIV/AIDS Treatment Selzentry(TM) (Maraviroc) Demonstrates Increased Efficacy Rate In Treatment-Naive HIV Patients

   Results from MERIT ES Data Reanalysis Using Enhanced Sensitivity
                       Tropism Test at 48 Weeks
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Patients taking Selzentry, in combination with Combivir(R)
(zidovudine/lamivudine) and selected by an enhanced sensitivity
tropism test to screen patients, experienced a 68 percent rate of
virologic suppression to undetectable levels, according to the MERIT
ES (Reanalysis of the MERIT Study with the Enhanced Trofile Assay)
reanalysis presented at the 48th Annual Interscience Conference on
Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC(TM))/ 46th Annual Meeting
of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in Washington
D.C., USA.

   MERIT ES is a reanalysis of 48-week efficacy and safety data from
the MERIT (Maraviroc versus Efavirenz Regimens as Initial Therapy)
study following retesting of screening samples using the newly
launched enhanced sensitivity Trofile(TM) assay. This therefore
represents a subset of the MERIT 48-week primary analysis population.
The enhanced sensitivity test was not available at the time of the
MERIT study and is the only version of Trofile currently available.

   In the MERIT ES reanalysis 68 percent of patients in the Selzentry
arm, and 68 percent of patients in the efavirenz arm - a current
standard of care - achieved suppression of the virus to undetectable
levels (less than 50 copies/ml). When the criterion of less than 400
copies/ml was used, the results were 73 percent with Selzentry, and 72
percent with efavirenz.

   "The results of MERIT ES are exciting as they show that with an
enhanced sensitivity tropism assay the efficacy rate of Selzentry
shown in MERIT with the original Trofile assay is improved further,"
said Michael Saag, Professor of Medicine and Director of the Center
for AIDS Research at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, who
presented the results. "These findings are important for patients and
physicians and offer guidance for clinical practice with the only
version of Trofile currently available."

   In the MERIT ES population, 14.2 percent of patients taking
efavirenz discontinued due to adverse events compared to 4.2 percent
of patients taking Selzentry. This was largely driven by a greater
number of cases of CNS toxicity (13 vs. 2), rash (9 vs. 0), and
tuberculosis (6 vs. 1) in the efavirenz arm versus the Selzentry arm.
In MERIT ES, there were fewer discontinuations in the Selzentry arm
due to lack of efficacy than the rate seen for the MERIT full study
population. In MERIT ES, 9.3 percent of patients taking Selzentry
discontinued due to lack of efficacy, compared to 4 percent of
patients taking efavirenz.

   The enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay is able to detect
dual/mixed or CXCR4-tropic variants of the HIV virus when they are
present in patients in greater than or equal to 0.3 percent of the
total viral population, a 30-fold improvement in sensitivity.

   About the MERIT Study

   MERIT was a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the antiretroviral
activity of Selzentry (300 mg twice daily) compared to efavirenz (600
mg once daily), a current standard of care, in combination with
Combivir (zidovudine/lamivudine) in CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infected
patients who had never received antiretroviral therapy and had no
evidence of resistance to any of the drugs used in the study.

   In MERIT, rates of virologic suppression in patients receiving
Selzentry compared to efavirenz were 70.6 percent vs. 73.1 percent for
less than 400 copies/ml and 65.3 percent vs. 69.3 percent at less than
50 copies/ml. Fewer patients experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events
in the Selzentry arm than in the efavirenz arm.

   At 48 weeks, the most common adverse events reported during the
study in both arms were nausea, headaches, diarrhea, dizziness and
fatigue. When the incidence of adverse events was adjusted for
exposure to study drug, there was a higher incidence of
nasopharyngitis and bronchitis in the Selzentry treatment group and a
higher incidence of dizziness, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory
tract infection, cough, abdominal pain, rash and abnormal dreams in
the efavirenz treatment group.

   About Selzentry

   Selzentry is referred to as Celsentri(R) in countries outside the
U.S. Discovered by Pfizer scientists in 1997, Selzentry is an oral
medicine that blocks viral entry to human cells. Rather than fighting
HIV inside white blood cells, Selzentry prevents the virus from
entering uninfected cells by blocking its predominant entry route, the
CCR5 co-receptor.

   Selzentry has been approved for use in several markets around the
world including the U.S. and European Union in combination with other
antiretroviral medicinal products, for the treatment of experienced
adult patients with only CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable.

   About Pfizer

   Founded in 1849, Pfizer is the world's largest research-based
pharmaceutical company taking new approaches to better health. We
discover, develop, manufacture and deliver quality, safe and effective
prescription medicines to treat and help prevent disease for both

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp took the wraps off a new computing service that allows companies to use its data centers to run their Web applications in a bid to become a player in the "cloud computing" trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray Ozzie, Microsoft's chief software architect, said on Monday it will start previewing "Windows Azure," a platform that allows third-party developers to host, manage, calculate and store data for applications running on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a transformation of our software. It's a transformation of our strategy," Ozzie said at the Professional Developer's Conference, Microsoft's annual gathering of third-party engineers to detail the company's future plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie, who replaced Bill Gates as Microsoft's top software guru in 2006, is spearheading the company's push into cloud computing, a trend that taps into computing power in distant data centers and delivers applications over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, software has run on a single computer's hard drive, but as Internet connections became faster and more reliable, companies started to deliver software as an online service by using the computing power of the "cloud," a network of powerful computer servers accessed over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success of Web-based companies such as Google Inc and Salesforce.com Inc in creating online applications competitive with Microsoft has forced the company to embrace a new way of delivering and supporting software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are in the early days of a transformation to services across the industry," said Ozzie at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has worked to add online services elements to most of its traditional software, which required the company to invest billions in building massive data centers with thousands of computer servers and data storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Ozzie said Azure will be profitable when it launches and will eventually generate "a lot" of revenue. He did not offer specifics and said the platform will help its online offerings built on Azure be more profitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPUTING FOR RENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Microsoft wants to let other companies rent out its computing power so third-party developers can run applications over the Internet without the need for hefty investments in data centers. It also allows companies the flexibility to increase or decrease computing needs according to demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to how its Windows operating system became the main platform for programs on personal computers, Microsoft aims to be the platform of choice for Web applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's one of these times that the battleship turns around for Microsoft," said Neil MacDonald, a vice president at research firm Gartner. "This is the direction that the industry is heading toward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc and Salesforce are already in the market with computing services for Web developers, but Microsoft has a few advantages. It has deeper pockets, longer relationships with third-party developers and more expertise in building a software platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd like to tip my hat to Jeff Bezos and Amazon," said Ozzie, referring to Amazon's chief executive. "Across the industry, all of us will stand on their shoulders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Windows Azure differs from rival cloud computing offerings because it balances the work load required to run an online service over multiple machines in various locations on its own without a need for developers to provision the program to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It allows the developer to focus purely on writing an online application versus worrying about data center failures, power outages or other potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research firm IDC expects spending on cloud computing services to grow nearly threefold to about $42 billion by 2012. Spending growth on cloud computing will also accelerate over the next few years, making up as much as 25 percent of the increase in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers can write applications on Windows Azure using the tools and programing languages necessary to write software to run on top of the current Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not announce any details on pricing, saying it would depend on the level of usage -- usually, a per-hour rate -- and the level of service required. Ozzie said Windows Azure will be priced competitively with "the marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dell Inc said Microsoft has picked its computer servers for the company's data centers running Azure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft closed down 78 cents, or 3.55 percent, to $21.18 on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Brian Moss, Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Oct 28 (Reuters) - A top Chinese copyright official
chided Microsoft for launching an "anti-piracy" tool that causes
screens of computers using counterfeit software to turn black and
said the company's prices were too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The U.S. software giant launched its "Windows Genuine
Advantage" programme last week, prompting lawsuit threats and
howls of indignation in China, where the vast majority of
computer users are believed to be using counterfeit software,
unwittingly or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; National Copyright Administration Vice-Director Yan Xiaohong
said his agency supported "the rights-safeguarding move taken by
institutions including Microsoft", Xinhua news agency quoted him
as saying in a report late on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But companies should "pay attention to the methods", Yan
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whether the 'black-out' method should be adopted is open to
question. Measures for safeguarding rights also need to be
appropriate," Yan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has defended the black-out programme as a measure
to protect its intellectual property and help customers determine
that they have legal software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dong Zhengwei, a Beijing lawyer, said Microsoft was abusing
its market power by forcing users to verify the genuineness of
their software and had filed a complaint to China's trade
watchdog, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the
China Daily said in separate report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft should be fined $1 billion," the paper quoted the
lawyer as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yan said Microsoft's price policies needed to "fit the
Chinese situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company adopted unified prices in the past without
considering the income gap between developed and developing
countries, so we need to kindly remind them that Chinese
customers' affordability should be considered," Yan said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Visa Inc (V.N) said they agreed to pay credit card issuer and network Discover Financial Services Inc (DFS.N) a total of $2.75 billion to settle a lawsuit over anti-competitive practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The payment is big enough to potentially force Visa to issue more shares, and has triggered a lawsuit by Discover's former parent, Morgan Stanley, (MS.N) which says it is entitled to $1.2 billion of the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover sued credit card networks MasterCard and Visa in 2004 for harming its business by preventing banks that issued MasterCard and Visa cards from also offering Discover cards. Discover's lawsuit was similar to one American Express Co (AXP.N) filed in 2004, which MasterCard settled for $1.8 billion in June and Visa settled for about $2.1 billion in November 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just before the Discover suit was scheduled to go to trial earlier this month, the companies agreed to settle. On Monday, the companies disclosed the size of the settlements and other terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the settlement agreement, Visa will pay $1.89 billion, the company said in a statement. MasterCard said it will pay $862.5 million. Discover had sought $6 billion in damages from the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa set aside $3 billion of proceeds from its initial public offering in March to cover some of its potential litigation expenses. With the American Express and the Discover settlements, Visa is now paying out more than $3 billion, which according to the prospectus from the company's initial public offering could spur it to issue more shares. Visa's nearly $20 billion IPO in March was the largest ever U.S. stock market debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LITIGATION AFTER THE LITIGATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discover, which was spun off from Morgan Stanley last year, has said in regulatory filings that it agreed to pay Morgan Stanley the first $700 million of proceeds it receives from a settlement, and half of any proceeds it receives above $1.5 billion, with a maximum potential payment of $1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Discover said in a statement on Monday that Morgan Stanley is in breach of the agreement, and the amount it will pay to its former parent "is a matter of dispute."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said in a statement that it is due to receive $1.2 billion pre-tax from the settlement, and "there is absolutely no basis for Discover's claim that the agreement was breached." The bank said it filed a lawsuit last week in New York state court seeking a declaratory judgment to resolve the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Discover's former parent company, will repay MasterCard $35 million and repay Visa $65 million, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with the matter said those payments were concessions Morgan Stanley made to help get the settlement done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard said it will make the payments in November and receive the payment from Morgan Stanley in the same month. MasterCard will take a net after-tax charge of $515.5 million in the third quarter of 2008, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of Visa and MasterCard's respective payments was based on their transaction processing volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Emily Chasan; Editing by Andre Grenon and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background on case, paragraph 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Oct 27 (Reuters) - A trial to determine if

companies working in the swamps and shallow waters of the Niger

Chevron by Larry Bowoto, one of the Parabe platform occupiers who
was injured by gunfire in the resulting clash in May 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those who occupied the platform say it was a peaceful protest
by unarmed villagers who accused Chevron Nigeria Ltd of polluting
their water and wanted compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which said the occupiers had demanded "ransom" and
issued threats, argues it had a duty to protect employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parabe, nine miles (14.5 km) off the coast, accounted for a
fifth of Chevron's Nigerian daily crude oil output of 400,000
barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Opening arguments are not expected to start until Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dispute fits into a broader political discussion about the
responsibilities of U.S. companies abroad. The head of a Senate
subcommittee on human rights and the law argued last month at a
hearing on corporate responsibility and natural resources that the
issue was not "black and white."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is no doubt that American oil, gas and mining companies
operating in countries with poor human rights records face
difficult challenges in protecting their employees and
operations," Sen. Richard Durbin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, when American companies choose to go into these
countries, they assume a moral and legal obligation to ensure that
security forces protecting their operations do not commit human
rights abuses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bowoto is bringing the case against San Ramon,
California-based Chevron under the Alien Tort Claims Act, a
statute that dates back to 1789 and allows foreigners to sue over
human rights abuses committed in their countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) faces a similar trial in New
York early next year on charges of human rights violations and
racketeering in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A landmark decision a decade ago found another California oil
company, Unocal Corp, could be sued in a U.S. court for its
alleged role in human rights abuses in Myanmar. Unocal settled in
2005, just weeks before agreeing to be bought by Chevron.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) expects its new "cloud computing platform, Windows Azure, to be profitable at launch, the company's top software executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is the trend by Internet powerhouses to array huge numbers of computers in centralized data centers to deliver Web-based applications to far-flung users. Windows Azure will allow companies to build Web applications using Microsoft's data centers,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft built its business selling software to run on local machines -- both computer servers and personal computers -- but in recent years, it has invested billions of dollars in massive data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an interview, Ray Ozzie, Microsoft's chief software architect, said the company's new platform to let third-party developers build, manage and store data for Web applications inside Microsoft data centers would eventually generate "a lot" of revenue albeit at a lower margin than traditional software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we do offer it as a commercial service, we will be profitable from day one," said Ozzie at the Professional Developer's Conference, Microsoft's annual gathering of third-party engineers to detail the company's future plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Azure is only available in a free, limited preview, but the company expects the platform to underpin a new wave of applications for itself and others looking to take advantage of the flexibility and cost benefits of cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will take a while before Azure will be a significant business on its own, but one of its benefits would be to boost the margins of existing Microsoft products built on the new platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie would not elaborate on any specific figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research firm IDC expects spending on cloud computing services to grow nearly three-fold to about $42 billion by 2012. Spending growth on cloud computing is also expected to accelerate over the next few years, making up as much as 25 percent of the increase in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One goal for Windows Azure, Ozzie said, is for third-party companies to make between $7 to $9 for every dollar Microsoft makes on the platform, providing the incentive for outside developers to write applications on Azure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, software has run on a single computer's hard drive, but as Internet connections became faster and more reliable, companies started to deliver software as an online service by using the computing power of the "cloud," a network of powerful computer servers accessed over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CLOUD OPERATING SYSTEM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to how its Windows operating system became the main platform for programs on personal computers, Microsoft aims to be the platform of choice for Web applications. Companies such as Amazon.com (AMZN.O), Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Salesforce.com (CRM.N) already offer a cloud computing platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now, we are still in the early adopter phase of cloud computing, but I think this one will ultimately ... be really, really big," said Ozzie, who replaced Bill Gates as Microsoft's top software guru in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Windows Azure differs from rival cloud computing offerings, because it balances the work load required to run an online service over multiple machines in various locations on its own without a need for developers to provision the program to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It allows the developer to focus purely on writing an online application versus worrying about data center failures, power outages or other potential problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, Microsoft has been a low-fixed cost and small-capital expenditure business, but the services push has changed that. In recent years, Microsoft investors have seen it spend billions to build out data centers all over the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie said the company has gotten better at ensuring the build-out of data centers do not outpace demand for services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are throttling our investments commensurate with the demand and how it grows," said Ozzie, who joined Microsoft after it bought Groove, a company he started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advantage Microsoft holds over competitors, according to Ozzie, in building a platform for cloud computing is because it is one of the few companies who have experience building operating systems for PCs and computer servers and running Web services used by hundreds of millions of users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Richard Chang, Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;McKesson Health Solutions and IBM to Deliver Business Intelligence Solutions to Health Plans

     Companies to Deploy Business Intelligence Solution to Address
  Increasing Medical Loss Ratios for Public and Private Health Plans
NEWTON, Mass, &amp; ARMONK, NY--(Business Wire)--
McKesson Health Solutions and IBM today announced they are working
together to unleash the power of business intelligence for healthcare
by creating an analytics solution for public and private health plans.
McKesson's premiere clinical content and healthcare business expertise
combined with IBM's information management software and health plan
data model will fundamentally change the way insurers use healthcare
information. The new solution will enable health plans to facilitate
smarter, faster decision-making across their businesses and externally
with health services enterprises, employers and consumers.

   As health costs continue to rise and medical loss ratios become
increasingly difficult to control, business intelligence is more
critical than ever. Yet, in today's environment, health plans rely
heavily on partial data sets to identify opportunities to improve
quality and better manage results. Without a solution to integrate the
data from disparate sources, plans are unable to turn their
disconnected data-streams into real business value.

   Together, McKesson Health Solutions and IBM are developing a
solution that will unleash the power of plan-based analytics by
addressing the data, communication and ease-of-use issues inherent in
today's environment. The relationship will bring health plans a
business intelligence solution that will quickly consolidate,
aggregate and analyze data from multiple sources and infuse it with
rich clinical content and business logic. The result will be
intelligent, actionable information that drives the consistent, timely
care and sound business decisions that health plans need today. In
addition to IBM Cognos 8 BI business intelligence software, the
solution will employ IBM's application development expertise as well
as its Health Plan Data Model, InfoSphere Information Server,
InfoSphere Warehouse, Optim, and WebSphere Application Server.

   "We're excited to be working with IBM, who brings unmatched
technology credentials, a strong commitment to healthcare, the deep
resources to execute and, most importantly, an unparalleled track
record in teaming to deliver transformational solutions," said Emad
Rizk, MD, president of McKesson Health Solutions. "Together with
McKesson's unmatched strength in clinical content and deep
understanding of the health insurance industry, we look forward to
providing groundbreaking business intelligence solutions to this
community."

   "The complexity of the decisions facing health plans today is
unprecedented and requires a central source of business intelligence
that can be used to improve medical cost ratios," said Dan Pelino, IBM

&lt;p&gt;    * Sees Windows Azure platform profitable at launch &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Expects "a lot" of revenue from Azure eventually &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Expects Azure margin to be lower than software &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Azure expected to help margins of other online offerings &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Daisuke Wakabayashi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LOS ANGELES, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) expects Windows Azure, a new "cloud computing" platform to allow companies to build Web applications using Microsoft's data centers, to be profitable at launch, the company's top software executive said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cloud computing is the trend by Internet powerhouses to array huge numbers of computers in centralized data centers to deliver Web-based applications to far-flung users. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft built its business selling software to run on local machines -- both computer servers and personal computers &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- but in recent years, it has invested billions of dollars in -- but in recent years, it has invested billions of dollars in massive data centers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In an interview, Ray Ozzie, Microsoft's chief software architect, said the company's new platform to let third-party developers to build, manage and store data for Web applications inside Microsoft data centers will eventually generate "a lot" of revenue albeit at a lower margin than traditional software. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "When we do offer it as a commercial service, we will be profitable from day one," said Ozzie at the Professional Developer's Conference, Microsoft's annual gathering of third-party engineers to detail the company's future plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Azure is only available in a free, limited preview, but the company expects the platform to underpin a new wave of applications for itself and others looking to take advantage of the flexibility and cost benefits of cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It will take a while before Azure will be a significant business on its own, but a benefit of the new platform will be in helping boost the margins and demand for existing Microsoft products built on top of Azure as they shift online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Ozzie, who replaced Bill Gates as Microsoft's top software guru in 2006, is spearheading the company's push into cloud computing. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Traditionally, software has run on a single computer's hard drive, but as Internet connections became faster and more reliable, companies started to deliver software as an online service by using the computing power of the "cloud," a network of powerful computer servers accessed over the Web. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Similar to how its Windows operating system became the main platform for programs on personal computers, Microsoft aims to be the platform of choice for Web applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Right now, we are still in the early adopter phase of cloud computing, but I think this one will ultimately ... be really, really big," said Ozzie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Richard Chang) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((daisuke.wakabayashi@thomsonreuters.com; +1 206 674 3531; Reuters Messaging: daisuke.wakabayashi.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: MICROSOFT/OZZIE  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2008.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Bill Gates and other Microsoft Corp officials stepped up lobbying of top U.S. communications regulators on Monday, ahead of an important vote next week to open up unused wireless airwaves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Federal Communications Commission has scheduled a November 4 vote on a plan to allow unlicensed use of parts of the airwaves called "white spaces." These pockets of the spectrum will become available when U.S. broadcasters are required to move completely to digital television next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft co-founder Gates planned to speak to Republican Commissioner Robert McDowell later on Monday, according to Microsoft chief strategist Craig Mundie, who was also in Washington for a lobbying trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People seem to be generally favorable" of the FCC proposal, Mundie said of his discussions with regulators. Mundie, who spoke to reporters at a briefing, met on Monday morning with Democratic Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC, made up of three Republicans and two Democrats, will vote on the white spaces proposal drawn up by Republican commission chairman Kevin Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The issue pits traditional broadcasters such as Walt Disney Inc's ABC, CBS Corp's CBS and General Electric's NBC against high-tech companies like Microsoft and Google Inc, which want the airwaves for new wireless devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the broadcasters said the technology threatens "the viability of clear television reception."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadcasters want the proposal to go out for public comment, and last week accused its supporters of trying to take broadcast television off the air completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wireless microphone users are also concerned the move could cause interference during performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Country music icon Dolly Parton wrote to the FCC asking for more time for the industry to review it. "The importance of clear, consistent wireless microphone technology cannot be overstated," Parton wrote in a letter released on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC has received thousands of public comments on the issue over the past few years and intends to go forward with the vote next Tuesday, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've had over a year and a half of testing and building on the public record," Martin spokesman Rob Kenny said, citing the agency's technical report, which he said proved "white spaces can be used commercially, unlicensed and it can be done without causing harmful interference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FCC report analyzed two rounds of testing on prototype devices, and cleared the technology to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House of Representatives House Energy and Commerce Committee, sent a list of questions to Martin. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat, demanded that Martin respond by October 31 on whether an FCC engineering report was peer reviewed, and how the agency will deal with interference from broadcast signals if it occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mundie said Dingell's letter and the latest request by broadcasters is in "no way indicative of a problem going forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Frank McGurty)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Oct 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM Information on Demand Conference -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced
the expansion of its Integrated Data Management (IDM) software initiative
with new offerings from the Optim(TM) portfolio, to help organizations
manage application data with greater consistency across the enterprise.
IBM's IOD strategy focuses on helping companies unlock the business value
to gain competitive advantage.

    With IBM Optim, companies can manage data seamlessly across each phase of
the lifecycle, from requirements to retirement, to align with their
business goals. Building upon a foundation of shared information, teams
can develop and deploy enterprise-ready applications faster, with better
performance, while mitigating governance risks.

    "Organizations today rely on complex, heterogeneous IT infrastructures to
execute their business processes, from shipping a sales order to posting a
payment," notes Arvind Krishna, vice president, IBM Data Management. "IBM
Optim expands on our Information on Demand strategy, providing an open,
integrated environment for customers to manage the data across related
applications, databases and platforms, from design through sunset. Our
clients can reduce cost and complexity through automation, collaboration
and improved productivity."

    Leading companies are proactively implementing IBM Optim software to
protect data privacy, a key governance concern. Colgate Palmolive, a
leading global consumer products company, focused on oral care, personal
care, home care and pet nutrition, chose the Optim Data Privacy Solution
for SAP applications to guard its critical human resources data.

    "Good governance is the foundation of everything we do at Colgate," said
Jim Capraro, Director of Global Information Technology at
Colgate-Palmolive. "Therefore it makes sense that we would look for a way
to help us to automate our existing manual processes that protect personal
data for our employees around the world. The Optim Data Privacy Solution
offers application-aware data masking for our SAP system -- creating a
safe environment for development and testing activities."

    A recent commissioned study conducted by Forrester Consulting on behalf of
IBM describes the state of a comprehensive data management strategy in
organizations today, with a clear call to action: "These issues call for a
more comprehensive, coordinated and planful approach to the full data
lifecycle: design, develop, deploy, operate, and archive or retire. Like
other maturing aspects of IT, a more effective, end-to-end data management
regime will be more efficient, more agile, less risky, and less costly.
Enterprises need to take a closer look at their data management strategy
and plan to drive improvements into this neglected corner of their
organizations."

    With more than 10 new offerings to be delivered in Q4, IBM is again
extending its data management market leadership. IBM launched the
industry's first Integrated Data Management software offering, Data
Studio, a year ago. Since then, the IBM Optim portfolio of multi-platform
data management products has been added to the Information on Demand
portfolio following the acquisition of Princeton Softech.

    The following integrated data management products are planned for delivery
in 2008:


Optim Change Manager 1.2 (formerly Data Studio Administrator)
Optim Data Relationship Analyzer 1.1
Optim Data Privacy Solution 1.2
Optim Data Privacy Solution for SAP Applications 1.1
Optim Data Privacy Solution, PCI Module 1.2

&lt;p&gt; (Adds FCC official, broadcasters, Dolly Parton comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Kim Dixon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Oct 27 (Reuters) - Bill Gates and other
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) officials stepped up lobbying of top
U.S. communications regulators on Monday, ahead of an important
vote next week to open up unused wireless airwaves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Federal Communications Commission has scheduled a Nov.
4 vote on a plan to allow unlicensed use of parts of the
airwaves called "white spaces." These pockets of the spectrum
will become available when U.S. broadcasters are required to
move completely to digital television next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft co-founder Gates planned to speak to Republican
Commissioner Robert McDowell later on Monday, according to
Microsoft chief strategist Craig Mundie, who was also in
Washington for a lobbying trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People seem to be generally favorable" of the FCC
proposal, Mundie said of his discussions with regulators.
Mundie, who spoke to reporters at a briefing, met on Monday
morning with Democratic Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCC, made up of three Republicans and two Democrats,
will vote on the white spaces proposal drawn up by Republican
commission chairman Kevin Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The issue pits traditional broadcasters such as Walt Disney
Inc's (DIS.N) ABC, CBS Corp's (CBS.N) CBS and General
Electric's (GE.N) NBC against high-tech companies like
Microsoft and Google Inc (GOOG.O), which want the airwaves for
new wireless devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for the broadcasters said the technology
threatens "the viability of clear television reception."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broadcasters want the proposal to go out for public
comment, and last week accused its supporters of trying to take
broadcast television off the air completely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wireless microphone users are also concerned the move could
cause interference during performances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Country music icon Dolly Parton wrote to the FCC asking for
more time for the industry to review it. "The importance of
clear, consistent wireless microphone technology cannot be
overstated," Parton wrote in a letter released on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCC has received thousands of public comments on the
issue over the past few years and intends to go forward with
the vote next Tuesday, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've had over a year and a half of testing and building
on the public record," Martin spokesman Rob Kenny said, citing
the agency's technical report, which he said proved "white
spaces can be used commercially, unlicensed and it can be done
without causing harmful interference."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCC report analyzed two rounds of testing on prototype
devices, and cleared the technology to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House of
Representatives House Energy and Commerce Committee, sent a
list of questions to Martin. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat,
demanded that Martin respond by Oct. 31 on whether an FCC
engineering report was peer reviewed, and how the agency will
deal with interference from broadcast signals if it occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mundie said Dingell's letter and the latest request by
broadcasters is in "no way indicative of a problem going
forward."

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Oct 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM Information on Demand Conference -- Today IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced
enhancements to its InfoSphere software portfolio, a unified platform for
delivering timely and accurate information on demand to the people,
processes and applications that rely on it. The company is introducing
new software for the rapid advancement of master data management
projects, software to improve data integration, tighter integration with
Cognos, and tools to help establish an information agenda.

    "Having access to trusted information is imperative for the world's
leading retailers and consumer good manufacturers," said Bill Le Clair Sr.
Director, DemandTec. "Working with InfoSphere software, we are able to
provide our customers unprecedented access to timely, valid information to
help them understand consumer buying behavior, make better merchandising
and marketing decisions, and to navigate both future and past pricing
decisions."

    Speeding Master Data Management Initiatives

    IBM is offering new functionality within InfoSphere Master Data
Management Server to help customers reap a return on their master data
management investments more quickly. Master data is the information upon
which organizations' operations and critical business decisions are based.
Many businesses struggle with data that is distributed across multiple
front and back-office systems and cannot be shared enterprise-wide. This
problem, which costs businesses millions of dollars in missed revenues and
operational inefficiencies, is driving companies to seek more flexibility
in how they maintain and use master data as a means of competing and
capitalizing on emerging business opportunities.

    To address this challenge, IBM offers software that supports the variety
of ways in which businesses define, create, and use master data in their
daily operations. Earlier this year, the company introduced InfoSphere MDM
Server, the first product to provide out-of-the-box capabilities for
managing master data on customers, products, accounts, suppliers,
citizens, employees, prospects, guests, agents, items, product bundles,
parts, agreements, and more.

    The new functionality combines InfoSphere MDM Server with key components
of IBM InfoSphere Information Server, which provide pre-defined data
integration and cleansing logic to allow organizations to match and
combine data from heterogeneous systems into a single high-quality view
that can be managed within InfoSphere MDM Server. The package allows
organizations to get an operational master data management solution up
and running within a dramatically reduced timeframe, at a fraction of the
price of alternative approaches.

    Expanded Data Integration Capabilities

    A new version of IBM InfoSphere Information Server extends the
capabilities of the product's DataStage module, helping companies to
integrate and sort through massive amounts of information stored in
databases.

    Balanced optimization allows customers to harness the power of their
existing investments in high performance database systems, with no changes
in the design of integration jobs. It works by selectively pushing
processing down to the database engine based on optimization algorithms
and design preferences, boosting information integration performance and
delivering information to end users as quickly as possible.

    Closer Integration with Cognos

    The IBM InfoSphere portfolio has been more tightly aligned with the Cognos
8 platform to provide improved confidence in the information driving
performance management. For example, the recently announced Cognos 8
Business Viewpoint helps organizations maintain, govern and share
dimensions and hierarchies used in decision-making process across business
intelligence (BI) and performance management. Business Viewpoint can be
deployed as part of a broader master data management initiative with
InfoSphere MDM Server so performance management is aligned with the
operational master data.

    The InfoSphere Warehouse 9.5 now provides customers with the ability to
synchronize data in the warehouse with business intelligence applications
or desktop software such as Microsoft Excel. As a result, the product
delivers more intelligence more rapidly to more users, as well as tighter
integration with IBM Cognos 8 BI. The InfoSphere Balanced Warehouse C3000
and C4000 now include Cognos 8 BI, providing a valuable and cost-effective
solution for small and midsized companies, who need to ensure that their
data warehousing capabilities can be easily expanded as their businesses
grow.

    In addition, IBM InfoSphere Foundation Tools provide metrics on
conformance, validity and completeness of information as a data source to
Cognos 8 BI. This enables business users to gain insight into the quality
of data alongside their regular BI reports. Business users also gain
immediate access to shared business glossary and end-to-end data lineage
provided by InfoSphere Foundation Tools from within Cognos 8 BI with the
click of a mouse. Rational Data Architect is now integrated with
InfoSphere Information Server, InfoSphere Warehouse, Industry Models and
Cognos 8 BI so models can be reused to simplify the lifecycle deployment
of projects from design and development to deployment.

    New purchasing options for the InfoSphere Foundation Tools and the entire
InfoSphere portfolio are now available. The InfoSphere "Flex" Offering
allows customers to make purchase decisions early with the flexibility to
grow, change and adjust their product selection across the portfolio as
project needs evolve.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details of Windows Azure, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Oct 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
took the wraps off a new computing service that allows
companies to use its data centers to run their Web applications
in a bid to become a player in the so-called "cloud computing"
trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ray Ozzie, Microsoft's chief software architect, said on
Monday it will start previewing "Windows Azure," a platform
that allows third-party developers to host, manage, calculate
and store data for applications running on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a transformation of our software. It's a
transformation of our strategy," Ozzie said at the Professional
Developer's Conference, Microsoft's annual gathering of
third-party engineers to detail the company's future plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ozzie, who replaced Bill Gates as Microsoft's top software
guru in 2006, is spearheading the company's push into "cloud
computing," a trend that taps into computing power in distant
data centers and delivers applications over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traditionally, software has run on a single computer's hard
drive, but as Internet connections became faster and more
reliable, companies started to deliver software as an online
service by using the computing power of the "cloud," a network
of powerful computer servers accessed over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The success of Web-based companies such as Google Inc
(GOOG.O) and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) in creating online
applications competitive with Microsoft has forced the company
to embrace a new way of delivering and supporting software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in the early days of a transformation to services
across the industry," said Ozzie at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has worked to add online services elements to
most of its traditional software, which required the company to
invest billions in building massive data centers with thousands
of computer servers and data storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COMPUTING FOR RENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now, Microsoft wants to let other companies rent out its
computing power so third-party developers can run applications
over the Internet without the need for hefty investments in
data centers. It also allows companies the flexibility to
increase or decrease computing needs according to demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similar to how its Windows operating system became the main
platform for programs on personal computers, Microsoft aims to
be the platform of choice for Web applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's one of these times that the battleship turns around
for Microsoft," said Neil MacDonald, a vice president at
research firm Gartner. "This is the direction that the industry
is heading toward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amazon.com Inc (AMZN.O) and Salesforce are already in the
market with computing services for Web developers, but
Microsoft has a few advantages. It has deeper pockets, longer
relationships with third-party developers and more expertise in
building a software platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'd like to tip my hat to Jeff Bezos and Amazon," said
Ozzie, referring to Amazon's chief executive. "Across the
industry, all of us will stand on their shoulders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Research firm IDC expects spending on "cloud" computing
services to grow nearly three-fold to about $42 billion by
2012. Spending growth on cloud computing will also accelerate
over the next few years, making up as much as 25 percent of the
increase in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Developers can write applications on Windows Azure using
the tools and programming languages necessary to write software
to run on top of the current Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ozzie also said Azure will allow companies to deliver
applications over the Web, on mobile phones and on PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft did not announce any details on pricing, saying
it would depend on the level of usage -- usually, a per-hour
rate -- and the level of service required. Ozzie said Windows
Azure will be priced competitively with "the marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gartner's MacDonald said he was uncertain how this would
affect Microsoft's business model or profit margins, saying
this puts the company in the unfamiliar role of managing a
large amount of fixed costs from building out data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft fell 75 cents, or 3.4 percent, to
$21.21 in midday Nasdaq trading.

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO (Reuters) - Software giant Microsoft Corp has matched a reward being offered in the search for a missing Canadian teenager who ran away from home after his parents took away his Xbox 360 video game console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which makes the Xbox 360, said it would match the existing reward of C$25,000 ($19,400) for information leading to Brandon Crisp's return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like everyone, we are deeply worried about the disappearance of Brandon Crisp," the company said in an email. "Law enforcement has contacted Microsoft about this matter and we are co-operating fully with them. We are unable to comment further on the nature of our co-operation because of the ongoing investigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 15-year-old has been missing since October 13. He ran away from his home in Barrie, Ontario, north of Toronto, after his parents took away his gaming privileges because of his excessive playing of "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game is a wartime shooting simulator that gives players a first-person perspective. It also lets players connect over Microsoft's Xbox Live online service and compete against one another, either in teams or individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is possible that police will ask or have already asked Microsoft to divulge the list of players with whom Brandon Crisp has played recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police and volunteers have been scouring the area around Barrie, a small lakeside city about a one-hour drive from Toronto, but so far have been unable to find the boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As online gaming has exploded in popularity since the start of the decade, academics and parents have raised concerns over the possibility of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, the American Medical Association said more research was necessary on the potential of addiction to video games. It urged parents to closely monitor their children's use of games and the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Web sites such as www.wowdetox.com, a sounding board for those addicted to or trying to quit the popular "World of Warcraft" online game, have sprung up as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=$1.29 Canadian)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Wojtek Dabrowski; editing by Rob Wilson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Oct 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM Information on Demand Conference -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced
new Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solutions that are designed to
help organizations achieve greater business agility and workplace
effectiveness. Recognizing the need for more nimble, adaptable
technology, IBM's agile ECM portfolio provides improved flexibility to
help business users respond faster to changing business requirements. The
new solutions will allow customers to optimize content-based operational
and compliance processes.

    Unifying content, process and compliance capabilities in a new composite
application framework, IBM's agile ECM enables clients to quickly solve
increasingly complex business problems. Using a flexible,
services-oriented environment, clients can now deploy solution
applications within days instead of months. With this new offering, IBM
is helping clients accelerate time-to-value, improving end-user
accessibility and allowing business professionals to optimize their
content-based processes.

    Further, IBM's agile ECM portfolio helps clients realize IBM's Information
On Demand vision. It makes it easier for business users to connect content
in the context of their business processes and leverage that information
to facilitate business optimization.

    "Organizations need information to innovate and optimize their businesses,
but many struggle with how to manage all the information that they have,"
said Ken Bisconti, vice president, products and strategy, IBM Enterprise
Content Management. "IBM's focus on agility with ECM software helps
clients address many important challenges, such as how to globally
integrate solutions with immense volumes of information and optimize
their processes while managing regulatory requirements."

    For example, construction field personnel have frequent interaction with
multiple contractors, inspecting their work and documenting their progress
on various projects. Many documents are necessary for the accurate record
keeping and reporting of all construction activity. Information captured
on paper forms, which are then filed in a project book or transcribed
into an online data storage system, can be flawed by delays in data
entry, damaged paper forms and errors during transcription. With an
agile, end-to-end ECM business process, these documents can be digitally
authored and managed and contextual information, such as maps and
equipment inventory, can now be electronically delivered to the
contractors in the field instantly, improving speed, reducing errors as
well as reducing overall project costs.

    IBM Agile ECM Software Portfolio

    The volume of information, the number of different information types and
the multi-channel communications world an organization deals with continue
to grow dramatically. With globalization and changing market conditions,
organizations need to access information instantly. Utilizing an IBM
service-oriented architecture (SOA) approach, IBM's agile ECM portfolio is
designed to address these growing market needs.

    Key enhancements in IBM ECM portfolio include:

    IBM FileNet P8 4.5 is a unified ECM platform that combines content with
Business Process Management (BPM) and compliance capabilities. FileNet P8
4.5 has been significantly enhanced across all of its core modules.
Highlights include:

    IBM FileNet Business Process Manager 4.5 is a comprehensive,
enterprise-class offering for managing content-centric business
processes. It supports business user-oriented and standards-based process
modeling and simulation, promotes business user and IT collaboration, and
provides tools for agile ECM application development, utilizing Smart SOA
and Web 2.0 technologies such as mashups. This new offering enables users
to launch FileNet BPM processes for content in multiple repositories
including IBM Content Manager 8 (CM8). This seamless integration to IBM
CM8 allows a FileNet BPM process to make changes to IBM CM8 content thru
IBM CM8-specific content operations. 
 
 IBM FileNet Content Manager 4.5
is designed to provide clients with a scalable, single content catalog
that embeds IBM's content-centric BPM and compliance capabilities into an
ECM platform operating on content in multiple repositories. The enhanced
FileNet Content Manager enables intuitive integration with Lotus Quickr,
Microsoft Office 2007, and Microsoft SharePoint, allowing users choice
while interacting with and benefiting from ECM capabilities. FileNet
Content Manager has also implemented a component-based content model
leveraging the DITA XML standard, now broadly adopted in the industry for
advanced document management applications. DITA supports agility through
the reuse of document components in support of diverse authoring and
publishing requirements. 
 
 IBM Content Manager 8.4.1 manages all types
of digitized content across multiple platforms, databases and
applications. The new offering provides active content capabilities which
allow content in CM8 to participate in IBM FileNet BPM 4.5 processes.
Additionally CM8.4.1 has been enhanced to support collaborative content
management through integration with Lotus Quickr and includes new Web
Interface (WEBi) enhancements that support Web 2.0 style interaction. 
 

IBM Content Manager on Demand (CMOD) 8.4.1 provides advanced enterprise
report management. The latest CMOD offering includes integration to IBM
FileNet P8 for federated Records Management and BPM applications.

    In addition, the new IBM ECM products use the same technology as IBM's
recently released compliance and discovery offerings:

    The IBM Content Collection and Archiving family is based on a modular,
extensible architecture that helps enable organizations to take back
control and unlock business value of content, while enforcing compliance
and operational policies. 
 
 IBM's records management offerings are a
prescriptive set of deployment and management practices, tools and best
practices to eliminate deployment complexity, mitigate risks associated
with lack of best practices and industry skill and knowledge shortages.  


 IBM's eDiscovery products help clients take the cost out of electronic
discovery management. The offerings provide an integrated, in-house
approach that helps control stored information and litigation response
across the enterprise. 
 
 IBM FileNet P8 integration with IBM Content
Analyzer enables organizations to increase the return on their enterprise
content investment by analyzing unstructured content together with
structured data to gain valuable, even business-changing insight from all
information.

    IBM also announced that it has extended the IBM Lotus Quickr collaboration
software line to include IBM ECM Services for Lotus Quickr, further
helping businesses of all sizes manage, share and collaborate on important
information. Available in December, IBM Lotus Quickr version 8.1.1 will be
the first software of its kind to integrate with documents, spreadsheets
and other files that reside in IBM enterprise content management systems.
This new integration between IBM Lotus Quickr and IBM's ECM offerings will
allow Lotus Quickr 8.1.1 and IBM ECM users -- both IBM FileNet P8 and IBM
Content Manager 8 users -- to collaborate on business content via Quickr
while leveraging IBM's comprehensive enterprise content management
infrastructure.

    This technology advancement will allow employees to access enterprise
content and programs so it can be easily accessed across the organization.
This content includes every day business applications like e-mail,
presentations and spreadsheets and complicated records management and
business process management programs.

    The new software will allow organization with a variety of IT applications
to standardize on Lotus Quickr for team collaboration and social
networking needs without the hassle of complex data migration.

    IBM is the only company with an integrated portfolio that spans from team
collaboration and basic content services to advanced enterprise content
management.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Oct 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM Information on Demand Conference -- Today IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced
IBM solidDB Universal Cache, relational, in-memory database technology
that accelerates not only IBM's relational databases, but also other
industry-leading databases.

    An industry first, solidDB Universal Cache relies on relational, in-memory
database software to accelerate IBM's own DB2 and Informix Dynamic Server,
Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle and Sybase, increasing their performance up
to ten times. When storing performance-critical data from one of the
supported disk-based databases into solidDB's in-memory cache,
applications can access data with extreme speed because it is always kept
in the computer's RAM rather than on disk. With solidDB Universal Cache,
both existing and new applications can now generate data workloads of
more than 120,000 transactions per second and safely rely on predictable
response times measured in microseconds to support growing numbers of
users and data volumes allowing companies to quickly unlock the business
value of their data which is what Information on Demand is all about.

    solidDB Universal Cache integrates with relational, disk-based databases
to accelerate access to their data. This acceleration can be particularly
valuable for performance-critical data frequently accessed by many
concurrent users, typical of applications such as ticketing and
reservation systems, e-commerce applications, event processing and
alerting, online gaming, and software as a service (SaaS) application
platforms. Additionally, data from leading disk-based, relational
databases can be cached into solidDB Universal Cache to help support peak
workloads experienced by such applications as customer service and stock
trading.

    Performance is enhanced even further because solidDB Universal Cache can
be co-located and linked with the application. This avoids network
latency and the overhead of inter-process communication, as well as
context switching in the operating system, further contributing to
extreme speed.

    "In January, we acquired Solid Information Technology, and shortly
thereafter, released solidDB Cache for DB2 and Informix Dynamic Server.
Today, we are announcing that the extreme speed capabilities of solidDB
will be available to an even larger number of businesses, allowing them to
process their growing data volumes faster than ever before," said Arvind
Krishna, vice president, IBM Data Management. "solidDB Universal Cache is
the industry's first database caching technology that complements our
competitor's databases as well as our own, and helps all businesses
process data in real time while leveraging their existing database
investments."

    IBM solidDB 6.3 Universal Cache will be generally available in December
2008 with support for DB2, IDS, Oracle and Sybase. Support for Microsoft
SQL Server will follow in Q1 2009.

move completely to digital television next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft founder Gates planned to speak to Republican
Commissioner Robert McDowell later on Monday, according to
Microsoft chief strategist Craig Mundie, also in Washington for
a lobbying trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People seem to be generally favorable," of the FCC
proposal, Mundie said of his discussions with regulators.
Mundie, who spoke to reporters at a briefing, met on Monday
morning with Democratic Commissioner Jonathan Adelstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCC, made up of three Republicans and two Democrats,
will vote on the white spaces proposal drawn up by Republican
chairman Kevin Martin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The issue pits traditional broadcasters such as Walt Disney
(DIS.N)'s ABC, CBS Corp (CBS.N) and General Electric (GE.N)'s
NBC against high tech companies like Microsoft and Google
Inc.(GOOG.O), which want the airwaves for a new generation of
wireless devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An FCC engineering report analyzing results of two rounds
of testing of prototype devices cleared the technology to move
forward. Broadcasters want the proposal to go out for public
comment, and last week accused its supporters of trying to take
broadcast television off the air.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday, Rep. John Dingell, chairman of the House of
Representatives House Energy and Commerce Committee, sent a
list of questions to Martin. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat,
demanded that Martin respond by Oct. 31 on whether an FCC
engineering report was peer reviewed, and how the agency will
deal with interference from broadcast signals if it occurs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mundie said Dingell's letter and the latest request by
broadcasters is in "no way indicative of a problem going
forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Frank McGurty)

   Epicor and Microsoft share a complementary vision for cloud
computing and building applications that seamlessly bridge the gaps
between PC, Web and phone. Epicor recently announced its
next-generation enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution Epicor 9 -
expected to be generally available before the end of the year - which
will virtually put "ERP everywhere," utilizing Web 2.0 concepts to
provide users with a truly collaborative and dynamic enterprise
business application experience.

   "Epicor continues to be a leader in adoption of forward-looking
technologies from Microsoft," said Robert Wahbe, Corporate Vice
President, Connected Systems Division at Microsoft. "Taking advantage
of our cloud computing initiative is the next logical step in the
evolution of Epicor's service-oriented business applications -
creating new business benefits and lower cost of ownership, which
equates to increased value of these solutions for customers."

   Cloud Computing - Epicor Enterprise Search

that combine innovative Web 2.0 concepts, such as Enterprise Search,
presence and real-time communication with business acumen.

   "As an enterprise software solution provider, we are challenged to
continuously increase the value of our solutions to our customers --
widening the spread between the benefit and cost of ownership," said
Erik Johnson, senior director of development at Epicor. "Azure
Services Platform will be a game changer for cloud platforms - it
incorporates Microsoft's .NET Framework which means Epicor can
leverage our existing skills and code libraries. Azure will also
include new storage, identity, and data geo-affinity features that are
crucial for deploying commercial enterprise applications in the
cloud."

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Oct 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM INFORMATION ON DEMAND -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today launched new software
and services to help customers put information at the center of their
organizations to outperform competitors. These offerings aim to help
customers build an Information Agenda and provide trusted information as
a strategic asset for making smarter business decisions.

    The new offerings help provide information on demand and address three
critical business needs: innovating by creating new intelligence to
identify business opportunities; improving efficiency; and making better
use of information for improved decision making to outmaneuver
competitors.

    As part of today's announcement, IBM is launching new software and
services to help customers develop a strategy for using their information
more effectively -- by creating an "information agenda" for their
businesses.

    New Solutions and Services to Create an Industry-Specific Information
Agenda

    Last month, IBM announced industry-specific technologies and services to
help customers develop an Information Agenda. In less than two months,
more than 100 IBM customers are already actively engaged in Information
Agenda workshops, deploying new software tools and working with IBM
consultants to develop a strategy to better use their business
information.

    Industry-Specific and Financial Management Solutions -- IBM is introducing
seven industry-specific and financial management solutions to help
customers develop performance management capabilities in the areas of
finance, pharmaceuticals, internal controls, sales and operations
planning, municipal scorecarding and business reporting. Built on
technology derived from IBM's acquisition of Cognos, these solutions
reflect IBM's strategy of delivering industry-specific solutions for its
clients.

    New Information on Demand Competency Center Services -- IBM is also
offering comprehensive consulting services focused on analytics software
to help customers organize internally for success to create and execute on
their Information Agenda by bringing together people, process and
technology offerings. These services will help customers design, implement
and operate a Competency Center in their own organization, whether it is a
structured or virtual team, to help drive better business outcomes.

    IBM Global Business Services is introducing four new service offerings.
These new industry solutions have been developed to address key
information-related business issues including enterprise risk management,
customer analytics, data quality and integration, operational intelligence
and performance management. IBM Global Delivery Centers will also now
provide application development and maintenance services to help customers
support their Information on Demand strategies in key growth markets.

    IBM Global Technology Services is also providing technology to help
clients move forward with their Information Agenda with confidence by
ensuring their infrastructure can accommodate workload increases.
Launched today, the new IBM Archive Reference Architecture allows
customers to build an archive environment that meets corporate information
management requirements while ensuring cost efficient, predictable
scalability. Additionally, IBM storage virtualization provides a
performance boost with no modification to existing storage systems.
Scale-out File Services leverages supercomputer technology to deliver a
simple, high performance NAS solution that can scale to store every
electronic file ever created.

    Open Tools With Flexible Purchasing to Create an Information Agenda -- IBM
is unveiling new purchasing options for its recently announced IBM
InfoSphere Foundation Tools, and the entire InfoSphere portfolio, to
support multiple projects as part of an Information Agenda, enabling the
delivery and management of trusted information. This InfoSphere "Flex"
Offering allows customers to make purchase decisions early with the
flexibility to grow, change and adjust their product selection across the
portfolio as project needs evolve. InfoSphere Foundation Tools help
businesses identify which information is important; develop a plan for
pulling it together to make it more useful to the people and applications
that need it; and then define the governance and processes that are needed
to put an information management plan into action.

    "Many organizations still take a vague approach to decision-making," said
Tom Davenport, a leading author and professor at Babson College. "They
often make a significant number of decisions, both large and small, in the
dark. With improved access to trusted information, organizations are now
generating greater insights and creating new intelligence that is helping
them make quicker and smarter decisions."

    As software becomes smarter and more predictive, putting information at
the center of business processes will allow companies to easily analyze
it and enable a new level of decision-making.

    New Tracking Technology

    IBM is launching a new item tracking application called InfoSphere
Traceability Server. The new software helps businesses comply with
emerging standards and enables them to use smart tracking to address
issues such as counterfeiting, diversion of valuable items, making the
food supply safer and boosting product availability in retail stores. It
helps companies become more competitive through improved insights, better
visibility and automated intelligence provided by Cognos dashboards,
analytics, reporting and alerts.

    In the pharmaceutical industry, manufacturers and distributors use the
software to comply with emerging drug pedigree regulations. For example,
distributor AmerisourceBergen uses it to improve business processes and
ensure that it can comply with future regulations for drug pedigrees.

    "AmerisourceBergen is helping define a new electronic communication system
to provide an even higher level of high quality, safe products and
services to our customers in the pharmaceutical industry," said Shay
Reid, vice president of operations, AmerisourceBergen. "Our focus demands
that trusted information flows across the entire supply chain. Our work
with IBM industry experts and IBM software products is helping to
accelerate the delivery of our vision of a connected pharmaceutical
supply chain."

    With the industry's broadest portfolio for managing and accessing all
types of information, IBM is working with more than 10,000 new customers
and 2,000 business partners using its Information on Demand portfolio.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp took the wraps off a new computing service that allows companies to use its data centers to run their Web applications in a bid to become a player in the so-called "cloud computing" trend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray Ozzie, Microsoft's chief software architect, said on Monday it will start previewing "Windows Azure," a platform that allows third-party Web developers to host, manage, calculate and store data for applications running on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a transformation of our software. It's a transformation of our strategy," Ozzie said at the Professional Developer's Conference, Microsoft's annual gathering of third-party engineers to detail the company's future plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie, who replaced Bill Gates as Microsoft's top software guru in 2006, is spearheading the company's push into "cloud computing," a trend that taps into computing power in distant data centers and delivers applications over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, software has run on a single computer's hard drive, but as Internet connections became faster and more reliable, companies started to deliver software as an online service by using the computing power of the "cloud," a network of powerful computer servers accessed over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The success of Web-based companies such as Google Inc and Salesforce.com Inc in creating online applications competitive with Microsoft has forced the company to embrace a new way of delivering and supporting software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"TRANSFORMATION"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are in the early days of a transformation to services across the industry," said Ozzie at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has worked to add online services elements to most of its traditional software, which required the company to invest billions in building massive data centers with thousands of computers servers and data storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Microsoft wants to let other companies rent out its computing power so third-party developers can run applications over the Internet without the need for hefty investments in data centers. It also allows companies the flexibility to increase or decrease computing needs according to demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similar to how its Windows operating system became the main platform for programs on personal computers, Microsoft aims to be the platform of choice for Web applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amazon.com Inc and Salesforce is already in the market with computing services for Web developers, but Microsoft has a few advantages. It has deeper pockets, longer relationships with third-party developers and more expertise in building a software platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd like to tip my hat to Jeff Bezos and Amazon," said Ozzie, referring to Amazon's chief executive. "All of us across the industry will stand on their shoulders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Developers can write applications on Windows Azure using the tools and programing languages necessary to write software to run on top of the current Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell 75 cents, or 3.4 percent, to $21.21 in midday Nasdaq trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Brian Moss)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows Azure Gives PolicyPortal Customer Scalability across the
                               Internet
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
FullArmor, a leader in enterprise policy management, today
announced that PolicyPortal, a web based end-to-end policy and
compliance management solution, has been updated for Windows Azure,
Microsoft Corp.'s cloud platform. PolicyPortal with Windows Azure
provides a scalable, secure solution for laptop and desktop management
across the internet.

   From a web based Silverlight console, PolicyPortal provides IT
administrators the ability to secure and manage remote PCs. This new
version expands the scope of management beyond Group Policy settings
to include delivery of virtual applications via Microsoft's App-V,
documents, and PowerShell script enforcement.

   "Our goal with PolicyPortal is to help customers reduce the cost
of managing their endpoints," said Danny Kim, CTO of FullArmor.
"PolicyPortal with Windows Azure provides increased scalability so
that we can deliver end-to-end policy management to more users through
the cloud."

   The Ethiopian government is deploying PolicyPortal along with new
laptops to all 250,000 teachers in Ethiopia. They need to deploy,
secure, and manage these machines throughout the country however they
do not have a centralized, scalable data center. PolicyPortal with
Windows Azure is an ideal solution. PolicyPortal enables the
deployment of custom teacher applications through the cloud using
Microsoft's App-V and secures them using Group Policy.

   "Microsoft's Windows Azure technology with FullArmor's
PolicyPortal is especially important in our case as it helps us
overcome our infrastructure challenges in managing the many remote
computers throughout our school systems," said Kiross Bitew, Bureau IT
Head for the Government of Tigray Ethiopia.

   "We are excited that FullArmor is using Windows Azure to help the
Ethiopian government scale their environment and help upgrade the
quality of their education system," said Steven Martin, Senior
Director, Connected Systems Division at Microsoft. "Our goal in
building Azure and extending the Windows platform to the cloud has
been to engender the kind of innovation Full Armor demonstrates in
bringing the full value of cloud computing to customers like this in
software + services solutions."

   About FullArmor

   FullArmor enables organizations to centrally define, manage, and
enforce endpoint security policies across the extended enterprise by
enhancing investments in Group Policy, Microsoft Active Directory, and
Microsoft Windows PowerShell. The company is a Microsoft Gold
Certified Partner. More than 5 million users and 1,500 organizations

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO Oct 27 (Reuters) - Software giant Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) has matched a reward being offered in the search for a
missing Canadian teenager who ran away from home after his
parents took away his Xbox 360 video game console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which makes the Xbox 360, said it would match
the existing reward of C$25,000 ($19,400) for information
leading to Brandon Crisp's return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Like everyone, we are deeply worried about the
disappearance of Brandon Crisp," the company said in an email.
"Law enforcement has contacted Microsoft about this matter and
we are co-operating fully with them. We are unable to comment
further on the nature of our co-operation because of the
ongoing investigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 15-year-old has been missing since Oct. 13. He ran away
from his home in Barrie, Ontario, north of Toronto, after his
parents took away his gaming privileges because of his
excessive playing of "Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The game is a wartime shooting simulator that gives players
a first-person perspective. It also lets players connect over
Microsoft's Xbox Live online service and compete against one
another, either in teams or individually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is possible that police will ask or have already asked
Microsoft to divulge the list of players with whom Brandon
Crisp has played recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Police and volunteers have been scouring the area around
Barrie, a small lakeside city about a one-hour drive from
Toronto, but so far have been unable to find the boy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As online gaming has exploded in popularity since the start
of the decade, academics and parents have raised concerns over
the possibility of addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, the American Medical Association said more
research was necessary on the potential of addiction to video
games. It urged parents to closely monitor their children's use
of games and the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Web sites such as www.wowdetox.com, a sounding board for
those addicted to or trying to quit the popular "World of
Warcraft" online game, have sprung up as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=$1.29 Canadian)

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to additional subscribers, no change to text or headline) By Mike Oboh KANO, Nigeria, Oct 27 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on Monday it hoped to reach an out-of-court settlement with Nigeria over a 1996 drug trial that the government says caused the death of 11 children and left dozens disabled. Nigeria's federal government and its northern state of Kano sued Pfizer last year for a total of $8.5 billion in damages over the testing of the antibiotic Trovan in Kano during a 1996 meningitis epidemic that killed 12,000 children. The New York-based drugmaker denies all charges and argues that meningitis, not Trovan, killed the children or damaged their health. It says Trovan saved lives and was as effective as a more established drug used for comparison in the study. The civil and criminal cases launched by authorities more than a year ago have grown into a tangle of unresolved petitions and side issues, dragging from one adjournment to the next. No witness has been heard and no substantive issue tackled. Talks between the Nigerian authorities and Pfizer on a possible settlement have been slowed by disagreements over liabilities and compensation. The reason for the lack of progress in these settlement talks is the excessive and unsubstantiated claims put forth by the private lawyers hired by the governments, Pfizer said in a statement. Prosecution lawyers have failed to provide evidence to support their excessive monetary claims despite repeated demands by Pfizer, it said. Nevertheless, Pfizer continues to be interested in an amicable resolution of these cases. The company is prepared to stay at the settlement table to reach an agreement, the firm said. Pfizer said it has proposed to set up a fund for participants in the study, underwrite projects to improve and expand healthcare in Nigeria, and provide assistance to cover legitimate legal expenses incurred by the government. Court sources said in March Pfizer had proposed to pay $10 million in compensation, rehabilitate the hospital where the Trovan study took place, and upgrade Kano's state-owned drug manufacturing company. But Kano state's lead attorney Aliyu Umar said in April the government wanted a better package for the victims. A Kano state High Court hearing the lawsuits adjourned the civil case on Monday to Nov. 27 and the criminal one to Nov. 28. Speaking to reporters after Monday's court sitting, Pfizer's lead counsel Anthony Idigbe said the adjournment provided the disputing parties an opportunity to close ranks and reach an amicable agreement.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has taken a minority equity stake in Blue Source, LLC, a U.S. developer of voluntary greenhouse gas emissions credits, the companies said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, Goldman will market the carbon credit developer's emissions reductions to clients including big polluters, such as utilities that have coal-burning power plants, according to Bill Townsend, Blue Source's chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terms of the deal were not released. A source close to the deal said Goldman will take a less than 10 percent equity stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blue Source says it has logged nearly 40 million tonnes worth of voluntary greenhouse emissions credits on public registries and that it generates another 20 million tonnes of emissions reductions per year. Carbon registries verify the quality of greenhouse gas reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early movers in the sector hope the value of the credits logged on registries will rise if the United States regulates greenhouse gases. Both U.S. presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain say they support capping the gases blamed for warming the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Interest in the pre-compliance carbon market in the U.S. is growing rapidly and we are excited to be able to offer our clients immediate access to a diverse selection of emission reductions to manage their carbon risk," Leslie Biddle, the global head of Goldman's commodity sales said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman will market verified emissions reductions from Blue Source projects including burning of the powerful greenhouse gas methane at coal mines, waste water treatment, landfills and animal waste. Other projects will include energy efficiency and carbon capture and storage from fertilizer and natural gas plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No commercial scale coal-fired plants in the United States practice CCS yet, but a handful could do so by late 2010 or early 2011. "Once construction begins on a few commercial scale facilities at coal plants that will be a bellwether for the industry," Townsend said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Timothy Gardner, Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

registries and that it generates another 20 million tonnes of
emissions reductions per year. Carbon registries verify the
quality of greenhouse gas reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early movers in the sector hope the value of the credits
logged on registries will rise if the United States regulates
greenhouse gases. Both U.S. presidential candidates Barack
Obama and John McCain say they support capping the gases blamed
for warming the planet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Interest in the pre-compliance carbon market in the U.S.
is growing rapidly and we are excited to be able to offer our
clients immediate access to a diverse selection of emission
reductions to manage their carbon risk," Leslie Biddle, the
global head of Goldman's commodity sales said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman will market verified emissions reductions from Blue
Source projects including burning of the powerful greenhouse
gas methane at coal mines, waste water treatment, landfills and
animal waste. Other projects will include energy efficiency and
carbon capture and storage from fertilizer and natural gas
plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No commercial scale coal-fired plants in the United States
practice CCS yet, but a handful could do so by late 2010 or
early 2011. "Once construction begins on a few commercial scale
facilities at coal plants that will be a bellwether for the
industry," Townsend said in an interview.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds BP spokesman, background, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tom Bergin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 27 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) has replaced Britain's BP Plc (BP.L) as the
third-largest non-government controlled oil company in the
world, as problems in Russia and sterling weakness weigh on BP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP's market capitalisation was $131.2 billion, based on
Friday's closing share price, compared with $131.3 billion for
Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP's shares dipped 0.11 percent to 439-1/2 pence at 1511 GMT
on Monday, while Chevron shares traded down 0.8 percent at
$63.40. However, a fall in sterling against the dollar meant
BP's market value fell more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The collapse in crude prices from a record above $147/barrel
in July to around $63/barrel on Monday has dented confidence in
the oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP's exposure to Russia -- its TNK-BP joint venture accounts
for a quarter of BP's oil and gas production -- has weighed on
the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In September, BP resolved a dispute with its oligarch
partners in TNK-BP over control of the unit by conceding some
control to the billionaires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This eased worries that BP might lose its half share of the
business altogether but a collapse in Russian shares and worries
about Russian relations with the West after Moscow's invasion of
Georgia in August has weighed on BP's shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP was the industry's number two until it was overtaken by
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) in 2006, after BP's valuation was
hit by the Texas City refinery explosion in 2005, which killed
15 workers, and by big project delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP's value has hovered around the same level as Chevron's in
recent months a BP spokesman said, but he could not confirm if
or when Chevron had previously risen above BP's market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) is the largest listed international oil
company, with a market capitalisation of $358.6 billion.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Oct 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Women Writing Science project, a multi-faceted initiative to involve
young women in science and to encourage them to pursue careers in
science, technology, engineering and math (STEM), announces the launch of
the website Underthemicroscope.com.

    Sponsored by and developed with IBM, Underthemicroscope.com offers a
wealth of continually updated information, including input from visitors
to the web site. Currently the site provides the opportunity to post
personal stories, feature and guest blogging, news about science, and
links to related resources. Within the year the site will include more
social networking opportunities, tips on careers, tips for parents,
expanded links to science-related sites, and mentoring. Ultimately the
site will provide information about internships and scholarships as well
as serialized chapters of Women Writing Science publications that can be
downloaded free of charge and an online book
club.

"Underthemicroscope.com with IBM's help combines new technology,
like social networking, with traditional publishing to better communicate
with young women in science, develop new content for stories and serve as
a place of learning and inspiration," said Gloria Jacobs, Executive
Director of the Feminist Press.

    Initiated by The Feminist Press at The City University of New York with
support from the National Science Foundation (NSF), Women Writing Science
will publish books of biography, fiction, history, career profiles, and
how-to-survive guides presenting women as both scientists and as writers
about science. Women Writing Science will also provide free teacher
guides describing lesson plans and strategies for using the books in
science curricula. These materials will be easily downloaded from
Underthemicroscope.com.

    Women Writing Science begins its publishing program early in 2009 with two
books: BASE TEN: A Novel by Maryann Lesert and WOMEN IN SCIENCE: Then and
Now by Vivian Gornick, with a Foreword by Donna E. Shalala.

    Stanley Litow, Vice President, IBM Corporate Citizenship &amp; Corporate
Affairs and President of the IBM International Foundation, will help
unveil Underthemicroscope.com at the Feminist Press' 38th anniversary
gala in New York City on Monday, October 27, 2008. Gala participants will
include Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton and Charles E. Schumer and
celebrated broadcast journalist Barbara Walters.

    "At IBM, we have about 200,000 technical positions out of nearly 400,000
employees overall, and women are more than 20 percent of our technical
workforce. This puts us in a leadership position since less than 10
percent of engineers in the entire professional workforce are women, but
its not nearly enough to be double the average. We want to improve," Mr.
Litow said. "One way to realize that goal is to provide young women with
role models, mentors and examples so more young women will be inspired and
helped to enter exciting technical careers, and projects like the Woman
Writing Science will help."

    IBM is supporting Underthemicroscope.com as part of its efforts to
encourage more young people to pursue careers in science, technology,
engineering and math. There is a serious shortage of young people
entering into these disciplines that could impact America's
competitiveness in today's global economy. While other countries are
increasing the number of students in these fields, enrollment in higher
education institutions in the U.S. is declining. Young people need to
understand the opportunity and be encouraged to pursue potential careers
in these disciplines.

    Begun in 1970, the award-winning Feminist Press at The City University of
New York is a unique organization dedicated to publishing literary and
educational works by and about women. It is the oldest continuing women's
publisher in the world.

&lt;p&gt;Announcing Torex Retail POS Validation on the IBM Retail

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Torex Retail Holdings Limited (Torex(TM)), the leading

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and SAN JOSE, CA, Oct 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Effigent, Inc., a leading provider of enterprise solutions for the Apple
platform, and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced an OEM agreement under
which Effigent has created CDP4Mac, an Apple OS X version of IBM Tivoli
Continuous Data Protection for Files software. Under the agreement,
Effigent has embedded IBM's data protection software to provide data
backup and restore functionality for Mac users.

    IBM Tivoli Continuous Data Protection for Files software was originally
designed to provide a simple data backup and recovery solution for PC
users. IBM Tivoli Continuous Data Protection for Files continuously
protects important files automatically, without requiring users to
schedule backups. A copy of the file is stored on a local disk, while
other copies can be sent to a file server or other device.

    Embedded with IBM's software, the new data protection solution created by
Effigent, CDP4Mac, was developed to help Mac users guard against data loss
caused by file corruption, user error, virus, or system failure. The
software installs and configures in minutes, and runs invisibly in the
background utilizing minimal system resources. CDP4Mac is a Mac native
application designed and built specifically for laptop and desktop backup

&lt;p&gt;Credit Union Partners with Digital Dialogue for Total Member Care
AUBURN HILLS, Mich.--(Business Wire)--
Digital Dialogue, a PSCU Financial Services company and nationwide
provider of 24/7 call center operations and software solutions to
credit unions, announced today that Oakland, Calif.-based Chevron
Federal Credit Union has partnered with Digital Dialogue for 24/7/365
call center and total member service.

   Chevron Federal Credit Union, which has more than $1 billion in
assets and 66,000 members, surveyed other Symitar(TM) users to
identify a call center solutions provider that could interface
seamlessly with its core system for credit union afterhours, emergency
response and 24/7 total member service delivery. According to credit
union officials, Digital Dialogue was a clear choice, because its call
center is focused on serving the credit union industry, they are
familiar with credit union specific language and have an excellent
track record of success.

   "Chevron Federal Credit Union serves members in many different
time zones, including members overseas, and we needed a transparent
call center partner that could help us maintain our high level of
responsive and friendly service," said Mitch Dormer, vice president,
Strategic Initiatives at Chevron Federal Credit Union. "We did not
want to take attention away from our members to staff, educate and
maintain a 24/7/365 call center, so we chose a partner that we felt
could best serve them without their feeling like they were in
different hands."

   After a soft launch in June, which saw more than 1,200 calls,
Chevron Federal Credit Union announced to its members the 24/7/365
call center on Tuesday, September 16. Credit union officials utilized
the soft launch to validate how the initial scripts would work and
develop additional scripts that addressed the specific and unique
questions and requests from members. Digital Dialogue's CUScripter can
accommodate an unlimited number of responses, so Chevron Federal
Credit Union can add or modify scripts as products change, or if a
business disruption should occur.

   Digital Dialogue is prepared (both as a company and call center
services provider) to handle business continuity and disaster recovery
whether in its own backyard or that of a credit union customer.
Officials from Chevron Federal Credit Union stated that business
continuity planning was an important part of their call center
provider selection process.

   "As the competitive landscape becomes more crowded for credit
unions, and our economy takes a hit, a focus not just on member care,
but on total member care is paramount," said Peter Schmitt, president
of Digital Dialogue. "By working with Digital Dialogue, Chevron
Federal Credit Union positions itself as a responsive credit union
offering timely and accessible financial products and services."

   In June, Chevron Federal Credit Union also signed a five-year
agreement to convert its 40,000 offline debit and 15,000 PIN debit
accounts to PSCU Financial Services. Credit union executives report
they are changing to PSCU Financial Services' debit platform, because
of its industry-leading fraud management technology as well as its
24/7 Contact Center.

   About Chevron Federal Credit Union

   Founded in 1935, Chevron Federal Credit Union has grown in
financial strength and soundness, resulting in more than 70 years of
success. The credit union emphasizes timely, accurate and courteous
service and products whether in person, by phone at 510-627-5000 or
toll free at 800-232-8101, or online at www.chevronfcu.org.

nationwide provider of 24/7 financial call center operations and

funding and sophisticated cross-selling. Digital Dialogue manages the

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and SAN JOSE, CA, Oct 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Effigent, Inc., a leading provider of enterprise solutions for the Apple
platform, and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced an OEM agreement under
which Effigent has created CDP4Mac, an Apple OS X version of IBM Tivoli
Continuous Data Protection for Files software. Under the agreement,
Effigent has embedded IBM's data protection software to provide data
backup and restore functionality for Mac users.

    IBM Tivoli Continuous Data Protection for Files software was originally
designed to provide a simple data backup and recovery solution for PC
users. IBM Tivoli Continuous Data Protection for Files continuously
protects important files automatically, without requiring users to
schedule backups. A copy of the file is stored on a local disk, while
other copies can be sent to a file server or other device.

    Embedded with IBM's software, the new data protection solution created by
Effigent, CDP4Mac, was developed to help Mac users guard against data loss
caused by file corruption, user error, virus, or system failure. The
software installs and configures in minutes, and runs invisibly in the
background utilizing minimal system resources. CDP4Mac is a Mac native
application designed and built specifically for laptop and desktop backup
that can be leveraged by an individual Mac user or thousands of clients in
an enterprise.

    "More than 90 percent of corporate data now lives on the edge in end user
desktops and laptops," said Obul Kambham, Effigent's CEO &amp; Founder. "This
data often contains work-critical documents and information. At the same
time, businesses now face more complex compliance regulations and
standards. It is therefore more important than ever to ensure this
valuable information is not lost. By leveraging IBM's software, we were
able to create CDP4Mac to offer a high level of protection to both the
individual and corporate Mac user community."

that address the needs of their customers," said Daren Hanson, director,
IBM OEM software sales. "Through this OEM agreement, Effigent has built
upon IBM's software to offer a data protection solution developed

Protection (CDP) solution has greatly enhanced the Natural Science
Division's system backup and restore ability," said Douglas Gilbert,
Technology Liaison, Natural Science Division, Pepperdine University. "The
user-friendly interface combined with the solution's multifaceted options
resulted in a seamless, efficient implementation. We are grateful for

&lt;p&gt;  WALTHAM, MA, Oct 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Liquid Machines, Inc., the leader in Enterprise Rights Management (ERM)
solutions, today unveiled a major release of its Liquid Machines Gateway
for the BlackBerry(R) Enterprise Solution from Research In Motion (RIM)
(NASDAQ: RIMM) (TSX: RIM). The Liquid Machines Gateway for BlackBerry
enterprise customers adds advanced features that allow them to control
access to, and usage of, mobile communications that have been protected
using Microsoft Windows Rights Management Services (RMS). BlackBerry(R)
smartphone users can now send and receive RMS protected messages and
attachments using the same RMS policies available in Microsoft Outlook.

    Mobile access to real-time communications and data risks the loss of
confidential enterprise information such as intellectual property and
other trade secrets. To solve this problem, the Liquid Machines Gateway
extends Microsoft RMS information protection to a BlackBerry smartphone in
conjunction with BlackBerry Enterprise Server, enabling customers to
persistently protect emails and attachments with encryption and usage
controls that travel with the data. This persistent protection ensures
that mobile communications, which may include executive and board
communications, customer data, intellectual property and human resources
information, can only be viewed by authorized users.

    "Liquid Machines was the first BlackBerry(R) Alliance member to deliver
Microsoft RMS support to the BlackBerry platform, and with this release we
significantly raise the bar for usability and scalability," said Ed
Gaudet, senior vice president of corporate development and marketing.
"Our mutual customers now can enjoy the productivity of a BlackBerry
smartphone with enhanced, persistent protection of confidential emails
and documents safeguarding their mobile workforce from data loss."

    Unlike some mobile data protection tools that only secure the data at rest
on the device or during transmission, Liquid Machines persistently
protects emails and attachments at the user-level by restricting
unauthorized actions such as view, forward, reply, select/paste, and can
automatically expire content based on corporate usage and retention
policies.

    "Mobile data protection (MDP) systems and procedures are needed to protect
user privacy and to comply with audit requirements, and every company must
include MDP in its IT operations plan," said Gartner Research Vice
President Ray Wagner. "MDP for notebooks and smaller handheld devices
(PDAs and smartphones) is a rapidly growing market that began with basic
data encryption and has expanded beyond hard drives and local files to
encompass external data device controls and rights management. Interest
in data protection is fuelled by liability and privacy concerns. Civil
and criminal penalties for data leaks, and pressure to disclose leaks,
are also growing in other countries. Even if information is not misused,
negative public reaction is expensive and embarrassing, and it damages
buyer and investor confidence."(1)

    Liquid Machines enables users to protect new or previously unprotected
messages with RMS policies directly from a BlackBerry smartphone. Major
new and enhanced features in the Liquid Machines Gateway for RMS 7.0
include:


--  Persistently Protects Messages on the BlackBerry Smartphone: Emails
    protected with RMS policies are persistently encrypted on the BlackBerry
    smartphone. This added protection prevents the loss of confidential data
    inadvertently or through malicious intent. Additional enforcement
    capabilities block the leakage of sensitive data via copy/paste or sending
    emails outside of the corporate network. Off-line access to encrypted
    emails is supported.
--  Enhances Security for PIN-to-PIN Messaging:  Each BlackBerry
    smartphone ships with a unique personal identification number (PIN).
    BlackBerry smartphones support direct PIN-to-PIN emailing; if the recipient
    PIN is known, the user can send an email directly to the PIN instead of the
    email address. PIN-to-PIN messages are not encrypted and therefore risk
    data loss. For those emails protected with RMS policies, Liquid Machines
    enhances the protection by re-encrypting any protected message that is sent
    via PIN-to-PIN or SMS communications, thus rendering it unreadable. This
    allows companies to allow PIN-to-PIN and SMS communications while
    preventing the loss of RMS-protected confidential data on the same device.
--  Blocks Copy/Paste Operations: Liquid Machines prevent users from
    circumventing security parameters by copying important data from a
    protected email or file and pasting it into another message or document.
--  Enforces Expiration of Emails:  This ensures that messages can be
    electronically expired on the BlackBerry smartphone. The message sender can
    set the time of expiration directly from their BlackBerry smartphone.
--  Supports latest BlackBerry Platform: The Liquid Machines Gateway
    supports  BlackBerry(R) Enterprise Server 4.1.6 running on Windows 32- and
    64-bit servers with support for Microsoft Exchange 2007 and BlackBerry(R)
    client software 4.5.
--  Works with International Character Sets: The Liquid Machines Gateway
    and client software for BlackBerry smartphones is locale independent; that
    is, they support non-ASCII text characters for text bodies and file
    attachments. They support the same code pages the BlackBerry(R) operating
    system supports.
    

    
Since 2003, Liquid Machines has offered solutions that tightly
integrate with and extend the efficacy of Windows RMS to popular desktop
applications such as Adobe Acrobat, Microsoft Visio and Office and over
400 additional file types; enterprise content management systems such as
SharePoint; networked fileshares; the BlackBerry platform; eDiscovery and
archive solutions such Symantec Enterprise Vault and Zantaz Digital Safe;
and other enterprise infrastructure. In these enterprise scenarios,
Liquid Machines enables RMS users to create and manage a persistent set
of access controls that travel with the content, protecting unauthorized
access to files regardless of where they go, while supporting existing
business processes and workflows. Thousands of users at the world's
largest financial organizations, manufacturers and government agencies
rely on Liquid Machines to secure and control their most critical
information including intellectual property, executive and board
communications, customer data and human resources information, while
enabling secure collaboration and strict adherence to regulatory
compliance.

    Availability and Pricing

    The Liquid Machines Gateway for BlackBerry enterprise customers is
available now. Pricing is available by calling the Liquid Machines at
1-781-693-3600.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment, while no one at Citi was immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein's call was made shortly after Goldman got the approval to become a commercial bank on September 21 and with the knowledge of regulators, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Morgan Stanley, Goldman is one of only two large investment banks that have survived independently, though the two have subjected themselves to closer regulatory scrutiny in return for access to central bank funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported the call first on its website on Sunday. The conversation between the two bankers was brief as Pandit turned down the proposal immediately, the paper said, citing unnamed sources.

&lt;p&gt;Norkom to Showcase Award-Winning Financial Crime Prevention Solutions at IBM's Information on Demand Conference

   Featuring Capabilities for Gathering and Analyzing Anti-Fraud and
                 AML Information across the Enterprise
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Oct 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SOA Software, the leading Integrated SOA Governance vendor, announced
today that is has added support for Microsoft's extensions to the Windows
Server application server (code-named "Dublin") and Windows Communication
Framework (WCF) version 4.0. The company is also providing a preview of
its new governance models for the "Oslo" modeling platform at the
Microsoft Professional Developers Conference.

    SOA Software has extended the traditional models of enterprise security
within Microsoft's .NET Framework and Windows Server. Microsoft's
market-leading application server is being enhanced through new
capabilities in .NET Framework 4.0 (specifically Windows Communication
Foundation 4.0 and Windows Workflow Foundation 4.0) and with a set of
extensions to the application server role codenamed "Dublin." SOA Software
extends these efforts to include a unified governance automation
best-practices framework for WCF service providers and consumers. SOA
Software helps enterprise customers build the right services, build
services the right way, and ensure that their services are behaving
correctly.

    SOA Software's products built to work with the enhanced Windows
application server help Microsoft customers:


--  Ensure that services they identify, design and build using .NET
    Framework and WCF are relevant to and consumable by applications they
    design, build and deploy using other platforms like SAP and IBM.
--  Make services they expose from applications running on .NET Framework
    and WCF visible to and compliant with enterprise policies defined, enforced
    and audited across other platforms; and make services they design and build
    using other platforms like SAP and open source environments visible to and
    compliant with enterprise policies defined, enforced and audited across
    their .NET Framework and WCF applications.
--  Promote, ensure and formalize consistent alignment between demand from
    service consumers and the supply of services through Consumer Contract
    Provisioning.
    

    


"Today at PDC, Microsoft is previewing some of the coming
enhancements to the .NET Framework and Windows Server, which advance the
capabilities of our application server while still allowing developers to
use their existing skills with Microsoft Visual Studio, the .NET
Framework and IIS," said Burley Kawasaki, director in the Connected
Systems Division at Microsoft Corporation. "SOA Software's governance
automation products combined with Microsoft's .NET Framework and "Dublin"
extensions to the Windows Server application server help customers to
maximize their SOA vision."

    SOA Software's framework brings a governed SOA methodology to developers,
including centralized policy management for WCF and continuous compliance
and validation for Microsoft Team Foundation Server. This framework
provides custom bindings, channels and service hosts that make the job of
implementing and enforcing enterprise-wide security a transparent and
consistent quality of the "Dublin" run-time architecture. The cost and
effort required for coding, deployment and operations are greatly reduced
because security, compliance and audit become things an administrator
checks off via a centralized console, and the resulting policy documents
get pushed to Windows application server for implementation, enforcement
and monitoring.

    "The .NET Framework 4.0 enhancements -- along with the improved
manageability and standardized application hosting capabilities provided
by "Dublin" -- provide enterprise customers with a best-in-class platform
for developing, deploying, running and evolving their composite
applications," said Frank Martinez, executive vice president of SOA
Software. "These enhancements will allow customers to unify both
lightweight composition and process-driven integration techniques through
a consistent unified declarative programming model for rich composite
applications. This will help simplify the way in which SOA Software's
Integrated Governance Automation solutions can be used to preserve the
fidelity of the governance models, structures and mechanisms supporting
their enterprise SOA programs."

    Microsoft's "Oslo" modeling platform consists of a repository for sharing
and linking of model artifacts, a textual modeling language that provides
a shared meta-model for developers, and visual modeling tools for
designing and editing models. SOA Software enhances "Oslo" by providing
holistic governance automation that delivers consistent governance of
models, services, policies, and a wide range of related artifacts
throughout enterprise SOA programs. SOA Software's Repository Manager and
Policy Manager will offer deep integration with the "Oslo" repository and
tools to make "Oslo" a Governed Platform and ensure the end-to-end
fidelity of governance models, structures, and mechanisms. This will help
enterprises confidently leverage "Oslo" applications.

    SOA Software is attending the Microsoft PDC 2008 conference at the Los
Angeles Convention Center booth 1014.

    About SOA Software

    The world's largest companies including Merrill Lynch, Verizon, and Pfizer
use SOA Software to quickly and confidently realize the value of SOA. SOA

&lt;p&gt;(Recasts; adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oct 27 (Reuters) - J P Morgan upgraded Federated Investors
Inc (FII.N) to "overweight" from "neutral," saying the U.S.
asset manager will benefit from strong industry money fund
sales and a flight to quality within the money fund business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given current market volatility we see Federated as a
defensive play given its money market focus and lack of
meaningful international exposure," analyst Kenneth Worthington
said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Due to the significant corrosion in the equity markets, the
analyst sees Federated's heavy earnings contributions from
money funds and fixed income products as making it the most
defensive of the asset managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Money funds are one of the only asset classes generating
sale given the current massive flight to quality," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worthington expects minimal earnings decline in Federated
Investors compared to its peers, making it a strong relative
investment in the asset management sector, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, Federated has not acted as defensively as we
would have expected given its asset mix due to turmoil in the
credit markets. But with government support to money funds, we
see Federated as a good investment," Worthington added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $21.66 Friday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

Morgan, PNC, Principal Financial Take</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Oct 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
J.P. Morgan Investor Services, PNC and Principal Financial have been
honored with first-place for Leadership, Innovation and
Efficiencies/Streamlining, respectively, in Money Management Executive's
2008 Fund Operations Awards.

    Published by SourceMedia, Money Management Executive is the leading print
publication devoted to the retail asset management industry.

    Now in its sixth year, the awards program recognizes outstanding
investment management service providers. As in previous years, the judges
for the program noted significant technological strides and achievements
that the industry continues to make, particularly in the areas of
automation and straight-through-processing.

    The following nine winners, below, were selected by a panel of seven
leading executives in the industry, including: T. Neil Bathon, managing
director of PMR Associates and founder of FUSE Research Network; Peter
Delano, research area director, securities and investments at TowerGroup;
Ian Frost, senior partner at Boston Consulting Group; Bob Goldberg,
president emeritus of NICSA and consultant with Acadient; Burt Greenwald,
president of B.J. Greenwald Associates; Charlie O'Neill, principal of
Diversified Management Resources Financial; and Kathleen Whalen, managing
director, Dalbar.

    Leadership

    1st Place Winner, Leadership -- Tom Hierl, Director of U.S. Funds Taxation
at J.P. Morgan Investor Services

    Serving in this position since August 2006, Tom Hierl and his U.S. Funds
Taxation team have presided over tremendous growth in the number of funds
for which J.P. Morgan Investor Services provides U.S. tax services, which
have risen from 350 to 850. To manage this expansion, J.P. Morgan is
implementing automated processes that previously were handled manually,
including the production of tax provisions and returns. J.P. Morgan
Investor Services currently has $14.4 trillion in assets under custody and
$5.4 trillion under administration.

    2nd Place Winner, Leadership -- Larry H. Goldbrum, Executive Vice
President and General Counsel at RG Wuelfing &amp; Associates and the SPARK
Institute

    As an active industry leader, Larry H. Goldbrum worked with the Securities
and Exchange Commission in developing Rule 22c-2 to detect and prevent
market timing or other trading abuses, as well as with other regulatory
agencies on a number of initiatives to better serve investors, including
fee disclosure, fair funds settlement payments and materials to help the
403(b) plan community comply with new regulations taking effect in January
2009.

    3rd Place Winner, Leadership -- Keith F. Hartstein, President and Chief
Executive Officer of John Hancock Funds

    Keith F. Hartstein set an example with this year's liquidity freeze in
closed-end auction-rate preferred shares. Working with John Hancock Funds'
board of directors and a broad constituency of senior management from both
John Hancock and Manulife Financial, as well as the Investment Company
Institute and the Securities and Exchange Commission, Hartstein was able
to develop, implement and successfully execute a plan that solved the
difficult challenge of providing much-needed liquidity to auction-rate
preferred shareholders without negatively impacting the interests of
common shareholders.

    To date, John Hancock remains the only major asset management firm to have
completely refinanced all of its closed-end auction rate preferred shares.

    1st Place, Innovation -- PNC

    PNC is being awarded First Place, Innovation, for its ADVISORport unified
managed account platform. Web-based, customizable and available for
sponsors to white label, the secure online platform allows financial
advisers to make timely changes to clients' portfolios on an ongoing
basis, thereby eliminating processing concerns and investment delay
risks. Thus, the UMA account is streamlined, can be offered to a broader
client base and has the potential to attract more assets.

    2nd Place, Innovation -- J.P. Morgan Investor Services

    Recognizing the increasing popularity of exchange-traded funds, J.P.
Morgan Investor Services' Exchange-Traded Fund Product Development and
Operations Team expanded the capabilities of its ETF platform so that
clients may offer not just equity ETFs, but also those that invest in
fixed income, enhanced indexes, inverse indexes, enhanced inverse
indexes, international and emerging markets derivative products and
130/30 strategies. They also expanded capabilities to offer servicing for
ETFs outside the United States.

    Of particular concern was the ability to offer clients shortened
settlement, cash settlement, customized intraday valuation, cash component
forecasting, restricted securities implications and cash in lieu of
processing.

    3rd Place, Innovation -- BNY Mellon Asset Servicing

    BNY Mellon is the recipient of Third Place, Innovation, for expanding its
exchange-traded fund servicing beyond fund accounting, administration,
custody and transfer agency services to include automated basket creation
and dissemination, and order-desk services.

    These technologies have added 800 basis points of operating leverage by
significantly reducing the headcount to service ETFs. It has also led to
an 80% win rate in new business opportunities. All told, this is driving a
top-line revenue growth increase of 40% year-over-year.

    Efficiencies/Streamlining

    1st Place, Efficiencies/Streamlining -- Principal Financial

    Principal Financial successfully automated multiple fund administration
processes and combined them on a single platform called Unity. This
eliminates error-prone manual processes and spreadsheets for clients,
while giving them the opportunity to reuse the same data for multiple
reporting purposes.

    Notably, this reduces the time it takes clients to issue financial
statements by 25%. It also brings down a fund's holdings reporting cycle
from 20 days to five, and halves the time it takes to create a document.
Conversely, clients' financial reporting capacity increases by 30% without
expanding staff, and they are able to conduct compliance tests daily,
while avoiding the 14-fold increase in payroll costs otherwise required
with manual methods.

    2nd Place, Efficiencies/Streamlining -- John Hancock Signature Services

    John Hancock implemented a process aimed at increasing efficiency and
quality performance while decreasing costs for outgoing correspondence to
customers. This process, which John Hancock dubbed "straight-through
correspondence," creates correspondence from a data bank of standardized
form letters, which today handles 40% of customer inquiries.

    This new process enabled the team to respond promptly and accurately to
more routine inquiries, while allowing them time to focus on more
sensitive and complicated customer inquiries.

    The new process has increased productivity by 20%, led to a 15% reduction
in staff and raised external quality benchmark ratings for John Hancock
Signature Services by 10%.

    3rd Place, Efficiencies/Streamlining -- Access Data

    Rounding out Access Data's enterprise sales reporting applications is
SalesVision Distributor Compensation. A first-of-its-kind solution, it
enables mutual fund companies to automate and streamline their
compensation processes for external distribution partners, service
providers and administrators.

    Distributor Compensation facilitates managing and servicing multiple
intermediary and distribution agreements through a flexible rules library
that tracks and applies complex payment arrangements to payment
calculations. Invoices from financial intermediaries are automatically
analyzed and reconciled against payments calculated to identify and
disparities.

    The cost and time requirements for manual processing and tracking from
spreadsheets can be reduced as much as 50%, while the accuracy of payments
reported to distributors, regulators and management is increased.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs and Blue Source Create Strategic Alliance to Market U.S. Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions

NEW YORK &amp; SALT LAKE CITY--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) and Blue Source LLC today
announced a strategic alliance that combines Goldman's global
leadership in commodities trading and financial risk management with
Blue Source's leading climate change portfolio. As part of the
alliance, Goldman Sachs has purchased an equity stake in Blue Source
LLC.

   Goldman Sachs will off-take, structure and market a broad range of
verified emissions reductions (VERs) resulting from certain greenhouse
gas (GHG) reduction projects in Blue Source's portfolio, including
those associated with methane management from coal mining, wastewater
treatment, landfills and animal waste; energy efficiency; carbon
capture and sequestration from fertilizer and natural gas production;
and industrial gas destruction.

   The alliance combines environmental market experience and skills
that can provide real climate change solutions for a broad array of US
companies. Blue Source has the resources and expertise to capitalize
and develop to scale high-quality GHG reduction projects and Goldman
Sachs can bring those reductions to a market increasingly eager to
engage a low carbon economy. Furthermore, the recently announced joint
venture between Blue Source and certain affiliated investment funds of
Och-Ziff Capital Management Group LLC (NYSE:OZM) provides a
competitive source of funding to identify, develop and manage
emission-related investments, thereby supporting the growth of Blue
Source's offset portfolio. This portfolio provides Goldman Sachs
additional tools to help its clients manage GHG-related risks in both
the voluntary and pre-compliance carbon markets.

   "Combining the market reach and trading capabilities of Goldman
Sachs with the project development skills and supply position of Blue
Source is not only a winning combination, but an important step in the
development of the North American carbon market," said Bill Townsend,
CEO of Blue Source. "This unique agreement is the next step for Blue
Source as the US carbon market evolves from voluntary to compliance.
We have been able to develop a high-quality portfolio of independently
verified emission reductions from projects based in North America, and
this new alliance creates an exceptional opportunity to reach a broad
range of offset buyers through a highly experienced and well-trusted
institution."

   "Goldman Sachs is committed to leveraging the first-mover position
of Blue Source and its extensive experience and relationships to
provide best-in-class risk management to North American voluntary and
compliance buyers," said Leslie Biddle, Global Head of Commodity Sales
at Goldman Sachs. "Interest in the pre-compliance carbon market in the
US is growing rapidly and we are excited to be able to offer our
clients immediate access to a diverse selection of emission reductions
to manage their carbon risk."

   Goldman Sachs was advised by Linklaters LLP; Blue Source was
advised by The Blackstone Group and Baker &amp; McKenzie LLP.

&lt;p&gt;Oct 27 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded
semiconductor equipment maker Mattson Technology Inc (MTSN.O)
to "neutral" from "overweight," saying the prospect to deliver
above-average growth in the next cycle has diminished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also questioned the company's ability and

in to the market, especially at a time when it was forced to
reduce costs and headcount to stem losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said its confidence in the company has been
shaken as the company has negatively pre-announced in two of
the five past quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Oct. 22, Mattson had forecast fourth-quarter loss of 44
cents a share to 53 cents a share on revenue of $12 million to
$18 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said the company's fourth-quarter outlook was
40 percent to 60 percent lower than its third-quarter results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also saw Mattson as a "potentially fat"
acquisition target for another player or one who wishes to gain
an easy entry into the etch and thermal processing segments due
to its low valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Mattson closed at $2.76 Friday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;Jay Rasulo, Chairman, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts to Be Inducted into TIA's Hall of Leaders

WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
Jay Rasulo, chairman, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts, has been
named the 2008 inductee into the Travel Industry Hall of Leaders.

   Rasulo will be honored during a dinner attended by several hundred
travel industry leaders October 28th in Portland, Oregon during the
Marketing Outlook Forum, an annual industry conference run by the
Travel Industry Association (TIA). Distinguished individuals are named
to the Hall of Leaders for "sustained, noteworthy contributions that
have positively impacted the travel industry, stimulated greater
achievement, and raised industry-wide standards."

   "Jay was the catalyst that has given us a much bigger voice in
Washington," remarked Roger Dow, TIA president and CEO. "He invested
time and energy to ensure that policymakers understand the importance
of travel economically and as resource for public diplomacy. He
exemplifies the leader this award was created to honor."

   "The travel industry's significant and pervasive impact on our
nation's economy, social and cultural life and international image is
understood better today than ever because of Jay Rasulo's unwavering
commitment to the industry," said Barbara Richardson, a past national
chair of TIA and also the chair of the selection committee. "Over the
years, he has worked tirelessly as an advocate for the industry, for
those who rely on the industry for their livelihood and for millions
of travelers. It is an honor to recognize his commitment and to
publicly thank him by inducting him into the Hall of Leaders."

   Rasulo served for two years as national chair of TIA. During that
time he called on the industry to create a blueprint for success that
would be the equivalent of an Apollo project to improve marketing the
U.S. as an international destination and send a more welcoming message
to international travelers around the world. He then led the effort to
generate that blueprint, which included creation of the Discover
America Partnership, an industry coalition aimed at improving
international travel to the U.S.

   The Partnership, now part of TIA, has since had a string of public
affairs victories, including expansion of the Visa Waiver Program,
reform of visa and entry processes, and creation of model airports to
improve the arrival process for international visitors.

   Last year Rasulo had Disney produce a multimedia experience which
includes a seven-minute video entitled, "Welcome: Portraits of
America." The video was donated to the Departments of State and
Homeland Security for use at major U.S. international airports, and at
U.S. embassies and consulates around the world.

   Under Rasulo's leadership, TIA also entered a public-private
partnership with the U.S. government that created DiscoverAmerica.com,
the first-ever official travel and tourism website of the United
States, which promotes the country internationally.

   Rasulo will be the 78th travel industry professional inducted into
the Travel Industry Hall of Leaders since it was created in 1969. The
2007 inductee was Stephen Holmes, chairman and chief executive officer
of Wyndham Worldwide.

   The Travel Industry Association is the national, non-profit
organization representing all components of the $740 billion travel
industry. TIA's mission is to promote and facilitate increased travel
to and within the United States. TIA is proud to be a partner in
travel with American Express. For more information, visit www.tia.org.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's Novel HIV/AIDS Treatment Selzentry(TM) (Maraviroc) Demonstrates Increased Efficacy Rate In Treatment-Naive HIV Patients

Results from MERIT ES Data Reanalysis Using Enhanced Sensitivity Tropism Test at
                                    48 Weeks
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Patients taking Selzentry, in combination with Combivir(R)
(zidovudine/lamivudine) and selected by an enhanced sensitivity tropism test to
screen patients, experienced a 68 percent rate of virologic suppression to
undetectable levels, according to the MERIT ES (Reanalysis of the MERIT Study
with the Enhanced Trofile Assay) reanalysis presented at the 48th Annual
Interscience Conference on Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy (ICAAC(TM))/
46th Annual Meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in
Washington D.C., USA.

MERIT ES is a reanalysis of 48-week efficacy and safety data from the MERIT
(Maraviroc versus Efavirenz Regimens as Initial Therapy) study following
retesting of screening samples using the newly launched enhanced sensitivity
Trofile(TM) assay. This therefore represents a subset of the MERIT 48-week
primary analysis population. The enhanced sensitivity test was not available at
the time of the MERIT study and is the only version of Trofile currently
available.

In the MERIT ES reanalysis 68 percent of patients in the Selzentry arm, and 68
percent of patients in the efavirenz arm - a current standard of care - achieved
suppression of the virus to undetectable levels (less than 50 copies/ml). When
the criterion of less than 400 copies/ml was used, the results were 73 percent
with Selzentry, and 72 percent with efavirenz.

"The results of MERIT ES are exciting as they show that with an enhanced
sensitivity tropism assay the efficacy rate of Selzentry shown in MERIT with the
original Trofile assay is improved further," said Michael Saag, Professor of
Medicine and Director of the Center for AIDS Research at the University of
Alabama at Birmingham, who presented the results. "These findings are important
for patients and physicians and offer guidance for clinical practice with the
only version of Trofile currently available."

In the MERIT ES population, 14.2 percent of patients taking efavirenz
discontinued due to adverse events compared to 4.2 percent of patients taking
Selzentry. This was largely driven by a greater number of cases of CNS toxicity
(13 vs. 2), rash (9 vs. 0), and tuberculosis (6 vs. 1) in the efavirenz arm
versus the Selzentry arm. In MERIT ES, there were fewer discontinuations in the
Selzentry arm due to lack of efficacy than the rate seen for the MERIT full
study population. In MERIT ES, 9.3 percent of patients taking Selzentry
discontinued due to lack of efficacy, compared to 4 percent of patients taking
efavirenz.

The enhanced sensitivity Trofile assay is able to detect dual/mixed or
CXCR4-tropic variants of the HIV virus when they are present in patients in
greater than or equal to 0.3 percent of the total viral population, a 30-fold
improvement in sensitivity.

About the MERIT Study

MERIT was a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate the antiretroviral activity of
Selzentry (300 mg twice daily) compared to efavirenz (600 mg once daily), a
current standard of care, in combination with Combivir (zidovudine/lamivudine)
in CCR5-tropic HIV-1 infected patients who had never received antiretroviral
therapy and had no evidence of resistance to any of the drugs used in the study.

In MERIT, rates of virologic suppression in patients receiving Selzentry
compared to efavirenz were 70.6 percent vs. 73.1 percent for less than 400
copies/ml and 65.3 percent vs. 69.3 percent at less than 50 copies/ml. Fewer
patients experienced grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the Selzentry arm than in
the efavirenz arm.

At 48 weeks, the most common adverse events reported during the study in both
arms were nausea, headaches, diarrhea, dizziness and fatigue. When the incidence
of adverse events was adjusted for exposure to study drug, there was a higher
incidence of nasopharyngitis and bronchitis in the Selzentry treatment group and
a higher incidence of dizziness, diarrhea, vomiting, upper respiratory tract
infection, cough, abdominal pain, rash and abnormal dreams in the efavirenz
treatment group.

About Selzentry

Selzentry is referred to as Celsentri(R) in countries outside the U.S.
Discovered by Pfizer scientists in 1997, Selzentry is an oral medicine that
blocks viral entry to human cells. Rather than fighting HIV inside white blood
cells, Selzentry prevents the virus from entering uninfected cells by blocking
its predominant entry route, the CCR5 co-receptor.

Selzentry has been approved for use in several markets around the world
including the U.S. and European Union in combination with other antiretroviral
medicinal products, for the treatment of experienced adult patients with only
CCR5-tropic HIV-1 detectable.

About Pfizer

Founded in 1849, Pfizer is the world's largest research-based pharmaceutical
company taking new approaches to better health. We discover, develop,
manufacture and deliver quality, safe and effective prescription medicines to
treat and help prevent disease for both people and animals. We also partner with
healthcare providers, governments and local communities around the world to

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer to Present Data on New Approaches to Pain and Inflammation Treatment at ACR Meeting

Results from Clinical Trials Show Promise for Innovative Therapies in Rheumatoid
               Arthritis and Osteoarthritis Pain and Fibromyalgia
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer will present data on three investigational compounds that represent
potential new mechanisms for targeting pain and inflammation. These data will
highlight tanezumab, a molecule designed to target nerve growth factor, a key
pain mediator; CP-690,550, a JAK-inhibitor that suppresses immune-related
inflammatory response; and esreboxetine, a highly-selective norepinephrine
reuptake inhibitor which plays a role in controlling the activity of this
important neurotransmitter. These data will be presented at the 2008 American
College of Rheumatology Scientific Meeting in San Francisco, California.

"Pfizer has an established track record of bringing innovative therapies to
patients suffering with pain and inflammation," said Martin Mackay, Ph.D.,
president, Pfizer Global Research and Development. "Data to be presented at ACR
confirm our clinical approaches in developing these three compounds -
CP-690,550, esreboxetine and tanezumab - as potential new medicines to provide
relief from these serious medical conditions."

Rheumatoid Arthritis

Data is being presented from several clinical trials studying CP-690,550, an
oral medication that inhibits the Janus Kinase enzyme (JAK). This enzyme plays a
major role in controlling the activation and proliferation of white blood cells,
key elements of the immune system, which play a major role in rheumatoid
arthritis (RA). CP-690,550 has shown encouraging results for the treatment of
rheumatoid arthritis at doses that don't appear to be associated with excessive
immune suppression.

Investigators will present interim results from a late-breaking Phase 2B study
evaluating the activity of CP-690,550 in combination with methotrexate, the most
commonly-used RA treatment. Approximately 60 percent of patients on doses at or
above 3 mg of CP-690,550 responded to treatment as compared to 37.7 percent on
placebo. These data confirm and extend the promising data seen in an earlier
phase 2A study to this longer, 12 week study, and to patients who are already
taking methotrexate to treat their rheumatoid arthritis.

Also being presented is a pharmacokinetic drug interaction study which showed
that CP-690,550 and methotrexate can be co-administered without dose adjustment.
In addition, preliminary results from an open label extension study will be
presented.

In these studies, the most commonly reported adverse events were nausea,
headache, dizziness, disorientation, hot flushes, urinary tract infections,
diarrhea and liver function tests.

Larger and longer phase 3 studies are expected to start in 2009 to help further
define the benefits and risks of CP-690,550 as a potential treatment for
rheumatoid arthritis.

According to the Arthritis Foundation, 1.3 million Americans live with
rheumatoid arthritis, a type of arthritis that can be severe, debilitating,
deforming and even shorten life.

Osteoarthritis Pain

Pfizer continues to research new ways of treating osteoarthritis pain. Two
studies to be presented highlight a new compound in development and new data for
Celebrex (celecoxib) in the treatment of osteoarthritis pain.

Results from a Phase 2 study exploring the safety and efficacy of tanezumab, a
novel biologic designed to block nerve growth factor, show that treatment once
every eight weeks may significantly decrease pain in patients suffering from
moderate to severe osteoarthritis pain in the knee. In the trial, approximately
75 percent of patients in both the tanezumab 100 and 200 (mu)g/kg treatment
groups experienced a 50 percent reduction in knee pain as compared to 26 percent
of patients in the placebo group. In the study, the most common adverse events
associated with tanezumab include headache, upper respiratory tract infection,
paresthesia (abnormal sensations), hypoesthesia (decreased sensations) and
arthralgia (joint aches).

Another late-breaking study evaluated continuous use of daily Celebrex
treatment over a 22-week period compared to intermittent use of the medicine in
preventing spontaneous OA flares. The study showed that continuous use resulted
in 42 percent fewer OA flare episodes than the intermittent use. The results
from the study also demonstrated that there were no significant differences in
overall adverse events between the intermittent and continuous use groups.

According to the Arthritis Foundation, osteoarthritis affects 27 million
Americans. Recent data show that one in two Americans are at risk for knee
osteoarthritis over their lifetime. Loss of joint function as a result of
osteoarthritis is a major cause of work disability.

Fibromyalgia

Pfizer is a pioneer in the study of fibromyalgia, investing many years of
research into treatment options for this complex pain condition. In June 2007,
Lyrica (pregabalin) CV became the first FDA-approved treatment for the
management of fibromyalgia. Data supporting that approval showed Lyrica patients
experienced significant reduction in pain as early as week one in some patients.

While widespread pain is the cornerstone of fibromyalgia, the condition is also
characterized by other hallmark symptoms such as fatigue and difficulty
concentrating.

Data presented at ACR will highlight the results of a phase 2 proof of concept
study with esreboxetine, a highly selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor in
a fibromyalgia population.

Data from this study showed that esreboxetine may be effective in relieving in
key fibromyalgia symptoms, including pain, function and fatigue and was
generally well tolerated. In the study, 43 percent of patients receiving
esreboxetine reported their condition was much improved or very much improved as
compared to 23 percent of placebo-treated patients.

The most common side effects compared to placebo were constipation, insomnia,
dry mouth, headache and nausea. The proportion of patients who discontinued as a
result of adverse events was 8.2 percent in the esreboxetine group and 2.3
percent in the placebo treatment group.

Fibromyalgia has been recognized by the professional community for over 30 years
as a common, chronic widespread pain condition and is now thought to affect up
to six million Americans. Recent evidence suggests a neurological basis to
fibromyalgia, as demonstrated by brain scans and altered levels of certain
neurotransmitters.

About Pfizer's Investor Briefing at ACR

On Tuesday, October 28 at 6:00 p.m. PCT, Pfizer will host a briefing for
analysts and investors to review data presented at the meeting on candidates in
Pfizer's pain and inflammation portfolio.

About Celebrex

CELEBREX is indicated for the relief of the signs and symptoms of
osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis in adults and ankylosing spondylitis, and

&lt;p&gt;Oi, Microsoft and Gemalto Partner to Launch Windows(R) Live Messenger Through Oi SIM Chip

       This worldwide innovation will first be launched in Brazil
RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil--(Business Wire)--
Oi, the first quadri-play operator in Brazil, today announces that
it will launch, in the first week of November, Windows Live Messenger
services built into Oi's SIM card, in partnership with Microsoft and
Gemalto. This worldwide innovation means that users who buy a new Oi
SIM card will have direct access to Messenger functionalities in any
Oi mobile phone. The new features will first be available for
customers in all States where Oi operates.

   Customers will benefit from a ready-to-use application featuring a
menu for easy and quick navigation and guaranteed security and
privacy. This new version of Messenger will have the same features as
in a PC, such as viewing or blocking contacts, changing the status to
on-line, off-line, absent or busy, and keeping several chat sessions
open simultaneously. Each message sent to a contact using the service
will cost 31 cents of a 'real' (about 0.1 Euro).

   To experience Messenger over the mobile phone, there is no need to
download an application or register for the service, users can access
the Mundo Oi (Oi World) menu, select their type of user account and
enter an address and password to make a connection. While the user is
on-line on Messenger, it is still possible to make and receive calls
as usual.

   Microsoft has over 39 million Windows Live Messenger users in
Brazil, the largest base in the world. This innovation through Oi's
SIM card will create an additional channel, offering anytime, anywhere
access.

   "Oi is known for its value added services innovation based on SIM
cards. This is one of the latest services we added to their SIM
services portfolio", stated Henry Trejgier, Latin America Marketing
Director of Gemalto's Telecom business unit.

   "We've always believed in services capable of making our
customers' lives more convenient. They will access Windows Live
Messenger in a simpler and faster manner, using the Oi Chip menu. Our
partnership with Gemalto and Microsoft will provide a large scale
service. This business has a great growth potential in Brazil, where
135 million people have mobile telephones, but only 44 million are
connected to the internet", says Gustavo Alvim, Oi VAS Director.

   According to Microsoft Brazil On-line Consumer Market general
director, Osvaldo Barbosa de Oliveira, the partnership with Oi will
benefit current and new users of both Oi and Windows Live Messenger.
"Consumers may choose to be on-line and in contact with friends
whenever they wish, either on a PC or on a mobile phone, using a
service they are familiar with via a simple and friendly interface".

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Oct 29 (Reuters) - Energy pricing agency Platts
has lifted its review on Goldman Sachs (GS.N) that had
prevented Wall Street's biggest oil trader from making a market
in benchmark prices, sources familiar with the move said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman was placed under review just over two weeks ago,
making it the last in a series of major banks to be restricted
from trading in a key half-hour price assessment window as
Platts stepped up its monitoring of counterparty credit risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The review has been completed and they are allowed to
trade again without any restrictions," said a source who was
briefed on the matter, who didn't want to be named because he
was not authorised to comment officially.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The original concern seems to have been deemed to be
unfounded," the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two further sources confirmed the review had been lifted
and Goldman's trading arm J Aron was free to make markets
again, allowing them to place bids and offers in the trading
window that Platts uses to help establish the price for
hundreds of opaque, over-the-counter physical oil and energy
products every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The restrictions on Goldman came at a time when the global
credit crisis and financial market turmoil is constricting
trade across commodity markets and heightening credit anxiety
among traders as once blue-chip financial institutions founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Platts does not have the resources or the remit to
assess a company's credit status, its officials have said it
must sometimes limit the activities of some companies in the
window when faced with issues -- including credit concerns
raised by other participants -- that threaten to skew its
prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's review had not been as severe as those placed
earlier on some rivals, who were effectively barred from
participating in the half-hour window.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even under the review Goldman's trading arm J Aron had been
able to trade during the window -- and Platts took those trades
into account -- but it was not able to submit bids and offers
to make a market during the assessment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders have said, however, that Goldman stayed absent from
the window during the review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs corporate communications and a Platts
spokesman in Singapore declined official comment. Platts, a
unit of McGraw-Hill MHP.N, declines to confirm or deny any
specific reviews of companies taking part in its assessment
process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is not uncommon to be under Platts review for things
such as violating the rules of trade or delivering
off-specification product, essentially a punitive measure with
different levels of severity, the toughest of which is known as
"boxing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But until recently, Platts, which competes with Thomson
Reuters in providing news and information to the energy
markets, was less likely to start a review because of credit
concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It placed Lehman Brothers, which had a much smaller energy
trading operation, under review in July, about two months
before the bank collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was not immediately clear whether a review on rival
Morgan Stanley (MS.N), imposed in September, had been lifted.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO Oct 28 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
fed, housed and paid Nigerian military forces involved in a
deadly clash with local residents occupying an oil platform
more than a decade ago, a jury was told on Tuesday at a federal
trial in which the oil company is accused of human rights
abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The accusations stem from May 1998, when about 100 people
occupied Chevron's Parabe platform off the coast of West Africa
for three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case in San Francisco District Court was brought
against Chevron by Larry Bowoto, one of the occupiers of the
platform, under the Alien Tort Claims Act. The act, dating back
to 1789, allows foreigners to sue over human rights abuses
committed in their countries by a U.S. organization or someone
acting on behalf of a U.S. organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In opening arguments, lawyer Dan Stormer, speaking for the
plaintiffs, said the forces that landed on Parabe to retake the
platform were on Chevron's payroll and supervised by the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Parabe, nine miles (15 km) off the coast, accounted for a
fifth of Chevron's daily crude oil output of 400,000 barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hostage-taking and ransom demands are a regular hazard for
oil companies working in the impoverished Niger Delta, where
residents say they do not benefit from the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stormer said two men died and many were injured in the
clash between the protestors and armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trial will decide if Chevron, based in San Ramon,
California, is responsible for injuries suffered by villagers
and one of the deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People who occupied Parabe called it a peaceful protest by
unarmed villagers who accused Chevron of polluting their water,
causing the supply of fish, one of their main food sources, and
vegetation to dwindle, and turning the village's soil to acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's lawyer Bob Mittelstaedt told jurors the case was
"about the right and duty of a company to protect its workers"
and that the protest was not a peaceful but a "hostile" one
that put its workers' lives at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron employees said the protesters were armed with long
knives and "poured diesel on the barge and threatened to set it
on fire," Mittelstaedt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stormer countered that a Chevron employee sent a fax to the
U.S. embassy during the conflict saying "the villagers were
unarmed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mittelstaedt, while expressing sympathy for the families of
those who were harmed, said the use of military support to
break up the protest was "a decision any employee would want
their company to make."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trial is due to resume on Wednesday.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The next upgrade of Office business software from Microsoft Corp will include a version that edits word processing documents and spreadsheets inside a Web browser, the software maker said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The online version of Office, which includes the Word and Excel programs, aims to prevent competitors such as Google Inc from pecking away at Microsoft's dominance in software used by office workers and expand the market for one of its most profitable products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft would not comment on when it plans to release the next version of Office, dubbed "Office 14," but in the past it has shipped an upgrade every two to three years. It introduced the current Office suite of programs in January 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said Office Web applications will offer lightweight, online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint presentation software and the OneNote collaboration program. Office files can be managed and edited on a normal desktop computer, a Web browser or a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, has seen a wave of competitors from Web start-ups to Google offering word processing, presentation and spreadsheet software over the Internet for free with advertising or a monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody, none of our competitors, will do as good of a job on the phone, the browser or the PC," said Chris Capossela, a senior vice president at Microsoft's Office business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company announced the news at the Professional Developer's Conference, Microsoft's annual gathering of engineers to detail the company's future plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has mostly resisted the push to make its Office suite available online, choosing to sell licenses to run the applications locally on a single computer. It allows users to share files through Office Live, which is free with advertising or available with more functions for a monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Apps, a free suite of Web services aimed at business users, includes calendar, collaboration, e-mail and messaging software, as well as online spreadsheets and word processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's announcement did not surprise David Girouard, president of Google's enterprise division, who saw the move as an endorsement of its business model for running programs in its powerful data centers and delivering those applications as services over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's an acknowledgment of all the progress we've made with Google Apps in the last 18 months," said Girouard, noting that Google has 10 million business users running Google Apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUPPORTED BY ADVERTISING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said the new Office Web applications will be available for consumers on Office Live, although it did not disclose whether it would be paid for by advertising or subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For large corporate customers, they can either pay for a license to run those applications online using their own computer servers, or run those programs in Microsoft's data centers for a monthly fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said users will be able to view Word documents or Excel spreadsheets in the same way regardless of whether they are using a Web browser or on a standard desktop. The online Office version also has a similar look and feel to the desktop applications, albeit with less functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Office Web applications will work on Internet Explorer, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple Inc's Safari browsers. They will be available for a technical preview sometime this year, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capossela sees the applications expanding the base of Office users, notably employees who do not work on a computer sitting on a desk -- nurses, truck drivers or factory workers -- but require some business software accessible over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also offers, Capossela notes, the opportunity to make money in the form of advertising or subscriptions for a software product that is heavily pirated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a huge number of users. Very few pay us. There is a huge opportunity for us in this space because we can get revenue from people we are not getting anything from," said Capossela, who did not elaborate on the effect the new service would have on Office's profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the September quarter, Microsoft's Office business division was the biggest revenue and profit driver, outgaining even its bread-and-butter Windows unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the previous fiscal year, the Office unit generated $18.9 billion in revenue and $12.4 billion in profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Derek Caney and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CORRECTING and REPLACING FullArmor PolicyPortal Updated for Windows Azure, Microsoft's Cloud Platform

BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Please replace the release dated October 27, 2008 with the
following corrected version due to multiple revisions.

   The corrected release reads:

   FullArmor PolicyPortal Updated for Windows Azure, Microsoft's
Cloud Platform

   Windows Azure Gives PolicyPortal Customer Scalability across the
Internet

   FullArmor, a leader in enterprise policy management, today
announced that PolicyPortal, a web based end-to-end policy and
compliance management solution, has been updated for Windows Azure,
Microsoft Corp.'s cloud platform. PolicyPortal with Windows Azure
provides a scalable, secure solution for laptop and desktop management
across the internet.

   From a web based Silverlight console, PolicyPortal provides IT
administrators the ability to secure and manage remote PCs. This new
version expands the scope of management beyond Group Policy settings
to include delivery of virtual applications via Microsoft's App-V,
documents, and PowerShell script enforcement.

   "Our goal with PolicyPortal is to help customers reduce the cost
of managing their endpoints," said Danny Kim, CTO of FullArmor.
"PolicyPortal with Windows Azure provides increased scalability so
that we can deliver end-to-end policy management to more users through
the cloud."

   The government of Ethiopia is diligently working to deploy
PolicyPortal along with new laptops to 30,000 teachers. If this
program deems successful, it hopes to be able to expand its scope and
reach up to 250,000 teachers in the future. They need to deploy,
secure, and manage these machines throughout the country however they
do not have a centralized, scalable data center. PolicyPortal with
Windows Azure is an ideal solution. PolicyPortal enables the
deployment of custom teacher applications through the cloud using
Microsoft's App-V and secures them using Group Policy.

   "Microsoft's Windows Azure technology with FullArmor's
PolicyPortal is especially important in our case as it helps us
overcome our infrastructure challenges in managing the many remote
computers throughout our school systems," said Kiross Bitew, Capacity
Building Head for the Government of Tigray Ethiopia.

   "We are excited that FullArmor is using Windows Azure to help the
Ethiopian government scale their environment and help upgrade the
quality of their education system," said Steven Martin, Senior
Director, Connected Systems Division at Microsoft. "Our goal in
building Azure and extending the Windows platform to the cloud has
been to engender the kind of innovation Full Armor demonstrates in
bringing the full value of cloud computing to customers like this in
software + services solutions."

   About FullArmor

enforce endpoint security policies across the extended enterprise by

&lt;p&gt; (Adds delay in pricing of CCE bond issue)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 28 (Reuters) - Standard  Poor's on Tuesday
revised the outlook on ratings of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and its
two main bottling units to "negative," and said the company's
more aggressive financial policy has hurt its credit quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Weak economic conditions in select markets and volatile
commodity costs have pressured the Coke system's operating
performance," SP analyst Jean Stout said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency views Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) and
Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling (CCHB) as a system and analyzes
them on a consolidated basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP currently has an "A-plus" rating on Coca-Cola, which is
its fifth-highest investment grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A negative outlook indicates the rating is more likely to
be cut over the next one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In response to the news, CCE delayed pricing a $1 billion
bond issue announced earlier, according to IFR, a publication
of Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is planning to offer five-year notes at an
indicated price of 462.5 basis points over Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of Sept. 26, Coca-Cola had about $11.7 billion of debt,
while CCE had $10.4 billion of debt. CCHB had an estimated 2
billion euros of debt as of June 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we believe that reduced share repurchases at Coke
could restore some financial flexibility to the Coke system,
weakening macroeconomic conditions, as well as future
acquisitions at Coke, CCE or CCHB will likely further weaken
Coke system credit measures," said Stout.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds delay in pricing of CCE bond issue)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 28 (Reuters) - Standard  Poor's on Tuesday
revised the outlook on ratings of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and its
two main bottling units to "negative," and said the company's
more aggressive financial policy has hurt its credit quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Weak economic conditions in select markets and volatile
commodity costs have pressured the Coke system's operating
performance," SP analyst Jean Stout said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency views Coca-Cola, Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE) and
Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling (CCHB) as a system and analyzes
them on a consolidated basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP currently has an "A-plus" rating on Coca-Cola, which is
its fifth-highest investment grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A negative outlook indicates the rating is more likely to
be cut over the next one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In response to the news, CCE delayed pricing a $1 billion
bond issue announced earlier, according to IFR, a publication
of Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is planning to offer five-year notes at an
indicated price of 462.5 basis points over Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of Sept. 26, Coca-Cola had about $11.7 billion of debt,
while CCE had $10.4 billion of debt. CCHB had an estimated 2
billion euros of debt as of June 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we believe that reduced share repurchases at Coke
could restore some financial flexibility to the Coke system,
weakening macroeconomic conditions, as well as future
acquisitions at Coke, CCE or CCHB will likely further weaken
Coke system credit measures," said Stout.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments from Google)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Oct 28 (Reuters) - The next upgrade of Office
business software from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will include a
version that edits word processing documents and spreadsheets
inside a Web browser, the software maker said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The online version of Office, which includes the Word and
Excel programs, aims to prevent competitors such as Google Inc
(GOOG.O) from pecking away at Microsoft's dominance in software
used by office workers and expand the market for one of its
most profitable products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft would not comment on when it plans to release the
next version of Office, dubbed "Office 14," but in the past it
has shipped an upgrade every two to three years. It introduced
the current Office suite of programs in January 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said Office Web applications will offer
lightweight, online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint
presentation software and the OneNote collaboration program.
Office files can be managed and edited on a normal desktop
computer, a Web browser or a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, has seen a
wave of competitors from Web start-ups to Google offering word
processing, presentation and spreadsheet software over the
Internet for free with advertising or a monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Nobody, none of our competitors, will do as good of a job
on the phone, the browser or the PC," said Chris Capossela, a
senior vice president at Microsoft's Office business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company announced the news at the Professional
Developer's Conference, Microsoft's annual gathering of
engineers to detail the company's future plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has mostly resisted the push to make its Office
suite available online, choosing to sell licenses to run the
applications locally on a single computer. It allows users to
share files through Office Live, which is free with advertising
or available with more functions for a monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google Apps, a free suite of Web services aimed at business
users, includes calendar, collaboration, e-mail and messaging
software, as well as online spreadsheets and word processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's announcement did not surprise David Girouard,
president of Google's enterprise division, who saw the move as
an endorsement of its business model for running programs in
its powerful data centers and delivering those applications as
services over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's an acknowledgment of all the progress we've made with
Google Apps in the last 18 months," said Girouard, noting that
Google has 10 million business users running Google Apps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SUPPORTED BY ADVERTISING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said the new Office Web applications will be
available for consumers on Office Live, although it did not
disclose whether it would be paid for by advertising or
subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For large corporate customers, they can either pay for a
license to run those applications online using their own
computer servers, or run those programs in Microsoft's data
centers for a monthly fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said users will be able to view Word documents or
Excel spreadsheets in the same way regardless of whether they
are using a Web browser or on a standard desktop. The online
Office version also has a similar look and feel to the desktop
applications, albeit with less functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new Office Web applications will work on Internet
Explorer, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Safari
browsers. They will be available for a technical preview
sometime this year, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capossela sees the applications expanding the base of
Office users, notably employees who do not work on a computer
sitting on a desk -- nurses, truck drivers or factory workers
-- but require some business software accessible over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also offers, Capossela notes, the opportunity to make
money in the form of advertising or subscriptions for a
software product that is heavily pirated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have a huge number of users. Very few pay us. There is
a huge opportunity for us in this space because we can get
revenue from people we are not getting anything from," said
Capossela, who did not elaborate on the effect the new service
would have on Office's profit margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the September quarter, Microsoft's Office business
division was the biggest revenue and profit driver, outgaining
even its bread-and-butter Windows unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the previous fiscal year, the Office unit generated
$18.9 billion in revenue and $12.4 billion in profit.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NV, Oct 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM Information on Demand Conference -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled
new software and services to support businesses of all sizes as they
address efficiency-related challenges in dealing with the energy crisis
and creating environmental business metrics.

    According to the U.S. Department of Energy, the price of energy will
continue to rise over the next 25 years as global demand is poised to grow
by 57 percent. Rising energy costs, regulatory mandates, the exponential
growth of information, and data center capacity shortages are driving
organizations to consider more power-efficient ways of doing business.
IBM's announcement today, including new software designed to reduce energy
consumption by more than 35 percent -- such as new solutions based on IBM
Enterprise Content Management and the new version of Lotus Notes and
Domino 8.5 -- addresses these concerns bringing together experience and
capabilities across IBM hardware, software, IBM Global Business Services
and Research.

    "Organizations today are under increasing pressures to become more energy
efficient and environmentally responsible," said Art Gloster, vice
president for information systems, Bryant University. "At Bryant
University, IBM software is providing us the ability to monitor and reduce
power consumption and we've embarked on a project to consolidate and
reduce the size of our data center, providing us an estimated savings of
15 percent in facility overhead, power and cooling costs. IBM's approach
to addressing energy and environmental concerns spans hardware, software
and services to help us reduce both expenditures and our energy
consumption."

    Eliminating the Burden of Paper

    The continued use of paper to record critical business transactions can
weigh organizations down with related costs, compliance risks, as well as
environmental challenges. New IBM Content Collection and Archiving
software provides de-duplication and integration with records retention
services that help reduce customers' storage and electronic discovery
costs while simultaneously helping customers to manage not just e-mails,
but also integrate to a common Enterprise Content Management
infrastructure to manage other content types. A recent IBM No Paper
Weight study, indicates that when companies stop printing their "born
digital" documents, paper consumption can be reduced between 80-90
percent. The newest version of IBM FileNet Business Process Manager also
helps customers in their move to a paperless environment by streamlining
business processes, eliminating redundancies, unnecessary papers trails
and reducing content storage costs.

    Built upon IBM FileNet Business Process Manager and IBM FileNet Content
Manager, IBM Business Partner, Imagine Solutions, is also launching a new
Paperless Lending Solution for lenders that rely on the processing of
large amounts of paper-based documentation in their business
transactions. Designed to help reduce underwriting costs and improve loan
approval processing, the new solution typically saves in excess of $75 per
loan.

    New Software from Across IBM Drives Better Efficiency

    The next significant release of Lotus Notes 8.5 and Domino e-mail and
collaboration software, expected to be available in the first quarter,
2009, includes a new efficiency feature called Domino Attachment Object
Service. This ensures that only one copy of the file attachment is kept on
each mail server helping companies benefit by eliminating the use of
valuable storage hardware and software resources including floor space,
energy and related costs. The savings due to reduced storage space
requirements for Lotus Notes and Lotus Domino is expected to be on the
average of 35 percent for each business. IBM Lotus Notes version 8.5 will
also make it easier to find content stored on an IBM Lotus Connections
server so that the content does not need to be present in every mail file.

    IBM has combined the capabilities of Tivoli Usage and Accounting Manager
software with Tivoli Monitoring for Energy Management to enable
organizations to meter and charge back energy costs within their own
enterprise. For example, a manufacturer can collect energy and power
consumption data from across the organization and determine how energy is
being consumed by individual, application, service, machine or department.
Using a simple dashboard, it also helps quickly identify and analyze the
top energy users, wasters and use trends.

    To help companies more effectively use IT assets to reduce energy
consumption, IBM is announcing a new product, IBM Rational Test Lab
Manager and new capabilities in Telelogic System Architect. Available
today, Rational Test Lab Manager configures, builds and effectively
manages the use of physical and virtual machines to help conserve energy
while reducing operating costs and hardware demands. Available later this
year, Telelogic System Architect's new analytics and reporting
capabilities will help organizations establish a blueprint for energy
impact analysis. For example, the new Telelogic System Architect features
provide analysis and virtualization of current and future power
consumption by location, application, processes, strategies and staff,
while executive reports help organizations plan greener IT initiatives,
resulting in more energy-efficient and cost-effective business
operations. Organizations will be able to download the new Telelogic
System Architect capabilities at no cost from IBM.

    Also available, an updated SmartSOA Sandbox from IBM provides enterprises
with in-depth information about how IBM SOA middleware can help with smart
energy management enabled by SOA.

    Combining software across IBM's portfolio, C-Lock Technology, Inc. and IBM
Premiere Business Partner Enterprise Information Management, Inc. (EIM)
have released a new beta version of a greenhouse gas meter called
GreenCert. Developed on IBM technologies including WebSphere Portal,
Lotus and Information Management software, GreenCert helps organizations
in multiple industries measure, verify, and report Greenhouse Gas (GHG)
emissions with an emphasis on carbon management. The new version is in
testing with power and utility plants in the United States and Europe.

    Additionally, a new Energy and Environment Self-Assessment Tool will soon
be available to help guide customers in improving energy efficiency across
the enterprise. The online tool, available at no cost, analyzes the
current status of an organization and recommends steps that can be taken
to address issues such as compliance mandates, the reduction of paper
use, and improving energy efficiency, for example.

    IBM has created a new technical validation team to help Business Partners
and IT professionals create innovative solutions to reduce energy use and
lower the impact of IT on the environment. This team will provide access
to technical workshops, expert IBM technical support, and IBM technology
through a worldwide network of 41 IBM Innovation Centers. In addition, IBM
is providing marketing resources to partners such as access to a virtual
client event package utilizing Lotus Sametime Unyte Events technology.

    Clean tech and energy-related areas represent one of the largest growth
areas for venture capital investment. By working through IBM's Venture
Capital Group, venture capitalists and their portfolio companies can take
advantage of today's announcement to help drive innovation for their
customers and gain access to IBM's worldwide partner ecosystem.

    The new software complements the work of IBM Global Business Services in
providing a range of consulting offerings to help address these issues
from a business strategy standpoint. This includes the IBM "Green
Sigma(TM)" consulting offering to help reduce energy and water usage
throughout a company's operations; a Carbon Tradeoff Modeler to help
evaluate and balance carbon and energy usage throughout the supply chain;
and Environmental Product Lifecycle Management offerings. With today's
announcements, broad portfolio, deep expertise and business process
transformation skills, IBM is expanding its global effort to help
customers take action on energy, the environment, and sustainability.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and DEERFIELD BEACH, FL, Oct 28 (MARKET
WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and World Omni Financial Corp. (World Omni) are joining
forces to boost the customer satisfaction, quality and operating
efficiency for which the automotive servicing company is known. World
Omni and its subsidiaries will now use IBM FileNet software, which will
increase its straight-through processing and result in the automatic
adjudication of previously manual work steps.

    The relationship will allow World Omni's CenterOne Financial Services
(CenterOne) third-party servicing unit to access critical information on
demand and take its services to a new level of operating excellence. As a
result of using FileNet, work is completed faster with a lower degree of
errors and edits. The company has also gained the capacity to monitor
process performance metrics using IBM Cognos.

    "Communication is where information management becomes critical," said
Sanjay Rishi, vice president and global automotive industry leader for IBM
and author of the company's IBM Automotive 2020 Global Study. "World
Omni's CenterOne unit is making customer service and quality a top
priority as they put accurate, real-time information at the fingertips of
their customer service associates. Such information translates to
effective customer interactions that result in customer satisfaction and
loyalty."

    CenterOne embarked on a business process re-engineering effort last year
aimed at optimizing key aspects of its operations. This included
streamlining processes, the on-going training of associates to handle
exception processes instead of manual or repetitive work, and investing in
and effectively leveraging information systems and supporting technology.
 The goal was to build a business/information technology framework -- an
Information Agenda -- that would allow its disparate systems to more
effectively collaborate in support of business objectives

    According to the recent IBM Automotive 2020 Global Study, by the year 2020
consumers will be better informed, more demanding and more environmentally
conscious when it comes to purchasing vehicles. As a result, communication
will continue to be a vital tool in retaining valued customers.

    "CenterOne provides a sophisticated suite of account servicing solutions,"
said Larry Williams, assistant vice president of Business/Process
Re-engineering for CenterOne. "Our business is subject to marketplace
regulations and varied client requirements, which increase the challenge
of structuring effective and consistent business processes. It's a
complicated business, but by developing an Information Agenda, we have
been able to achieve real business process transformation that will
increase our efficiency while improving our quality and customer service.
We believe this will help us build customer loyalty and position
CenterOne for cost-effective growth."

    Using IBM's FileNet enterprise content management and business
intelligence software from IBM Cognos, CenterOne is increasing the
productivity and quality of its operations and effectiveness of its
associates through process automation. The company has also gained a
business process management capability that it is using to improve
additional processes throughout the business. Also, an additional benefit
resulting from the use of IBM's content management technology is that the
company has reduced its paper usage by approximately 169,000 pages
annually.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group Inc tumbled on Tuesday on speculation the banks might be caught on the wrong side of a trade involving German automaker Volkswagen AG, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley shares were down $1.67, or 12 percent, at $12.06 after falling as low as $10.15. Goldman slid $5.98, or 6.3 percent, to $87.01, after dropping as low as $82.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley spokesman Mark Lake said the company does not have any exposure to Volkswagen. Goldman declined to comment, citing its policy of not responding to market speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources inside Goldman told Reuters the company had no significant losses tied to Volkswagen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There have been several 'black swan' events occurring in the markets, and there are concerns that they will lead to large losses," said James Ellman, president of Seacliff Capital.

Shares of Societe Generale, the French bank, fell as much as 17.5 percent on speculation it also made a bad bet on VW stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Trone, an analyst at Fox-Pitt Kelton Cochran Caronia Waller, said Morgan Stanley shares might also be down because of "problematic 'self-fulfilling fear.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like peers that have either gone bankrupt or were forced to sell, we believe fundamentals were sound enough to overcome problem asset exposures, but there is no antidote for unbridled fear," Trone wrote.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Oct 28 (Reuters) - The next upgrade of Office
business software from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) will include a
version that edits word processing documents and spreadsheets
inside a Web browser, the software maker said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The online version of Office, which includes the Word and
Excel programs, aims to prevent competitors such as Google Inc
(GOOG.O) from pecking away at Microsoft's dominance in software
used by office workers, and expand the market for one of its
most profitable products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft would not comment on when it plans to release the
next version of Office, dubbed "Office 14," but in the past it
has shipped an upgrade every two to three years. It introduced
the current Office suite of programs in Jan. 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said Office Web applications will offer
lightweight, online versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint
presentation software and the OneNote collaboration program.
Office files can be managed and edited on a normal desktop
computer, a Web browser or a mobile phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, has seen a
wave of competitors from Web start-ups to Google offering word
processing, presentation and spreadsheet software over the
Internet for free with advertising or a monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google Docs offers spreadsheets, word processing, and
presentation software over the Internet as a free service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Nobody, none of our competitors, will do as good of a job
on the phone, the browser or the PC," said Chris Capossela, a
senior vice president at Microsoft's Office business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company announced the news at the Professional
Developer's Conference, Microsoft's annual gathering of
engineers to detail the company's future plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has mostly resisted the push to make its Office
suite available online, choosing to sell licenses to run the
applications locally on a single computer. It allows users to
share files through Office Live, which is free with advertising
or available with more functions for a monthly subscription.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the September quarter, Microsoft's Office business
division was the biggest revenue and profit driver, outgaining
even its bread-and-butter Windows unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the previous fiscal year, the Office unit generated
$18.9 billion in revenue and $12.4 billion in profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ADVERTISING FUNDED?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said the new Office Web applications will be
available for consumers on Office Live, although it did not
disclose whether it would be paid for by advertising or
subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For large corporate customers, they can either pay for a
license to run those applications online using their own
computer servers, or run those programs in Microsoft's data
centers for a monthly fee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said users will be able to view Word documents or
Excel spreadsheets in the same way regardless of whether they
are using a Web browser or on a standard desktop. The online
Office version also has a similar look and feel to the desktop
applications, albeit with less functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new Office Web applications will work on Internet
Explorer, Mozilla's Firefox and Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) Safari
browsers. They will be available for a technical preview
sometime this year, according to Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capossela sees the applications expanding the base of
Office users, notably employees who don't work on a computer
sitting on a desk -- nurses, truck drivers or factory workers
-- but require some business software accessible over the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also offers, Capossela notes, the opportunity to make
money in the form of advertising or subscriptions for a
software product that is heavily pirated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have a huge number of users. Very few pay us. There is
a huge opportunity for us in this space because we can get
revenue from people we are not getting anything from," said
Capossela, who did not elaborate on the effect the new service
would have on Office's profit margins.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - In a US national survey, the risk of heart attack was increased fourfold among young adults who had used cocaine more than 10 times in their lifetimes, report researchers from the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this nationally representative population, roughly 10 percent of the heart attacks in those aged 18 to 45 years were associated with a history of more than 10 lifetime episodes of cocaine use, Dr. Murray A. Mittleman and his colleagues report in the American Journal of Cardiology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recognition of this association between cocaine use and heart attack led the American Heart Association to issue a scientific statement earlier this year urging doctors to consider cocaine use in young adults with unusual cardiovascular or lung complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new findings stem from a look at data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, or NHANES III, conducted from 1988 to 1994. Among the nearly 12,000 participants aged 18 to 59 years in NHANES III, approximately 4.6 percent reported using cocaine more than 10 times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Mittleman and colleagues, the prevalence of heart attack among these subjects was roughly 3 times higher than among subjects who never used cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the 9,000 subjects aged 18 to 45 years, the risk of heart attack was roughly fourfold higher among the 5.7 percent who were frequent cocaine users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is concerning, the investigators say, given that cocaine use has increased from 14 percent in those aged 18 to 59 years in the NHANES III data to 19 percent in those aged 20 to 59 in the most recent NHANES survey conducted between 2005 and 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOURCE: American Journal of Cardiology, October 15, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

    Signed in the second quarter of 2008, the deal makes FI one of the world's
largest IBM System z mainframe customers.

    Finanz Informatik has been recently formed through the merger of
Sparkassen Informatik and FinanzIT and provides IT related services to
443 savings banks, ten state banks, ten building associations and
additional customers. Once all German Savings Banks are migrated to
OSPlus (FI's full-scope, flexible service-oriented banking solution),
more than 200,000 bank employees will rely on the services provided by
FI. FI expects a multi-million Euro savings potential based on the
synergistic effects that a unified IT infrastructure can bring. The
contract builds on existing relationships that the previous organizations
Sparkassen Informatik and FinanzIT had established with IBM in the past
and lays the ground for future development.

    "The extended agreement with IBM is an important building block for the
future growth of Finanz Informatik," said Franz-Theo Brockhoff, Deputy
Chairman of the Board of Finanz Informatik. "Based on the long positive
experience we have made with IBM and their infrastructure solutions and
services, we feel well prepared for the future."

    The continued general technology collaboration with IBM will help enable
FI to improve the performance and cost structure of FI's IT platform. FI
plans to use IBM's consultancy expertise and proactive service to
transform their IT infrastructure into a more energy efficient,
consolidated and flexible next generation of data centers. The ongoing
further development of FI's core banking solution OSPlus and the
framework given for continuous technology refreshes provide the
flexibility for further growth in terms of number of clients,
transactions and applications.

    "Finanz Informatik is one of the most important European market players in
providing IT services for financial institutes and needs an infrastructure
that can help reduce energy consumption, improve transactions and have
security levels in place while thousands of users access its system every
second," says Harald Fischer, Director Savings Banks Service Provider,
Financial Services Sector, IBM Germany. "The IBM Systems Technology is the
cornerstone of the new enterprise today, and we're pleased to continue our
long relationship with Finanz Informatik to streamline their data center
and give them the technology advantages they need to maximize their
offerings in today's competitive environment."

&lt;p&gt;VISANOW Highlights Impact of Increased Enforcement Surrounding Labor Certification Process

    Leading Immigration Solution Provider Outlines Implications of
    Expected Changes on Corporate HR Departments and Suggests Best
                               Practices
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
The Department of Labor (DOL) recently increased enforcement of
the existing regulations involved in filing Program Electronic Review
Management (PERM) labor certification applications to help further
reduce any fraudulent activity or misuse of the process. In addition,
the DOL announced plans to introduce new measures in the coming months
that would impact employers who hire foreign nationals to work in the
United States.

   Labor certification - a key stage of the more commonly referred to
employment-based "Green Card" process - requires specific recruitment
activities on behalf of the employer to demonstrate the need to hire a
foreign applicant. Issued by the DOL, a permanent labor certification
is the first step in the process allowing an employer to hire a
foreign worker for permanent employment in the U.S.

   Below, leading immigration solution provider VISANOW outlines
expected revisions and recommendations for employers to ensure they
can successfully prepare for the impact of such changes:

   1. Increase in PERM Audits: Both targeted and random PERM audits,
as well as supervised recruitment, are expected to increase possibly
resulting in the audit of one of every two PERM applications. PERM
audits require additional information outlining the actual minimum
requirements of a position, the associated recruitment effort or other
outside issues that may impact the application. Audits must be
responded to within 30 days and can significantly extend the
adjudication process.

   Recommendation: Document all case and recruitment activity -
Monitoring and tracking multiple forms, recruitment activities and
filing deadlines are crucial steps in filing a successful PERM
application. In addition, access to documented case and recruitment
history is critical if an application is selected for audit. VISANOW
recommends finding a legal services provider that leverages technology
to deliver real-time access to recruitment activity summaries and
centralized document tracking capabilities.

   2. Fraud Unit: The DOL will create a fraud unit that uses data
mining software to uncover inconsistencies in recruitment activities
by comparing the stated job requirements across all positions for
which a company files a PERM application. The goal is to identify
employers who do not recruit with consistent requirements for a
position and instead tailor these to a foreign worker's personal
qualifications.

   Recommendation: Ensure consistency across all application and
recruitment activities - Employers should take the necessary steps to
ensure they conduct coordinated and consistent recruitment activities
for all PERM applications. The DOL's incorporation of data mining
software will prioritize the importance of regularity on behalf of
employers and should further reduce any fraudulent use of the labor
certification process. Incorporating online recruitment management
tools, employers can electronically maintain and store the job
requirements for all positions, providing transparency and certain
compliance.

   3. New PERM/Labor Condition Application Portal: The DOL plans to
introduce a new PERM/Labor Condition Application portal on Jan. 1,
2009, to allow for easier comparison of job requirements across PERM
and H-1B cases to identify inconsistencies.

   Recommendation: Plan for continued increases in DOL enforcement
activities - Following the failure of Comprehensive Immigration Reform
measures in recent years, the DOL and United States Citizenship and
Immigration Services (USCIS) have taken additional steps to enforce
the current U.S. immigration policies. As the global hiring
environment continues to expand, these agencies will likely shift
their focus to enforcement of various immigration programs until a
workable reform solution can be implemented addressing the entire
system. Employers should prepare for the continued introduction of
more advanced monitoring measures as additional technological
solutions are incorporated into these enforcement activities.

&lt;p&gt;Integration Increases Business Productivity and Project Management
                               Adoption
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Clarizen, a provider of on-demand, online project management
software, today announced its integration with Microsoft Outlook,
allowing users to create and assign tasks, set task deadlines or
update the status of a task directly from their e-mails. This
development builds upon Clarizen's effort to make project management
solutions extremely intuitive and easy to use for everyday
professionals.

   E-mail has emerged as the primary means of communicating and
working within an organization. Project management tools like Clarizen
benefit everyday professionals and project managers who spend a large
part of their day on e-mail. The integration with Microsoft Outlook
provides an easier way for busy professionals to create, communicate
and track project actions from their e-mail work environment, enabling
the organization to concentrate on business decisions instead of
project tracking.

   By uniting Clarizen and Microsoft Outlook environments, managers
do not have to switch from their primary e-mail to a project
management system in order to assign new tasks, get project updates or
take the time to learn a new project management system. This
capability significantly decreases the resource and time requirements
for entering new project activities and for keeping project status
current. In addition, the integration also ensures that no action item
slips through the cracks, leading to an increased rate of on-time and
on-budget completion of projects.

   Highlights of the integration include:

   --  Clarizen plug-in to Microsoft Outlook - Users need to install
        a Clarizen plug-in, which creates a Clarizen action item icon
        in the user's Microsoft Outlook menu. In order to create a new
        task and assign it to a team member, a manager simply creates
        a new e-mail and clicks on the Clarizen action item icon. A
        project name field is created and the manager can select the
        project for which they want to assign tasks from an
        auto-populated list by the Clarizen-Outlook integration.

   --  Creating a task for a user - Once a project is selected, a
        manager sends an e-mail about the task to the person they are
        assigning the task to. Clarizen automatically creates a task
        within the selected project, assigns it to the person the
        e-mail was sent to and adds the content of the e-mail as the
        context for the task.

   --  User updates via e-mail - Team members are notified via a
        Clarizen e-mail when they are assigned a new task. Task status
        can be updated from within the notification e-mail by team
        members, which is reflected within Clarizen. Additionally,
        Clarizen keeps managers updated on the project status through
        e-mail notifications.

   "Effective project execution cannot be achieved by keeping the
project management and work environment separate," said Avinoam
Nowogrodski, CEO and co-founder of Clarizen. "By integrating the
Microsoft Outlook and Clarizen environments, managers and business
professionals can easily create and manage tasks and action items
within their e-mail system and assign them to specific projects while
they are in a meeting or working at their desk. This integration
significantly increases team accountability, keeps everyone on the
same page and, as a result, increases the success rate of projects
completed on-time and on-budget."

   Clarizen users can now download the Microsoft Outlook integration
at no additional cost at
http://www.clarizen.com/Downloads/OutlookAddin.aspx , while new users
are welcome to sign up for a free 30-day Clarizen trial at
https://app.clarizen.com/Clarizen/Pages/Service/Registration.aspx.

&lt;p&gt;Adeona Pharmaceuticals' Oral dnaJP1 Phase II Clinical Findings Presented At the
American College of Rheumatology Annual Meeting

ANN ARBOR, Mich., Oct. 28, 2008 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Adeona Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(AMEX:AEN), a specialty pharmaceutical company developing innovative late-stage
drug candidates for the treatment of autoimmune and central nervous system
diseases, announced today that its scientific collaborator presented new
findings from a 160-patient, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase II clinical
trial using oral dnaJP1 for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) at the
American College of Rheumatology (ACR) annual meeting in San Francisco, CA.

Oral dnaJP1 is an orally active epitope-specific immunotherapeutic molecule
derived from a family of heat shock proteins that contribute to autoimmune
inflammation in RA patients.

A presentation titled, "Susceptibility to Epitope-Specific Immunotherapy of
Rheumatoid Arthritis Relies on the Expression of Co-stimulatory Molecules
Associated with T-Cell Anergy and Tolerance" was given by Dr. Salvatore Albani,
chairman of the Department of Rheumatology at the University of Arizona and
inventor of this program (contributing authors and their respective affiliations
are listed below). Findings from the phase II clinical trial demonstrated that
clinical responders can be elicited in treated patients as defined by a
composite score known as ACR20, which is a standard efficacy measure that
requires at least a 20 percent improvement in a number of different measures of
rheumatoid arthritis disease activity. ACR scores are an FDA accepted
measurement of clinical efficacy. Immunological analyses in samples from
patients who were clinical responders at the end of the study showed a
statistically significant increase versus non-responders (p less than 0.05) in
expression of PD-1, B7-H1, B7-DC, CTLA-4 and FoxP3 before the initiation of the
treatment.

Dr. Albani commented, "These data suggest that an expression of a cluster of
molecules associated with T-cell tolerance and anergy may be a necessary
pre-requisite for clinical responses to treatment with oral dnaJP1. This
knowledge may be exploited in our upcoming clinical development plan."

Nicholas Stergis, Adeona's chief executive officer, commented, "We are pleased
to present these data to the scientific community. As we prepare for additional
clinical trials with oral dnaJP1 for the treatment of RA, these and other data
will be helpful in broadening our understanding of the mechanism of action of
this molecule. Oral dnaJP1's ability to tolerize harmful T-cells to this epitope
could represent a significant step forward for treating the 20 million RA
patients affected worldwide."

"We intend to request a meeting with the FDA to discuss our upcoming clinical
development strategy for oral dnaJP1 for the treatment of RA," Mr. Stergis
continued.

About Rheumatoid Arthritis

Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease that leads to pain,
stiffness, swelling and limitation in the motion and function of multiple
joints. If left untreated, RA may produce serious destruction of joints that
frequently leads to permanent disability. Although the joints are the principal
body part affected by RA, inflammation may develop in other organs as well. The
disease currently affects over two million Americans, almost one percent of the
population, and is two to three times more prevalent in women. Onset can occur
at any point in life but is most frequently manifested in the fourth and fifth
decades of life, with most patients developing the disease between the ages of
35 and 50. Over 20 million people suffer from rheumatoid arthritis worldwide,
and the global market is estimated at over $6.3 billion. DMARDs, including
biologics such as Enbrel(r), Humira(r), Cimzia(r), and Remicade(r), accounted
for nearly $5.0 billion of that figure. The global market for RA therapies has
been estimated at $13 Billion.

About Oral dnaJP1

Oral dnaJP1 is an epitope-specific immunotherapy for RA patients. Oral dnaJP1 is
a heat shock protein (hsp)-derived peptide which was previously identified as a
contributor of T-cell-mediated inflammation in RA. Immune responses to hsp are
often found at sites of inflammation and have an initially amplifying effect
that needs to be down-regulated to prevent tissue damage. The mechanisms for
this regulation involve T-cells with regulatory function that are specific for
hsp-derived antigens. This regulatory function is one of the key components of a
"molecular dimmer" whose physiologic function is to modulate inflammation
independently from its trigger. This function is impaired in autoimmunity and
could be restored for therapeutic purposes.

The mechanistic hypothesis is that mucosal tolerization to oral dnaJP1 could
determine immune tolerization primarily of T-cells and secondarily of APC. The
effects of immune tolerance are initially peptide-specific but affect
secondarily non-epitope specific pathways. Immune tolerance could translate into
clinical benefit.

About Adeona Pharmaceuticals, Inc.

Adeona Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a specialty pharmaceutical company that is
developing proprietary, late-stage drug candidates for the treatment of
autoimmune and central nervous system diseases. Adeona's strategy is to
exclusively in-license proprietary, clinical-stage drug candidates and to
complete the further clinical testing, manufacturing, regulatory requirements
and seek marketing authorizations. Adeona is focused on treating rheumatoid
arthritis (RA), dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD), multiple sclerosis
(MS), and fibromyalgia. For further information, please visit

&lt;p&gt;Managed-code application environment gives wide range of
          developers access to convergent processing platform
BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
At today's Embedded Systems Conference, Analog Devices Inc., and
AxiomFount Inc. announced the availability of the Microsoft .NET Micro
Framework on Analog Devices' popular Blackfin processors. The move
brings the popular managed-code application environment to the world's
only convergent processor family via AxiomFount's AxiDotNet and
integrated .NET Micro Framework solutions. This gives a broad
community of application developers easy access to high-performance
signal processing resources for the first time through Microsoft
Corp.'s widely adopted Visual Studio development tools. The move to
host .NET applications on Blackfin processors supports Microsoft's
focus on application development for media-rich embedded products
applications.

   "It is really exciting to see the growth in the capabilities and
complexity of today's embedded devices. More and more embedded
applications are integrating rich media features and sophisticated
processing needs. The Blackfin processor family is a great platform
for supporting these applications, and .NET brings greater programmer
productivity, especially when handling increasingly complex
programming tasks," said Colin Miller, product unit manager for the
.NET Micro Framework at Microsoft. "With version 3.0 of the .NET Micro
Framework, we are continuing to target the needs of embedded
developers with advanced programming models. Together we are providing
embedded developers with a development environment and a
high-performance platform for cutting-edge applications to run on."

   The ability to use Microsoft's Visual Studio tools with Blackfin
devices instantly gives a large community of software engineers,
already familiar with server and desktop application development in
the Microsoft .NET environment, access to the powerful convergent
processor family. The ability to utilize the larger pool of .NET
application developers in conjunction with specialized embedded
developers reduces development costs and schedules.

   "In the embedded environment, developing rich media applications
with high-end signal-processing algorithms has traditionally required
specialized engineering resources," said Jerry McGuire, vice president
of the General Purpose DSP group at Analog Devices. "Bringing the .NET
Micro Framework to the Blackfin family opens up convergent application
development to a much larger population that includes application
developers without traditional embedded software experience."

   The programming abstractions provided by the .NET Micro Framework
ease the development of embedded products, allowing applications to be
decoupled from the Blackfin hardware. In addition to full integration
with Visual Studio, the .NET Micro Framework software development kit
(SDK) is equipped with an emulator to simulate targeted hardware
capabilities. The framework also enables device developers to connect
diverse hardware solutions to virtually any peripheral device through
industry-standard communication connections and managed drivers.

   With .NET, the majority of Blackfin-based software is developed in
the application layer using Visual C#, managed drivers and libraries
in the Visual Studio environment; compared to development in C, C++ or
assembly code. In addition, new applications and features can easily
be added to existing Blackfin-based products with minimal or no effort
at the hardware or platform abstraction layers.

   Blackfin EZ-KIT Lite evaluation kits supported by AxiDotNet
solution can be purchased through Analog Devices, online or through a
local ADI sales or Distributor office. A time-limited evaluation
version of AxiDotNet solution is available at no cost. Developers can
contact AxiomFount (www.axiomfount.com) for one of the complete
AxiDotNet solutions packages. The packages are focused on enabling
core functions, applicable interfaces and features as generic
solutions, as well as solutions with market application focus.

   Convergent Processing

   With a clear vision of the future needs of embedded applications,
Analog Devices has been the pioneering innovator behind convergent
processing - achieving best-of-breed performance, cost-efficiency and
power-efficiency for both signal processing and control processing, in
a single, homogeneous processor architecture. ADI's convergent
processing approach, embodied in the Blackfin family of processors,
has replaced heterogeneous co-processor architectures in thousands of
applications and products, making engineering development faster,
easier, and less costly.

   The Blackfin family is backed by industry-leading tools, starter
kits and support including the ADI CROSSCORE(R) software and hardware
tools and the award-winning VisualDSP++(R) integrated development and
debug environment (IDDE), emulators, and EZ-KIT Lite(R) evaluation
hardware.

   About .NET Micro Framework

   The .NET Micro Framework expands Microsoft's embedded offerings
into a new market of devices that are based on low-cost 32-bit
processors and are constrained in terms of memory, battery power or
other resources. By providing powerful, modern programming paradigms
to this arena, the .NET Micro Framework is aimed at accelerating the
innovation of small, connected devices. More information can be found

closed at $20.86 Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - A top Chinese copyright official chided
Microsoft for launching an anti-piracy tool that nags users of
counterfeit software with a black computer screen and said the
company's prices were too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The U.S. software giant launched "Windows Genuine
Advantage" in China last week, a programme that turns the
background of the Windows operating system's desktop black if
the software fails a validation test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move prompted lawsuit threats and howls of indignation
in China, where the vast majority of computer users are
believed to be using pirated versions, unwittingly or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; National Copyright Administration (NCA) Vice-Director Yan
Xiaohong said his agency supported "the rights-safeguarding
move taken by institutions including Microsoft," Xinhua news
agency quoted him as saying in a report late on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But companies should "pay attention to the methods," Yan
said. "Whether the 'black-out' method should be adopted is open
to question. Measures for safeguarding rights also need to be
appropriate," Yan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has defended the programme as a measure to
protect its intellectual property and help customers determine
that they have legal software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Methods to subvert the programme were circulated on Chinese
blogs and Internet chat-rooms within days of its launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dong Zhengwei, a Beijing lawyer, said Microsoft was abusing
its market power and had filed a complaint to China's trade
watchdog, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce,
the China Daily said in separate report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft should be fined $1 billion," the paper quoted
the lawyer as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yan said Microsoft's price policies needed to "fit the
Chinese situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The company adopted unified prices in the past without
considering the income gap between developed and developing
countries, so we need to kindly remind them that Chinese
customers' affordability should be considered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's China office denied users were being forced to
use the anti-piracy programme and pointed to recent sales
promotions cutting prices of its software in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We appreciate the NCA's understanding and support on
efforts made by right holders including Microsoft to protect
IPR," it said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Building a market environment that respects intellectual
property rights is critical to the development of the entire
software industry and of knowledge economy in China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Nick Macfie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled the newest Express Advantage offerings,
which include hardware, software, and services specifically developed for
midsized businesses. The portfolio of offerings provides IBM's extensive
business partner ecosystem with a broad range of applications to deliver
simple, affordable, customized solutions for their customers.

    Midsize companies are looking for ways to better align their IT strategy
with the needs of the business, improve access to information, reduce
costs associated with manual processes and securely integrate information
from disparate sources. IBM is committed to helping midsize businesses
find new and affordable ways to apply technology to provide greater value
to their customers.

    IBM has launched a new software offering that helps midsize companies
deliver better quality software, improve operational efficiency and
continuously lower risk. IBM Rational Quality Manager Express is the
first centralized Web-based test management solution built on IBM's Jazz
technology. The software provides a Web 2.0 collaborative, customizable
environment for test planning, construction, deployment and execution. It
also enables workflow control and quantifiable metrics for project
tracking and decision-making to ensure that the business objectives and
outcomes of a software release have been met. A key benefit of the
software is that it provides a central hub for business-driven
software-quality delivery.

    For example, the CIO of a company that manufactures electronic medical
devices depends on the functionality of the company's software to ensure
that the medical devices work. Using Rational Quality Manager Express they
can monitor the aspects of the software delivery process that are
contributing to the development of the medical devices.

    As a result of being informed in real-time, they can now make immediate
decisions to enable delivery of a high quality product to the marketplace
on time and ahead of their company's competitors. With the implementation
of Rational Quality Manager Express, if an issue with that software
arises, the company and its IT staff would be alerted. The company is
then able to take immediate action to fix the defects, thereby reducing
delays and lost revenue.

    "IBM's hardware, software and services offerings for the midmarket provide
business partners with cost-effective solutions to help streamline
business processes, gain information insights, employ new business models
and secure more reliable access to critical resources," said Marc
Dupaquier, general manager, IBM Global Midmarket. "The addition of
Rational Quality Manager Express to the Express Advantage portfolio will
enable them to significantly increase their operational efficiencies,
employee productivity, customer service and competitive advantage to
support growth."

    "We are excited about the addition of Rational Quality Manager Express to
the Jazz suite of IBM solutions," said Arthur Povlot, Sales Manager of
Tescom USA. "Tescom is always looking to ease the process of software
testing and improve business collaboration to meet the challenges of a
constantly changing environment. This new software will enable us to
achieve this while improving our customers productivity and increase their
revenue."

    New Business Partner Offerings:

    IBM has also launched new tools that drive innovation and growth for our
business partners in the midmarket. These tools demonstrate IBM's
continued focus on helping business partners better serve the needs of
their customers.

    IBM's  Solutions Builder Express program, which enables business partners
to provide cost-effective infrastructure solutions to meet the needs of
midmarket customers, now includes the  Solutions Consultant Tool V3. The
tool helps solution providers to find clear and rapid resolution for
solving discreet IT problems, or expand existing IT infrastructure
solutions. By using the tool, business partners can shorten the solution
sales cycle by up to 50 percent, while increasing their value-added
services, gaining easier access to new markets and increasing
profitability.

    IBM Software Assembly Toolkit offers a simple and intuitive approach for
business partners and independent software vendor to deploy their business
applications. The toolkit assembles multiple middleware software products
and the applications that run on them, and then creates a package for easy
installation on a customer's computer. This package enables customers,
business partners, and service organizations to gain complete control over
the deployment experience by embedding OEM software. Deploying solutions
happens in a matter of hours and the number of errors that commonly occur
during deployment is significantly reduced.

    IBM Finances the Midmarket Needs

    IBM Global Financing, the lending and leasing business segment of IBM, has
designed financing options that can help clients in the midmarket defer
up-front investment costs for IBM hardware, software and services, thereby
conserving cash for other more pressing business priorities. IBM Financing
Advantage offers fast and simple financing at competitive rates, with
simplified Web-based processes to deliver credit, price and contracts in
less than one hour.

    IBM Global Financing now offers "Why Wait," a no interest no payments
program for 90 days deferral plan to support eligible customers acquiring
IBM technology now through the end of 2008.The promotion financing
structure is a 36 month fair market value lease. Customers installing the
new server under the promotion terms make no payments for 90 days, and
then make 36 even monthly payments (33 payments in some countries).
Customers must be credit qualified, lease the eligible equipment with IGF
for the promotional term and structure, and install the product in
participating countries by Dec. 31, 2008.

    For more information about IBM Global Financing's offering for financing
the technology needs of midsize companies, visit IBM's Medium business
financing solutions site.

    IBM expands Express Advantage portfolio

    IBM Express Advantage combines a comprehensive portfolio of technology
offerings, business solutions and financing options with a network of
local IBM Business Partners and dedicated Concierge customer support
service to create a powerful, end-to-end approach for helping the
mid-sized customer increase efficiency, advance their innovation agenda
and grow.

    IBM continues to leverage these capabilities to differentiate itself in
the marketplace and drive growth in the $253 billion midmarket, one of
IBM's largest and fastest growing market opportunities.

    Recently, IBM launched several new Express Advantage security and IT
optimization offerings to meet the needs of midmarket companies.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - MasterCard Inc (MA.N) and Visa Inc
(V.N) said they agreed to pay credit card issuer and network
Discover Financial Services Inc (DFS.N) a total of $2.75
billion to settle a lawsuit over anti-competitive practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The payment is big enough to potentially force Visa to
issue more shares, and has triggered a lawsuit by Discover's
former parent, Morgan Stanley, (MS.N) which says it is entitled
to $1.2 billion of the proceeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Discover sued credit card networks MasterCard and Visa in
2004 for harming its business by preventing banks that issued
MasterCard and Visa cards from also offering Discover cards.
Discover's lawsuit was similar to one American Express Co
(AXP.N) filed in 2004, which MasterCard settled for $1.8
billion in June and Visa settled for about $2.1 billion in
November 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just before the Discover suit was scheduled to go to trial
earlier this month, the companies agreed to settle. On Monday,
the companies disclosed the size of the settlements and other
terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the settlement agreement, Visa will pay $1.89
billion, the company said in a statement. MasterCard said it
will pay $862.5 million. Discover had sought $6 billion in
damages from the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa set aside $3 billion of proceeds from its initial
public offering in March to cover some of its potential
litigation expenses. With the American Express and the Discover
settlements, Visa is now paying out more than $3 billion, which
according to the prospectus from the company's initial public
offering could spur it to issue more shares. Visa's nearly $20
billion IPO in March was the largest ever U.S. stock market
debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LITIGATION AFTER THE LITIGATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Discover, which was spun off from Morgan Stanley last year,
has said in regulatory filings that it agreed to pay Morgan
Stanley the first $700 million of proceeds it receives from a
settlement, and half of any proceeds it receives above $1.5
billion, with a maximum potential payment of $1.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Discover said in a statement on Monday that Morgan
Stanley is in breach of the agreement, and the amount it will
pay to its former parent "is a matter of dispute."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley said in a statement that it is due to
receive $1.2 billion pre-tax from the settlement, and "there is
absolutely no basis for Discover's claim that the agreement was
breached." The bank said it filed a lawsuit last week in New
York state court seeking a declaratory judgment to resolve the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Discover's former parent company,
will repay MasterCard $35 million and repay Visa $65 million,
the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A person familiar with the matter said those payments were 
concessions Morgan Stanley made to help get the settlement     
done.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MasterCard said it will make the payments in November and
receive the payment from Morgan Stanley in the same month.
MasterCard will take a net after-tax charge of $515.5 million
in the third quarter of 2008, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The size of Visa and MasterCard's respective payments was
based on their transaction processing volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Emily Chasan; Editing by Andre Grenon and

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - A top Chinese copyright official chided Microsoft for launching an anti-piracy tool that nags users of counterfeit software with a black computer screen and said the company's prices were too high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. software giant launched "Windows Genuine Advantage" in China last week, a program that turns the background of the Windows operating system's desktop black if the software fails a validation test.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move prompted lawsuit threats and howls of indignation in China, where the vast majority of computer users are believed to be using pirated versions, unwittingly or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;National Copyright Administration (NCA) Vice-Director Yan Xiaohong said his agency supported "the rights-safeguarding move taken by institutions including Microsoft," Xinhua news agency quoted him as saying in a report late on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But companies should "pay attention to the methods," Yan said. "Whether the 'black-out' method should be adopted is open to question. Measures for safeguarding rights also need to be appropriate," Yan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has defended the program as a measure to protect its intellectual property and help customers determine that they have legal software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Methods to subvert the program were circulated on Chinese blogs and Internet chat-rooms within days of its launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dong Zhengwei, a Beijing lawyer, said Microsoft was abusing its market power and had filed a complaint to China's trade watchdog, the State Administration for Industry and Commerce, the China Daily said in separate report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft should be fined $1 billion," the paper quoted the lawyer as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yan said Microsoft's price policies needed to "fit the Chinese situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The company adopted unified prices in the past without considering the income gap between developed and developing countries, so we need to kindly remind them that Chinese customers' affordability should be considered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's China office denied users were being forced to use the anti-piracy program and pointed to recent sales promotions cutting prices of its software in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We appreciate the NCA's understanding and support on efforts made by right holders including Microsoft to protect IPR," it said in a statement on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Building a market environment that respects intellectual property rights is critical to the development of the entire software industry and of knowledge economy in China."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ian Ransom; Editing by Nick Macfie)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest credit card network, beat Wall Street expectations on Wednesday, but said its annual revenue growth target will be at the lower end of a previous stated goal, citing a challenging economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company guided its financial outlook for annual net revenue growth to the lower end of the 11 percent to 15 percent range it had estimated, as consumer spending falls and the global economic outlook deteriorates rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa makes money from processing transactions and does not lend, making it immune to credit concerns, but exposed to overall spending volume. That growth could slow if the economy continues to weaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But offsetting any potential slowdown on spending volume is the fact that more consumers globally, particularly in the developing world, are embracing credit and debit cards for everyday spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only real threat is a downturn in global consumer spending, which is the key driver behind Visa's profits. The upcoming holiday season will be a pretty powerful litmus test of how such spending will play out," Red Gillen, an analyst at Celent, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa said that revenue growth may be somewhat challenged in 2010 given the current economic environment in the U.S. and around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are trying to be cautious and conservative," Chief Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said in a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlook overshadowed higher-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit boosted by international processing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding litigation, restructuring and other expenses, the company said its adjusted net income for the fiscal fourth quarter ended September 30 was $448 million, or 58 cents per Class A share, compared with pro forma income of $196 million a year earlier, when the company was privately held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts forecast, on average, adjusted earnings of 56 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company affirmed its targets of an annual adjusted operating margin in the mid-to-high 40 percent range, annual adjusted diluted Class A common earnings per share growth of 20 percent or more, and annual free cash flow in excess of $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa posted a quarterly net loss of $356 million, against a net loss of $1.65 billion a year ago, hit by a litigation reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net operating revenue rose 17 percent to $1.7 billion, while payments volume grew 15 percent to $699 billion, boosted by growth in the U.S., Asia and Latin America, among other places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa's stock cut its earlier losses and was stable in after-hours trade. The company's shares have fallen around 10 percent since its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Juan Lagorio, editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Speculators on Wednesday scooped up call options in Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), hoping to catch a share price rally on prospects of a positive earnings report, according to one options analyst.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of the world's largest non-government-owned energy company fell 21 cents to $74.65 on the New York Stock Exchange after notching a session high of $77.99.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Options traders loaded up on Exxon calls as its shares rose earlier in the session, helped by sharp gains in crude oil futures and a Wall Street rally after the Federal Reserve cut interest rates. U.S. stocks fell in a steep sell-off late in the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil is due to deliver third-quarter results before the opening bell on Thursday. Analysts expect the company to report a profit of $2.38 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Basically option traders are speculating that Exxon Mobil will report third-quarter profits that would match or beat Wall Street expectations," said Joseph Hargett, senior equities analyst at Ohio-based options research firm Schaeffer's Investment Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Betting on Exxon Mobil at the moment is pretty much a bet that crude oil prices are going to continue to rise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, December crude hit a session high of $69.24. It earlier settled up 7.6 percent at $67.50 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SENTIMENT DRIVER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One indicator of sentiment is Exxon stock's put-to-call open interest ratio for the top three months. It stood at 0.95 and lies in the 76th percentile of its annual range, data from Schaeffer's Investment Research shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means speculative options traders are a bit more pessimistic on the company's prospects. But Hargett noted the influx of call activity on Wednesday is a shift in sentiment, reflecting expectations of share price gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a contrarian, I would view this surge of call activity negatively because it means that option traders are expecting positive earnings and that Exxon meeting Wall Street expectations may not be enough," Hargett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 74,000 calls and 72,000 puts traded in Exxon Mobil on Wednesday, 1.6 times its normal combined volume, according to option analytics firm Trade Alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A call conveys the right to buy the company's shares at a fixed price within a specified time period while a put enables an investor to sell the stock at a preset price and time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The busiest option was the November $80 call strike, where 14,537 contracts were situated at $2.20 a contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For this trade to break even, Exxon shares would have to rally 10 percent between now and November 21 options expiration. By entering this trade, investors are indicating they are bullish on Exxon for the near-term, Hargett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technically the stock has not looked great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares are down 20 percent for the year. Stiff resistance is at the 20-week moving average at around $78.48 and the security has not closed above that trendline since the week of July 4, Hargett added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This overhead resistance could cripple a November $80 call position if Exxon Mobil's recent momentum fades," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PGE CFO Jim Piro appointed next CEO and President
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) today announced the
appointment of Jim Piro as Chief Executive Officer and President of
PGE effective January 1, 2009.

   Peggy Fowler, who has held the CEO and president position since
April 2000, will retire as CEO on March 1, 2009, and will continue to
play an active role as a member of the PGE Board of Directors.

   "PGE has an exceptionally strong management team, which will allow
for a seamless transition," said Corbin McNeill, Chairman of the
Board. "Peggy is an extraordinary CEO who steered PGE through a
difficult time in the company's history. Because of her leadership,
PGE is a respected, successful, publicly traded company headquartered
in Portland. Jim's experience, his overall financial acumen and strong
strategic planning capabilities make him an ideal choice to lead PGE
into the future."

   "Jim and I have worked together closely since our appointments to
CEO and CFO in 2000," said Fowler. "Along with the rest of the
executive team and our employees, we've built a solid platform that
will serve PGE well into the future. Jim's extensive management
experience within the Company and his equally strong financial
capabilities make him the clear choice to lead PGE and our dedicated
employees. He will be a visionary chief executive with a strong focus
on executing the strategy to deliver value to both customers and
shareholders."

   Piro brings to his new role as CEO and president 35 years of
utility experience and 28 years with PGE. Prior to becoming CFO, he
held many positions at PGE including roles in the areas of
engineering, regulation and planning. He has been involved integrally
in the strategic and operational initiatives of the Company. He began
his PGE career as a civil engineer in Generation Engineering. He also
managed the departments of Economic Analysis and Strategic Planning
Support. Piro became Executive Vice President of Finance in May 2001
and has served as Chief Financial Officer since November 2000. Piro is
active in the community serving on the Governor of Oregon's Governance
Transportation Subcommittee, the board of LifeWorks Northwest, and the
advisory board of FM Global. He also serves as treasurer of the PGE
Foundation, the corporate foundation of Portland General Electric.

   "I am extremely honored to be entrusted to lead our dedicated and
talented employees who are committed every day to making PGE a great
company. My co-workers and I will continue Peggy's legacy. Our focus
will be on delivering value to our customers, our community and our
shareholders through providing safe, reliable and reasonably priced
power," Piro said. "Peggy is an amazing leader and a true friend. She
has been a model of great leadership and sound decision making over
her career and especially the last eight-and-a-half years as CEO. She
will be missed. However, I'm pleased she will continue to serve on the
PGE Board and be part of achieving the strategy we have set in place
for PGE."

   Fowler joined PGE in 1974 and has held the position of CEO since
April 2000. Prior to assuming that position, she managed almost every
major area of the company in her tenure with PGE. After 35 years with
PGE, she is retiring to pursue other adventures in business and the
community and with family and friends.

   "The timing is right," Fowler said. "PGE has achieved
independence, we've put many major issues behind us, we've built a
solid foundation for growth and have a strong executive team in place.
I look forward to continuing to be engaged in PGE's strategic
direction as part of the Board of Directors, as well as being actively
involved in other business and community endeavors."

   Fowler serves on several business, government and nonprofit
boards, including the Oregon Business Council (chair), the Regence
Group, Regence BlueCross BlueShield of Oregon, Federal Reserve Bank of
San Francisco - Portland Branch, the Oregon Global Warming Commission
and Greenlight Greater Portland.

   The company is in the process of seeking a new Chief Financial
Officer and Treasurer to succeed Piro, and expects to complete this
process by the end of 2008.

2008 included the combined $17.8 million of pre-tax charges ($9.3
million after-tax, or basic net loss per share of $1.01) related to
Central States and the Company's restructuring plan. The results for
the first nine months of 2007 also included a $2.6 million pre-tax
charge ($1.6 million after-tax, or basic net income per share of $.18)
related to a simplification of the Company's operating management
structure and reduction in workforce.

   J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, "We saw a modest
improvement in our gross margin during the third quarter as compared
to last year and are seeing initial positive results from our
restructuring and continuous improvement plan that we implemented in
July. We continue to challenge ourselves to find new ways to better
deal with an extremely challenging set of business conditions and are
very pleased with how our employees have responded implementing more
cost effective ways of getting our products into the marketplace and
serving our customers."

   William B. Elmore, President and COO, added, "We are pleased we
were able to increase our net sales by 4% and gross margin dollars
slightly in the third quarter of 2008 as compared to the prior year
given the rapidly softening economy and extraordinary increases in raw
materials costs. It should also be noted that a severe gasoline
shortage in the month of September, primarily in Charlotte and
Nashville, had a considerable negative impact on our convenience store
business. Our intense focus on price realization to cover input costs
coupled with aggressive but thoughtful reductions in operating
expenses delivered a sizable increase in operating income on a
normalized basis (i.e., excluding the Central States and restructuring
expenses)."

   J. Frank Harrison, III summarized, "The current uncertainty in the
economy presents a challenge for our consumers, customers, suppliers
and employees. Nonetheless, because we make, sell, and deliver the
premier nonalcoholic beverages in the world and have a highly
dedicated and talented workforce, we remain confident about our future
prospects."

&lt;p&gt;Charges of Rape and Murder Prompt Disappearance of Entire Country
                        from Corporate Website
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Chevron has quietly removed from its website any reference to its
operations in Burma, a country where the oil giant has been implicated
in allegations of rape and murder connected to a lucrative pipeline
project that generates up to $1 billion annually for the country's
brutal military regime, the Amazon Defense Coalition said today.

   The company has replaced the majority of substantive information
on its website with a short page glossing over their role in the
country.

   Chevron removed the references to Burma while it has been
embroiled in high-stakes legal case charging it helped orchestrate the
deaths of two Nigerian villagers protesting Chevron's operational
practices in the African country. The trial on those charges began
Tuesday in federal court in San Francisco.

   Earth Rights International, a legal organization based in
Washington, D.C., has leveled withering criticism at Chevron for
jointly operating a natural gas pipeline with the Burmese military.
Just in the last year, the Burmese army has violently suppressed
protesting monks and diverted international relief aid after a
devastating hurricane, and the country's government is considered an
international pariah.

   The pipeline generates an estimated $1 billion per year in hard
currency for the clique of generals who rule Burma. Chevron has
defended the project on the grounds it exercises a liberalizing
influence on the country's government.

   Just two years ago, Chevron's Burmese operations were featured
prominently on the company's website. This week, one could not find a
single reference to Burma on the website where Chevron boasts of its
worldwide operations and lists the dozens of countries where it has
investments.

   The earlier website is archived at www.archive.org.

   In a recent report, lawyers for ERI concluded that Chevron faces
liability for being complicit in murder, rape, and slave labor
committed by the Burmese Army in providing "security" for the
pipeline. ERI is most known for having settled a legal case against
Unocal over the same charges before Chevron bought Unocal in 2005 and
inherited the pipeline project.

   As ERI noted in their report "The Human Cost of Energy: Chevron's
Continuing Role in Financing Oppression and Profiting From Human
Rights Abuse in Military-Ruled Burma (Myanmar)": "Chevron and its
consortium partners continue to rely on the Burmese army for pipeline
security, and those forces continue to conscript thousands of
villagers for forced labor, and to commit torture, rape, murder and
other serious abuses in the course of their operations. Due to its
involvement in the Yadana Project, Chevron remains vulnerable to
liability in U.S. courts for the abuses committed by these security
forces." The full report is available at http://www.earthrights.org

   The removal of any mention of Burma is the latest in a long series
of controversial moves by Charles S. James, Chevron's General Counsel,
to hide or divert attention from Chevron's growing human rights
problems.

   "James has shown a repeated willingness to tolerate unethical
practices by Chevron to hide its growing reputation as a global human
rights violator," said Jeremy Low, who monitors the company's human
rights record for the Amazon Defense Coalition, which has sued Chevron
for environmental damage in Ecuador.

   "What we're seeing is hard information replaced by absolute fluff
or just blank space," he added.

   Just last week, Chevron was accused by the environmental group
Amazon Watch of paying journalists to write favorable editorial
content without disclosing their financial relationship to the
company. One of the journalists, San Francisco writer Pat Murphy, has
not denied he accepts fees from Chevron to write one-sided articles in
his online newspaper that mysteriously get "Google bombed" to the top
of search engines.

   Undisclosed payments to journalists for favorable coverage are
considered highly unethical, yet James has not denied that the company
engages in the practice.

   The Nigeria case, being tried before Judge Susan Illston, has
created a lengthy record of charges that Chevron paid Nigerian
military officers to shoot local villagers who had staged a peaceful
protest on one of the company's oil platforms. The trial, expected to
last five weeks, began on Tuesday.

   In the Amazon region of Ecuador, where Chevron faces a potential
$16.3 billion liability for dumping more than 18 billion gallons of
toxic waste, local lawyers have long accused the company of paying
uniformed Ecuadorian army officers to provide "security" designed to
intimidate members of indigenous groups.

   "I am sure James wishes Chevron could erase its human rights
problems as easily as it can erase mention of Burma from its website,"
said Low. "But as the company is now finding out, that's not so easy."

&lt;p&gt;Oct 29 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said it expects dividend
cuts and asset sales among U.S. real-estate investment trusts
(REITs) as they will be forced to conserve capital amid the
prospects of a prolonged downturn in credit markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs also said it continues to remain cautious on
REITs and commercial real-estate companies citing near-term
funding challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A catalyst for the cautious view is the potential for an
increase in default rates in outstanding commercial
mortgage-backed securities, as well as higher capitalization
rates, analysts at Goldman wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts said they also expect a focus on de-leveraging
as REITs largely reverse the rapid growth in assets that has
taken place over the last 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts remained "most cautious" on apartment REITs,
but continued to favor retail and office REITs based on their
long average lease terms, steady occupancy levels and embedded
rent growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman added apartment REIT AvalonBay Communities Inc
(AVB.N) to its Americas conviction sell list and removed
industrial REIT ProLogis (PLD.N) from it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts said the shares of AvalonBay continued to
trade at a more than 25 percent premium to the broader REIT
sector despite below-average growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They said AvalonBay's rental stream could be at risk and
projected a negative funds-from-operations growth over the next
two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman removed ProLogis from its Americas Conviction Sell
list less than a month after it added the company to the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Much of the negative news has been priced into the stock
at this point; in fact, we believe the stock may have
over-corrected in light of concerns regarding near-term
liquidity, which we think are largely unfounded," the analysts
said.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Cuomo letter to banks, details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 29 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
has promoted 94 employees to partner, an exclusive club that
gets a bigger slice of the firm's enormous bonus pool, at a
time when eye-popping bonuses are under the gun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Executive pay is expected to shrink as Wall Street suffers
through its worst year since the Depression. Bank bonuses are
under intense scrutiny as Goldman and dozens of other financial
institutions receive government cash injections to help them
survive the credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Every two years Goldman names a class of managing directors
to the exclusive rank of "partner managing director." The
system offers about 400 employees the chance to share a fifth
of the firm's total compensation pool.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman selects many of its biggest revenue producers,
though many are little known. One exception on this year's list
is Jan Hatzius, the economist who last year predicted the
subprime crisis would lead to a $2 trillion reduction in
lending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The promotions were announced on Wednesday in an internal
Goldman memo obtained by Reuters. A spokeswoman for the bank
confirmed that the memo had been circulated but declined
further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Partners are chosen after a months-long process in which a
range of executives throughout the firm review and grade
candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the class named Wednesday, Goldman will have 443
partners. That's an exclusive club for a firm with nearly
30,000 employees and about 1,800 managing directors.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new class is the smallest since 2004, when Goldman
added 99 new partners. At the end of October 2006, when Wall
Street was roaring, the bank added a record 115 partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Times are tougher this year, with revenue for the first
nine months of fiscal 2008 down 32 percent from a year earlier
to $23.8 billion. Using rough calculations and past payout
ratios, each partner could stand to receive $7 million in
compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year Goldman paid a record $20.2 billion in
compensation and benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, these promotions come as regulators and
lawmakers demand that Wall Street, which has plunged the
economy into recession with its missteps, put a lid on
extravagant paychecks. Banks are under intense scrutiny after
receiving Federal Reserve funding support and, in the case of
Goldman, a direct investment of $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier Wednesday, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo
sent letters to the boards of nine U.S. banks receiving $125
billion of government investments in exchange for preferred
shares and stock warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cuomo, who successfully blocked some executive payments and
perks at insurer American International Group (AIG.N), warned
that some bank compensation could be found to be illegal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Massachusetts Congressman Barney Frank said
there should be a moratorium on bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (To see the memo and the list of partners, go to Reuters

&lt;p&gt; (Adds context, details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Oct 29 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Enterprises (CCE.N)
on Wednesday sold $1 billion in five-year notes at a higher
yield spread than originally planned, after delaying the issue
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The delay came after Standard  Poor's revised its outlook
on the company and on parent Coca-Cola (KO.N) to negative just
after the deal was announced, indicating their ratings may be
cut over the next one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The notes were priced at 99.897 to yield 468 basis points
over U.S. Treasuries. That was 5.5 basis points more than the
original indicated spread of 462.5 basis points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Enterprises last tapped the capital markets in
July, with a $300 million five-year note offer that priced at a
far lower spread of 168 basis points over Treasuries. Those
notes are currently trading at about 350 basis points over
Treasuries, according to MarketAxess.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A number of recent issues from companies including IBM
 (IBM.N), Caterpillar (CAT.N) and PepsiCo (PEP.N) have priced
at more than 400 basis points over Treasuries, indicating the
tight conditions in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP said Tuesday the pace of growth in new debt issuance
fell to a 17-year low in the third quarter, as credit spreads
remained elevated and banks reluctant to lend. See
[ID:nN28399218].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP analyst Jean Stout said Tuesday that recent aggressive
financial policies have hurt the Coca-Cola brand's credit
quality at a time when weak economic conditions are pressuring
operating performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP has an "A-plus" rating on Coca-Cola, its fifth-highest
investment grade. The agency rates the Atlanta-based bottling
company "A", or the sixth-highest investment grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The joint lead managers on Wednesday's sale were Banc of
America Securities, Citigroup Global Markets, Credit Suisse and
Deutsche Bank.

&lt;p&gt;  ZURICH, SWITZERLAND, Oct 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Resembling a memory stick with an integrated display, a prototype USB
device developed at IBM's (NYSE: IBM) Zurich Research Lab brings a new
level of security to online banking for consumers. Pilot devices are
ready and available to banks for trials.

    The Zone Trusted Information Channel (ZTIC) plugs into the USB port of any
computer and creates a direct, secure channel to a bank's online
transaction server, bypassing the PC which could be infected by malicious
software (malware) or susceptible to hacker attacks.

    The consumer can use the security stick to logon and validate all
transactions via a display, while the USB device is securely connected to
the server, safeguarding against today's ever more fiendish forms of
attacks that can manipulate data in the background, hidden from the
consumer and the bank. The USB device adds an extra level of security to
the existing authentication solutions provided by smart card, PIN or
one-time validation code, in order to counter the newest and most highly
manipulative security threats.

    Hackers are becoming increasingly inventive in their attempts to attack
financial transactions on the Internet. Among the increasingly prominent
threats are so called "Man-In-The-Middle" attacks, where a hacker
inconspicuously intercepts and modifies the messages flowing between a
user and a financial institution. The modified messages appear to be
official transactions from the financial institution, and the messages
going to the financial institution appear to be from the consumer.

    Malware is an even more fiendish form of attack, where the hacker manages
to install a virus or Trojan Horse in a user's personal computer and is
then free to manipulate the messages seen by and sent by the user. This
allows the attacker to redirect communications and manipulate the data
displayed by the internet browser in real-time during the user's e-banking
session and totally unnoticeable to the user's eyes.

    Nearly 90 percent of identity attacks online are targeted at the financial
services sector. A 2007 international study by the Swiss Reporting and
Analysis Centre for Information Assurance (MELANI), found that successful
malware intrusions have increased and that currently established
"two-factor authentication systems (e.g. transaction authentication
numbers, SecurID, etc.) do not afford protection against such attacks and
must be viewed as insecure once the computer of the customer has been
infected with malware."

    ZTIC provides an extra layer of security in the presence of both of these
attacks.

    "In the presence of an ever more professionally operating e-crime scene,
it became obvious that PC-software based authentication solutions were
potentially vulnerable and that we needed to innovate to stay ahead. That
was the starting point for developing the ZTIC," explained Dr. Peter
Buhler, Manager Computer Science at IBM's Zurich Research Lab. "The design
of the solution was governed by and is based on the analysis of pros and
cons of present and announced alternative solutions."

    This solution effectively moves all the cryptographic and critical
user-interface processes away from a consumer's PC onto the ZTIC device,
creating a trusted communication endpoint between the banking server and
the user. With the new device, a user can then communicate securely with
sensitive online services such as a banking server. In combination with a
smart card, which can be inserted into the device, this new solution
brings a new level of end-to-end security to online banking.

    After initial lab prototypes had been realized by the researchers, first
pilot devices have now been industrially manufactured and are ready for
trials.

    Even if a user's PC should be infected by malware that manipulates the
information flow in the PC, the user can cancel the transaction while
displayed on the ZTIC device. What the user sees on the ZTIC display is
identical to what the server "sees," no matter what malicious intervention
may occur on the PC or anywhere in the Internet. "Owing to the direct
secure connection between ZTIC and server, the device essentially provides
a safe window to the server," states Buhler.

    Moreover, the ZTIC has been designed such that no change is required in
either the server software or the software running on the client's PC. It
runs on all major home computing operating systems.

    Technological Specifications

    The researchers designed the ZTIC as an USB device of about the same size
as a memory stick. It runs the commonly used TLS/SSL protocol. The ZTIC
hardware consists conceptually, at a minimum, of a processing unit,
volatile and persistent memory, a small display and at least two control
buttons (OK and Cancel) as well as an optional smartcard reader. The
software is minimally configured with a complete TLS engine including all
cryptographic algorithms required by today's SSL/TLS servers, an HTTP
parser for analyzing the data exchanged between client and server, plus
custom system software implementing the USB mass storage device profile
and a networking proxy for running on a PC. It supports TLS/SSL client
authentication as well as common chip-card based challenge/response
protocols.

&lt;p&gt;J.P. Turner Fined $250,000 for Failing to Supervise Commissions Charged On Stock Trades

WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) announced
today that it has imposed a $250,000 fine against J.P. Turner &amp;
Company, LLC of Atlanta, GA, for failing to have an adequate
supervisory system designed to ensure that its registered
representatives charged customers fair and reasonable commissions on
stock trades.

   As part of the settlement, FINRA ordered J.P. Turner to retain, at
its own expense, an independent consultant to conduct a comprehensive
review of the adequacy of the firm's policies, systems, procedures,
and training relating to FINRA's Fair Pricing Rule.

   "In order to establish a fair commission or mark-up, brokers must
take into consideration all of the relevant circumstances and not just
whether the commission is below a certain percentage of the total
price of the transaction," said Susan Merrill, FINRA Executive Vice
President and Chief of Enforcement. "In this case, J.P. Turner allowed
its brokers to charge commissions of up to 4.5% on almost every stock
trade without regard to the circumstances, such as the size of the
transaction, the cost of executing the order, or whether the
securities were readily available in the market."

   FINRA requires firms to implement a system and reasonable
procedures to ensure that customers are fairly charged for
transactions, taking into consideration all relevant factors. FINRA's
mark-up policy lists seven factors for firms to consider: the type of
security involved; the availability of the security in the market; the
price of the security; the size of the transaction; disclosure to the
customer; the pattern of the firm's mark-ups; and, the nature of the
firm's business.

   FINRA found that between January 2002 and March 2005, J.P.
Turner's supervisory system and written procedures failed to take
these factors into account and failed to provide adequate guidance to
its registered representatives to determine a fair commission or
mark-up on equity securities transactions.

   FINRA found that under J.P. Turner's system and procedures,
representatives had discretion to establish the commission on such
transactions, limited only by whether the price of the security was
above or below $25 per share. On all equity securities transactions in
which the price of the security was below $25, registered
representatives were allowed to charge up to 4.5%, while they could
only charge up to 3.5% if the price of the security was above $25.
During the review period, 91% of the firm's equity securities
transactions involved securities priced below $25 per share.

   J.P. Turner's trading manager was responsible for reviewing and
approving trades for fair and reasonable charges. Those reviews,
however, were limited to reviewing the transactions to ensure that the
commissions charged did not exceed the firm's 3.5% and 4.5%
guidelines.

   In concluding this settlement, J.P. Turner neither admitted nor
denied the charges, but consented to the entry of FINRA's findings.

&lt;p&gt;Family First Federal Credit Union to Offer Double Rewards Points on Its VISA(R) Credit Card

   Members Can Earn Double Rewards Points on Everyday Purchases Made
                          During the Holidays
OREM, Utah--(Business Wire)--
With the holidays fast approaching and prices skyrocketing for
ordinary purchases like food, clothing and fuel, many consumers are
looking for ways to make their dollars stretch further. Family First
Federal Credit Union is hoping to put more money in its members'
wallets this year by offering double rewards points on purchases made
with a Family First VISA credit card during Nov. 1 through Dec. 31,
2008.

   "This is a great opportunity for card holders to not only earn
double rewards points on holiday shopping but also on everyday
purchases such as supermarkets, gas stations and drug stores," said
Jennifer Stoddard, associate vice president of member services.
"Credit card rewards can be an excellent reason for using your credit
card and, if used wisely, can put cash back into your pocket."

   Family First is encouraging its members to stay within their
monthly budget when using their rewards cards. Members should earn
points responsibly and pay off their credit card every month. This
will help avoid any interest charges and will get members into the
habit of maintaining a monthly budget.

   To get the most money back, members should consider charging
everyday monthly expenses to their credit card. All of your regular
bills (that you pay anyway) such as utilities, telephone, cable or
satellite TV, Internet, food and gas. If a member's household expenses
come to $5,000 per month, members could earn $50.00 cash back per
month. That comes to $600 a year, which can be very beneficial during
these tough economic times.

   To apply for a Family First VISA credit card, visit any of the
credit union branches throughout Utah County or call 801-255-6020.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N) posted a higher quarterly profit on Wednesday, helped by price increases and a benefit from foreign exchange rates, but warned volatile markets would weigh on annual results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest consumer products maker lowered the bottom end of its fiscal year profit forecast, citing volatility in commodity, energy and currency markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said this year's sales growth would be weaker than previously forecast and that revenue might even fall in the current quarter because of the hit it expects from foreign exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG, whose products include Tide detergent and Pampers diapers, has seen some consumers switch to low-price private label brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it expects consumers will continue to buy pricier, innovative items such as clinical-strength deodorants, as well as its own lower-priced products like Gain detergent and Luvs diapers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selling "products that consumers purchase weekly and use daily gives me continuing confidence PG will deliver target growth over the long term, even in a challenging economic environment," Chairman and Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG said profit in its fiscal first quarter rose to $3.35 billion, or $1.03 per share, from $3.08 billion, or 92 cents a share, a year earlier, matching analysts' average forecast, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales rose 9 percent to $22.03 billion, topping Wall Street's view. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, sales rose 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of PG, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, were up 0.9 percent at $63.80 in premarket trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FORECAST HIT BY FOREX&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Products that sold well included Head  Shoulders shampoo, Gillette Fusion razors and Luvs diapers, which are priced lower than PG's Pampers brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG, like other companies, has raised prices to counter higher raw material and transportation costs. Now that those costs are coming down, consumers might expect to see lower prices in stores as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost reductions PG has seen would not trigger revised prices at this time, outgoing Chief Financial Officer Clayton Daley said on Wednesday, speaking on CNBC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG said it now expects to earn $3.77 to $3.87 per share in fiscal 2009, versus a prior forecast of $3.80 to $3.87 per share. That forecast still excludes a gain of about 50 cents per share from the sale of the Folgers coffee business and about 12 cents a share in increased restructuring costs. The company's fiscal year began on July 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts' average forecast is $3.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A weak U.S. dollar helped boost revenue in recent quarters. Now that the dollar is gaining, sales in foreign markets have a lower dollar value on the income statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG now expects revenue to rise 1 percent to 3 percent this year, versus a prior view of 5 percent to 7 percent growth, due to foreign exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG expects to earn 98 cents to $1.03 per share in the current fiscal second quarter, excluding the gain from Folgers and 3 cents per share in Folgers-related restructuring charges. Analysts' average forecast is $1.03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company forecast second-quarter revenue to be down 1 percent to up 2 percent. Excluding acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, revenue should rise 4 percent to 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG said its credit ratings are in the top 5 percent of all public companies, which should allow it to access credit markets without issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jessica Wohl; Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RedPrairie VP speaks at Microsoft Professional Developers
                              Conference
MILWAUKEE, Wis.--(Business Wire)--
RedPrairie Corporation, a consumer-driven optimization company,
shared in one of four keynote presentations at Microsoft Corp.'s
Professional Developers Conference, held October 27-30 in Los Angeles.
Shawn Davison, VP of E2e Platforms, highlighted many of the ways
Azure(TM) Services Platform will positively impact information
technology in the near future, particularly in the ways of cloud
computing.

   Davison demonstrated how the platform will enhance RedPrairie's
"One Button Recall" application, designed to completely streamline
communication between partners over the Internet.

   "The primary advantage of any cloud-based program is the immediate
value it adds to a legacy system," says Davison, "Azure Services
Platform leverages cloud computing technology, allowing secure
interaction between applications across enterprises via Software as a
Service (SaaS). This will allow companies like RedPrairie to easily
connect their clients with any number of businesses using Web
services, providing seamless contact not only within an organization,
but outside of it - without the need for extensive, complicated, or
dedicated circuitry."

   Davison illustrated RedPrairie's plans to use the Azure Services
Platform in extending clients' on-premise supply networks across the
Web. Doing so, he claims, will allow the company's customers the
ability to recall distributed product with the touch of a button,
without the need to manually provide access or instruction for
individual carriers.

   "RedPrairie's excellent demonstration in the keynote address with
Bob Muglia is just another example of their strong partnership in
working with Microsoft to deliver the latest innovations and technical
transformations to customers", said Eddie Amos general manager for
World wide Partner Evangelism at Microsoft, "We expect the work
RedPrairie is doing with Microsoft's Azure will result in greater
value for our mutual customers and the industry as a whole."

   RedPrairie is a world leading consumer driven optimization
company. Built on an advanced Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)
developed over the past 15 years, the RedPrairie integrated suite of
solutions offers on-demand capabilities to over 32,000 sites worldwide
for many of the world's largest companies.

   RedPrairie's E2e(TM) solutions synchronize people and products
throughout the customer buying cycle to ensure goods reach the right
place at the right time. At the point of sale, this means consumers
have access to desired products and that the store is staffed with the
right people to help them make their purchases. In the production
cycle, it means suppliers and manufacturers time and synchronize
shipments and production based on demand signals from the retailer.
And in the back room of the store, it means having the least amount of
inventory, solving the "last yard" problem of the retail supply chain.

   With 20 global service sites and standard service methods that
have been validated over the last 30 years, RedPrairie provides
unparalleled service and support. For additional information, call

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp fed, housed and paid Nigerian military forces involved in a deadly clash with local residents occupying an oil platform more than a decade ago, a jury was told on Tuesday at a federal trial in which the oil company is accused of human rights abuses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The accusations stem from May 1998, when about 100 people occupied Chevron's Parabe platform off the coast of West Africa for three days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case in San Francisco District Court was brought against Chevron by Larry Bowoto, one of the occupiers of the platform, under the Alien Tort Claims Act. The act, dating back to 1789, allows foreigners to sue over human rights abuses committed in their countries by a U.S. organization or someone acting on behalf of a U.S. organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In opening arguments, lawyer Dan Stormer, speaking for the plaintiffs, said the forces that landed on Parabe to retake the platform were on Chevron's payroll and supervised by the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Parabe, nine miles off the coast, accounted for a fifth of Chevron's daily crude oil output of 400,000 barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hostage-taking and ransom demands are a regular hazard for oil companies working in the impoverished Niger Delta, where residents say they do not benefit from the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stormer said two men died and many were injured in the clash between the protestors and armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial will decide if Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, is responsible for injuries suffered by villagers and one of the deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People who occupied Parabe called it a peaceful protest by unarmed villagers who accused Chevron of polluting their water, causing the supply of fish, one of their main food sources, and vegetation to dwindle, and turning the village's soil to acid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's lawyer Bob Mittelstaedt told jurors the case was "about the right and duty of a company to protect its workers" and that the protest was not a peaceful but a "hostile" one that put its workers' lives at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron employees said the protesters were armed with long knives and "poured diesel on the barge and threatened to set it on fire," Mittelstaedt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stormer countered that a Chevron employee sent a fax to the U.S. embassy during the conflict saying "the villagers were unarmed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mittelstaedt, while expressing sympathy for the families of those who were harmed, said the use of military support to break up the protest was "a decision any employee would want their company to make."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial is due to resume on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Braden Reddall; Editing by Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Procter &amp; Gamble Extends Strategic Relationship by Selecting Dassault Syst&#232;mes for New Product Development

    DS V6 Architecture Establishes Enterprise-wide PLM Backbone for
            All Product, Packaging and Process Information
PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Regulatory News:

   Dassault Syst&#232;mes (DS) (Paris:DSY) (NASDAQ:DASTY) , a world leader
in 3D and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) solutions, announced
today that Procter &amp; Gamble Company (P), the world's largest
consumer goods company, has chosen to implement DS's ENOVIA solution
as its enterprise-wide PLM backbone. Building upon its longtime
relationship with Dassault Syst&#232;mes, P will leverage Dassault
Syst&#232;mes' portfolio to create a global platform to support product
development. P also uses 3DVIA, SIMULIA, DELMIA and Solidworks
solutions from Dassault Syst&#232;mes.

   P will use a common backbone built on Dassault Syst&#232;mes' V6
technology integrating existing systems to better manage product,
packaging and process information. The Dassault Syst&#232;mes platform will
save employees time as they research product material. It will also
improve accuracy of information and speed up the product development
process due to the entire product definition residing in a single
view.

   "We are very pleased to be growing our partnership with Dassault
Systemes. We look forward to working together to create an
enterprise-wide solution to support product development" said Michael
Telljohann, PLM director, Procter &amp; Gamble. "In an organization as
large as ours, with so many brands, products and geographies involved
in the design and manufacturing process, PLM enables us to save both
time and cost from the bottom line, making P a more productive
organization and strengthening our innovation capability."

   Building on the 16,000 ENOVIA users (12,000 internal and 4,000
external) currently deployed in the Corporate Standards Systems, P
will implement the ENOVIA Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG)
Accelerator(TM) for Global Specification Management to better manage
products spanning multiple brands and markets. This approach will
reduce the number of regulatory compliance systems, lower raw material
costs, reduce cycle times and enable lower cost labor centers.

   "As a company that has always embraced the spirit of innovation,
P understands the value of PLM collaborative innovation and lifelike
experience to reduce cost and time-to-market," said Bernard Charl&#232;s,
president &amp; CEO, Dassault Syst&#232;mes. "P's vision to implement
company-wide PLM for a single source of product data and processes,
from specifications to compliancy, sets the stage for its own industry
as well as others such as Life Science and Apparel."

   About Dassault Syst&#232;mes

   As a world leader in 3D and Product Lifecycle Management (PLM)
solutions, Dassault Syst&#232;mes brings value to more than 100,000
customers in 80 countries. A pioneer in the 3D software market since
1981, Dassault Syst&#232;mes develops and markets PLM application software
and services that support industrial processes and provide a 3D vision

designing the virtual product - SolidWorks for 3D mechanical design -
DELMIA for virtual production - SIMULIA for virtual testing - ENOVIA

lifelike experiences. Dassault Syst&#232;mes' shares are listed on Euronext

&lt;p&gt; (Adds byline, details from interview, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Oct 30 (Reuters) - Andy Mooney, chairman of
Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) Consumer Products division, said on
Thursday he expects the company's market share to grow despite
a challenging holiday season for retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm actually pretty optimistic about the holiday season in
the sense that... parents are going to buy toys for their kids
come this holiday," Mooney told Reuters in an interview. "In
terms of the things they're likely to give up, I would expect
us to be pretty far down the list."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his nine year tenure Mooney has grown a global licensing
business to $30 billion of retail sales in 2008 by nurturing
brands such as Disney Princess and cross promoting properties
from the company's other divisions, like the Pixar film "Cars"
and Disney Channel's "High School Musical." Disney generally
earns a 10 percent royalty on those sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mooney said the industry and retail sales "will certainly
be challenged for this season and the rest of 2009 and I'm
pretty confident Disney will gain share" as consumers turn to
"value brands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By that I don't just mean lower price -- I mean what am I
getting from the Walt Disney Co relative to other competitors
that are out there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because Disney earns a royalty on products it licenses and
is paid when orders are delivered to retailers, Mooney said the
company had good visibility through the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since retailers, wholesalers and licensees had already
committed to holiday products before the financial markets
became shaky, rather than canceling or adjusting those orders,
most are "just keeping their fingers and toes crossed as we go
through the season," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I really don't think people are going to adjust (orders)
until they come out the back end of the holiday season and into
the spring," Mooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mooney did not anticipate "a large scale shift" in orders
unless there was "a dramatic slowdown throughout the holiday
season in terms of consumer purchasing, which would then back
up inventory going into the spring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But it's too early in the season to figure out what the
consumer is going to do exactly," Mooney said. "Everybody is
expecting them to be very selective and very price conscious
but it's unclear to what degree."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp filed court documents on
Thursday challenging bankrupt Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK
on whether it has a claim to billions of dollars worth of tax
benefits stemming from its collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The FDIC said it disagrees that all of those tax benefits
belong to WaMu's holding company, which filed for bankruptcy
protection last month after its bank was seized by the FDIC and
sold to JPMorgan for $1.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, WaMu filed court documents seeking to
limit trading in its common stock to protect tax breaks the
company could receive due to losses it incurred throughout
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the court documents, WaMu said it estimated it has
incurred "consolidated net operating tax loss carryforwards" or
unrecognized losses in excess of $20 billion. It said the
losses could become "valuable assets" for the bankrupt company
because the U.S. tax code generally allows companies to carry
over their losses and tax credits to offset future income,
thereby lowering the amount of taxes owed to the government .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The total tax benefit the company would get from those
losses would be a percentage of that $20 billion in losses,
based on its tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDIC argued in court documents Thursday that the net
operating loss carryforwards should belong to the entity that
actually incurred the loss, and said the agency may fight for
any rights it has to those benefits in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said in its filing that it wanted assurances that
any court orders on this matter would not affect tax benefits
that should be allocated to the bank it acquired from WaMu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Emily Chasan and Chelsea Emery; editing by

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp topped its own record for the biggest U.S. quarterly operating profit and Royal Dutch Shell Plc earnings beat market forecasts on Thursday, helped by high oil prices and fatter refinery margins.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But both Exxon and Shell said their quarterly oil output fell, in part from damage caused by Hurricanes Gustav and Ike, which swept through the Gulf of Mexico during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil prices averaged about $118 a barrel in the third quarter, more than $40 higher than the year-ago period. They had peaked above a record $147 in early July before turning and falling by nearly 60 percent over the next three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That decline, coupled with knock-on effects of the credit crunch on oil and gas producers, prompted a few more U.S. oil services companies to cut 2009 spending forecasts on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon and Shell posted strong performances in refining, which benefited as the falling crude oil price trimmed costs, even as demand for gasoline shrank, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gene Pisasale, senior energy analyst at PNC Capital Advisors, called Exxon's U.S. refining profits a positive, but said it needed to focus on boosting oil and gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They need to be more aggressive with the drill bit. ... That's going to be the focus going forward," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global economic slump has prompted energy experts to pare back oil demand forecasts in recent months, and the oil price declines have forced many companies, such as Hess and Suncor Energy, to rein in spending on projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Irving, Texas-based Exxon said it planned to stick to its spending plans of $25 billion this year as it maintained its strong financial position despite the economic turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smaller rival Marathon Oil Corp said rising production and improved refinery margins helped it more than double profit in the quarter, but it cut planned 2009 spending by more than 15 percent because of the current business environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's earnings jumped 58 percent from a year ago to $14.8 billion, and operating profit climbed 42 percent to $13.4 billion, easily topping the previous U.S. record it set in the second quarter at $11.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's majority-owned Imperial Oil Ltd, Canada's top oil company, also had a strong quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell's profit rose 71 percent to $10.9 billion, topping analyst forecasts, but its shares slipped as investors focused on the Anglo-Dutch major's 7 percent drop in oil and gas production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shell also said Chief Financial Officer Peter Voser would take over from Jeroen van der Veer as CEO next July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decline in oil futures prices that cut into a rally early this week pushed Exxon shares down 2.5 percent, after early gains, and Shell fell 4.1 percent. Marathon jumped 6.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SERVICE SECTOR SEES SLOWDOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil services company BJ Services Co, while posting a rise in profit on Thursday, foresaw weaker activity by oil and gas producers weighing on its future earnings. It cut fiscal 2009 capital spending plans to a range of $550 million to $575 million, down from $600 million in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival Cameron International Corp, alongside a solid third-quarter performance, also said its 2009 capital expenditure would fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you look at the kind of capex we spent the last couple of years, if you make the assumption that we're pretty much where we need to be on capacity given the outlook, you'll probably see capex come down a little bit," Chief Financial Officer Charles Sledge told analysts on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That dimmer outlook was echoed by driller Patterson-UTI Energy, which said the number of rigs hired by energy companies to search for oil and gas was likely to shrink through the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patterson-UTI posted a rise quarterly profits of more than 10 percent, while contract driller Pride International Inc saw its profits surge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pride shares jumped 13 percent, Patterson-UTI shares rose 9 percent and Cameron was up 8.8 percent, while BJ Services fell less than 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp reported a 5.7 percent drop in quarterly profit on Thursday, missing market expectations as its subsidy burden grew.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ONGC, accounting for 78 percent of India's oil and gas production, must sell oil from its domestic output at mandated discounts to state-run refiners to keep retail prices low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily, Euan Rocha and Michael Erman in New York, Anna Driver in Houston, Braden Reddall in San Francisco, Tom Bergin in London and Devidutta Tripathy in New Delhi; Editing by Dave Zimmerman and Brian Moss)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Profit hits record as results beat expectations&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Shares edge down, following crude oil&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Sees production growth in 2009
 (Updates share price, adds production outlook, cash position)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Anna Driver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) posted
another record quarterly profit on Thursday, beating estimates,
on higher profit in its exploration and production business and
and improved margins in its refining unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even as crude oil prices drop and a global credit crunch
threatens oil demand, investors expect the world's largest
publicly traded company to continue on a similar course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since peaking in July above $147 per barrel, crude oil
futures CLZ8 have tumbled more than 50 percent and were
losing more ground on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon is very good at what they do and they are too large
a company to respond to gyrations in the oil market," said Mark
Coffelt, head portfolio manager at Empiric Advisors Inc in
Austin, Texas. "I think they will probably use cash to raise
their dividend and keep buying back stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Exxon Chief Executive Rex Tillerson
said the company plans to stick to its five-year, $125 billion
capital expenditure plan, even with financial markets in
turmoil. The company has $37 billion in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Profit in the third quarter for the world's largest
publicly traded company was $14.83 billion, or $2.86 per share,
compared with $9.4 billion, or $1.70 per share, in the same
period a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "U.S. downstream was up from last year, so that was a
positive surprise," said Gene Pisasale, senior energy analyst
with PNC Capital Advisors. "They have the strongest balance
sheet in the business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Exxon will need to be more aggressive in exploration
going forward, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy investors are concerned the credit crisis will
trigger a global recession and cut demand for oil. As a result,
the spending plans for oil majors such as Exxon will be
carefully scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding a gain related to the sale of a natural gas
transportation business in Germany, Exxon earned $13.38
billion, or $2.59 per share. The huge profit was another record
for the oil producer and the largest ever for any U.S. publicly
traded company on an operating basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts had expected the Irving, Texas, company to report
a profit of $2.38 per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it was still recovering from hurricanes
Ike and Gustav, which cut third-quarter production by 24,000
barrels oil equivalent per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The storms, which battered the U.S. Gulf Coast, are
expected to reduce the company's fourth-quarter earnings by
about $500 million, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Production decreased 8 percent from a year ago. On a
conference call with analysts, the company said its output
should increase in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings in Exxon's exploration and production unit,
excluding the sale of the German gas business, were $9.35
billion, up $3 billion from a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's refining arm saw profits rise $1 billion to
$3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the quarter, the oil company purchased $8 billion of
its shares, reducing the number outstanding by 2.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon shares were off 3 percent at $72.40 on the New York
Stock Exchange. So far this year, the stock has fallen 20
percent, outperforming a 36 percent drop in the Chicago Board
Options Exchange index of oil companies .OIX.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft extends use of DealBuilder and licenses Business Integrity's latest generation of DealBuilder

   The world's leading document assembly and contract automation
system
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Leveraging the success of its existing DealBuilder document
assembly system for generating End User License Agreements (EULAs),
Microsoft is licensing the new DealBuilder 3 system for EULAs and new
document assembly projects in its Legal and Corporate Affairs (LCA)
division.

   Additionally, Microsoft is licensing Business Integrity's
DealBuilder ContractExpress 3 contract lifecycle management solution
to enhance the process of creating and managing EULAs and other
contracts throughout their lifecycle.

   Andy Wishart, Business Integrity's CTO, commented, "It's always
great when a customer extends its existing license. It shows that
DealBuilder has delivered on its promise of improving business
processes and that Business Integrity's support and development team
has achieved the high standards of customer support expected by world
class organizations such as Microsoft".

   Andy continued, "DealBuilder 3 is Business Integrity's new
generation of document assembly and contract lifecycle management
products, which leverage the enhanced capabilities of Word 2007,
SharePoint 2007, and the Office Open XML standard. Microsoft described
DealBuilder 2 as "a generation ahead", so it's very pleasing to have
Microsoft license the next generation DealBuilder 3".

   Business Integrity (www.business-integrity.com) develops and
markets the DealBuilder legal document assembly and contract
automation system. DealBuilder is used by the world's leading law
firms and major corporations in the US and internationally to reduce
the time and cost of doing business by accelerating the creation and
approval of compliant sales contracts, and by improving the management
of those contracts throughout their lifecycle.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Oct 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Muhtar Kent, president and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, will be honored
with the top award of the United States Council for International
Business at a November 12 gala in New York.

    Mr. Kent was tapped to head the beverage giant in part because of
extensive international experience. The Coca-Cola Company recently
reported solid third-quarter earnings, bucking the downbeat trend among
many top companies, thanks in large part to growth in sales outside the
United States.

    According to USCIB Chairman William G. Parrett, Mr. Kent exemplifies the
spirit of the council's International Leadership Award, which is accorded
annually to a top CEO.

    "Muhtar Kent's background demonstrates why U.S.-based companies are
increasingly moving into their international ranks to find top talent,"
said Mr. Parrett, former CEO of Deloitte Touche Tohmatsu. "He has
demonstrated the global mindset necessary to push one's company into new
markets and into the vanguard of global business."

    Speakers at the gala event, which takes place at the Waldorf-Astoria,
include Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska and Hal Scott of Harvard Law
School, director of the Committee on Capital Markets Regulation. Senator
Hagel will address the results of the U.S. elections, while Professor
Scott will focus on the global financial system. The annual USCIB award
gala draws hundreds of business leaders as well as dignitaries from
government and diplomatic circles. More information on the event is
available at www.uscibgala.com.

    Recent recipients of USCIB's award include Fisk Johnson of SC Johnson,
Terry McGraw of McGraw-Hill and Jean-Rene Fourtou of Vivendi Universal.

    Mr. Kent joined The Coca-Cola Company in 1978 and has held a variety of
marketing and operations roles, both in the U.S. and overseas. He served
as president and CEO of the Efes Beverage Group in Istanbul from 1999
until his return to The Coca-Cola Company in 2005. He became CEO in July
of 2008.

    USCIB promotes an open system of global commerce. Its membership
encompasses leading U.S. companies, professional services firms and
associations. As American affiliate of several leading global business
groups, USCIB provides business views to policy makers and regulatory
authorities worldwide and works to facilitate international trade.

&lt;p&gt;Wave your mobile phone for the ultimate freedom to purchase
TORONTO--(Business Wire)--
RBC, Visa and Rogers Wireless have come together for the next
phase of the mobile phone payment pilot, which will ultimately allow
Canadians the flexibility to make purchases securely at the point of
sale with a wave of their mobile phone. The customer phase of the
mobile phone payment pilot is expected to launch in mid-2009,
following a brief employee pilot.

   Designed to be a fast and convenient way for customers to pay for
small purchases, pilot participants will be issued specially-equipped
mobile phones that can simply be waved at Visa payWave-enabled
checkout readers at select retail stores and quick-service restaurants
in Toronto's downtown core.

   "As Canada's largest wireless provider, Rogers Wireless is
continually seeking ways to provide our customers with new and
innovative services that will add value to their lives," said David
Robinson, Vice-President, New Business Planning, Rogers Wireless.
"This pilot is the first step to making our customers' mobile phones
as indispensable as their wallets and we are excited to be working
with Visa and RBC on this new wireless payment service."

   As part of the pilot, Motorola mobile phones outfitted with Near
Field Communication (NFC) contactless chips will enable customers to
make purchases using the Visa payWave feature just as they would with
a contactless RBC Visa card. The functions tested in the pilot will
include the secure delivery and storage of account information to the
mobile phone and the security of mobile payments at retailers.

   The pilot will be the first in Canada to test secure over-the-air
(OTA) delivery of mobile payment software and credit card information
to a customer's mobile phone. Gemalto, a world leader in digital
security, is providing this capability by acting as the Trusted
Service Manager and securely bridging banking with mobile phones.
Gemalto, who currently produce RBC Visa chip cards, will manage the
transfer of credit card information from RBC to the secure SIM card in
the Rogers Wireless NFC-enabled mobile phone, using the same high
level of security and encryption used to issue RBC Visa chip cards.

   "We're delighted to have Rogers Wireless on board to move our
payment pilot with Visa forward," said Anne Koski, head, Payments
Innovation, RBC Global Cards. "Our clients will definitely appreciate
the convenience of making purchases using their mobile phones and we
look forward to their feedback on this pilot."

   RBC was the first Canadian financial institution to offer a credit
card with chip technology nationwide and was the first to announce its
intentions to offer the Visa payWave feature on its cards. Mobile
payments are yet another extension of RBC's commitment to offer
clients convenient and secure payment options.

   Supported by Visa's mobile payment platform, pilot activities will
allow RBC, Rogers and Visa to better understand customer behaviours
and their perceptions of the payment experience before the service is
provided to consumers.

   "Visa aims to be the best way to pay and our approach to
innovation reflects this goal," said Mike Bradley, Head of Products,
Visa Canada. "Allowing consumers to use their mobile phones to pay
with Visa is an innovative new service, and also adds value to
retailers, financial institutions and mobile operators."

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Oct 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Playmaker's Standard, LLC, today released an illustrated analysis of
strategies employed by ExxonMobil as the oil giant responds to persistent
criticism of its corporate and environmental policies, notably by
skeptical environmental groups, financial analysts, hostile foreign
governments, and shareholder activists.

    Based on The Playmaker's Table(TM), a first-of-a-kind classification
framework of 25 irreducibly complex influence strategies, the independent
study shows how the Texas-based oil giant blunts and bends the agendas of
its most dogged detractors to preserve and propel its preferred
reputation and brand.

    Principal findings of the study:

    -- To manage public dialog and commentary, Exxon exhibits considerable
strategic range across the playmaker's spectrum, from evasive diverting
plays, such as the Deflect and Red Herring, to provocative Call Outs and
Preempts (see p. 6 of study for a glossary of terms).

    -- An exception is that Exxon relies on no luring plays to challenge or
bait its critics, an indication of the company's aversion to direct
engagement of negative public issues.

    -- Two of every three moves by Exxon opponents are supported by
high-interaction plays, particularly the Challenge and Call Out
stratagems, which are typically employed to pressure an opposing market
player.

    -- Exxon's opponents are slow to employ high-profile surrogates to
reinforce their claims -- a delay that suggests comparably poorer command
and control of their public campaigns.

    -- Exxon marketing campaigns tend not to involve the CEO, suggesting a
strategy to insulate and de-couple executive leadership from public
scrutiny of the company.

    The map was created on StrategyMapper(TM), a patent-pending web-tool that
illustrates patterns, sequences and trends of influence strategies in a
defined marketplace. The result: unparalleled insight into the means and
methods that corporations, the media, activists, politicians, governments
and others employ to drive agendas, manage conversations and counter
criticism. Data are aggregated using StrategySnapshot(TM).

    The Playmaker's Standard, LLC, based in the Washington, D.C. metro area,
is a management consulting and web software services firm specializing in
communication and competitive strategy. The company's work is based on
The Elements of Influence, a landmark book by CEO and founder Alan Kelly,
which details The Playmaker's Table, the first periodic table of influence
strategy.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stock trading, one of the few bright spots for JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Merrill Lynch  Co MER.N in the third quarter, could be a key source of profits for these banks in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But for banks that did not position themselves well for the third quarter's stock market turmoil -- most notably Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Citigroup (C.N) -- the fourth quarter could be difficult, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The big equity selloffs in October could really hurt a lot," said Jeff Harte, bank analyst at Sandler O'Neill in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any profits from equity sales and trading would be welcome for banks whose bond businesses are smarting from the credit crunch and whose merger advisory revenue has dropped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(Equity sales) will keep the lights on and pay the base salaries, but where the money is going to be made is the derivatives book," said Brad Hintz, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trick to making money in equities in current conditions is being positioned for markets where stocks are dropping and prices are seen as increasingly unpredictable, which lifts option prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From the beginning of July to the end of September, the Standard  Poor's 500 index .SPX fell by just under 9 percent. The VIX .VIX, a measure of market fluctuations that is linked to option prices, rose 40 percent over the same period and has jumped another 40 percent this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOME READY, SOME OFFSIDES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan seems to have been ready for that movement; revenue at its equity markets division climbed 35 percent in the third quarter compared with a year earlier, to $1.7 billion. The bank said strong trading results and customer business were key contributors to that increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's equity sales and trading profit rose 42 percent, and equity derivatives profit at Merrill Lynch, which is being acquired by Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), rose 14 percent on "increased trading activity and heightened market volatility."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Citigroup's revenue from equity markets fall 54 percent, and Goldman Sachs' revenue fell 50 percent, which it ascribed to an unusually strong period a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, banks could have changed their positions since the third quarter. And even banks positioned well last quarter might have trouble in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hedging is more expensive when markets whipsaw as violently as they have, and some banks might have closed out profitable positions too early.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's safe to say that month to date in October at least ... it's been a very tough trading environment," Sandler O'Neill's Harte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, painful losses due to equities and equity derivatives may not be that far away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg News reported on Monday that Deutsche Bank lost $400 million in the third quarter on equity derivatives positions. The German bank said in its third-quarter results on Thursday that it lost $142 million in equity sales and trading, compared with a profit of $830 million in the second quarter, due to "very significant dislocations in global equity markets in the month of September."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to get those trades right, but volatility on balance should be the friend this month," said David Harris, chief investment officer at Rockefeller  Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

   EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED:

   "ExxonMobil's strong results in the third quarter of 2008
demonstrate the continued success of our disciplined business
approach. Third quarter earnings excluding special items were a record
$13,380 million, up 42% from the third quarter of 2007. Earnings per
share excluding special items were up 52% reflecting the benefit of
the share purchase program. Record net income for the third quarter of
$14,830 million was up 58% from the third quarter of 2007. Net income
included an after-tax special gain of $1,620 million from the sale of
a natural gas transportation business in Germany and an after-tax
special charge of $170 million reflecting a provision for interest
related to the Valdez punitive damages award. Earnings for the first
nine months of 2008 excluding special items were $36,240 million, an
increase of 25% over the first nine months of 2007. Net income for the
first nine months of 2008 was $37,400 million, up 29% versus 2007.

   "Third quarter results include impacts of Hurricanes Gustav and
Ike which affected U.S. Gulf Coast operations during the period. We
responded quickly and effectively to maximize supplies of gasoline and
other products to the marketplace. The majority of our operations are
back on-line or are completing the final stages of start-up. At our
Beaumont Chemical facilities, we continue to progress repairs and
start-up planning after experiencing significant flooding during
Hurricane Ike. Quarterly upstream volumes were down 24 thousand oil
equivalent barrels per day and costs were higher by $50 million before
tax due to the hurricanes. Damage repairs and lower volumes across all
business lines associated with the hurricanes are expected to reduce
fourth quarter earnings by about $500 million.

   "Despite the continuing uncertainty in world financial markets,
ExxonMobil has maintained a strong financial position. We plan to
continue our disciplined capital investments with our full year
capital and exploration expenditures projected to be about
$25 billion, consistent with previous guidance. In the third quarter
of 2008, capital and exploration project spending increased to
$6.9 billion, up 26% from last year. For the first nine months of
2008, spending on capital and exploration projects was $19.3 billion.
Through these investments we continue to make a substantial
contribution to employment and economic activity in the countries in
which we operate.

   "The Corporation returned significant cash to shareholders,
distributing a total of $10.1 billion in the third quarter through
dividends of $2.1 billion and share purchases of $8.0 billion to
reduce shares outstanding by 2%."

   THIRD QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

   --  Earnings excluding special items were a record
        $13,380 million, an increase of 42% or $3,970 million from the
        third quarter of 2007.

   --  Earnings per share excluding special items were up 52% to
        $2.59 reflecting strong earnings and the continued reduction
        in the number of shares outstanding.

   --  Net income was a record at $14,830 million, up 58% from the
        third quarter of 2007.

   --  Third quarter 2008 net income included an after-tax special
        gain of $1,620 million from the sale of a natural gas
        transportation business in Germany and an after-tax special
        charge of $170 million reflecting a provision for interest
        related to the Valdez punitive damages award.

   --  Capital and exploration expenditures were $6.9 billion, up 26%
        from the third quarter of 2007.

   --  Share purchases of $8.0 billion reduced shares outstanding by
        2.1%.

   --  Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately
        $17.0 billion, including asset sales of $2.6 billion.

   --  The ExxonMobil-operated Kizomba C deepwater development
        started production from the Saxi and Batuque fields. Combined
        with the Mondo field, which came on stream in January, the
        Kizomba C project is now producing 200,000 barrels of oil per
        day (gross). The Kizomba C development, located off the coast
        of Angola, is designed to produce an estimated 600 million
        barrels of oil (gross) over the life of these three fields.

   --  ExxonMobil announced the start-up of the East Area Natural Gas
        Liquids II project, located offshore Nigeria. The project
        started ahead of schedule and is expected to recover more than
        275 million barrels of natural gas liquids from several East
        Area fields, which will help monetize gas resources and reduce
        gas flaring. At its peak, the project is expected to produce
        50,000 barrels of natural gas liquids per day.

   Third Quarter 2008 vs. Third Quarter 2007

   Upstream earnings, excluding the gain related to the sale of the
German natural gas transportation business, were $9,351 million, up
$3,052 million from the third quarter of 2007. Higher crude oil and
natural gas realizations increased earnings approximately
$4.4 billion. Lower sales volumes decreased earnings about
$1.3 billion.

   On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 8% from the third
quarter of 2007. Excluding lower entitlement volumes (which include
price and spend impacts and PSC net interest reductions) and impacts
associated with the hurricanes, production was down about 5%. Higher
maintenance activity and downtime reduced volumes by just under 3%.

   Liquids production totaled 2,291 kbd (thousands of barrels per
day), down 246 kbd from the third quarter of 2007. Excluding lower
entitlement volumes and the impacts of the hurricanes, liquids
production was down 5%, as increased production from projects in west
Africa and the North Sea was more than offset by mature field decline
and higher maintenance activity.

   Third quarter natural gas production was 7,823 mcfd (millions of
cubic feet per day), down 460 mcfd from 2007. Higher European demand
and new production volumes from project additions in the North Sea and
Malaysia were more than offset by mature field decline, increased
maintenance activity and entitlement effects.

   Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,879 million,
$683 million higher than the third quarter of 2007. Non-U.S. Upstream
earnings, excluding the gain related to the sale of the German natural
gas transportation business, were $7,472 million, up $2,369 million
from last year.

   Downstream earnings of $3,013 million were up $1,012 million from
the third quarter of 2007. Higher margins increased earnings by
$1.1 billion while favorable mix effects increased earnings by $200
million. Unfavorable foreign exchange effects were a partial offset.
Petroleum product sales of 6,688 kbd were 413 kbd lower than last
year's third quarter, mainly reflecting asset sales and lower demand.

   U.S. Downstream earnings were $978 million, up $64 million from
the third quarter of 2007. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of
$2,035 million were $948 million higher than last year.

   Chemical earnings of $1,087 million were $115 million lower than
the third quarter of 2007. Lower volumes, which reduced earnings
approximately $200 million, and lower margins were partly offset by
favorable foreign exchange effects. Third quarter prime product sales
of 6,060 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 669 kt lower than the
prior year due to hurricane effects and lower demand.

   Corporate and financing expenses of $71 million, excluding the
charge for interest related to the Valdez litigation, decreased by
$21 million.

   During the third quarter of 2008, Exxon Mobil Corporation
purchased 109 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a
gross cost of $8.7 billion. These purchases included $8.0 billion to
reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the balance used to
offset shares issued in conjunction with the company's benefit plans
and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced from 5,194 million at
the end of the second quarter to 5,087 million at the end of the third
quarter. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through
negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.

   First Nine Months 2008 vs. First Nine Months 2007

   Net income of $37,400 million ($7.11 per share) was a record and
increased $8,450 million from 2007. Excluding special items, earnings
for the first nine months of 2008 were $36,240 million, an increase of
$7,290 million from 2007.

   FIRST NINE MONTHS HIGHLIGHTS

   --  Earnings excluding special items were a record
        $36,240 million, up 25%.

   --  Earnings per share excluding special items increased 34% to
        $6.89, reflecting strong business results and the continued
        reduction in the number of shares outstanding.

   --  Net income was up 29% from 2007. Net income for the first nine
        months of 2008 included an after-tax special gain of $1,620
        million from the sale of a natural gas transportation business
        in Germany and after-tax special charges of $460 million
        related to the Valdez punitive damages award. Net income for
        the first nine months of 2007 did not include any special
        items.

   --  The effective income tax rate increased to 48% versus 45%.

   --  Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately
        $53.4 billion, including $4.2 billion from asset sales.

   --  The Corporation distributed a total of $30.0 billion to
        shareholders in 2008 through dividends and share purchases to
        reduce shares outstanding, an increase of $3.3 billion versus
        2007.

   --  Year to date dividends per share of $1.15 increased 13%.

   --  Capital and exploration expenditures were $19.3 billion, an
        increase of 31% versus 2007.

   Upstream earnings, excluding the gain related to the sale of the
German natural gas transportation business, were a record
$28,148 million, up $9,855 million from 2007. Record high crude oil
and natural gas realizations increased earnings approximately
$14.8 billion. Lower sales volumes reduced earnings about
$3.7 billion. Higher taxes and increased operating costs decreased
earnings approximately $1.5 billion. Favorable foreign exchange
effects provided a partial offset.

   On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 7% from last
year. Excluding impacts related to the Venezuela expropriation and
lower entitlement volumes, production was down about 4%.

   Liquids production of 2,383 kbd decreased 267 kbd from 2007.
Excluding the Venezuela expropriation and lower entitlement volumes,
liquids production was down about 5%, as field decline in mature areas
more than offset project volume increases.

   Natural gas production of 8,843 mcfd decreased 194 mcfd from 2007.
Higher volumes from North Sea, Malaysia and Qatar projects and higher
European demand were more than offset by mature field decline and
planned maintenance activity.

   Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2008 were
$5,544 million, an increase of $1,949 million. Earnings outside the
U.S., excluding the gain related to the sale of the German natural gas
transportation business, were $22,604 million, $7,906 million higher
than 2007.

   Downstream earnings of $5,737 million were $1,569 million lower
than 2007. Lower worldwide refining margins decreased earnings
approximately $1.9 billion while higher operating costs reduced
earnings about $400 million. Improved refinery operations increased
earnings about $800 million. Petroleum product sales of 6,761 kbd
decreased from 7,090 kbd in 2007, mainly reflecting asset sales and
lower demand.

   U.S. Downstream earnings were $1,669 million, down $1,829 million.
Non-U.S. Downstream earnings were $4,068 million, $260 million higher
than last year.

   Chemical earnings of $2,802 million decreased $649 million from
2007. Lower margins decreased earnings approximately $900 million,
while lower volumes decreased earnings by about $200 million.
Favorable foreign exchange and tax effects provided a partial offset.
Prime product sales of 19,356 kt were down 1,075 kt from 2007.

   Corporate and financing expenses of $447 million, excluding the
charges related to the Valdez litigation, increased by $347 million,
mainly due to lower interest rates and higher corporate costs.

   Gross share purchases through the first nine months of 2008 were
$26.9 billion, reducing shares outstanding by 5.5%.

   Estimates of key financial and operating data follow.

   ExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other
matters on a webcast at 10 a.m. Central time on October 30, 2008. To
listen to the event live or in archive, go to our website at
exxonmobil.com.

   Statements in this release relating to future plans, projections,
events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual results,
including project plans, resource recoveries and production rates,
capital expenditures, and the impact of hurricane damage on future
earnings, could differ materially due to changes in long-term oil or
gas prices or other market conditions affecting the oil and gas
industry; completion of repair projects as planned; unforeseen
technical difficulties; political events or disturbances; reservoir
performance; the outcome of commercial negotiations; wars and acts of
terrorism or sabotage; changes in technical or operating conditions;
and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting
Future Results" on our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2007
Form 10-K. We assume no duty to update these statements as of any
future date. References to quantities of oil expected to be developed
may include amounts not yet classified as proved reserves but that we
believe will ultimately be produced.

   Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes
both earnings excluding special items and earnings per share excluding
special items. Both are non-GAAP financial measures and are included
to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across
periods. A reconciliation to net income is shown in Attachment II. The
release also includes cash flow from operations and asset sales.
Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment
program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales
proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when
evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing
activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating
activities is shown in Attachment II. Further information on
ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and
other terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms"
available through the Investors section of our website at
exxonmobil.com.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Oct 30 (Reuters) - International Business Machines
(IBM.N) is planning a rare euro-denominated, five-year benchmark
bond to be listed in New York, International Financing Review
reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Guidance has been set at mid-swaps plus around 275 to 300
basis points, and BNP Paribas, HSBC, Morgan Stanley and UBS have
been named to manage the sale, said IFR, a subisidary of Thomson
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest technology service company, IBM offers
rarity value after having sold its last euro bond in November
2006, IFR said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, IBM raised $3.9 billion in a three-part
dollar-denominated bond, the first corporate bond sale to tap
the market in roughly a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It paid 387.5 basis points over Treasuries for five- and
10-year tranches and 400 basis points over for a 30-year
tranche. The spreads have tightened sharply since then, IFR
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM is rated A+ by Standard  Poor's and Fitch Ratings and
A1 by Moody's Investors Service.

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Oct 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
RBC (TSX: RY)(NYSE: RY), Visa and Rogers Wireless have come together for
the next phase of the mobile phone payment pilot, which will ultimately
allow Canadians the flexibility to make purchases securely at the point
of sale with a wave of their mobile phone. The customer phase of the
mobile phone payment pilot is expected to launch in mid-2009, following a
brief employee pilot.

    Designed to be a fast and convenient way for customers to pay for small
purchases, pilot participants will be issued specially-equipped mobile
phones that can simply be waved at Visa payWave-enabled checkout readers
at select retail stores and quick-service restaurants in Toronto's
downtown core.

    "As Canada's largest wireless provider, Rogers Wireless is continually
seeking ways to provide our customers with new and innovative services
that will add value to their lives," said David Robinson, Vice-President,
New Business Planning, Rogers Wireless. "This pilot is the first step to
making our customers' mobile phones as indispensable as their wallets and
we are excited to be working with Visa and RBC on this new wireless
payment service."

    As part of the pilot, Motorola mobile phones outfitted with Near Field
Communication (NFC) contactless chips will enable customers to make
purchases using the Visa payWave feature just as they would with a
contactless RBC Visa card. The functions tested in the pilot will include
the secure delivery and storage of account information to the mobile
phone and the security of mobile payments at retailers.

    The pilot will be the first in Canada to test secure over-the-air (OTA)
delivery of mobile payment software and credit card information to a
customer's mobile phone. Gemalto, a world leader in digital security, is
providing this capability by acting as the Trusted Service Manager and
securely bridging banking with mobile phones. Gemalto, who currently
produce RBC Visa chip cards, will manage the transfer of credit card
information from RBC to the secure SIM card in the Rogers Wireless
NFC-enabled mobile phone, using the same high level of security and
encryption used to issue RBC Visa chip cards.

    "We're delighted to have Rogers Wireless on board to move our payment
pilot with Visa forward," said Anne Koski, head, Payments Innovation, RBC
Global Cards. "Our clients will definitely appreciate the convenience of
making purchases using their mobile phones and we look forward to their
feedback on this pilot."

    RBC was the first Canadian financial institution to offer a credit card
with chip technology nationwide and was the first to announce its
intentions to offer the Visa payWave feature on its cards. Mobile
payments are yet another extension of RBC's commitment to offer clients
convenient and secure payment options.

    Supported by Visa's mobile payment platform, pilot activities will allow
RBC, Rogers and Visa to better understand customer behaviours and their
perceptions of the payment experience before the service is provided to
consumers.

    "Visa aims to be the best way to pay and our approach to innovation
reflects this goal," said Mike Bradley, Head of Products, Visa Canada.
"Allowing consumers to use their mobile phones to pay with Visa is an
innovative new service, and also adds value to retailers, financial
institutions and mobile operators."

&lt;p&gt;The Coca-Cola System Announces New Global Targets for Water Conservation and Climate Protection in Partnership with WWF

     Extends Partnership with WWF to Protect Freshwater Resources
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company, in partnership with World Wildlife Fund
(WWF), today announced ambitious new targets to improve water
efficiency and reduce carbon emissions within its system-wide
operations, while promoting sustainable agricultural practices and
helping to conserve the world's most important freshwater basins.

   "Our sustainability as a business demands a relentless focus on
efficiency in our use of natural resources. These performance targets
are one way we are engaging to improve our management of water and
energy," said Muhtar Kent, president and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company.

   "In this resource constrained world, successful businesses will
find ways to achieve growth while using fewer resources," said Carter
Roberts, president and CEO of WWF-US. "The Coca-Cola Company's
commitment to conservation responds to the imperative to solve the
global water and climate crisis."

   The partnership, announced by WWF and The Coca-Cola Company in
2007 with $20 million in funding, has now been extended an additional
two years (through 2012) with the Company providing $3.75 million in
new funding.

   The Coca-Cola Company also joined WWF's Climate Savers program in
which leading corporations from around the world work with WWF to
dramatically reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. By 2010, Climate
Savers companies will collectively cut carbon emissions by 14 million
tons annually - the equivalent to taking more than 3 million cars off
the road each year.

   Water Efficiency -- Saving 50 billion liters in 2012

   The Coca-Cola system will improve its water efficiency 20 percent
by 2012, compared to a baseline year 2004. While water use is expected
to increase as the business grows, this water efficiency target will
eliminate approximately 50 billion liters of that increase in 2012.

   To support this efficiency target, The Coca-Cola Company and WWF
have developed a Water Efficiency Toolkit to help reduce water
consumption within bottling plants. This software-based instruction
manual has been distributed to managers and operators throughout the
Coca-Cola system, providing strategies to shrink the water footprint
of their operations.

   Climate Protection -- Preventing 2 million tons of CO(2) emissions

   The Company has set two emissions reduction targets: 1) grow the
business, not the carbon system-wide and 2) a 5 percent absolute
reduction in Annex 1 (developed) countries. The emissions targets
apply to manufacturing operations in the year 2015 compared to a
baseline year of 2004.

   The Coca-Cola Company and its bottlers anticipate substantial
volume growth globally during this period, thus growing the business
without growing the carbon is a significant commitment. Without
intervention, emissions would grow proportional to volume and reach
7.3 million metric tons in 2015. Thus, the global commitment will
prevent the release of more than 2 million metric tons of CO(2) in
2015 - the equivalent of planting 600,000 acres of trees.

   Supply Chain Sustainability

   The Coca-Cola Company also will work with WWF to promote more
sustainable agricultural practices in an effort to reduce the impact
of its supply chain on water resources. This work will initially focus
on sugarcane production. The Coca-Cola Company and WWF are working
with the Better Sugarcane Initiative to establish standards, evaluate
suppliers and set goals for the purchase of sugar. The Coca-Cola
Company will identify two additional commodities on which to work in
2009.

   Freshwater Conservation

   The Coca-Cola system and WWF are working together to conserve some
of the world's most important freshwater resources, including the
Yangtze, Mekong, Danube, Rio Grande/Rio Bravo, Lakes Niassa and
Chiuta, the Mesoamerican Reef catchments, and the rivers and streams
in the southeastern region of the United States. More than a dozen
production plants and/or bottlers in the areas surrounding these
rivers are developing and implementing water stewardship plans to
serve as models throughout the Coca-Cola system.

   "Water and energy conservation are areas where we can truly make a
difference. Last year, we set a goal to return to communities and to
nature an amount of water equal to what we use in our beverages and
their production. These targets support our work to achieve that
goal," said Kent. "The expansion of our partnership with WWF
demonstrates our shared dedication to achieving large-scale results,
and a grounded understanding that collaboration is key if we are to
help address the world's water challenges."

significantly accelerate our global expansion because we are no longer
limited by organic growth to finance expansion throughout European and
Asian markets. We will increase our investment in infrastructure,

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)

 Oct 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its 2009-10 earnings
forecast on 16 mid-cap European consumer stocks by an average
of 15.3 percent, citing softening demand in developed markets,
deteriorating pricing power, operational cost deleverage and
higher funding costs.

 "The 16 mid-cap consumer stocks in our coverage universe
have declined by 11.6 percent - 86.1 percent over the last 12
months, reflecting the expectation of a challenging consumer
environment," Goldman Sachs wrote in a note to clients.

 The brokerage downgraded Aryzta ARYN.S, Dairy Crest
(DCG.L), PZ Cussons (PZC.L) and Agrana (AGRV.VI) to "sell" from
"neutral."

 "Our base case now incorporates an assumption of a slowing
macroeconomic environment. We believe that this scenario will
see consumer spending power reduced in the developed markets
and a slowdown in emerging market growth." the brokerage said.

 Goldman also cut its 2009-10 revenue forecast on the 16

 The brokerage, however, upgraded Associated British Foods

        $20 million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the third quarter

   --  PGE initiates 2009 earnings guidance of $1.80 - $1.90 per
        diluted share.
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) today reported that
net income was zero for the third quarter of 2008 compared to $20
million, or $0.32 per diluted share, for the third quarter of 2007.
The decrease was due primarily to a $20 million after-tax provision
for the future refund to customers related to the Oregon Public
Utility Commission's (OPUC) Trojan Refund Order. Pursuant to Senate
Bill 408 (SB 408) there was also a $7 million after-tax impact of an
estimated increased customer refund, primarily due to the Trojan
Refund Order. Also contributing to the decrease was a $3 million
after-tax impact of a decline in the fair market value of
non-qualified benefit plan trust assets. Results were partially offset
by a 3 percent increase in retail energy deliveries and reduced power
costs. In the third quarter of 2008, the Company's power costs
decreased by $6 million related to results of the power cost
adjustment mechanism (PCAM), while power costs in the 2007 comparable
period included a $12 million increase related to the PCAM.

   Net income for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2008, was $67
million, or $1.08 per diluted share, compared to $121 million, or
$1.93 per diluted share, for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2007.

   "Portland General Electric had solid operating results in the
third quarter, and our residential customer satisfaction ratings rose
to their highest level in a decade," said Peggy Fowler, CEO and
president of Portland General Electric (PGE). "Our third-quarter
financial results were impacted by the Trojan Refund Order, but we're
pleased to be moving ahead in getting this challenging issue
resolved."

   2008 and 2009 Earnings Guidance

   PGE is reducing its full-year 2008 earnings guidance to $1.40 -
$1.50 per diluted share. This decrease from $1.85 - $1.95 per diluted
share is due primarily to the effects of the Trojan Refund Order and
losses on non-qualified benefit trust assets. The estimated net impact
of the Trojan Refund Order on 2008 earnings is approximately $0.41 per
diluted share and includes both SB 408 and PCAM impacts. PGE is
initiating 2009 earnings guidance of $1.80 - $1.90 per diluted share
based on normal hydro conditions and normal plant operations. PGE is
also reaffirming its long-term annual earnings growth expectation of 6
to 8 percent beginning with 2009.

   Dividend

   On Wednesday, Oct. 29, 2008, the PGE Board of Directors declared a
quarterly common stock dividend of 24.5 cents per share. The dividend
is payable on or before Jan. 15, 2009, to shareholders of record at
the close of business on Dec. 26, 2008.

   Market Conditions and Liquidity

   PGE has significant capital funding requirements in 2009 and 2010.
Although the recent turmoil in market conditions has made access to
capital more challenging, PGE believes it has sufficient access to
liquidity to meet anticipated capital and operating requirements.
Liquidity sources include issuances of long-term debt and equity
securities, availability under the Company's revolving credit facility
and the expected ability to increase short-term credit capacity. The
Company anticipates issuing a total of approximately $230 million of
equity and $300 million of new long-term debt in either late 2008 or
in 2009, subject to market conditions and availability of capital.

   PGE has an unsecured $400 million revolving credit facility with a
group of banks. In June 2008, PGE extended the maturity on $390
million of the facility to July 2013, with the remaining $10 million
maturing in July 2012.

   Lehman Brothers represented $55 million of PGE's $400 million
revolving credit facility. On Sept.15, 2008, Lehman's parent company,
Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., filed for protection under Chapter 11
of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. In October 2008, $25 million of Lehman's
$55 million share was reassigned to Sumitomo Mitsui Banking
Corporation. PGE is in discussions with another financial institution
for reassignment of the remaining $30 million.

   As of Oct. 24, 2008, PGE had $179 million of available borrowing
capacity under its revolving credit facility. PGE had $50 million of
commercial paper outstanding and $83 million in letters of credit. In
addition, the Company had $58 million of borrowings under the credit
facility.

   Trojan Refund Order

   On Sept. 30, 2008, the OPUC issued an order that requires PGE to
refund $33.1 million to customers. The refund relates to the OPUC
determination of the recoverable balance at Sept. 30, 2000, of the
Company's remaining investment in Trojan.

   The OPUC ruled that the difference of $15.4 million, plus interest
at 9.6 percent from Sept. 30, 2000, should be refunded to customers
who received service from PGE during the period Oct. 1, 2000, to Sept.
30, 2001. The $15.4 million amount, plus accrued interest, results in
a total refund of $33.1 million as of Sept. 30, 2008. The order also
provides that the total refund amount will earn interest at 9.6
percent from Oct. 1, 2008, until all refunds are issued to customers.

   In the order, the OPUC also made the following findings:

   --  The OPUC has authority to order a utility to issue refunds to
        former customers under certain limited circumstances.

   --  PGE's rates that were in effect for the period April 1, 1995,
        through Sept. 30, 2000, were just and reasonable.

   As a result of this order, PGE accrued the total refund due to
customers of $33.1 million as a regulatory liability, which reduced
revenues for the third quarter of 2008. PGE is continuing to review
and evaluate the order.

   2009 General Rate Case

   In February 2008, PGE filed a general rate case which is currently
under review by the OPUC. PGE's initial filing proposed an 8.9 percent
average price increase related to higher purchased power and fuel
costs, increased investment in utility plant and higher operating
expenses.

   PGE, OPUC staff and interveners have reached stipulations on two
major items: cost of capital and the method for determining estimated
power cost. First, the cost of capital stipulation provides for a
capital structure of 50 percent equity and 50 percent debt and a
return on equity of 10.1 percent. Second, the agreement on net
variable power costs (NVPC) stipulates to a number of modeling and
other adjustments, which results in an approximate $5 million downward
adjustment to the forecast of 2009's NVPC. The stipulated items and
the power cost updates filed to date would result in a proposed
average price increase of approximately 10 percent. Certain customer
credits, including those related to 2007 results of PGE's PCAM, are
expected to reduce the average price increase to approximately 8.4
percent.

   Next steps in the procedural schedule include reply briefs on
Tuesday, Nov. 4, oral arguments on Thursday, Nov. 13, and an order
from the OPUC by year-end, with new prices expected to go into effect
on Jan. 1, 2009.

   The following table indicates the revenue requirement increase as
originally filed on Feb. 27, 2008, and PGE's updated revenue
requirement increase based on the settlement agreements and the Sept.

   Biglow Canyon Wind Farm

   Construction has started on Phase II of the Biglow Canyon Wind
Farm. The estimated total cost of Phases II and III is $730 million to
$770 million, including allowance for funds used during construction
(AFDC) of approximately $40 million, with Phases II and III expected
to be completed by the end of 2009 and 2010, respectively.

   Smart Meters

   PGE plans to install approximately 850,000 new customer meters
that will enable two-way remote communications. In May 2008, the OPUC
approved PGE's smart-meter project. Approximately 16,000 new meters
are currently being installed as part of the project's acceptance
testing phase, with the remaining meters to be installed starting in
2009 and concluding in 2010. PGE expects the smart-meter project to
provide improved services, as well as operational efficiencies and a
reduction in future expenses.

   Capital Expenditures

   Capital expenditures in 2008 are estimated to be $401 million.
This consists of:

   --  $222 million for ongoing production, transmission and
        distribution facilities

   --  $98 million for Phases II and III of the Biglow Canyon Wind
        Farm

   --  $59 million for hydro relicensing projects

   --  $19 million for smart meters

   --  $3 million for Boardman emissions controls

   Capital expenditures in 2009 are estimated to be $760 million.
This consists of:

   --  $240 million for ongoing production, transmission and
        distribution facilities

   --  $414 million for Phases II and III of the Biglow Canyon Wind
        Farm

   --  $25 million for hydro relicensing projects

   --  $79 million for smart meters

   --  $2 million for Boardman emissions controls

   Third-Quarter 2008 Results Compared to Third Quarter 2007

   --  Total retail customers served increased 1.3 percent to
        approximately 814,000 as of Sept. 30, 2008, compared to
        approximately 804,000 as of Sept. 30, 2007.

   --  Total revenues decreased by $35 million due primarily to the
        net effect of the following factors:

-0-
*T
     -- Total retail revenues decreased $34 million, or 9 percent, due
      primarily to the accrual of refunds to customers in the amount
      of $33.1 million pursuant to the OPUC order issued Sept. 30,
      2008, related to various Trojan matters.

     -- $12 million decrease related to SB 408, largely due to an
      estimated refund due to customers of $6 million recorded in the
      third quarter of 2008, resulting primarily from the Trojan
      Refund Order, compared to an estimated collection from customers
      of $5 million recorded in the third quarter of 2007.

     -- $10 million increase resulting from a 2 percent increase in
      average price and a 3 percent increase in total retail energy
      deliveries, which was primarily due to a 1.4 percent increase in
      the average number of customers served during the third quarter
      of 2008, relative to the third quarter of 2007.

     -- $7 million decrease in wholesale revenues due to a $16 million
      decrease in wholesale energy sales volume partially offset by a
      $9 million increase in average price due to higher natural gas
      prices.

     -- $6 million increase in other operating revenue due primarily
      to the sale of fuel oil in 2008. Pursuant to an assessment of
      reliability requirements, PGE reduced oil inventory levels at
      its Beaver Plant.
*T

   --  Purchased power and fuel expense decreased by $25 million due
        primarily to the net effect of the following factors:

-0-
*T
     -- $50 million decrease related to settled natural gas agreements
      entered into in conjunction with PGE's management of its NVPC.

     -- $18 million decrease related to application of the Company's
      PCAM.

     -- $30 million increase in the cost of purchased power, resulting
      primarily from a 27 percent increase in the average cost.

     -- $11 million increase in the cost of natural gas-fired
      production, as a 55 percent increase in the average cost of
      natural gas was only partially offset by a 24 percent reduction
      in generation.
*T

   --  Production and distribution expense increased by $4 million
        due primarily to a $2 million increase in overhead and
        underground line maintenance costs, including tree trimming,
        and a $1 million increase in operating costs at Biglow Canyon
        Phase I, which was completed in December 2007.

   --  Administrative and other expense increased $2 million
        primarily due to an increase in the provision for
        uncollectible accounts and increased legal and regulatory
        fees.

   --  Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $8 million.
        Of this increase, $4 million is related to higher distribution
        plant balances and accelerated depreciation on existing meters
        which are being replaced as part of the Company's smart-meter
        project, and $3 million is related to the new Biglow Canyon
        Phase I project.

   --  Other income decreased by $7 million primarily due to a
        decline in the fair market value of non-qualified benefit plan
        trust assets.

   --  Interest expense increased $2 million due primarily to a
        higher level of short- and long-term debt outstanding.

   --  Income tax benefit was $1 million compared to a $12 million
        income tax expense in the third quarter of 2007. The change is
        primarily the result of lower taxable income and an increase
        of $1 million in federal energy tax credits generated from the
        operation of Biglow Canyon Phase I in the third quarter of
        2008.

   Year-to-Date 2008

   Net income for the nine months ended Sept. 30, 2008, was $67
million, or $1.08 per diluted share, compared to $121 million, or
$1.93 per diluted share, for 2007. The decrease was primarily due to
the net effect of:

   --  $20 million after-tax provision for the future refund to
        customers related to the Trojan Refund Order.

   --  $13 million after-tax impact of the deferral in 2007 of a
        portion of Boardman replacement power cost (including accrued
        interest) for potential future recovery.

   --  $10 million after-tax impact of adjustments related to SB 408.

   --  $9 million after-tax impact of a decline in the fair market
        value of non-qualified benefit plan assets.

   --  $4 million after-tax impact of a 2007 settlement between PGE
        and certain California parties related to wholesale energy
        transactions during 2000 and 2001.

   --  The decreases above were partially offset by a 3 percent
        increase in retail energy deliveries.

   Year-to-Date 2008 Results Compared to Year-to-Date 2007

   --  Total revenues increased by $23 million due to the net effect
        of the following factors:

-0-
*T
     -- $28 million increase resulting from a 2 percent increase in
      average price, which was driven by the Company's smart-meter
      project, and recovery of Port Westward and Biglow Canyon Phase
      I.

     -- $21 million increase resulting from a 3 percent increase in
      total retail energy deliveries, due to more extreme weather
      conditions in 2008 and a 1.4 percent increase in the average
      number of customers served during the first nine months of 2008
      relative to the first nine months of 2007.

     -- $33.1 million decrease, related to the accrual of refunds to
      customers pursuant to the OPUC order issued Sept. 30, 2008,
      related to various Trojan matters.

     -- $17 million decrease related to SB 408, with an estimated
      refund due to customers of $7 million recorded in 2008, compared
      to an estimated collection from customers of $10 million
      recorded in 2007.

     -- $4 million increase in wholesale revenues due to a $39 million
      increase resulting from a 34 percent increase in average price,
      partially offset by a $35 million decrease in wholesale energy
      sales volume.

     -- $16 million increase in other operating revenue due to sales
      of fuel oil from the Company's Beaver Plant in 2008, which
      resulted in a net gain of $11 million.
*T

   --  Purchased power and fuel expense increased by $32 million due
        primarily to the net effect of the following factors:

-0-
*T
     -- $99 million increase in the cost of thermal production, due
      primarily to a 39 percent increase in the average cost of
      natural gas and a 41 percent increase in gas-fired generation.

     -- $20 million increase related to the deferral of excess
      Boardman power costs in the first quarter of 2007, which were
      incurred in late 2005 and early 2006.

     -- $5 million increase due to a reduction in the Company's
      wholesale credit reserve in the first quarter of 2007, primarily
      as a result of a settlement with certain California parties
      involving transactions in 2000 and 2001.

     -- $46 million decrease in the cost of purchased power, due
      primarily to an 18 percent decrease in purchases resulting from
      the addition of Port Westward and Biglow Canyon Phase I to the
      Company's generation portfolio.

     -- $37 million decrease related to settled natural gas agreements
      entered into in conjunction with PGE's management of its power
      cost.

     -- $14 million decrease in the estimated amount recorded for
      potential future refund to customers under the PCAM.
*T

   --  Production and distribution expense increased by $16 million
        due primarily to the following:

-0-
*T
     -- $7 million increase in operating costs at the Company's
      generation facilities, including Port Westward and Biglow Canyon
      Phase I.

     -- $4 million increase in distribution labor, contractor and
      tree-trimming costs.

     -- $3 million increase related to repair and maintenance
      activities completed at Boardman and Beaver during the plants'
      scheduled outages in 2008.
*T

   --  Administrative and other expense increased $6 million
        primarily due to an increase in legal settlement expense,
        higher employee benefit expenses and an increase in the
        provision for uncollectible accounts.

   --  Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $20 million
        primarily due to increased capital plant additions. Increased
        depreciation of $14 million is primarily related to Port
        Westward and Biglow Canyon Phase I. In addition, a $4 million
        increase was related to accelerated depreciation of existing
        meters that are being replaced as part of the Company's
        smart-meter project.

   --  Other income decreased by $22 million primarily due to the
        following:

-0-

     -- $15 million decrease in income from non-qualified benefit plan
      trust assets resulting from the recognition of a $9 million
      decline in the fair market value of the plan assets during the
      first nine months of 2008, compared to a $6 million increase in
      the first nine months of 2007.

     -- $6 million decrease in AFDC equity, which resulted from lower
      construction work in progress (CWIP) balances during the first
      nine months of 2008 due to the completion of both Port Westward
      and Biglow Canyon Phase I.
*T

   --  Interest expense increased by $13 million primarily due to a
        higher level of outstanding long-term debt and lower AFDC debt
        resulting from lower CWIP balances.

   --  Income taxes decreased by $35 million, with an effective tax
        rate of 29 percent in 2008 compared to 34 percent in 2007.
        These decreases were primarily the result of lower taxable
        income and an increase of $5 million in federal energy tax
        credits generated from the operation of Biglow Canyon Phase I
        in 2008.

&lt;p&gt; * Adjusted net income was higher-than-expected&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sees revenue growth at lower end of previous estimate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * CFO says company being "cautious" and "conservative"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Add CFO comment, details, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world's largest
credit card network, beat Wall Street expectations on
Wednesday, but said its annual revenue growth target will be at
the lower end of a previous stated goal, citing a challenging
economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company guided its financial outlook for annual net
revenue growth to the lower end of the 11 percent to 15 percent
range it had estimated, as consumer spending falls and the
global economic outlook deteriorates rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa makes money from processing transactions and does not
lend, making it immune to credit concerns, but exposed to
overall spending volume. That growth could slow if the economy
continues to weaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But offsetting any potential slowdown on spending volume is
the fact that more consumers globally, particularly in the
developing world, are embracing credit and debit cards for
everyday spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The only real threat is a downturn in global consumer
spending, which is the key driver behind Visa's profits. The
upcoming holiday season will be a pretty powerful litmus test
of how such spending will play out," Red Gillen, an analyst at
Celent, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said that revenue growth may be somewhat challenged in
2010 given the current economic environment in the U.S. and
around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are trying to be cautious and conservative," Chief
Financial Officer Byron Pollitt said in a conference call with
analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The outlook overshadowed higher-than-expected adjusted
quarterly profit boosted by international processing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding litigation, restructuring and other expenses, the
company said its adjusted net income for the fiscal fourth
quarter ended September 30 was $448 million, or 58 cents per
Class A share, compared with pro forma income of $196 million a
year earlier, when the company was privately held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts forecast, on average, adjusted earnings of 56
cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company affirmed its targets of an annual adjusted
operating margin in the mid-to-high 40 percent range, annual
adjusted diluted Class A common earnings per share growth of 20
percent or more, and annual free cash flow in excess of $1
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa posted a quarterly net loss of $356 million, against a
net loss of $1.65 billion a year ago, hit by a litigation
reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net operating revenue rose 17 percent to $1.7 billion,
while payments volume grew 15 percent to $699 billion, boosted
by growth in the U.S., Asia and Latin America, among other
places.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's stock cut its earlier losses and was stable in
after-hours trade. The company's shares have fallen around 10
percent since its debut on the New York Stock Exchange in
March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Juan Lagorio, editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) quarterly profit more than doubled, easily beating Wall Street forecasts, as high oil prices and healthy refinery margins boosted its bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The third-quarter results from the second-largest U.S. oil company on Friday came a day after larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) also beat estimates and set another U.S. record for quarterly profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While smaller players have been forced to pare back investment, both majors will take advantage of their financial firepower and stick to their plans for capital spending, which totaled $15.8 billion for Chevron in the first nine months of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We anticipate trying to hold our capital expenditure pretty much in line with where we've been this year," said George Kirkland, vice president for Chevron's upstream and gas business. "We don't like fluctuating our capital spend up and down. Our long-term view on pricing has really not changed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are concerned that the credit crisis will trigger a global recession and cut energy demand, so the oil majors' spending plans are being carefully scrutinized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's third quarter net income rose to $7.9 billion, or $3.85 per share, from $3.7 billion, or $1.75 per share, in the same period a year ago. Revenue rose 43 percent to $78.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts had expected a net income of $6.55 billion, or $3.27 a share, according to the average on Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Italy's Eni SpA (ENI.MI), another top-10 global oil company, reported on Friday a 53 percent rise in profit and said it would keep its capital spending steady.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's U.S. refineries made a profit of $1 billion after suffering a loss of $110 million a year before, while profit from international operations rose 68 percent to $817 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Exxon's, Chevron refineries had a better-than-expected performance after oil prices peaked early in the quarter and declined sharply over the next two months, cutting their input costs and bolstering margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With oil still historically pricey, Chevron's oil and gas production side also saw much better profits than a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was sort of a sweet spot right in the middle of the quarter with the pricing of upstream and downstream," said Michael Cuggino, chief executive of Pacific Heights Asset Management in San Francisco, who manages about $3.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cuggino said he was a long-term holder of Chevron, as well as ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and BP Plc (BP.L), given anticipated supply constraints and energy demand growth in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With U.S. retail gasoline prices posting their steepest-ever drop after peaking above $4 per gallon in the summer driving season, near-term demand may prove more robust than expected, one analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Frankly, what we're hearing about prices and with the demand coming back for gasoline, we could see refining margins being stronger into the first half of next year than what people had been planning for," said R. Lewis Ropp, analyst at Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney and Strauss, which owns nearly 2 million Chevron shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third-quarter capital expenditure rose to $5.5 billion from $5.2 billion a year earlier. Stock buybacks totaled $2 billion, as in the previous four quarters, and Chevron Chief Financial Officer Steve Crowe said this quarter would be no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares touched a three-week high of $75.97, and ended 0.6 percent higher at $74.60. The shares have lost a fifth of their value in 2008, versus a 33 percent drop in the Chicago Board Options Exchange oil company .OIX index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRODUCTION DROPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas production fell 5.8 percent in the quarter to 2.44 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day, hurt by storms and reductions built into production-sharing agreements outside the United States that lower its stake as prices rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, said Gulf of Mexico hurricanes cut upstream, or exploration and production, earnings by about $400 million and cut September output by about 150,000 BOE per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Half of the production lost to the hurricanes has been restored, but bringing the rest back will be largely dependent on the return of damaged pipelines not owned by Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since peaking in July above $147 per barrel, crude oil futures have tumbled more than 50 percent, but prices were still well above the year-ago level for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron reiterated its assumption of a 4 percent to 5 percent rate of decline in output from existing wells, which is about half the industry average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling output for Chevron and others may lead the biggest companies to seek acquisitions to prop up their portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These guys have got to begin thinking about consolidating the smaller players that have the growth profiles," Ropp said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily and Braden Reddall; editing by Dave Zimmerman, Gerald E.

than expected, one analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Frankly, what we're hearing about prices and with the
demand coming back for gasoline, we could see refining margins
being stronger into the first half of next year than what
people had been planning for," said R. Lewis Ropp, analyst at
Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney and Strauss, which owns nearly 2
million Chevron shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Third-quarter capital expenditure rose to $5.5 billion from
$5.2 billion a year earlier. Stock buybacks totaled $2 billion,
as in the previous four quarters, and Chevron Chief Financial
Officer Steve Crowe said this quarter would be no different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares touched a three-week high of $75.97, and
ended 0.6 percent higher at $74.60. The shares have lost a
fifth of their value in 2008, versus a 33 percent drop in the
Chicago Board Options Exchange oil company .OIX index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PRODUCTION DROPS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil and gas production fell 5.8 percent in the quarter to
2.44 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day, hurt by
storms and reductions built into production-sharing agreements
outside the United States that lower its stake as prices rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, based in San Ramon, California, said Gulf of
Mexico hurricanes cut upstream, or exploration and production,
earnings by about $400 million and cut September output by
about 150,000 BOE per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Half of the production lost to the hurricanes has been
restored, but bringing the rest back will be largely dependent
on the return of damaged pipelines not owned by Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since peaking in July above $147 per barrel, crude oil
futures CLZ8 have tumbled more than 50 percent, but prices
were still well above the year-ago level for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron reiterated its assumption of a 4 percent to 5
percent rate of decline in output from existing wells, which is
about half the industry average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Falling output for Chevron and others may lead the biggest
companies to seek acquisitions to prop up their portfolios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These guys have got to begin thinking about consolidating
the smaller players that have the growth profiles," Ropp said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) could post its first ever quarterly loss as a public company in December, as market turmoil weighs on revenue for investment banking businesses and forces asset writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Wall Street analyst, Glenn Schorr at UBS, predicted a loss for the bank on Friday. The potential for a quarterly loss, combined with the generally weaker environment for financial institutions, has some investors wondering if Goldman Sachs really deserves to trade at a higher valuation than Morgan Stanley, (MS.N) the other major independent investment bank that is now a commercial bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's shares trade at about 1.1 times their tangible book value, while Morgan Stanley's shares trade at less than half their tangible book value. A spokesman for Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is legendary for its risk management expertise. In early 2007, it saw the storm clouds gathering above the subprime mortgage market and positioned itself to profit from the expected home loan downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company posted record net income in the fourth quarter of 2007, even as less nimble competitors like Merrill Lynch  Co Inc MER.N were already recording massive losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the duration and intensity of this credit crunch has surprised many of the savviest investors. After having already fallen 21 percent in the first nine months of the year, the Standard  Poor's 500's .SPX fell 17 percent in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many bond sectors have weakened in recent weeks, the dollar has unexpectedly surged against the euro and other currencies, and the price of oil has plummeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile merger activity has ground to a halt globally, and hedge funds, some of Goldman's best trading customers, are cratering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The business conditions are horrendous for these guys now," said Anton Schutz, chief investment officer at Mendon Capital Advisors in Rochester, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The conditions will likely pressure Goldman's net revenue, which was typically at least $10 billion a quarter in 2007 and dropped to about $6 billion last quarter. With so many business lines looking weaker, Goldman's revenue in the fourth quarter could be closer to about $5 billion, although the average estimate among Wall Street analysts is $6.3 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Goldman faces significant potential writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's investment in Industrial and Commercial Bank of China Ltd (601398.SS) (1398.HK), worth $2.6 billion in its fiscal third quarter ended August 29, is worth about $900 million less after a broad rout in Chinese stocks. The bank's principal investments, including private assets, public assets and real estate, worth about $17.1 billion at the end of last quarter, could now be worth $3.4 billion less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's $14.6 billion of commercial real estate could be worth $700 million less, assuming the firm was able to hedge all but 5 percent of the potential declines. The same assumption for Goldman's $7.6 billion of residential mortgage exposure yields another $380 million of write downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add up those numbers, and the writedowns could total $5 billion. Throw in another $2 billion of non-personnel related expenses, which is about what Goldman averages every quarter, and the fourth quarter could be ugly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the firm's principal investments could suffer meaningful mark downs in the quarter and lead to a loss," wrote UBS analyst Glenn Schorr on Friday. Schorr is the first Wall Street sellside analyst to forecast a quarterly loss for Goldman Sachs -- he cut his estimate to a loss of 40 cents a share from his prior estimate of earnings of $1.40 a share. The Wall Street average estimate is for earnings of $2.40 a share before items.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be sure, a fourth-quarter loss is not a sure thing for Goldman Sachs. The company still has another month left in its fiscal fourth quarter, and markets may recover then, particularly as credit markets show signs of thawing, said Mendon's Schutz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Goldman can set aside much less money for compensation in the fourth quarter than it has in prior quarters, which would reduce its costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But amid all the difficulties facing the investment banking business, some investors wonder if Goldman Sachs deserves to trade at a higher valuation than Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley is facing problems of its own, some analysts note. It has lost hedge fund customers in its prime brokerage business to other banks. Its efforts to collect deposits could end up being quite costly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even with these challenges for Morgan Stanley, some investors wonder if Goldman deserves such a large premium valuation over its competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is Goldman that much of a better business than Morgan Stanley now?" one hedge fund manager asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), the nation's largest bank and one of its biggest mortgage lenders, temporarily halted foreclosures on Friday and offered to renegotiate a swathe of mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The global credit crisis, which began with subprime mortgages, increasingly appears to be affecting a wider range of consumer loans and, according to a report published by First American CoreLogic on Friday, nearly one in five U.S. mortgage borrowers now owes more on the loan than their home is worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has avoided the large writedowns and credit losses posted by rival banks because it has limited exposure to the riskier classes of mortgages, such as subprime loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But when the bank acquired failed savings and loan Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK in September, it inherited that bank's more toxic mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expansion of the mortgage modification plan will target many of these mortgages, as well as prime mortgages held by JPMorgan that are also starting to show signs of deterioration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prime mortgages, especially where there are pay-option ARMs involved, (are) becoming a broader issue," said Charles Scharf, head of retail financial services at JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has about $250 billion of prime mortgages and home equity loans, $27 billion in subprime mortgages and about $51 billion of "option" adjustable-rate mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other lenders have also had loan modification programs in place, including Washington Mutual and the former Countrywide Financial Corp, which was acquired in July by Bank of America Corp (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Bank of America agreed with 11 state attorneys general to offer relief to nearly 400,000 Countrywide customers with troubled mortgages, resulting in an expected $8.4 billion of interest rate and principal reductions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) and Citigroup Inc (C.N), two other major mortgage lenders, did not immediately return requests for comment on whether they plan expanded loan modification programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of JPMorgan's effort, expected to last about 90 days, the bank will hire loan counselors and introduce alternatives to existing mortgage agreements. During this period, the bank will not put any additional loans into foreclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan expects to renegotiate $70 billion of mortgages over two years, in addition to $40 billion held by 250,000 borrowers since early last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program covers borrowers who live in their homes and who "show a willingness to pay," the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scharf said JPMorgan will also work with homeowners who are current on payments, given that modification programs started once customers have missed payments are "very often too late to help."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the troubled mortgages are in regions where house prices have fallen and unemployment is rising, Scharf said, but the program will be open to all customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are doing this because we think it's the right thing to do," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay, additional reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

academic institution to further develop this new marketing framework,
conduct research and create teaching opportunities to advance this
approach. Beyond this academic initiative, he will collaborate with
like-minded leaders to advance this movement, including work already

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's TOVIAZ(TM) (fesoterodine fumarate) Receives FDA Approval for the Treatment of Overactive Bladder

 New Once-Daily Treatment from Market Leader Shows Significant Efficacy over 24
                                      Hours

  Many People with Incontinence Conditions Suffer without Seeking Medical Help,
                             Recent NIH Report Shows
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc said today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved
TOVIAZ(TM) (fesoterodine fumarate) extended release tablets for the treatment of
overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. New once-daily TOVIAZ can significantly
reduce the number of urge urinary incontinence episodes and the frequency of
urination over 24 hours, symptoms of OAB that can significantly impact patients'
lives. Overactive bladder is a bothersome medical condition that affects an
estimated one in six Americans, yet still remains highly undertreated. TOVIAZ is
currently available in Europe.

Structurally related to the most prescribed OAB medication, Pfizer's Detrol(R)
LA (tolterodine tartrate extended release capsules), TOVIAZ can help regulate
the involuntary contractions of the bladder associated with OAB. These
contractions cause frequent, sudden urges to urinate. The two efficacious and
well-tolerated doses of TOVIAZ, 4 mg and 8 mg, allow dosing flexibility to
optimize treatment based on the individual patient response and tolerability.

"The emotional and social implications for people who suffer from OAB are
challenging, yet the condition remains underdiagnosed and highly undertreated,"
said Nancy Muller, executive director, National Association For Continence. "We
need to encourage people with OAB symptoms to stop simply coping and start
talking to their doctors about finding treatment approaches that work for them.
New treatments, like TOVIAZ, offer healthcare professionals another option to
help their patients."

Symptoms of OAB can have a profound effect on workplace productivity, social and
sexual activity and sleep. Overactive bladder may also lead to other health
problems, such as falls and fractures, urinary tract infections and skin
disorders, sleep problems and depression. Despite the impact of OAB on patients'
lives, research, including a March 2008 National Institutes of Health (NIH)
report, concludes that the embarrassment and stigma associated with incontinence
can cause sufferers to try to hide the condition from families, friends and even
their doctors. As a result, many with incontinence conditions suffer without
seeking help.

"Pfizer is proud to offer TOVIAZ, a new treatment for OAB symptoms that builds
on our strong heritage in urology," said Jim Maffezzoli, senior director, group
leader, Pfizer. "We will continue to partner with physicians and patients to
provide extensive support and education to help enhance treatment success."

Dr. Victor Nitti, professor and vice chairman of urology at the New York
University Langone Medical Center and a principal investigator for TOVIAZ,
added, "The FDA approval of TOVIAZ is good news for patients and treating
physicians. Clinical trials with TOVIAZ showed strong efficacy and favorable
tolerability, and the ability to titrate the dose of TOVIAZ allows physicians
flexibility in treating each patient based on individual history and need."

TOVIAZ Data Demonstrate Efficacy, Safety

The approval of TOVIAZ is based on two large 12-week Phase III clinical studies
of 1,964 OAB patients. In these studies, patients showed up to an 88 percent
median reduction in urge urinary incontinence with TOVIAZ 8 mg versus 50 percent
with placebo. Treatment with TOVIAZ 8 mg reduced the number of urinations per
day by up to 19 percent compared to an 11 percent reduction with placebo
treatment. Reductions in wetting accidents with TOVIAZ were seen as early as
week two of treatment and maintained over 12 weeks.

In clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse event was dry mouth
(incidence of 7 percent for placebo; 19 percent for TOVIAZ 4 mg; 35 percent for
TOVIAZ 8 mg). Most cases of dry mouth were mild to moderate with less than one
percent of patients discontinuing TOVIAZ due to dry mouth. There was a low
incidence of constipation (2 percent with placebo; 4 percent with 4 mg; 6
percent with 8 mg). TOVIAZ was evaluated for up to three years in open-label
studies, with an adverse event profile similar to that seen in previous trials.

TOVIAZ will be available in the United States in the first half of 2009.

Important Safety Information for TOVIAZ and Detrol LA

TOVIAZ and DETROL LA treat the symptoms of overactive bladder (leaks, strong
sudden urges to go, going too often).

If you have certain stomach problems, glaucoma, or trouble getting urine to
pass, you shouldn't take TOVIAZ or DETROL LA.

About Overactive Bladder

Overactive bladder is a treatable medical condition defined by urinary urgency
(a sudden compelling desire to pass urine that is difficult to defer) with or
without urgency urinary incontinence (the involuntary leakage of any amount of
urine, associated with or immediately preceded by urgency), increased daytime
urinary frequency and nocturia.

Overactive bladder affects an estimated one in six Americans; yet it is not
necessarily a natural part of aging as many people assume. Overactive bladder
can impact a wide range of health-related quality of life issues. However, many
people with OAB do not seek medical help due to embarrassment or the belief that
nothing can be done to alleviate their symptoms.

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's TOVIAZ(TM) (fesoterodine fumarate) Receives FDA Approval for the Treatment of Overactive Bladder

     New Once-Daily Treatment from Market Leader Shows Significant
                        Efficacy over 24 Hours

    Many People with Incontinence Conditions Suffer without Seeking
                 Medical Help, Recent NIH Report Shows
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc said today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) approved TOVIAZ(TM) (fesoterodine fumarate) extended release
tablets for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB) symptoms. New
once-daily TOVIAZ can significantly reduce the number of urge urinary
incontinence episodes and the frequency of urination over 24 hours,
symptoms of OAB that can significantly impact patients' lives.
Overactive bladder is a bothersome medical condition that affects an
estimated one in six Americans, yet still remains highly undertreated.
TOVIAZ is currently available in Europe.

   Structurally related to the most prescribed OAB medication,
Pfizer's Detrol(R) LA (tolterodine tartrate extended release
capsules), TOVIAZ can help regulate the involuntary contractions of
the bladder associated with OAB. These contractions cause frequent,
sudden urges to urinate. The two efficacious and well-tolerated doses
of TOVIAZ, 4 mg and 8 mg, allow dosing flexibility to optimize
treatment based on the individual patient response and tolerability.

   "The emotional and social implications for people who suffer from
OAB are challenging, yet the condition remains underdiagnosed and
highly undertreated," said Nancy Muller, executive director, National
Association For Continence. "We need to encourage people with OAB
symptoms to stop simply coping and start talking to their doctors
about finding treatment approaches that work for them. New treatments,
like TOVIAZ, offer healthcare professionals another option to help
their patients."

   Symptoms of OAB can have a profound effect on workplace
productivity, social and sexual activity and sleep. Overactive bladder
may also lead to other health problems, such as falls and fractures,
urinary tract infections and skin disorders, sleep problems and
depression. Despite the impact of OAB on patients' lives, research,
including a March 2008 National Institutes of Health (NIH) report,
concludes that the embarrassment and stigma associated with
incontinence can cause sufferers to try to hide the condition from
families, friends and even their doctors. As a result, many with
incontinence conditions suffer without seeking help.

   "Pfizer is proud to offer TOVIAZ, a new treatment for OAB symptoms
that builds on our strong heritage in urology," said Jim Maffezzoli,
senior director, group leader, Pfizer. "We will continue to partner
with physicians and patients to provide extensive support and
education to help enhance treatment success."

   Dr. Victor Nitti, professor and vice chairman of urology at the
New York University Langone Medical Center and a principal
investigator for TOVIAZ, added, "The FDA approval of TOVIAZ is good
news for patients and treating physicians. Clinical trials with TOVIAZ
showed strong efficacy and favorable tolerability, and the ability to
titrate the dose of TOVIAZ allows physicians flexibility in treating
each patient based on individual history and need."

   TOVIAZ Data Demonstrate Efficacy, Safety

   The approval of TOVIAZ is based on two large 12-week Phase III
clinical studies of 1,964 OAB patients. In these studies, patients
showed up to an 88 percent median reduction in urge urinary
incontinence with TOVIAZ 8 mg versus 50 percent with placebo.
Treatment with TOVIAZ 8 mg reduced the number of urinations per day by
up to 19 percent compared to an 11 percent reduction with placebo
treatment. Reductions in wetting accidents with TOVIAZ were seen as
early as week two of treatment and maintained over 12 weeks.

   In clinical studies, the most commonly reported adverse event was
dry mouth (incidence of 7 percent for placebo; 19 percent for TOVIAZ 4
mg; 35 percent for TOVIAZ 8 mg). Most cases of dry mouth were mild to
moderate with less than one percent of patients discontinuing TOVIAZ
due to dry mouth. There was a low incidence of constipation (2 percent
with placebo; 4 percent with 4 mg; 6 percent with 8 mg). TOVIAZ was
evaluated for up to three years in open-label studies, with an adverse
event profile similar to that seen in previous trials.

   TOVIAZ will be available in the United States in the first half of
2009.

   Important Safety Information for TOVIAZ and Detrol LA

   TOVIAZ and DETROL LA treat the symptoms of overactive bladder
(leaks, strong sudden urges to go, going too often).

   If you have certain stomach problems, glaucoma, or trouble getting
urine to pass, you shouldn't take TOVIAZ or DETROL LA.

   The most common side effects (greater than or equal to 4%) of
TOVIAZ are dry mouth and constipation.

   The most common side effects (greater than or equal to 4%) of
DETROL LA are dry mouth, headache, constipation, and abdominal pain.

There may be other options. Ask your doctor if TOVIAZ or DETROL LA is
right for you. For more information, visit TOVIAZ.com. or

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A rise in credit default swaps on
American International Group (AIG.N) debt indicates the market
may be skeptical about a government program to support the
insurer, JPMorgan said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Over the past month, five-year credit default swaps on AIG
have risen to 44 percent upfront from 29 percent upfront,
retracing much of the rally seen immediately after the
government announced an $85 billion rescue package in
September, JPMorgan said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A 44 percent upfront level means it costs $4.4 million a
year to insure $10 million of AIG's debt for five years, plus
$500,000 in annual premiums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The swaps traded around 53 percent upfront just before the
rescue, JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG was extended an $85 billion bridge loan by the
government on Sept. 16 as margin calls threatened the firm's
solvency. The government extended nearly $38 billion more in
another lending agreement earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "AIG is burdened by the high cost of the government loan
and a difficult market to sell assets necessary to pay down
that loan," JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The large insurance companies that are potential buyers of
AIG's assets are themselves struggling with asset quality
issues," the bank&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UBS also raised concerns about AIG's ability to sell
assets, saying potential buyers are facing capital pressures
due to deterioration in the credit and equity markets. For
details click on [nBNG222254]. UBS cut its price target on
AIG's stock to $1.70 from $5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AIG shares were up 7.4 percent at $1.75 on Thursday near
midday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Dena Aubin; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (dena.aubin@thomsonreuters.com; +1-646-223-6325; Reuters

&lt;p&gt;  COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, Oct 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and The Danish Medicines Agency today announced a DKK
144m (approx $24 million) contract for a business transformation project
to automatically process licensing of new drugs, further strengthening
The Danish Medicines Agency's position in European medicine cooperation.

    The project is called DAHLIA, which refers to the digitization of workflow
processes across the Danish Medicines Agency. In future, when the Agency
licences medicine, the IBM solution will make the licensing process run
smoothly, at the same time making the documentation of each case
accessible to all relevant stake holders through a portal.

    IBM will also enhance and extend digitization across the Danish Medicines
Agency and to pharmacies and the pharmaceutical industry, making it
possible for the Agency to tackle future challenges, improve cooperation
with stakeholders, and remain at the leading edge of technology. Adhering
to common European standards, DAHLIA helps future-proof the Agency's
international and global cooperation with authorities, citizens and
companies while maintaining its position as a key player in European
cooperation on medicines.

    The DAHLIA project uses the IBM FileNet P8 platform with IBM WebSphere
Portal as the user interface. In Denmark, the Agency fulfils the role of
ensuring the availability of effective and safe healthcare products --
medicinal products, medical devices and new therapies -- and promotes the
proper use of these products, and also works to influence the
international development of affordable healthcare products for both
people and animals.

    "The DAHLIA project demonstrates the leadership of the Danish Medicines
Agency and how IBM is helping the Agency to drive business transformation.
The project not only encompasses new IT systems but also uses legacy
systems through Service Oriented Architecture (SOA). The entire project
will be implemented without any interruption of the Agency's operations,"
says Steffen Lerche Nielsen, GBS Healthcare Leader, IBM Nordic.

    The DAHLIA contract was signed in October 2008.

&lt;p&gt;Insurance Marketing and Advertising Conference Upcoming Keynoter Steven Schreibman: Don't Fear YouTube

OLDWICK, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Steven Schreibman, who helped launch Nationwide's "Life Comes at
You Fast" and other high-profile marketing campaigns, urges insurance
marketers to leverage the power of viral marketing in the latest
edition of the Insurance Marketing Podcast, available online as
downloadable audio.

   Schreibman is a keynote speaker at the Insurance Marketing and
Advertising Summit, set for Thursday, November 6, at the Marriott
Marquis in New York City. For information and registration, visit
www.ambest.com/imas.

   In the podcast interview, Schreibman reviews some of Nationwide's
best-known campaigns, many of which have become favorites on YouTube.
They have also inspired many parodies, many of which have also become
online-video favorites. The unpredictability of viral marketing makes
some insurers nervous, but Schreibman has some pointed advice.

   "That is the media world today. Marketers of all stripes need to
get used to it," Schreibman said. "I personally love it. We have
dozens of spoofs that people have made on their own that are up on
YouTube and Ifilm. We have fans of the campaign who transport the ads
from the television or the computer monitor onto some of the
video-sharing Web sites. We get thousands and thousands and literally
millions over millions of additional hits and exposure to our
advertising that way."

   Schreibman joined Nationwide nearly five years ago and formerly
was marketing director for The Limited's Victoria's Secret Stores
division. Some of the attention grabbing work that Schreibman helped
create at Nationwide include spots featuring male model Fabio and
Kevin Federline, former spouse of singer Britney Spears.

   The audio interview with Schreibman is available at
http://feeds.feedburner.com/insurancemarketing, on iTunes and other
popular podcast services.

&lt;p&gt;Digital River CEO to Speak at the Goldman Sachs Software and IT Services Retreat 2008

MINNEAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
Digital River, Inc. (NASDAQ: DRIV), a leading provider of global
e-commerce solutions, announced that it will participate at the
Goldman Sachs Software and IT Services Retreat 2008 in New York, New
York. The event, which is being held at the Goldman Sachs Conference

&lt;p&gt;Largest Brazilian OTC ADR program upgrades to a Level 2 NYSE
                                listing
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan today announced it has been retained by Centrais
Eletricas Brasileiras S.A. (Eletrobras) to be the depositary bank for
the company's American Depositary Receipt (ADR) program listing on the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE). J.P. Morgan had served as the
depositary bank for the Eletrobras OTC ADR program, and has now been
mandated as the depositary for the company's Level 2 NYSE listing.
Eletrobras is the largest electric utilities company in Latin America,
and had been the largest Brazilian OTC ADR program prior to its
current upgrade to a full NYSE listing. The NYSE-listed ADRs will
trade under symbols EBR and EBR.B.

   William Kirst, Depositary Receipts Executive for Latin America at
J.P. Morgan, said: "We have had a long-standing relationship with
Eletrobras and are pleased to continue our relationship with them as
we launch their ADR program on the NYSE. By upgrading their program to
a full NYSE listing, Eletrobras will now have even more visibility to
a larger spectrum of potential investors, while at the same time
showcasing the highest standard of transparency that a NYSE listing
demonstrates."

   J.P. Morgan has been the depositary bank for all of the Latin
American listings on the NYSE in 2008: Eletrobras (Brazil), Ecopetrol
S.A. (Colombia), and Telmex Internacional (Mexico).

   J.P. Morgan launched the first DR in Latin America in 1960
(Telefonos de Mexico) and serves as depositary for a number of
prominent DR programs in Latin America, including Banco Santander -
Chile, Petroleo Brasileiro S.A. and Companhia Vale do Rio Doce. In
2007, the firm launched a global depositary shares (GDS) program for
Grupo Clarin S.A., the first Argentine company to have a DR listing on
the London Stock Exchange. That year it also launched a global
depositary receipt (GDR) program for Almacenes Exito S.A., the first
primary offering of equity securities by a Colombian company outside
of the home market in over 10 years.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and HONOLULU, HI, Oct 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today that PHASE 2 International, a leading
Software as a Service (SaaS) provider, selected IBM technology to enable
the company to support more clients while lowering energy use by over 65
percent.

    Fast growing, Honolulu-based PHASE 2 works with an expanding base of
mainly small and medium-sized business clients, simplifying their IT
operations by providing access to high-end business software applications
through the convenient SaaS model. The company offers clients a broad
range of cloud services -- from e-mail and customer relationship
management to Web conferencing and document management -- all delivered
across the Internet.

    After more than doubling its business in the first half of 2008, PHASE 2
quickly found that its Dell blade server-based data center was nearing its
capacity and potentially inhibiting the company's ability to continue to
grow and support new clients. To address those and other potential data
center limitations, PHASE 2 selected the IBM System x3850 M2 to replace
its Dell servers, increasing PHASE 2's ability to serve new clients.

    "At the end of the day, PHASE 2 is selling service. The ability of our
technology to scale along with the needs of our clients and provide them a
good experience is directly tied to our success," said Kevin Doherty, CEO
of PHASE 2 International. "We're confident that our new IBM System x
servers will grow along with our business, helping us to deliver
unbeatable service and support to our clients."

    Thanks to the energy efficient design of the System x3850 M2, PHASE 2 also
expects to lower its energy use by more than 65 percent while increasing
the amount of capacity available to support its clients in the same amount
of space.

    PHASE 2 plans to join the SaaS Enablement Network of infrastructure
providers that use IBM server technology to help ISVs deliver
interoperable SaaS solutions, which allow disparate applications to work
together.

    "IBM sees SaaS as part of a larger cloud services opportunity. As part of
its strategy to capture this cloud computing opportunity, IBM is helping
ISVs design, build, deliver and market cloud services," said Dave
Mitchell, director of strategy, IBM Developer Relations. "Working with
clients like PHASE 2, IBM is helping to accelerate the shift from
traditional on-premise-only computing to cloud computing."

    PHASE 2 will run VMware on the System x3850 M2 as well as IBM System
Storage N series. This highly reliable solution will allow PHASE 2 to
ensure its clients have access to their business applications whenever and
wherever they need them.

    PHASE 2 believes its technology backbone sets it apart from other SaaS
providers -- many of which use third party servers -- providing PHASE 2 a
competitive advantage that allows it to confidently issue claims of
reliability and security to clients.

    Based on X-Architecture, IBM's design blueprint for Intel-based servers,
the System x3850 M2 is built with special features for fast performance
and efficiency, allowing clients to support a large number of demanding
business applications on a single server. The system offers flexible
scalability that allows clients to easily expand their system from four
sockets to 16, so clients can pay for more capacity only when they need it
-- not up front as with other vendors.

    IBM is the market leader in the Intel 4-socket segment by factory revenue,
according to IDC (1).

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and HONOLULU, HI, Oct 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Punahou School in Honolulu, Hawai'i have undertaken
an aggressive energy reduction effort intended to cut Punahou's
data-center power consumption in half by 2016. In order to accomplish
this goal, Punahou has replaced its legacy servers with high-performance,
low-power System x servers from IBM, running VMWare virtualization
software.

    Punahou School, a private school for grades K-12 in Hawai'i, has many
notable graduates, including U.S. Presidential nominee Barack Obama and
America Online co-founder Steve Case. In May 2008, the school's athletic
program was named No. 1 in the nation by Sports Illustrated magazine. [1]

    Punahou School has recently undertaken an initiative to reduce overall
campus energy consumption 25 percent by 2010 and 50 percent by 2016.
Working with IBM and IBM Business Partner, Commercial Data Systems (CDS),
Hawai'i's leading IT Consultants, Punahou has implemented a new data
center solution, centering around IBM System x3850 M2 servers running
VMware virtualization software. This new solution will provide the
performance, space consolidation and -- most importantly -- the energy
reduction the school needs to meet its projected goals. CDS will be
providing Punahou School's team with the necessary training to run the
IBM systems and achieve their power and efficiency goals.

    "Our effort to reduce energy on campus not only impacts the bottom line,
but also sets an environmentally sound example for our students," said
Wendi Kamiya, Punahou School CIO. "We will also be positioned to grow our
data in the future while continuing to conserve our energy use."

    The high performance and low power consumption of the IBM System x servers
will enable Punahou to consolidate all of its physical servers onto three
x3850 M2s while maintaining availability and data protection. The IBM
solution will run all of Punahou's information systems -- everything from
email applications to the school's student data system and external Web
site. It will also be the information hub for the school's information
needs, serving accounts payable as well as bus scheduling, student
grading, and school healthcare information.

    Based on X-Architecture, IBM's design blueprint for Intel-based servers,
the System x3850 M2 is built with special features for fast performance
and efficiency, allowing clients to support a large number of demanding
business applications such as those for ERP and database on a single
server. The system offers flexible scalability that allows clients to
easily expand their system from 4 to 16 sockets, so clients can pay for
more capacity only when they need it -- not upfront as with other vendors.
IBM is the market leader in the Intel 4-socket segment by factory revenue,
according to IDC. [2]

    "Working with IBM, we were able to offer Punahou School a fully integrated
solution that met their energy saving and efficiency needs," said Mark
Gilbert, President of IBM Business Partner, CDS. "We feel confident that
Punahou is in good hands today and in the future by partnering with CDS
and
IBM."

   "Earnings for our upstream operations benefited from prices for
crude oil that were significantly higher than in last year's third
quarter," said Chairman and CEO Dave O'Reilly. "This improvement in
earnings was tempered, however, by effects of the September hurricanes
in the Gulf of Mexico."

   O'Reilly said facilities shut in due to the hurricanes caused a
decline of approximately 150,000 barrels of oil-equivalent production
per day in September. In addition, hurricane-related expenses in the
third quarter reduced upstream income by about $400 million. This
expense impact was nearly offset, however, by gains on upstream asset
sales in the period.

   "Earnings for our downstream operations also increased from a year
ago, due mainly to improved margins on the sale of refined products,"
O'Reilly added. "Margins were weak in last year's third quarter, and
our downstream business in the United States operated at a loss for
that period."

   The company reported capital and exploratory expenditures of $5.5
billion for the 2008 third quarter, compared with $5.2 billion a year
earlier. Common stock buybacks in the 2008 quarter totaled $2 billion.

   Looking ahead, O'Reilly commented, "Our disciplined capital
spending and tight control over costs remain extremely important in
today's uncertain economic climate. Our strong balance sheet enables
Chevron to continue investing in attractive projects that increase the
production of oil and gas and improve the efficiency of our refinery
network."

   In additional comments on the upstream business, O'Reilly cited
recent milestones and achievements in a number of areas of operations
that included:

   --  Kazakhstan - Completed the second phase of a major expansion
        of production operations and processing facilities at the 50
        percent-owned Tengizchevroil affiliate, increasing total
        crude-oil production capacity from 400,000 barrels per day to
        540,000.

   --  Nigeria - Started production offshore at the 68 percent-owned
        and operated Agbami Field, with total oil production currently
        averaging about 100,000 barrels per day and expected to
        achieve a total maximum of 250,000 barrels per day by the end
        of 2009.

   --  Middle East - Signed an agreement with the Kingdom of Saudi
        Arabia to extend to 2039 the company's operation of the
        Kingdom's 50 percent interest in oil and gas resources of the
        onshore area of the Partitioned Neutral Zone between the
        Kingdom and the State of Kuwait.

   --  Australia - Started production from Train 5 of the
        one-sixth-owned North West Shelf Venture onshore
        liquefied-natural-gas facility in West Australia, increasing
        export capacity by up to 4.4 million metric tons annually to
        16.3 million.

   --  Canada - Finalized agreements with the government of
        Newfoundland and Labrador to develop the 27 percent-owned
        Hebron heavy-oil project off the eastern coast.

   As part of the downstream strategy to focus on areas of market
strength, O'Reilly said the company recently announced plans to sell
marketing-related businesses in Brazil, Nigeria, Benin, Cameroon,
Republic of the Congo, Cote d'Ivoire and Togo.

   UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

   Worldwide oil-equivalent production averaged 2.44 million barrels
per day in the third quarter 2008, compared with 2.59 million barrels
per day in the corresponding 2007 period. The decline was associated
with the impact of higher prices on volumes recoverable under certain
production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts outside the United
States, as well as production that was shut in during September 2008
because of the hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.

   U.S. upstream income of $2.2 billion in the third quarter 2008
increased about $1 billion from the year-ago period, driven by higher
prices for crude oil and natural gas. The benefit of higher prices was
partially offset by the impact of lower oil-equivalent production,
mainly the result of production in the Gulf of Mexico that was shut in
during September because of hurricanes Gustav and Ike.

   The 2008 quarter also included approximately $400 million of
expenses associated with damage to facilities in the Gulf of Mexico
caused by the hurricanes. Largely offsetting these expenses were gains
of about $350 million on asset sales.

   The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas
liquids was $107 in the third quarter 2008, up from $67 in the
corresponding 2007 period. The average sales price per thousand cubic
feet of natural gas increased $3.21 between quarters to $8.64.

   Net oil-equivalent production was 647,000 barrels per day in the
2008 third quarter, down about 13 percent from a year earlier. More
than half the decline was due to the hurricanes. The net liquids
component of production was down 11 percent at 409,000 barrels per
day, and net natural-gas production declined 16 percent to 1.4 billion
cubic feet per day.

   At the beginning of October, approximately 120,000 barrels per day
of oil-equivalent production in the Gulf of Mexico, or about
two-thirds of the average daily oil-equivalent production prior to the
hurricanes, remained offline. About half, or 90,000 barrels per day,
remains shut-in at the end of October. The company estimates 90
percent of the production will be restored by the fourth quarter of
2009. Less than 10,000 barrels per day are expected to be permanently
shut-in.

   International upstream earnings of $4 billion in the third quarter
2008 increased $1.7 billion from the year-ago period due primarily to
higher prices for crude oil and natural gas. Partially offsetting the
benefit of higher prices were a reduction in crude-oil sales volumes
due to timing of certain cargo liftings and higher operating expenses.
Foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $316 million in the
2008 quarter, compared with a $99 million reduction to earnings a year
earlier.

   The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas
liquids was $103 in the 2008 quarter, up from $67 a year earlier. The
average sales price per thousand cubic feet of natural gas increased
$1.59 between periods to $5.37.

   Net oil-equivalent production of 1.8 million barrels per day in
the 2008 third quarter was about 3 percent lower than the year-ago
quarter. Absent the impact of higher prices on cost-recovery and
variable royalty volumes, oil-equivalent production increased about 2
percent between periods. The net liquids component of production
declined about 8 percent from a year ago to 1.2 million barrels per
day, while natural-gas production increased 10 percent to 3.6 billion
cubic feet per day.

   U.S. downstream earned $1 billion in the third quarter 2008,
compared with a loss of $110 million a year earlier. The recovery in
earnings was mainly the result of significantly higher margins on the
sale of refined products and improved refinery operations.

   Refinery crude-input of 922,000 barrels per day in the third
quarter 2008 was 123,000 higher than the corresponding 2007 period.
The increase was primarily due to significantly less planned and
unplanned downtime in this year's third quarter.

   Refined-product sales volumes declined 2 percent from the third
quarter of 2007 to 1.4 million barrels per day on lower gasoline and
fuel-oil sales. Branded gasoline sales volumes were down 7 percent
between quarters to 601,000 barrels per day.

   International downstream income of $817 million increased $330
million from the 2007 quarter. Margins on the sale of refined products
were higher in most areas. Last year's third quarter included a $265
million gain on asset sales in Europe. Foreign currency effects
benefited earnings by $63 million in the 2008 quarter, compared with
$5 million a year earlier.

   Refinery crude-input was 976,000 barrels per day, about 6 percent
lower than the third quarter of 2007 due mainly to an increase in
planned and unplanned downtime at various affiliate refineries.

   Refined-product sales volumes of 2 million barrels per day in the
2008 third quarter declined 1 percent from a year earlier on lower
sales of gas oil and kerosene and the impact of 2007 asset sales in
Europe.

2008, compared with $103 million in the year-ago period. Earnings of
the 50 percent-owned Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem)
and Chevron's Oronite subsidiary were both lower between periods.
CPChem earnings declined on lower sales volumes of commodity chemicals
and higher operating expenses. For the Oronite subsidiary, margins on
sales of lubricant additives and fuel additives were lower between
periods.

Securities downgraded communications cable maker CommScope Inc

&lt;p&gt; "Operating margins appear to be much less resilient than we
expected, based on new guidance for Q4 operating margins of
about 10 percent versus our recently-reduced estimate of 13.3
percent," the brokerage wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said while CommScope continues to be a strong

&lt;p&gt;Oct 31 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities removed
KLA-Tencor Corp (KLAC.O) from its U.S. equities focus list and
cut its price target on the stock, a day after the
microchip-equipment maker's first-quarter profit fell short of

stock to $28 from $51, citing the company's weak order and

second-quarter adjusted earnings per share at breakeven, plus

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats Oct. 30 story with no changes to headline or text)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds byline, details from interview, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Oct 30 (Reuters) - Andy Mooney, chairman of
Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) Consumer Products division, said on
Thursday he expects the company's market share to grow despite
a challenging holiday season for retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm actually pretty optimistic about the holiday season in
the sense that... parents are going to buy toys for their kids
come this holiday," Mooney told Reuters in an interview. "In
terms of the things they're likely to give up, I would expect
us to be pretty far down the list."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his nine year tenure Mooney has grown a global licensing
business to $30 billion of retail sales in 2008 by nurturing
brands such as Disney Princess and cross promoting properties
from the company's other divisions, like the Pixar film "Cars"
and Disney Channel's "High School Musical." Disney generally
earns a 10 percent royalty on those sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mooney said the industry and retail sales "will certainly
be challenged for this season and the rest of 2009 and I'm
pretty confident Disney will gain share" as consumers turn to
"value brands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By that I don't just mean lower price -- I mean what am I
getting from the Walt Disney Co relative to other competitors
that are out there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Because Disney earns a royalty on products it licenses and
is paid when orders are delivered to retailers, Mooney said the
company had good visibility through the holiday season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since retailers, wholesalers and licensees had already
committed to holiday products before the financial markets
became shaky, rather than canceling or adjusting those orders,
most are "just keeping their fingers and toes crossed as we go
through the season," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I really don't think people are going to adjust (orders)
until they come out the back end of the holiday season and into
the spring," Mooney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mooney did not anticipate "a large scale shift" in orders
unless there was "a dramatic slowdown throughout the holiday
season in terms of consumer purchasing, which would then back
up inventory going into the spring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But it's too early in the season to figure out what the
consumer is going to do exactly," Mooney said. "Everybody is
expecting them to be very selective and very price conscious
but it's unclear to what degree."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Oct 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM), the world leader in UNIX(R) revenue share (1), today
announced several enhancements to its IBM Power Rewards migration
program, including a 4X increase in reward points for customers moving
workloads from Sun SPARC, UltraSPARC or SPARC64 processor-based servers,
from either Sun or Fujitsu, to IBM Power Systems(TM).

    The IBM Power Rewards (2) program, similar to a frequent flyer incentive,
offers reward points to competitively-installed customers, based on the
number of HP, Sun or other cores retired when moving to Power Systems.
Customers can redeem points toward no-charge migration services to move
from HP-UX or Sun Solaris to AIX or Linux operating environments.

    As part of the Power Rewards enhancements announced today, IBM has
increased the value per core for Sun or Fujitsu servers based on SPARC,
UltraSPARC, or SPARC64 processors from 1,000 points to 4,000 points per
core, making each core of a SPARC processor redeemable for up to $4,000
worth of no-charge IBM migration services. Sun recently announced
end-of-life for all SPARC-IV products.

    With Power Rewards, customers can turn in multiple servers -- all with
multiple cores -- to build up considerable free migration points. As an
example, a customer who moves the workload from one Sun V890 server could
earn up to 64,000 points, worth up to $64,000, and a customer who replaces
a 256-core Sun M9000 server could earn up to 1,024,000 points, worth more
than $1 million in free services.

    Customers Migrate to IBM

    "IBM is already the world leader in UNIX servers and we see tremendous
opportunity through competitive migrations to gain share," said Scott
Handy, vice president of worldwide marketing and business strategy, IBM
Power Systems. "We see more opportunity to move clients to IBM systems
based on the strength of our products, It's no surprise that over the last
few years, nearly 1,200 customers have already chosen to migrate to IBM
from HP, Sun, and other competitive systems, including more than 500 from
Sun alone."

    Sun customers are not the only ones who can benefit from Power Rewards.
IBM is also giving HP PA-RISC-based Superdome customers a highly
attractive alternative to HP's long-delayed Itanium roadmap. IBM is
offering quadruple the Power Rewards points for PA-RISC-based system
migrations -- or 4,000 per core -- to help those customers easily justify
the migration to IBM. IBM also offers 1,000 points per core for HP Alpha
and Itanium technology-based systems, and SGI MIPS migrations.

    A wide range of additional discounts on hardware, software or services are
available and a reward points table is published for accumulating and
redeeming Power Rewards.

    IBM Global Technology Services offers a full complement of asset-based,
standardized services for Power Systems, ranging from implementation to
availability, virtualization and support, along with energy efficiency and
security assessments, which allow clients to maximize their investment in
IBM Power servers and software.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corp filed court documents on
Thursday challenging bankrupt Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK
on whether it has a claim to billions of dollars worth of tax
benefits stemming from its collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The FDIC said it disagrees that all of those tax benefits
belong to WaMu's holding company, which filed for bankruptcy
protection last month after its bank was seized by the FDIC and
sold to JPMorgan for $1.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, WaMu filed court documents seeking to
limit trading in its common stock to protect tax breaks the
company could receive due to losses it incurred throughout
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the court documents, WaMu said it estimated it has
incurred "consolidated net operating tax loss carryforwards" or
unrecognized losses in excess of $20 billion. It said the
losses could become "valuable assets" for the bankrupt company
because the U.S. tax code generally allows companies to carry
over their losses and tax credits to offset future income,
thereby lowering the amount of taxes owed to the government .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The total tax benefit the company would get from those
losses would be a percentage of that $20 billion in losses,
based on its tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDIC argued in court documents Thursday that the net
operating loss carryforwards should belong to the entity that
actually incurred the loss, and said the agency may fight for
any rights it has to those benefits in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said in its filing that it wanted assurances that
any court orders on this matter would not affect tax benefits
that should be allocated to the bank it acquired from WaMu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Emily Chasan and Chelsea Emery; editing by

&lt;p&gt;Oct 31 (Reuters) -  International Business Machines Corp
(IBM.N) sued a top executive on Thursday to prevent him from
joining Apple Inc (AAPL.O), court documents showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; IBM said Mark Papermaster, who was vice president of the
company's Blade Development unit until last week, signed a
noncompete agreement with IBM that would prevent him from
accepting a job with a competitor until one year after leaving
the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the suit filed at the United States District Court in
Manhattan, IBM said Papermaster was one of its top 300 managers
and had access to a wide range of the company's intellectual
property and trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papermaster, who was with IBM for the past 26 years, served
as a member of the company's Integration  Values Team since
2006.
 "In his capacity as a member of the IVT, Mr. Papermaster has
gained access to confidential information concerning the
company's strategic plans, marketing plans and long term
business opportunities, including the development of specific
IBM products," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Papermaster and Apple could not be immediately reached for
comment by Reuters.
