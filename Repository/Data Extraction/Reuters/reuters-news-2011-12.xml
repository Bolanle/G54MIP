&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three leading senators are inquiring into drugmaker Pfizer Inc's efforts to limit the sale of generic versions of its Lipitor cholesterol drug, which lost U.S. patent protection this week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Their concern was prompted by a newspaper report earlier this month that Pfizer had struck deals with leading insurers and pharmacy benefits managers, who negotiate prices on behalf of companies and insurers, to offer discounts on Lipitor if they block prescriptions for its generic versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it is providing Lipitor at prices equivalent to or less than generic versions as it tries to hold onto sales of its best-selling drug. The company denies it put any conditions on benefits managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers from three Senate oversight committees said the arrangements could lead to limited access to generic drugs and push up healthcare costs for patients and U.S. government insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without the prospect of true competition, generic drug manufacturers will be hesitant to invest the time and resources required to bring low-cost generic drugs to the market," they wrote in letters to Pfizer, Medco Health Solutions Inc, Express Scripts Inc, Catalyst Health Solutions Inc, Coventry Health Care Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Democrat; Senate Aging Committee Chairman Herb Kohl, a Democrat and Senate Judiciary ranking Republican Charles Grassley, wield considerable influence over issues involving healthcare and industry competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-cost generic drugs are a key lever for controlling healthcare costs, which in recent years have eclipsed the pace of U.S. economic growth, inflation and household income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned that the (benefits management companies) may charge health plan sponsors, including employers and Medicare Part D, full price for brand name Lipitor from December 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012, while pocketing the discount from Pfizer," the senators said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senators' request followed a November 11 New York Times article that said Pfizer had reached deals to prevent Lipitor customers from having access to generics for the next six months, before additional competitors come onto the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our intent is to offer Lipitor to payors and patients at or below the cost of a generic" in the next six months, Pfizer said in response on Thursday. "As a result, patients receive Lipitor at co-pays comparable to generics. Participation in Pfizer's programs by a health plan is entirely voluntary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESPONSE DEADLINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senators' letter gives the companies until December 21 to provide details of their agreements from wholesale costs to manufacturer discounts, consumer co-payments and the number of people affected, as well as presentations made to corporate officers including board directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medco said it would cooperate with the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look forward to sharing our approach on how Medco's Lipitor strategy will save our clients and members upwards of $1 billion over the next year alone," spokeswoman Ann Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Express Scripts said in an e-mail response to Reuters that it does recommend generic substitution for Lipitor when patients fill the subscription at retail pharmacies, but the final decision rests with the client, such as employers, whose benefits it manages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Express said that, so far, just one of 2,100 clients had chosen to block filling retail prescriptions with generic Lipitor. The company said mail order prescriptions would be offered for the same co-pay as a generic, but use the Pfizer brand version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipitor became one of the biggest-selling drugs after its introduction in 1997. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved late on Wednesday the sale of a generic version made by Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. Pfizer is also selling a so-called "authorized generic" version of the drug, known chemically as atorvastatin, in partnership with Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares closed nearly unchanged on Thursday.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The trustee seeking money for Bernard Madoff's victims won the right to immediately appeal a ruling that took away more than $19 billion of his claims against JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Madoff's main bank for two decades.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan last month took away all but $425 million of trustee Irving Picard's $19.9 billion lawsuit against the largest U.S. bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McMahon found that Picard, as trustee for the estate of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, lacked power to bring a variety of claims against the bank for harm caused to former Madoff customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the judge said, those claims belonged to the customers themselves.

&lt;p&gt;* More than $19 billion in claims dropped out&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 1 (Reuters) - The trustee seeking money for Bernard
Madoff's victims won the right to immediately appeal a ruling that
took away more than $19 billion of his claims against JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Co , Madoff's main bank for two decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Colleen McMahon in Manhattan last month

&lt;p&gt;* Chevron comes under greater regulatory oversight&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Chevron did not report sulfur from well - ANP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Frade field has 10 producing wells&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Sabrina Lorenzi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Brazil's government
ordered Chevron Corp to shut a well in an offshore
field where it faces intense scrutiny following an accident at
another well that spilled thousands of barrels of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move by the ANP oil regulator on Thursday followed a
safety audit last week at the Frade field, Chevron said, adding
that the closed well accounts for less than 10 percent of the
field's 79,000 barrels per day in production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANP director Magda Chambriard said the agency ordered the
second-largest U.S. oil company to shut it down because of a
failure to report the presence of sulfur from the well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The burning of fuels made from oil and natural gas
containing sulfur can create dangerous gases such as sulfur
dioxide which can harm humans and the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ANP does not ban the production of sulfur but requires
firms to have a prevention plan and to inform authorities of
what is done with the material, Chambriard said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Companies have to report the risks they are facing and
show that they are being controlled and minimized," she told a
news conference in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month's accident at another Frade well, which spilled
about 2,400 barrels of oil into the ocean, led to a $28 million
fine for Chevron - a figure that could at least triple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's local chief executive was hauled in front of
Congress and then the company had its Brazilian drilling rights
suspended as punishment for the undersea leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chambriard said Chevron would receive another fine for the
sulfur offense, but did not specify the amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said four wells in which it injects produced
water from the drilling process were also ordered shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chevron is confident it will successfully respond to the
ANP's concerns and be able to resume operation of its
production and injection wells in due time," the company said
in a statement late on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for last month's accident, Chevron took full
responsibility and capped and abandoned the evaluative well
that ruptured.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That spill is likely to increase politicization of the
governance of the country's oil sector, which has already
shifted to a more state-centered approach since the discovery
of huge reserves off the Rio coast in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has led to concern that Chevron may be excluded from
future offshore opportunities and has already given ammunition
to Rio state lawmakers fighting proposals to share more oil
wealth with non-producing states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nicaragua-sized "subsalt" area, which includes the
Frade concession, may hold 100 billion barrels of oil or more,
according to a study from the National Oil and Gas Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's government sees the fields as a ticket to
developed status that could make it the world's third or fourth
biggest oil producer by 2020, but it faces huge technological
and financial challenges to tap the ultra-deep reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns 52 percent of Frade, while state-run Brazilian
oil company Petrobras owns 30 percent and Frade
Japao the rest. Frade has 10 production wells, including the
one ordered closed, and produces 4 percent of Brazil's output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* David Owen to be consumer unit CFO at JPMorgan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* Latest high-profile departure from BofA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Rick Rothacker&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 1 (Reuters) - Bank of America Corp's head of
online banking is leaving to become chief financial officer of
rival JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co's consumer banking unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Owen starts on Monday, a JPMorgan spokesman said on
Thursday. He replaces John Samenuk, who takes a key role on the
bank's customer experience team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owen, with Bank of America since 2003, was its online,
mobile, fraud and claims executive, responsible for a website
with 30 million active users. After a reorganization announced
in October, he reported to Katy Knox, head of retail banking
and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He becomes the latest high-profile departure at the
nation's second biggest bank, which shook up its leadership in
recent months as part of a massive cost-cutting campaign. In
October, Bank of America strategy executive Mike Lyons left to
lead corporate and institutional banking at PNC Financial
Services Group Inc .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America's online banking website gained attention
recently when customers had trouble logging on and faced other
problems over a six-day period. The bank initially provided
little explanation for the issues, but later Owen said an
ongoing upgrade and heavy traffic were behind the problem,
easing concerns about possible hacking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owen was also involved in a joint venture announced in May
called clearXchange that will allow bank customers to move
money from their checking accounts to other people using a
mobile number or email address. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo are Bank of America's partners on the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America has not named a replacement for Owen.&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron&#8217;s Brazil Unit Says Regulator ANP Shut in One Production Well
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Company Says It Will Address All ANP Concerns at Campo Frade
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Brasil Upstream Frade Ltda announced today it has been ordered 
      by Brazil&#8217;s National Petroleum Agency (ANP) to shut in one of its 11 
      production wells and four produced water injection wells at its 
      off-shore Frade joint-venture Floating Production-Storage and Offloading 
      (FPSO) facility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The move by the ANP follows the agency&#8217;s Nov. 23 to 25 safety audit of 
      the Frade FPSO, the company said. The production well cited by the ANP 
      accounts for less than 10 percent of Frade&#8217;s total production of about 
      79,000 barrels per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron respects the decisions of the ANP and will respond appropriately 
      to the agency&#8217;s requests for clarification. All Frade production and 
      injection wells are safe and secure. Chevron continues to fully inform 
      and work with Brazilian government agencies to address their specific 
      issues on our activities in Brazil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With regard to the reported existence of hydrogen sulfide gas as the 
      basis for requesting the well be shut in, Chevron clarifies that it 
      conducts regular monitoring of the substance, a natural byproduct of the 
      oil and gas production process, and the company has safety systems and 
      processes in place to ensure the safety of employees, contractors and 
      the operations at all times.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is confident it will successfully respond to the ANP&#8217;s concerns 
      and be able to resume operation of its production and injection wells in 
      due time.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Three leading U.S. senators are inquiring into drugmaker Pfizer Inc's efforts to limit the sale of generic versions of its Lipitor cholesterol drug, which lost U.S. patent protection on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has made arrangements with some insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, which negotiate prices on behalf of companies and insurers, to provide Lipitor at prices equivalent to or less than those of the generic versions of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under those arrangements, drug stores would fill prescriptions with Lipitor instead of the generic alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our intent is to offer Lipitor to payors and patients at or below the cost of a generic" in the next six months, Pfizer said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, patients receive Lipitor at co-pays comparable to generics. Participation in Pfizer's programs by a health plan is entirely voluntary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers from three Senate oversight committees said the arrangements could lead to limited access to generic drugs and push up healthcare costs for patients and U.S. government insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without the prospect of true competition, generic drug manufacturers will be hesitant to invest the time and resources required to bring low-cost generic drugs to the market," they wrote in letters to Pfizer, Medco Health Solutions Inc, Express Scripts Inc, Catalyst Health Solutions Inc, Coventry Health Care Inc and UnitedHealth Group Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, a Democrat; Senate Aging Committee Chairman Herb Kohl, a Democrat and Senate Judiciary ranking Republican Charles Grassley, wield considerable influence over issues involving healthcare and industry competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-cost generic drugs are a key lever for controlling healthcare costs, which in recent years have eclipsed the pace of U.S. economic growth, inflation and household income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senators' request followed a November 11 New York Times article that said Pfizer had reached deals to prevent Lipitor customers from having access to generics for the next six months, before additional competitors come onto the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned that the (benefits management companies) may charge health plan sponsors, including employers and Medicare Part D, full price for brand name Lipitor from December 1, 2011 through May 31, 2012, while pocketing the discount from Pfizer," the senators said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESPONSE DEADLINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter gives the companies until December 21 to provide details of their agreements from wholesale costs to manufacturer discounts, consumer co-payments and the number of people affected, as well as presentations made to corporate officers including board directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medco said it would cooperate with the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look forward to sharing our approach on how Medco's Lipitor strategy will save our clients and members upwards of $1 billion over the next year alone," spokeswoman Ann Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Express Scripts said in an e-mail response to Reuters that it does recommend generic substitution for Lipitor when patients fill the subscription at retail pharmacies, but the final decision rests with the client, such as employers, whose benefits it manages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Express said that, so far, just one of 2,100 clients had chosen to block filling retail prescriptions with generic Lipitor. The company said mail order prescriptions would be offered for the same co-pay as a generic, but use the Pfizer brand version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipitor became one of the biggest-selling drugs after its introduction in 1997. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved late on Wednesday the sale of a generic version made by Indian drugmaker Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. Pfizer is also selling a so-called "authorized generic" version of the drug, known chemically as atorvastatin, in partnership with Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were nearly unchanged on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Ransdell Pierson in New York; editing by Michele Gershberg, Tim Dobbyn and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Give Dec. 21 deadline for details on arrangements&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Senators say deals could push up health costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Morgan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Three leading U.S.
senators are inquiring into drugmaker Pfizer Inc's 
efforts to limit the sale of generic versions of its Lipitor
cholesterol drug, which lost U.S. patent protection this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their concern was prompted by a newspaper report earlier
this month that Pfizer had struck deals with leading insurers
and pharmacy benefits managers, who negotiate prices on behalf
of companies and insurers, to offer discounts on Lipitor if
they block prescriptions for its generic versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it is providing Lipitor at prices equivalent to
or less than generic versions as it tries to hold onto sales of
its best-selling drug. The company denies it put any conditions
on benefits managers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers from three Senate oversight committees said the
arrangements could lead to limited access to generic drugs and
push up healthcare costs for patients and U.S. government
insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without the prospect of true competition, generic drug
manufacturers will be hesitant to invest the time and resources
required to bring low-cost generic drugs to the market," they
wrote in letters to Pfizer, Medco Health Solutions Inc , Express Scripts Inc , Catalyst Health
Solutions Inc , Coventry Health Care Inc and
UnitedHealth Group Inc .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max
Baucus, a Democrat; Senate Aging Committee Chairman Herb Kohl,
a Democrat and Senate Judiciary ranking Republican Charles
Grassley, wield considerable influence over issues involving
healthcare and industry competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-cost generic drugs are a key lever for controlling
healthcare costs, which in recent years have eclipsed the pace
of U.S. economic growth, inflation and household income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned that the (benefits management companies)
may charge health plan sponsors, including employers and
Medicare Part D, full price for brand name Lipitor from Dec. 1,
2011 through May 31, 2012, while pocketing the discount from
Pfizer," the senators said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senators' request followed a Nov. 11 New York Times
article that said Pfizer had reached deals to prevent Lipitor
customers from having access to generics for the next six
months, before additional competitors come onto the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our intent is to offer Lipitor to payors and patients at
or below the cost of a generic" in the next six months, Pfizer
said in response on Thursday. "As a result, patients receive
Lipitor at co-pays comparable to generics. Participation in
Pfizer's programs by a health plan is entirely voluntary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RESPONSE DEADLINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senators' letter gives the companies until Dec. 21 to
provide details of their agreements from wholesale costs to
manufacturer discounts, consumer co-payments and the number of
people affected, as well as presentations made to corporate
officers including board directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medco said it would cooperate with the inquiry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We look forward to sharing our approach on how Medco's
Lipitor strategy will save our clients and members upwards of
$1 billion over the next year alone," spokeswoman Ann Smith
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Express Scripts said in an e-mail response to Reuters that
it does recommend generic substitution for Lipitor when
patients fill the subscription at retail pharmacies, but
the final decision rests with the client, such as employers,
whose benefits it manages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Express said that, so far, just one of 2,100 clients had

Lipitor. The company said mail order prescriptions would be

&lt;p&gt;* Goldman Sachs recommends long Q4 NBP 2012 position&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Other banks, utilities expect weaker gas prices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* NBP Summer 2012 gas has fallen 16 pct since August&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Henning Gloystein and Oleg Vukmanovic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is
increasingly lonely in a prediction of rising European gas
prices next year, with other banks, analysts and utilities
forecasting a glut of gas supplies in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. investment bank said in a research note on Thursday
that it continued to recommend a long position in UK gas prices
for delivery in the fourth quarter of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The outlook comes despite sharp drops in gas prices since
last summer, with the benchmark NBP summer 2012 contract down
over 16 percent since the end of August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the UK NBP forward curve has been under pressure
as a result of weak demand on the back of mild weather and
slowing economic activity in Europe," Goldman Sachs gas analyst
Samantha Dart told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Going forward, we assume a return to normal weather as well
as a modest recovery in economic activity relative to this
winter. As a result, we expect UK NBP price levels to rise
relative to the current forward market in 2H 2012."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SWIMMING AGAINST THE TIDE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's views contrast with from those of other traders
and banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also in a research note on Thursday, French bank Societe
Generale said it expected European gas prices to fall in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Gas demand is not likely to reach pre-crisis 2008 levels
before 2015. But with the deepening of the euro crisis, we might
be too optimistic," SocGen analyst Thierry Bros said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We therefore reiterate our recommendation to sell NBP
summer 12 as we believe that increased Libyan exports into Italy
will mean ENI has to tackle additional Russian take-or-pay
obligations in 2012 and will force the market to admit that the
gas oversupply situation is likely to persist in 2012."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UK investment bank Barclays Capital said in a note in
November that "it will take a mighty winter to put the gas
market on a bullish path," and that "a warm winter puts the
market on a decidedly bearish trajectory."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BarCap said that "even a winter that is 10 percent colder
than normal would only push inventory levels down to last year's
end-of-March number, which was not very supportive for prices
even though last winter was quite cold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NBP gas inventories are filled to over 96 percent, according
to the latest data from Gas Infrastructure Europe, and if
inventory levels remain well supplied at the end of the heating
season next March, a mild winter would keep bearish pressure on
the NBP market much further into 2012, traders said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Weather forecasters are revising their European outlook for
the winter season and expect milder-than-average weather instead
of the initially forecast colder-than-normal season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German competitor Deutsche Bank said in late November that
it expected European gas demand to drop in late 2011, and that
"this trend could extend into 2012, with consequences for the
spot-to-contract discount and oil-indexed pricing arrangements."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche's Mark Lewis said the bank was revising its gas
price forecast for 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major European utility also said it disagreed with
Goldman's view of a bullish gas market next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The final quarter this year is one of the warmest on
record, and the one last year was among the coldest ever...so it
is reasonable to assume that, based on those outliers, next
winter will still see high demand," a source the utility said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But that isn't our view," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent Reuters analysis found that the European Union's
gas market could be around oversupplied by around 60 billion
cubic metres (bcm) in 2011 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This compares with a net positive balance of just over 10.5
bcm in 2010, according to BP's annual statistical review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Senators say deals could push up health costs&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Give Dec. 21 deadline for details on arrangements&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By David Morgan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Dec 1 (Reuters) - Three leading U.S. senators
are inquiring into drugmaker Pfizer Inc's deals with
pharmacy benefits companies to limit the sale of generic rivals
to cholesterol drug Lipitor, which lost U.S. patent protection
this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer reportedly agreed to give discounts to pharmacy
benefits managers and health insurers on Lipitor provided they
blocked prescriptions to the generic alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmaker denies it has imposed such conditions, but is
offering discounts to these companies and patients as part of
an aggressive marketing strategy to hold onto as much income as
possible from the best-selling medicine of all time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers from three Senate oversight committees said the
arrangements could lead to limited access to generic drugs and
push up healthcare costs for medical patients and the
government insurance programs Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without the prospect of true competition, generic drug
manufacturers will be hesitant to invest the time and resources
required to bring low-cost generic drugs to the market," they
wrote in letters sent to Pfizer, Medco Health Solutions , Express Scripts , Catalyst RX ,
Coventry Health Care and UnitedHealth Group .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawmakers, Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max
Baucus, a Democrat; Senate Aging Committee Chairman Herb Kohl,
a Democrat and Senate Judiciary ranking Republican Charles
Grassley, wield considerable influence over issues involving
healthcare and industry competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low-cost generic drugs are a key lever for controlling
healthcare costs, which in recent years have eclipsed the pace
of U.S. economic growth, inflation and household income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The senators' request followed a Nov. 11 New York Times
article that said Pfizer had reached deals to prevent Lipitor
customers from having access to generics for the next six
months, before additional competitors come onto the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned that the (benefits management companies)
may charge health plan sponsors, including employers and
Medicare Part D, full price for brand name Lipitor from Dec. 1,
2011 through May 31, 2012, while pocketing the discount from
Pfizer," the senators said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The letter gives the companies until Dec. 21 to provide
details of their agreements from wholesale costs to
manufacturer discounts, consumer co-payments and the number of
people affected, as well as presentations made to corporate
officers including board directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our intent is to offer Lipitor to payors and patients at
or below the cost of a generic" in the next six months, Pfizer
said. "As a result, patients receive Lipitor at co-pays
comparable to generics. Participation in Pfizer's programs by a
health plan is entirely voluntary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Express Scripts said in an emailed response to Reuters
that it does recommend generic substitution for Lipitor when
patients fill the subscription at retail pharmacies, but that
the final decision rests with the client, such as employers,
whose benefits it manages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Express said that so far, just one of 2,100 clients has
chosen to block filling retail prescriptions with generic
Lipitor. It did not address its approach to generic Lipitor
when filling prescriptions via mail-order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipitor, which soared to become one of the biggest-selling
drugs after its introduction in 1997, lost its patent
protection on Wednesday. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration
gave approval for the first generic version to Indian drugmaker
Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd . Pfizer is also selling a
generic version of the drug, known chemically as atorvastatin,
in partnership with Watson Pharmaceuticals .&lt;/p&gt;

			CJPS Medical Systems Introduces Remote Patient 
      Monitoring With Tablet PCs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CJPS Medical Systems announces today that VitalPoint&#174; 
      HOME, its remote patient monitor, can be used with Microsoft 
      Windows&#174;-based Tablet PCs. This announcement comes on the heels of CJPS 
      being the first company waiving all connectivity fees to caregivers 
      accessing their patients&#8217; data remotely using home monitors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Typically, nurses and doctors have been using their desktops or laptops 
      to view their patient data using VitalPoint&#174; 
      HOME, which has been designed to be the easiest system to use 
      anywhere &#8211; Not just for the patients, but also for the caregivers 
      monitoring their health. This newest development makes it even easier 
      for nurses and doctors to pick up patients&#8217; reported symptoms and vital 
      signs data from anywhere. All existing VitalPoint&#174; 
      HOME units that have been sold in the field are already capable of 
      such connectivity, and all that needs to be purchased is a Microsoft 
      Windows&#174;-based Tablet PC, and then download VitalPoint&#174; 
      HOME Remote Device Connectivity&#174; software from CJPS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With facilities looking to upgrade to easier-to-use, and more modern and 
      reliable remote patient monitors to reduce their readmission rates, 
      improve health care delivery, while trying to keep up with a sharp 
      increase in older, chronically-ill patients, this unique offering could 
      not come at a better time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In spite of large name competitors, CJPS continues to gain market share 
      thanks to breakthrough industry firsts such as never charging 
      connectivity fees, trading-in existing remote patient monitors and now, 
      providing true mobile health care to home patients. This disruptive 
      industry transformation, driven single-handedly by CJPS, and coupled 
      with the state-of-the-art VitalPoint&#174; technology, contributed greatly to 
      the large national contracts recently won by the company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      VitalPoint&#174; is a standalone 4.5-lb device that can monitor blood 
      pressure, blood oxygen saturation, pulse rate, weight, glucose level, 
      prothrombin time and ratios, temperature, fluid status, and provide 
      electrocardiogram data, and provides the caregiver with the ability to 
      remotely monitor patients&#8217; conditions using their laptop or cell phone.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 1 (Reuters) - Google Inc's Chrome
internet browser overtook Firefox for the first time globally in
November and it continues to narrow the gap to market leader
Microsoft Corp's Internet Explorer, web analytics firm
StatCounter said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We can look forward to a fascinating battle between
Microsoft and Google as the pace of growth of Chrome suggests
that it will become a real rival to Internet Explorer globally,"
Aodhan Cullen, StatCounter chief executive, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November Chrome saw its market share roughly doubling
from a year ago to 25.7 percent, while Internet Explorer's share
dropped to 40.6 percent from 48.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market share of Firefox -- which is popular in Europe --
slipped globally to 25.2 percent from 31.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple Inc's Safari is a distant No 4 on the market
with a 5.9 percent share of all browsing, with No 5 Opera
 controlling 1.8 percent of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;StatCounter statistics are based on aggregate data from more
than 3 million websites with a sample of more than 15 billion
page views per month.&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Completes Acquisition of Ferrosan Consumer Health&#8217;s Business
		&lt;/p&gt;

      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that it has completed its 
      previously announced acquisition of Ferrosan Consumer Health&#8217;s business, 
      which includes dietary supplements and lifestyle products, from Altor 
      2003 Fund GP Limited.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Ferrosan Consumer Health&#8217;s innovative products and geographic footprint 
      are a strong fit for our business,&#8221; said Paul Sturman, President, Pfizer 
      Consumer Healthcare. &#8220;Today, we have taken an important step by adding 
      leading brands to our existing portfolio as well as enhancing our 
      presence in established and emerging markets such as the Nordic 
      countries, Russia and Ukraine. Through this acquisition, we&#8217;ll have the 
      opportunity to provide a broader portfolio of highly trusted and 
      differentiated products to consumers.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc.: Working together for a healthier world&#8482;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At Pfizer, we apply science and our global resources to improve health 
      and well-being at every stage of life. We strive to set the standard for 
      quality, safety and value in the discovery, development and 
      manufacturing of medicines for people and animals. Our diversified 
      global health care portfolio includes human and animal biologic and 
      small molecule medicines and vaccines, as well as nutritional products 
      and many of the world&#8217;s best- known consumer products. Every day, Pfizer 
      colleagues work across developed and emerging markets to advance 
      wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that challenge the most 
      feared diseases of our time. Consistent with our responsibility as the 
      world&#8217;s leading biopharmaceutical company, we also collaborate with 
      health care providers, governments and local communities to support and

&lt;p&gt; Nickelodeon is down in the ratings, and in the dark about why.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; After 16 years of dominating childrens television, the network finds itself in the midst of a mysterious ratings slide serious enough to drive concerns about its parent companys stock and prompt an investigation with Nielsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In just-released November ratings, Nickelodeon was down 19 percent year-over-year in ratings for viewers age 2 and older. In October, its ratings fell 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street is paying attention: This week, one analyst downgraded his rating on Viacom stock from buy to neutral and the other lowered his target price slightly. Both cited Nickelodeon ratings declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viacom CEO Philippe Dauman calls the slide inexplicable and an aberration -- but so far, a coordinated effort by the network and Nielsen to find some glitch that might explain it has come up empty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At least one Nick rival doesnt buy the idea that theres anything wrong with the way Nielsen tracks childrens ratings -- and poked fun at Daumans choice of words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We dont think theres a glitch in kids ratings, the Disney Channel said in a statement to TheWrap. The ratings strength of Disney Channel and Disney XD is inexplicable to some but we are very clear on whats happening -- its the popularity of our programming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Could SpongeBob -- gulp -- just be getting old?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also read: Spongebobs Latest Tormentor: The American Academy of Pediatrics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its definitely not a case of kids spending more time on their homework: Preteen viewership is up overall. Through Nov. 20 of this TV season, an average of 5.8 million children between age 2 and 11 are watching television at any given minute, an increase of 1.7 percent over last season, Nielsen says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nicks slide comes at a particularly bad time: The last three months of the year are especially important to the network because of ads for holiday films and toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stakes are also high because no cable network earns higher total-day ratings than Nick, whose closest rival is The Disney Channel. Both benefit from young audiences with plenty of spare time during the day -- and parents who use it as a plug-in babysitter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though it trails them in total-day viewing, the Cartoon Network is the third-most-watched kids network after Nick and the Disney Channel, and has shared some of Nicks ratings woes. But in the latest monthly ratings it seems to be digging itself out, while Nickelodeons latest numbers have only gotten worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also read: Transformers Helps Viacom Triple 4Q Earnings, Beat the Street&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nick believes the problem could lie with Nielsens sampling of its audience, and has worked with the company behind the scenes to examine several possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Weve been doing this for 30 years, and weve been No. 1 for 16, going on 17 years, with 2-to-11 year-olds. This is a short-term problem, Nickelodeon spokesman Dan Martinsen told TheWrap. The bottom line is whatever has happened with the sample, this is what were working with now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the network still expects to finish the year as the top network among viewers age 2 to 11, and that the network plans 500 new episodes in the next few months to increase ratings. Its new shows include Kung Fu Panda: Legends of Awesomeness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Were moving more aggressively, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dauman said in a Nov. 10 earnings call that Nicks ratings are usually very predictable, and that set-top box data shows meaningfully different viewership trends than those Nielsen has recorded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Nielsen stands by its numbers. In a statement, it said it has worked with the network and the Media Rating Council, the industrys independent auditing organization, on an exhaustive assessment of its ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To date, the review process confirms that our measurement methodology, operations and related reporting processes are working as expected, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nick first noticed the drop in September. According to the latest numbers, Nick fell to an average 0.75 rating over each entire day in November, down from 0.91 in November of 2010. It reached about 1.4 million households this November, down from roughly 1.7 million in November of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also read: Rich Ross and His Decentralized Magic Kingdom -- Is It Working?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Disney Channel posted a 4 percent year-over-year ratings increase in November, from 0.67 to 0.7. (Nick doesnt consider it a direct competitor since it isnt ad-supported.) The Cartoon Network was flat year-over-year in November, recovering somewhat from its own recent losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In October, Nick dropped 13 percent in the ratings while Disney gained 5 percent and the Cartoon Network dropped 12 percent. In September, Nick dropped 8 percent while Disney dropped 2 percent and Cartoon Network fell 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The slide isnt a case of other networks eating Nicks lunch -- not all of it, anyway. Disneys small gains dont begin to account for Nicks losses. Neither does the fast growth of The Hub, which grew 40 percent year-over-year in November. (That isnt as impressive as it sounds when you consider that the growth reflects a ratings increase from 0.05 to 0.07, as the number of daily households grew from 56,000 to 76,000.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disneys XD, meanwhile, has posted ratings gains of 8 percent in October and 15 percent in November after a flat September. It climed to 223,000 households in November, up from 205,000 year-over-year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, analyst David Joyce of Miller Tabak and Co. cut his rating on Viacom stock from buy to neutral, citing the ratings pressure. On Wednesday, Nomura Securities Michael Nathanson lowered his price target by $1, to $54 -- though he still rates the stock a buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viacom shares nonetheless climbed more than 5 percent Wednesday, fueled by the markets overall surge, to end the month of November at $44.76. At the end of August, three very volatile months ago, its shares were at $48.24.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dauman will likely face more questions about the ratings drop when he speaks Monday at the UBS Global Media and Communications Conference in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nickelodeon and Nielsen have looked at a host of possible explanations for the slide. Among them are whether Nielsens sampling may have been thrown off by Cablevision starting to require customers to begin using converters for all TVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They have also looked into whether Nielsen has measured Nickelodeons Hispanic viewers accurately, and whether Nielsen may have replaced cable households with non-cable homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But nothing in the data collection explains the ratings slide.&lt;/p&gt; Related Articles: Spongebobs Latest Tormentor: The American Academy of Pediatrics  Transformers Helps Viacom Triple 4Q Earnings, Beat the Street  Rich Ross and His Decentralized Magic Kingdom -- Is It Working?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades JPMCC 2006-LDP7; Affirms A-2 Through A-J
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded eight classes of J.P. Morgan Chase 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., Series 2006-LDP7 commercial 
      mortgage pass-through certificates, due to the greater certainty of 
      expected losses on the specially serviced loans. A detailed list of 
      rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades reflect an increase in Fitch expected losses across the 
      pool. Fitch modeled losses of 8.01% of the remaining pool. Fitch has 
      designated 60 loans (20%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 26 
      specially serviced loans (10.4%). Fitch expects classes J thru Q may be 
      fully depleted from losses associated with the specially serviced assets 
      and class H will also be impacted slightly.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the November 2011 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has decreased by approximately 11% to $3.5 billion 
      from $3.9 billion at issuance. Interest shortfalls totaling $11.4 
      million are affecting classes J through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to loss (6.8%) is secured by a portfolio of four 
      regional malls and one anchored retail center totaling 2.4 million 
      square feet (sf) (1.7 million sf of collateral) located in OH, CT, MO, 
      CA, and CO. The decline in performance is mostly attributed to the 
      Midway Mall property located in Elyria, OH, which continues to struggle 
      and is currently 62% occupied. The mall has experienced declining income 
      as a result of low occupancy, lower market rents, tenant issues, and 
      current economic conditions. As of trailing 12 months (TTM) June 2011, 
      the debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) for the portfolio declined to 
      1.10 times (x) from 1.20x TTM June 2010. The portfolio was 86.7% 
      occupied as of August 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to loss (1.4%) is currently in special 
      servicing and is a 393,533 sf office property located in Atlanta, GA. 
      The property consists of three buildings built in 1980 and renovated in 
      1997. The loan was transferred to special servicing in June 2010 due to 
      imminent default as a result of the loss of two large tenants vacating 
      at lease expiration in May and June of 2010. The property became real 
      estate owned (REO) in June 2011. CB Richard Ellis is the property 
      manager and leasing agent and marketing efforts are currently underway 
      for lease-up of the properties. Occupancy remains at 40% as of September 
      2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to loss (1.5%) is currently specially 
      serviced and is secured by a 552,927 sf office property located in 
      Shoreview, MN, approximately 12 miles north of the Minneapolis CBD. The 
      collateral consists of five buildings built in 1973 and renovated in 
      2005. The loan was transferred to special servicing in October 2009 due 
      to imminent default resulting from the largest tenant, (41%) net 
      rentable area (NRA), vacating at lease expiration. A receiver was 
      appointed to the property in August 2011 and the foreclosure sale was 
      held in September 2011. The property was 63.2% occupied as of August 
      2011.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and Teva Pharmceutical Industries Ltd were sued by Walgreen Co and four other large retailers, accused of violating U.S. antitrust law by conspiring to keep generic versions of a popular antidepressant off the shelves.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walgreen, Kroger Co, Safeway Inc, Supervalu Inc and HEB Grocery Co accused Pfizer's Wyeth unit of conducting an "overarching anticompetitive scheme" to prevent and delay the approval and marketing of generic versions of the prescription drug Effexor XR, causing them to overpay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a complaint made public on Thursday by the U.S. District Court in Trenton, New Jersey, the retailers said Wyeth kept generic equivalents off the market for at least two years after its marketing exclusivity for the original Effexor compound patent lapsed in June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They said Wyeth did this by obtaining fraudulent patents, engaging in sham litigation, and entering a price-fixing agreement with Teva to delay cheaper generic equivalents from reaching the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result of defendants' exclusionary conduct, generic versions of Effexor XR were illegally blocked from the marketplace from June 2008 through at least June 2010," when U.S. sales of the drug topped $2.5 billion, the 78-page complaint said. Pfizer bought Wyeth in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the retailers' claims had been assigned to them by three large drug wholesalers: AmerisourceBergen Corp, Cardinal Health Inc and McKesson Corp. A sixth plaintiff is American Sales Co, another wholesaler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Effexor XR is used to treat depression and three anxiety disorders. Its chemical name is venlafaxine hydrochloride.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer categorically denies the claims asserted in the plaintiffs' complaints," spokesman Christopher Loder said in an emailed statement. "Wyeth obtained its patents protecting Effexor XR lawfully, and the company intends to defend itself vigorously against these claims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teva spokeswoman Denise Bradley said that company believes the lawsuit has no merit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's global sales of Effexor XR totaled $537 million from January to September, down 64 percent from a year earlier, reflecting increased generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is based in New York, while Wyeth has operations in Madison, New Jersey. Walgreen is based in Deerfield, Illinois; Kroger in Cincinnati; Safeway in Pleasanton, California; Supervalu in Eden Prairie, Minnesota; independently-owned HEB in San Antonio; and American Sales in Lancaster, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Walgreen Co et al v. Wyeth Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 11-06958.&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Completes Acquisition of Excaliard
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that it has completed its 
      acquisition of Excaliard Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately owned 
      biopharmaceutical company focused on developing novel drugs for the 
      treatment of skin fibrosis, more commonly referred to as skin scarring.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is imperative at Pfizer that we continue to develop new and 
      innovative treatments to address unmet medical needs, and there is 
      currently no FDA-approved treatment for excessive skin scarring,&#8221; said 
      Jose-Carlos Gutierrez-Ramos, senior vice president, Biotherapeutics, 
      Worldwide Research and Development, Pfizer. &#8220;Acquiring Excaliard allows 
      us to continue the development of its lead compound EXC 001 to 
      potentially fill a gap and bring a novel new treatment to patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nicholas Dean, PhD., Founder and Chief Scientific Officer of Excaliard: 
      &#8220;We are excited that Pfizer will continue to develop EXC 001, which has 
      shown evidence of reducing scar severity in Phase 2 clinical trials.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While specific financial terms are confidential, Pfizer provided 
      Excaliard&#8217;s shareholders, which include Isis Pharmaceuticals, Alta 
      Partners, ProQuest Investments and RiverVest Venture Partners, an 
      upfront payment and will make contingent payments if certain milestones 
      are achieved in the future.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - RIO DE JANEIRO Dec 3 (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors are probing the possible involvement of state-led oil company Petrobras in a November offshore oil spill in a field operated by Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, the Estado de S. Paulo newspaper reported on its Web site.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At least one Petrobras employee was believed to be on the drilling rig involved in the spill and prosecutors want to determine if Petrobras acted according to the law, Estado said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors are already investigating Chevron and Transocean, the owner of the Sedco 706 floating rig involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spill occurred after unexpected pressure from an undersea oil reservoir in the Frade field northeast of Rio de Janeiro damaged the well more than 500 meters below the seabed and caused an estimated 2,400 barrels of oil to seep up through undersea rock and the seabed and into the ocean, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Petrobras owns a 30 percent stake in the field, Chevron, with a 52 percent stake and the role of operator, has assumed responsibility for the accident and has taken the brunt of criticism for the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining 18 percent is owned by Frade Japao, a Japanese group. Chevron officials said November 20 that Transocean had no responsibility in the spill. The spill, tiny in comparison to the estimated four-million-barrel Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010, has been totally dispersed without coming near Brazil's coast, according to Chevron. The Deepwater Horizon rig was also owned by Transocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Brazilian courts and environmental agencies, all owners of an oil field or exploration concession are "co-responsible" for any damages or accidents in their field according to Brazil's oil regulator, the ANP, and Marilda Rosado De Sa Ribeiro, an oil legislation expert at the Rio de Janeiro law firm of Doria, Jacobina, Rosado, Godinho.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the ANP, though, all regulatory compliance issues are directed at the operator, ANP officials said. Chevron has already been fined $28 million for the spill and faces further fines, the ANP and Brazilian environmental officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Petrobras chief executive Jose Sergio Gabrielli declined to comment on the probe or on the Estado report when called by Reuters on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A well producing about 10 percent of the 79,000 barrels a day of oil pumped from the field was shut by the country's oil regulator, the ANP said December 1.

&lt;p&gt;THOUSAND OAKS, California (Reuters) - While some will argue that Tiger Woods' long-awaited return to the winner's circle on Sunday came in an unofficial 18-man event with the odds stacked in his favor, there is no doubt the former world number one is back to form.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Granted, Woods knew Sherwood Country Club better than anyone else in the elite field and he had previously won the Chevron World Challenge which he hosts four times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significantly, though, he played well for four consecutive rounds -- something which had largely proved elusive for him over the last two years while he struggled for form and fitness -- and his one-shot victory will have sounded an ominous warning to his peers of what they can expect of him in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The greatest player of his generation and arguably ever, a fully-fit Woods can now practise full bore for every event on his schedule -- something he has been unable to do in a long while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In order for me to play the way I know I can play, I had to get fully fit," the 14-times major champion told reporters after fending off fellow American Zach Johnson by a shot with a sizzling birdie-birdie finish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I had to get healthy to where I was strong and explosive again so I could practise. It basically starts with that. I was finally able to practice, then my practice sessions started building and building and building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I felt very good about my game. I got better each and every tournament. I feel pretty good going into next year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods won the most recent of his 14 major titles at the 2008 U.S. Open, and he has long targeted the record 18 claimed by compatriot Jack Nicklaus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that goal still seems distant, Woods was delighted to be able to plan on a full 2012 campaign after missing two of the four majors last year while recovering from injuries to his left knee ligaments and Achilles tendon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MISSING MAJORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't like missing major championships, I really don't," the 35-year-old American said. "I feel very excited about next year. I'm excited about the progress I've made, and really looking forward to it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to be fun to get out there and play a full schedule, which I haven't done for quite some time. I'll get my number of events in, prepare and practise and play my normal pace getting ready for the major championships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'll be trying to peak four times a year, which I haven't had the opportunity to do the last couple years consistently."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much has changed in Woods's life on and off the course since his marriage deteriorated at the end of 2009 amid lurid revelations of serial philandering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 23, 2010, he and his Swedish wife, Elin Nordegren, announced they had divorced and Woods has since successfully completed the fourth swing change of his career and he is now once again able to 'fix' during tournament play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year, he parted company with long-time caddie Steve Williams and on Sunday he won his first tournament with the experienced Joe LaCava on his bag, a pairing which already looks well grooved and relaxed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In throwing off much of the old for the new, it would now seem that the old Tiger is back -- or at least a new and perhaps an improved version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is now aiming to emulate compatriot Jim Furyk, who ended a two-year title drought by winning the 2009 Chevron World Challenge and then followed up with a career-best season on the 2010 PGA Tour that included three victories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Look at what Jimmy did a few years ago," Woods said. "He won here and then had a hell of a year. Hopefully I can do the same. I feel pretty good going into next year." (Editing by Frank Pingue)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THOUSAND OAKS, California (Reuters) - Tiger Woods ended a frustrating victory drought of just over two years when he clinched the Chevron World Challenge which he hosts by one shot Sunday, holing a six-foot birdie putt at the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stroke behind fellow American Zach Johnson overnight, Woods fired a three-under-par 69 at Sherwood Country Club to claim the 95th tournament win of his career -- but his first since the 2009 Australian Masters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods, whose world ranking plummeted from number one to 52nd while he struggled for fitness and form over the last two years with his private life in tatters, came from one down with two holes to play to post a 10-under total of 278.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He drained a 15-footer at the par-three 17th before coolly knocking in a six-footer on the 18th green and then celebrating with a roundhouse sweep through the air with his right arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It feels great," a jubilant Woods said greenside after his spectacular birdie-birdie finish ended a run of 26 tournaments around the world without victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a lot of fun coming down the stretch. Zach put a lot of pressure on me. He turned the tide (on 16), next thing I am one down playing the last couple of holes. Then I made two good putts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked to describe his feelings after ending his lengthy title drought, 14-times major champion Woods replied: "It feels awesome, whatever that is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson, seeking his first victory since last year's Colonial Invitational, had to settle for second place after closing with a 71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Frank Pingue)&lt;/p&gt;

      locais para aumentar o acesso a servi&#231;os financeiros aos consumidores 
      ruandeses e internacionais em todo o pa&#237;s.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A parceria &#233; uma etapa do plano Vis&#227;o 2020, elaborado pelo Governo de 
      Ruanda para transformar o pa&#237;s em uma na&#231;&#227;o de classe m&#233;dia at&#233; o fim da 
      pr&#243;xima d&#233;cada, ampliando a renda per capita de US$220, em 2000, para 
      US$1.000 at&#233; 2020. O sucesso desse plano est&#225; apoiado em uma s&#233;rie de 
      pilares, incluindo a migra&#231;&#227;o para a economia baseada no conhecimento, o 
      desenvolvimento do setor privado e a melhoria da infraestrutura.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A realiza&#231;&#227;o de parcerias p&#250;blico-privadas &#233; tamb&#233;m um componente 
      fundamental para a estrat&#233;gia global de crescimento da Visa. A meta da 
      empresa de gerar 50% de sua receita em mercados fora dos Estados Unidos 
      at&#233; 2015 ser&#225; parcialmente atingida por meio de sua habilidade de 
      construir, comprar e implantar novas tecnologias que ampliem o alcance 
      de seus produtos para locais onde os pagamentos eletr&#244;nicos ainda s&#227;o 
      limitados, como Ruanda.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A Carta de Colabora&#231;&#227;o abrange 12 iniciativas estruturadas em torno de 
      tr&#234;s &#225;reas principais, identificadas pelo Governo de Ruanda e pela Visa 
      como essenciais para o desenvolvimento de um sistema financeiro 
      totalmente inclusivo (os detalhes da carta podem ser encontrados em: http://corporate.visa.com/corporate-responsibility/financial-inclusion/strategic-partnerships.shtml):
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			I. Estabelecer as bases para pagamentos eletr&#244;nicos &#8211; Instalar a 
      infraestrutura b&#225;sica para viabilizar o uso de pagamentos eletr&#244;nicos em 
      todo o territ&#243;rio nacional, o que inclui: (1) facilitar a ampla emiss&#227;o 
      e aceita&#231;&#227;o de cart&#245;es de pagamento; e (2) realizar localmente servi&#231;os 
      de compensa&#231;&#227;o e liquida&#231;&#227;o.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			II. Fomentar a inova&#231;&#227;o nos pagamentos eletr&#244;nicos &#8211; Possibilitar 
      &#224; Ruanda utilizar as mais recentes tecnologias para atingir a popula&#231;&#227;o 
      mal atendida pela infraestrutura tradicional de pagamentos.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			III.
			Capacitar &#8211; Desenvolver programas de treinamento e 
      facilitar a transfer&#234;ncia de conhecimento para que os sistemas 
      financeiros de todo o pa&#237;s consigam se sustentar a longo prazo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A parceria foi anunciada hoje em Kigali em uma coletiva de imprensa que 
      contou com a presen&#231;a do embaixador Claver Gatete, presidente do Banco 
      Nacional de Ruanda, e de Elizabeth Buse, presidente da Visa Inc. para a 
      &#193;sia Pac&#237;fico, Europa Central, Oriente M&#233;dio e &#193;frica.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Em todas as economias, sistemas financeiros bem desenvolvidos s&#227;o 
      essenciais para o crescimento econ&#244;mico sustent&#225;vel. A parceria entre o 
      Governo de Ruanda e a Visa &#233; uma oportunidade para aumentar a efici&#234;ncia 
      e a inclus&#227;o por meio da utiliza&#231;&#227;o dos servi&#231;os financeiros 
      eletr&#244;nicos&#8221;, disse o embaixador Gatete.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Buse descreveu o papel da Visa na parceria: &#8220;Estamos aplicando nossa 
      expertise e ativos &#250;nicos para trazer os benef&#237;cios dos pagamentos 
      eletr&#244;nicos e do sistema banc&#225;rio para mercados emergentes como Ruanda. 
      Ao trabalhar com governos e stakeholders do mundo inteiro para entender 
      melhor os desafios da popula&#231;&#227;o sem acesso a esses servi&#231;os, podemos 
      adaptar nossa abordagem para assegurar que n&#227;o apenas estamos 
      compartilhando nossa experi&#234;ncia, mas criando programas locais 
      relevantes que atendem as necessidades dos governos e de seus cidad&#227;os. 
      No longo prazo, acreditamos que isso tamb&#233;m abrir&#225; novas oportunidades 
      de crescimento para a Visa&#8221;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      O embaixador Gatete complementou: &#8220;Essa parceria est&#225; alinhada com a 
      estrat&#233;gia do Banco Nacional de Ruanda de reduzir a preval&#234;ncia da 
      utiliza&#231;&#227;o do dinheiro em esp&#233;cie e aumentar a liquidez com o sistema 
      banc&#225;rio, o que em &#250;ltima inst&#226;ncia reduz as taxas de juros e aumenta a 
      estabilidade de pre&#231;os&#8221;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Observando a import&#226;ncia de parcerias governamentais para a estrat&#233;gia 
      global da Visa, Joseph W. Saunders, Chairman e CEO da Visa Inc., disse: 
      &#8220;A Visa acredita que todos t&#234;m direito ao acesso a servi&#231;os b&#225;sicos 
      financeiros e de pagamento. Estamos muito satisfeitos em poder trabalhar 
      com um governo t&#227;o comprometido com essa vis&#227;o quanto o governo de 
      Ruanda. Parcerias como esta s&#227;o essenciais para concretizar a promessa 
      de crescimento econ&#244;mico e inclus&#227;o financeira que sabemos que os 
      sistemas de pagamento podem proporcionar&#8221;.

      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) y el Gobierno de Ruanda anunciaron hoy una amplia 
      Carta de Colaboraci&#243;n para desarrollar soluciones localizadas con el fin 
      de extender los servicios financieros a consumidores locales e 
      internacionales en toda la naci&#243;n.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      La alianza es uno de los pasos del plan Visi&#243;n 2020 del Gobierno de 
      Ruanda, que tiene como objetivo convertir al pa&#237;s en una naci&#243;n con un 
      nivel de ingreso de rango medio en la pr&#243;xima d&#233;cada, alcanzando un 
      ingreso per c&#225;pita de $1000 para el 2020, elev&#225;ndolo de los $220 
      registrados en el 2000. El &#233;xito del plan depende de una serie de 
      pilares que incluyen evolucionar el pa&#237;s hacia una econom&#237;a basada en 
      conocimientos, desarrollar el sector privado y mejorar la 
      infraestructura.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Crear asociaciones en los sectores p&#250;blico y privado es tambi&#233;n un 
      componente clave de la estrategia global de crecimiento de Visa. La meta 
      de la compa&#241;&#237;a de generar un 50 por ciento de sus ingresos de mercados 
      fuera de Estados Unidos para el a&#241;o 2015 se habilitar&#225; en parte por 
      medio de su habilidad de construir, comprar e implementar nuevas 
      tecnolog&#237;as que extiendan sus productos a zonas geogr&#225;ficas donde los 
      pagos electr&#243;nicos son hoy limitados, como es el caso de Ruanda.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      La Carta de Colaboraci&#243;n abarca 12 iniciativas estructuradas en torno a 
      tres &#225;reas clave identificadas por el Gobierno de Ruanda y Visa como 
      vitales para el desarrollo de un sistema financiero totalmente inclusivo 
      (se puede obtener informaci&#243;n m&#225;s detallada sobre la Carta de 
      Colaboraci&#243;n en http://corporate.visa.com/corporate-responsibility/financial-inclusion/strategic-partnerships.shtml):
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			I. Establecer las Bases para los Pagos Electr&#243;nicos &#8211; Instalar 
      los requisitos de infraestructura b&#225;sicos para permitir el uso de los 
      pagos electr&#243;nicos en todo el pa&#237;s, incluyendo: (1) facilitar la amplia 
      emisi&#243;n y aceptaci&#243;n de tarjetas de pago; y (2) llevar a cabo la 
      localizaci&#243;n de los servicios de compensaci&#243;n y liquidaci&#243;n.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			II.
			Promover la Innovaci&#243;n en los Pagos Electr&#243;nicos &#8211; Habilitar 
      a Ruanda para que pueda aprovechar las tecnolog&#237;as modernas para llegar 
      a los ciudadanos de la naci&#243;n que no utilizan plenamente la 
      infraestructura tradicional de pagos.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			III.
			Crear M&#225;s Capacidad &#8211; Desarrollar programas de

      asegurar la sostenibilidad a largo plazo de los sistemas financieros en 
      todo el pa&#237;s.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      La alianza fue anunciada hoy en Kigali durante una rueda de prensa 
      conjunta a la cual asistieron el Sr. Director del National Bank of 
      Rwanda, el distinguido Sr. Embajador Claver Gatete y la Sra. Elizabeth 
      Buse, Presidente de Grupo de Visa, Regi&#243;n Asia Pac&#237;fico, Europa Central, 
      Oriente Medio y &#193;frica.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      El Sr. Embajador Gatete se&#241;al&#243; que &#8220;en todas las econom&#237;as, los sistemas 
      financieros bien desarrollados son esenciales para el crecimiento 
      econ&#243;mico sostenido. La alianza entre el Gobierno de Ruanda y Visa es 
      una oportunidad para aumentar la eficiencia y la inclusi&#243;n por medio del 
      uso de los servicios financieros electr&#243;nicos&#8221;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Por su parte, la Sra. Buse describi&#243; el papel de Visa en la alianza: 
      &#8220;Estamos desplegando nuestro conocimiento experto y activos, que son 
      &#250;nicos, para llevar los beneficios de los pagos electr&#243;nicos y la banca 
      a mercados emergentes como Ruanda. Colaborando con los gobiernos y 
      entidades interesadas en el mundo entero para entender mejor los retos 
      de la poblaci&#243;n que no tiene un acceso pleno a los servicios 
      financieros, podemos adaptar nuestro enfoque para asegurar que no s&#243;lo 
      compartamos nuestro conocimiento experto en materia de pagos, sino 
      tambi&#233;n que entreguemos programas locales que tengan significado y 
      relevancia y que llenen las necesidades de los gobiernos y sus 
      ciudadanos. A largo plazo creemos que esto tambi&#233;n abrir&#225; nuevas 
      oportunidades de crecimiento para Visa&#8221;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Agreg&#243; el Sr. Embajador Gatete que &#8220;esta alianza est&#225; alineada con la 
      estrategia del National Bank of Rwanda de reducir el amplio uso del 
      efectivo y aumentar la liquidez dentro del sistema bancario, algo que en 
      &#250;ltima instancia reduce las tasas de inter&#233;s y mejora la estabilidad de 
      los precios&#8221;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Refiri&#233;ndose a la importancia de las alianzas con gobiernos para la 
      estrategia global de Visa, el Sr. Joseph W. Saunders, Presidente de la 
      Junta Directiva y Principal Funcionario Ejecutivo de Visa Inc., expres&#243; 
      que &#8220;Visa considera que todo el mundo tiene el derecho de contar con 
      acceso a servicios financieros y de pago b&#225;sicos, y nos sentimos 
      sumamente complacidos de poder colaborar con un gobierno tan 
      comprometido con esta visi&#243;n como el gobierno de Ruanda. Alianzas como 
      la presente son la clave para entregar la promesa de crecimiento 
      econ&#243;mico e inclusi&#243;n financiera que, sabemos, pueden cumplir los 
      sistemas de pago electr&#243;nicos&#8221;.

			Pfizer&#8217;s Toviaz Shows Positive Top-Line Primary Endpoint Result In 
      Study Of Overactive Bladder In Vulnerable Elderly Patients
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today the top-line primary endpoint 
      result for Toviaz (fesoterodine fumarate) Study A0221049 &#8211; Efficacy and 
      Safety of Fesoterodine Flexible Dose Regimen in Vulnerable Elderly 
      Patients with Overactive Bladder. The study met its primary endpoint: 
      treatment with Toviaz was found to be statistically significantly 
      superior to placebo in reducing the mean number of urgency urinary 
      incontinence (UUI) episodes per day at the end of treatment. Further 
      analyses will be conducted and a publication of the comprehensive 
      results is planned at a later date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Overactive bladder is a treatable medical condition often caused by 
      involuntary contractions or spasms of the bladder muscle. Overactive 
      bladder symptoms of urgency, frequency or urge urinary incontinence can 
      be bothersome and can have a significant impact on important aspects of 
      people&#8217;s lives. Approximately 33 million American adults are estimated 
      to suffer from overactive bladder symptoms. Despite its prevalence, 
      overactive bladder is often unrecognized and untreated. While the 
      prevalence of overactive bladder increases with age, limited research 
      has been conducted in older individuals with this condition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For older individuals with overactive bladder, incontinence accompanied 
      by urgency is the symptom that is most bothersome and embarrassing, and 
      greatly impacts their overall quality of life,&#8221; said Steven J. Romano, 
      M.D., senior vice president, Head, Medicines Development Group, Global 
      Primary Care Business Unit, Pfizer Inc. &#8220;Importantly, this was the first 
      study of any antimuscarinic agent to demonstrate efficacy and safety in 
      the rapidly growing population of medically vulnerable seniors who 
      struggle with overactive bladder.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Study A0221049 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      parallel-group, multicenter trial to compare the efficacy and safety of 
      a flexible dose regimen of fesoterodine to placebo in vulnerable elderly 
      subjects with overactive bladder symptoms of urinary urgency 
      incontinence. Vulnerability was determined using the VES-13, a validated 
      13-item questionnaire assessing physical activity and activities of 
      daily living, which predicts significant deterioration in health in 
      older persons.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 12-week trial enrolled 562 individuals aged 65 or older, with a mean 
      age of 75, at 109 sites in the United States. After an initial 2-week 
      screening period, subjects were randomized either to a fesoterodine 4 mg 
      arm (281 subjects) or to placebo (281 subjects). After 4 weeks of 
      treatment, subjects in the fesoterodine arm were permitted to increase 
      their daily dose of fesoterodine to 8 mg per day, if desired; if 
      subjects subsequently wished to be titrated back down to 4 mg/day of 
      fesoterodine, they were permitted to do so. The primary endpoint was the 
      change in mean number of UUI episodes per day at week 12 relative to 
      baseline versus placebo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      No significant new safety concerns were identified in this medically 
      complex, older study population. The most common adverse events were dry 
      mouth and constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About Toviaz
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      INDICATION
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Toviaz&#174; (fesoterodine fumarate) treats the symptoms of overactive 
      bladder (leaks, strong sudden urges to go, going too often).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you have certain stomach problems, glaucoma, or cannot empty your 
      bladder, you should not take Toviaz.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Toviaz may cause allergic reactions that may be serious. If you 
      experience swelling of the face, lips, throat, or tongue, stop taking 
      Toviaz and get emergency medical help right away.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Medicines like Toviaz can cause blurred vision, drowsiness, and 
      decreased sweating. Use caution when driving, doing unsafe tasks, or in 
      especially hot environments, until you know how Toviaz affects you. 
      Drinking alcohol while taking medicines such as Toviaz may cause 
      increased drowsiness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common side effects are dry mouth and constipation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Toviaz has benefits and risks. There may be other options. To learn more 
      about Toviaz, please see the Full Prescribing and Patient Information.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Slower tumor growth in kidney cancer patients taking Pfizer Inc's experimental drug, Inlyta, in a clinical trial was driven by a subset of patients who are rare in the United States, U.S. Food and Drug Administration researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In review documents released on Monday ahead of an expert advisory panel meeting on the drug, FDA staff expressed concern the Pfizer medicine appeared to work better in patients previously treated by cytokines that are rarely used in the United States, potentially limiting its appeal in the world's largest market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. kidney cancer patients are far more likely to be given Pfizer's Sutent as an initial treatment option rather than cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA documents found the safety profile of Inlyta, clinically known as axitinib, to be similar to rival drugs. However, interim analysis of Pfizer's pivotal trial showed more overall deaths and more deaths related to treatment in patients who received Inlyta compared with those who took Nexavar, which is sold by Bayer AG and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inlyta, which inhibits certain receptors that can influence tumor growth and progression of cancer, is one of several new drugs Pfizer is banking on to help replace lost revenue from its top-selling cholesterol fighter, Lipitor, which began facing generic competition last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA staff said Pfizer's kidney cancer drug showed the same degree of liver enzyme elevation and potential for liver failure as some other drugs in its class, but had lower rates of skin related side effects and anemia than Nexavar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 61,000 Americans will be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year and one in five of them are expected to die from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society. Most often, this cancer occurs in people over 55 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is awaiting an approval decision in Europe for use in patients who failed to be helped by prior treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2010, Pfizer released results of a study showing axitinib significantly delayed the time before the disease progressed compared with Nexavar in previously treated patients with advanced kidney cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial also found the Pfizer drug delayed progression of the disease by some 5.6 months in patients previously treated with cytokines, but only by 1.4 months in those initially treated with Sutent, known chemically as sunitinib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A panel of FDA advisers will consider whether the discrepancy affects Inlyta's risk-benefit ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is also being tested in another late-stage trial for kidney cancer as both an initial treatment option and in previously treated patients. It is also being tested as a treatment for liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 5 (Reuters) - BNY Mellon Wealth Management has hired a
former Goldman Sachs banker to join its ultra high net
worth family advisory team in Los Angeles, the firm said on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ron Bruder, a 25-year financial services industry veteran,
joined BNY Mellon as a managing director, overseeing
specialized planning and investment services to clients in five
states, primarily on the West Coast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BNY Mellon Wealth Management, the New York-based subsidiary
of the Bank of New York Mellon Corporation , has about
$170 billion in private client assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruder, based in Newport Beach, California, works with
clients in Texas, Nevada, Colorado, Washington and all of
California. He reports to team leader Ridge Powell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Goldman Sachs, Bruder managed main floor operations of
designated primary market-makers on the Chicago Board Options
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Deep expertise across a range of investment vehicles (is)
critical as clients navigate an increasingly complex investment
environment," Powell said, referring to Bruder's background as
a strategist and risk manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bruder is the second big addition to the firm in the past
week. BNY Mellon last Monday hired a veteran Northern Trust banker, Penny Weeks, to lead its private banking
business in New England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Concern about small subset driving trial results&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Shares up 0.8 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 5 (Reuters) - Slower tumor growth in kidney cancer
patients taking Pfizer Inc's experimental drug, Inlyta,
in a clinical trial was driven by a subset of patients who are
rare in the United States, U.S. Food and Drug Administration
researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In review documents released on Monday ahead of an expert
advisory panel meeting on the drug, FDA staff expressed concern
the Pfizer medicine appeared to work better in patients
previously treated by cytokines that are rarely used in the
United States, potentially limiting its appeal in the world's
largest market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. kidney cancer patients are far more likely to be given
Pfizer's Sutent as an initial treatment option rather than
cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA documents found the safety profile of Inlyta,
clinically known as axitinib, to be similar to rival drugs.
However, interim analysis of Pfizer's pivotal trial showed more
overall deaths and more deaths related to treatment in patients
who received Inlyta compared with those who took Nexavar, which
is sold by Bayer AG and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inlyta, which inhibits certain receptors that can influence
tumor growth and progression of cancer, is one of several new
drugs Pfizer is banking on to help replace lost revenue from
its top-selling cholesterol fighter, Lipitor, which began
facing generic competition last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA staff said Pfizer's kidney cancer drug showed the same
degree of liver enzyme elevation and potential for liver
failure as some other drugs in its class, but had lower rates
of skin related side effects and anemia than Nexavar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 0.8 percent at $20.05 in afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 61,000 Americans will be diagnosed with kidney cancer
this year and one in five of them are expected to die from the
disease, according to the American Cancer Society. Most often,
this cancer occurs in people over 55 years old.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is awaiting an approval decision in Europe for use
in patients who failed to be helped by prior treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November 2010, Pfizer released results of a study
showing axitinib significantly delayed the time before the
disease progressed compared with Nexavar in previously treated
patients with advanced kidney cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial also found the Pfizer drug delayed progression of
the disease by some 5.6 months in patients previously treated
with cytokines, but only by 1.4 months in those initially
treated with Sutent, known chemically as  sunitinib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A panel of FDA advisers will consider whether the
discrepancy affects Inlyta's risk-benefit ratio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is also being tested in another late-stage trial
for kidney cancer as both an initial treatment option and in
previously treated patients. It is also being tested as a
treatment for liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;

      Notes 'F1+'; Watch Negative
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings assigns a rating of 'F1+', on Rating Watch Negative, to 
      the not-to-exceed $45,871,560 principal, Upper Santa Clara Valley Joint 
      Powers Authority (Castaic Lake Water Agency) commercial paper notes (the 
      notes). The 'F1+', Rating Watch Negative, rating on the notes is based 
      on the support of a irrevocable direct-pay letter of credit (LOC) 
      provided by Citibank N.A. (Citibank, rated 'A+/F1+, with both long and 
      short term ratings on Rating Watch Negative, by Fitch). The rating on 
      the notes expires on the earlier of Dec. 9, 2014, the LOC expiration 
      date; unless such date is extended or any prior termination of the LOC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. Bank National Association as the Issuing and Paying Agent (IPA), 
      will draw on the LOC at the times and in amounts that are sufficient to 
      provide for the timely payment of the principal and interest on maturing 
      notes. The IPA is instructed not to issue any notes that, together with 
      notes then outstanding, will exceed the amount available under the LOC 
      to pay the principal and interest on the notes at maturity. The LOC 
      provides coverage for the $45,871,560 principal amount of the notes plus 
      270 days interest at 12% based upon a 360-day year. All notes will be 
      issued at par with interest due at maturity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the occurrence of an event of default under the LOC, Citibank 
      may direct the IPA to immediately stop the issuance of any additional 
      notes. Following the stop issuance notice Citibank has the option to 
      reduce the stated amount of the LOC to the amount of notes outstanding 
      plus interest and further reduce the stated amount as each note is paid 
      or issue the final drawing notice instructing the IPA to draw in full 
      for amounts outstanding. The proceeds of the final drawing will be held 
      by the IPA and paid out as notes mature. Citigroup Global Markets is 
      the dealer for the notes.

      Eighteen of golf&#8217;s top professionals wrapped up four days of tournament 
      play and raised $487,500 for five education-focused nonprofit partners 
      at the Chevron World Challenge. Held December 1- December 4 at Sherwood 
      Country Club, the PGA co-sponsored tournament featured golf&#8217;s elite and 
      provided funds for programs serving thousands of California students in 
      underserved communities
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron made a donation to the tournament&#8217;s nonprofit education partners 
      for every eagle scored as part of its Eagles For Education program. The 
      donation amount increased each day, starting on Thursday, December 1 at 
      $12,500, jumping to $25,000 on Friday, December 2, doubling to $50,000 
      on Saturday, December 3, and doubling again to $100,000 for the final 
      day of the tournament on Sunday, December 4.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Chevron World Challenge brings together some of the world&#8217;s best 
      golfers while supporting nonprofit partners that provide tremendous 
      programs reaching thousands of students every year,&#8221; said Steve Green, 
      vice president of Policy, Government and Public Affairs for Chevron 
      Corporation. &#8220;Through Eagles For Education, Chevron has been able to 
      provide our nonprofit partners with additional resources that help 
      expand their impact.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms JPMorgan Prime Money Market Fund at 'AAAmmf'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to the JPMorgan 
      Prime Money Market Fund managed by JP Morgan Investment Management, Inc. 
      (JPMIM), a wholly-owned indirect subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase  Co. 
      (NYSE: JPM).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The main drivers for the rating assignment are:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The fund's overall credit quality and diversification;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short maturity profile;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Minimal exposure to interest rate and spread risks;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Overnight and one-week liquidity profile;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The capabilities and resources of JPMIM as investment advisor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 'AAAmmf' money market fund rating reflect the fund's extremely 
      strong capacities to achieve the investment objectives of preserving 
      principal and providing shareholder liquidity through limiting credit, 
      market and liquidity risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FUND CREDIT QUALITY/DIVERSIFICATION
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consistent with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating criteria, the fund maintains a 
      high credit quality by investing exclusively in securities rated at 
      least 'A/F1' or equivalent. The fund seeks to mitigate counterparty risk 
      arising from investments in repurchase agreements by transacting with 
      counterparties rated at least 'A/F1' or equivalent. The fund has the 
      ability to enter into overnight and term repurchase agreements backed by 
      a variety of collateral. In line with the fund's investment policy, the 
      value of collateral exceeds the value of the repurchase agreement by a 
      specified overcollateralization rate that is consistent with the 
      assigned rating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund's Fund Credit Factor (PCF) met Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating 
      criterion of 1.50 or less. The PCF is a risk-weighted measure of the 
      fund's assets that accounts for the credit quality and maturity profile 
      of the fund's securities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      MATURITY PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund seeks to limit interest rate and spread risk consistent with 
      Fitch's ratings criteria for funds rated 'AAAmmf'. The fund limits its 
      weighted average maturity to reset date (WAMr) and weighted average 
      final maturity (WAMf) to 60 days and 120 days, respectively. As of Oct. 
      31, 2011 the fund had a WAMr of 49 days and a WAMf of 89 days.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LIQUIDITY PROFILE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund's additional investment restrictions are aimed at maintaining 
      sufficient levels of daily and weekly liquidity to meet investors' 
      redemption requests. In line with amended Rule 2a-7 under the Investment 
      Company Act of 1940, which governs the investment activities and 
      operations of U.S. money market funds, the fund must invest at least 10% 
      of total assets in daily liquid assets and at least 30% of total assets 
      in weekly liquid assets. As of Oct. 31, 2011, the fund met the liquidity 
      requirements mandated by Rule 2a-7 and was also in line with the 
      liquidity guidelines outlined in Fitch's rating criteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FUND OBJECTIVES
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund aims to provide the highest possible level of current income 
      while still maintaining liquidity and preserving capital. The fund 
      pursues its investment objectives by investing in a diversified, 
      high-credit quality portfolio of short-term debt securities including 
      U.S. government and government agency securities, commercial paper, 
      asset-back commercial paper and other debt obligations of U.S. and 
      foreign corporations, certificates of deposits, time deposits and 
      repurchase agreements. As of Oct. 31, 2011, the fund had approximately 
      $107.1 billion in assets under management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      INVESTMENT ADVISOR
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMIM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Asset Management Holdings 
      Inc., which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase  Co. 
      ('AA-/F1+'), a bank holding company. Fitch views JP Morgan Chase  Co.'s 
      and JPMIM's investment advisory capabilities, financial and resource 
      commitments, operational controls, corporate governance, and compliance 
      procedures as consistent with 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to the fund. As 
      of Sept. 30, 2011, JPMIM, together with other asset management divisions 
      of JP Morgan Chase  Co., had approximately $1.0 trillion in assets 
      under management worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING SENSITIVITY AND SURVEILLANCE:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality or 
      market risk profiles of the fund. A material adverse deviation from 
      Fitch guidelines for any key rating driver could cause the rating to be 
      lowered by Fitch. Furthermore, given the fund's primary investment focus 
      on domestic and foreign issuers in the financial sector, the ratings may 
      be sensitive to material adverse changes in the sector globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch receives weekly fund holdings information and other pertinent fund 
      data from the fund's administrator to conduct surveillance against 
      ratings guidelines and maintain its money market fund rating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional information is available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and 
      therefore, Fitch has been compensated for the provision of the ratings. 
      The sources of information used to assess this rating were the public 
      domain and JPMIM.

			CACI Chairman Dr. J.P. (Jack) London Inducted into Naval Postgraduate 
      School Hall of Fame
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Honor Recognizes Exceptional Contributions to Society, the Nation, 
      and His Alma Mater
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CACI International Inc (NYSE:CACI) 
      announced today that CACI Chairman of the Board Dr. J.P. (Jack) London 
      has been inducted into the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS) Hall of Fame. 
      The honor was bestowed by NPS President Daniel Oliver at a ceremony held 
      at the school&#8217;s Monterey, CA campus. Dr. London and fellow inductee 
      Admiral Stanley Arthur (Ret.) each accepted the school&#8217;s medal marking 
      the occasion. Commemorative plaques honoring the gentlemen will be 
      displayed in the Hall of Fame.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Hall recognizes the accomplishments of NPS&#8217;s most distinguished 
      alumni who, through the attainment of positions at the highest levels of 
      public service, have made the greatest contributions to society, their 
      nations, and the university. The school is a graduate-level academic 
      institution offering master and doctoral programs in more than 60 fields 
      of study &#8211; all with a unique and focused emphasis on enhancing national 
      security.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. London is a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy (1959) and the NPS 
      (1967), where he earned, respectively, a Bachelor of Science in naval 
      engineering and a Master of Science in operations research. He holds a 
      doctorate in business administration conferred &#8220;with distinction&#8221; from 
      George Washington University (1971). His active duty career extended 
      from 1959-1971, during which London initially served as a naval aviator 
      and carrier pilot. Later, during the Vietnam War, he served as Aide and 
      Administrative Assistant to the Vice Chief of the Naval Material 
      Command, Department of the Navy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. London has been instrumental in growing CACI from a small consulting 
      firm into a worldwide professional services and IT company serving vital 
      national needs in defense, intelligence, homeland security, and the 
      modernization of government. He was the architect of CACI strategies 
      that continually positioned the company for growth in rapidly changing 
      business climates, and he created the company&#8217;s robust mergers and 
      acquisition program. His leadership in developing CACI&#8217;s reputation for 
      its culture of ethics and integrity is known throughout the industry. He 
      also belongs to the Washington Business Hall of Fame and the Arlington, 
      Virginia Chamber of Commerce Business Hall of Fame, both lifetime 
      achievement awards honoring his major positive impact on the business 
      and civic life of these communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In his acceptance remarks, Dr. London thanked the more than 14,300 
      people of CACI, pointing out, &#8220;Our remarkable team of professionals is 
      the key to our success as a company and as a provider of critical 
      support to the government. These talented men and women drive the 
      innovation that contributes so much to our record financial performance 
      and they develop the solutions that help our customers serve our 
      nation&#8217;s priorities so effectively.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CACI President and CEO Paul Cofoni noted, &#8220;Everyone at CACI 
      congratulates Dr. London on this added honor to an already stellar 
      career. Throughout his long and distinguished tenure with our company, 
      he has continually championed the leadership and management qualities he 
      gained in his long military service, accentuated by his singular sense 
      of ethical behavior and fierce devotion to our nation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;THOUSAND OAKS, California (Reuters) - Tiger Woods ended a frustrating victory drought of just over two years when he clinched the Chevron World Challenge which he hosts by one shot Sunday, holing a six-foot birdie putt at the last.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A stroke behind fellow American Zach Johnson overnight, Woods fired a three-under-par 69 at Sherwood Country Club to claim the 95th tournament win of his career -- but his first since the 2009 Australian Masters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods, whose world ranking plummeted from number one to 52nd while he struggled for fitness and form over the last two years with his private life in tatters, came from one shot behind with two holes to play to post a 10-under total of 278.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He drained a 15-footer at the par-three 17th before coolly knocking in a six-footer on the 18th green and then celebrating with a roundhouse sweep through the air with his right arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It feels great to go basically head-to-head against Zach all day," a jubilant Woods told reporters after his spectacular birdie-birdie finish ended a run of 26 tournaments around the world without victory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Zach put a lot of pressure on me. He turned the tide (on 16), next thing I am one down playing the last couple of holes. Then I made two good putts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked to describe his feelings after ending his lengthy title drought, 14-times major champion Woods replied: "It feels awesome, whatever that is.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know it's been a while, but also for some reason it feels like it hasn't (been a while) because when I was coming down the stretch there I felt so comfortable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Was I nervous? Absolutely. I'm always nervous in that position but it's a comfortable feeling, and I enjoy being in that position," added Woods, who will rise to 21st when the new world rankings are issued Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson, seeking his first victory since last year's Colonial Invitational, had to settle for second place in his effective head-to-head with Woods after closing with a 71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's Paul Casey, who opened with a 79 in Thursday's wind-buffeted opening round, signed off with a 69 to secure third place at five under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUN-SPLASHED DAY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson held a one-stroke lead at the start of a glorious, sun-splashed autumn day at Sherwood and he preserved that advantage when he and Woods each birdied the par-five second.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Johnson then bogeyed the next two holes -- missing the green to the left off the tee at the par-three third and failing to reach the green in two at the par-four fourth -- to slip one stroke behind Woods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson immediately responded with a battling birdie at the par-five fifth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite ending up above a fairway bunker with his drive and clipping tree branches with his second shot for the ball to advance only 100 yards, he then struck a sizzling approach to five feet and knocked in the putt to draw level with Woods at eight under.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson and Woods both bogeyed the tricky par-three eighth to slip back to seven under before reaching the turn three ahead of the chasing pack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods edged a stroke in front with a birdie at the par-four 10th, where his approach from the right rough ended up within three feet of the cup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He picked up another shot at the par-five 11th after reaching the green in two, but then bogeyed the par-three 12th where he found the left greenside bunker off the tee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Johnson again caught Woods with a birdie at the par-five 13th, where he got up and down from just short of the green, and the pair stayed level with three holes to play.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both players laid up at the par-five 16th and Johnson edged a stroke in front after hitting his approach to 12 feet and calmly rolling in the putt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Woods immediately countered with his 15-foot birdie putt at the 17th before driving his right fist forward in celebration as the watching gallery roared its approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That set up the grandstand finish on 18 where Woods triumphed in style after recording his fifth birdie of the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There were certainly a lot of positives out there today, and I can obviously think of a lot of shots I gave away," Johnson said. "I just came up a little bit short.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I executed well when I needed to, hit good shots when I needed to, and I putted pretty well for the most part. Overall I'm not disappointed in my performance or my approach. I'm just not overly ecstatic about the outcome."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Frank Pingue)&lt;/p&gt;

			ProShares Names Stephen Sachs Head of Capital Markets
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ProShares, the nation&#8217;s fifth largest ETF provider,1 
      announced today that Stephen Sachs has been named to the newly created 
      role of head of capital markets. Mr. Sachs, most recently with Diamond 
      Hill Capital Management, will oversee ProShares&#8217; Capital Markets Group. 
      He reports to Steve Cohen, managing director and head of ProShares&#8217; 
      Strategy Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Few people have the deep level of understanding of ETF mechanics and 
      market microstructure as Steve Sachs,&#8221; said Michael L. Sapir, chairman 
      and CEO of ProShare Advisors LLC, ProShares' investment advisor. &#8220;His 
      experience, along with the strong relationships he brings, will be of 
      significant value as ProShares continues to expand its lineup of 
      alternative ETFs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Sachs has more than 20 years experience in the institutional trading 
      community. Most recently, he served as director of trading for Diamond 
      Hill Capital Management, an $8 billion long/short asset manager. Prior 
      to Diamond Hill, Mr. Sachs was director of trading at Rydex Investments 
      where he helped build the ETF business and was also a member of Rydex&#8217;s 
      Executive Committee, Asset Allocation Committee, Investment Leadership 
      Team, and chair of the Trading Practices Committee.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      His knowledge and expertise have made him an often quoted source for 
      many publications including Barron's and The Wall Street 
      Journal. He has appeared on CNBC, Bloomberg TV and Fox Business News 
      on many occasions discussing market conditions and issues affecting the 
      capital markets. Mr. Sachs participates in several industry committees 
      including the Investment Company Institute&#8217;s Equity Markets Advisory 
      Committee. Mr. Sachs has spoken at numerous industry events over the 
      years on the topics of market regulation and structure, ETF trading and 
      macro-economic conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Sachs received his Bachelor of Science in finance from Franklin 
      University. He also studied international relations and economics at The 
      Ohio State University.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About ProShares
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ProShares is the nation&#8217;s fifth largest ETF provider with 126 funds and 
      more than $24 billion in assets.1 ProShares&#8217; lineup includes 
      the largest family of geared (leveraged and inverse) ETFs.2 ProShare 
      Advisors is affiliated with ProFund Advisors, which was founded in 1997. 
      Together, they manage nearly $28 billion in ETF and mutual fund assets.3
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Short or Ultra ProShares ETFs seek returns that are either 3x, 2x, -1x, 
      -2x or -3x the return of an index or other benchmark (target) for 
      a single day, as measured from one NAV calculation to the next. 
      Due to the compounding of daily returns, ProShares' returns over periods 
      other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction 
      from the target return for the same period. These effects may be more 
      pronounced in funds with larger or inverse multiples and funds with 
      volatile benchmarks. Investors should monitor their ProShares holdings 
      consistent with their strategies, as frequently as daily. For more on 
      correlation, leverage and other risks, please read the prospectus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investing involves risk, including the possible loss of principal. 
      ProShares are non-diversified and entail certain risks, including risk 
      associated with the use of derivatives (swap agreements, futures 
      contracts and similar instruments), imperfect benchmark correlation, 
      leverage and market price variance, all of which can increase volatility 
      and decrease performance. For more on correlation, leverage and other 
      risks, please read the prospectus. There is no guarantee any 
      ProShares ETF will achieve its investment objective.

			New AllergyEats Disney World Microsite Spotlights Allergy-Friendly 
      Restaurants in (and around) the Popular Orlando Theme Parks
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			AllergyEats, the Biggest  Fastest Growing Source for Finding 
      Allergy-Friendly Restaurants, Helps Diners Find the Most Accommodating 
      Restaurants in and around Walt Disney World
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walt Disney World, known for being the happiest place on earth, is one 
      of the most popular vacation spots for families. Now, families with food 
      allergies will be even happier because AllergyEats (www.allergyeats.com), 
      the biggest and fastest growing source for finding allergy-friendly 
      restaurants, has just launched a new website focused exclusively on 
      restaurants in and around Disney (www.allergyeats.com/disney).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      People who log onto this new, free AllergyEats Disney World microsite 
      can quickly and easily view and rate the food allergy-friendliness of 
      all the restaurants in Walt Disney World&#8217;s parks and hotels, as well as 
      thousands of restaurants in the greater Orlando area.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Walt Disney World is widely-regarded as the &#8216;gold standard&#8217; in terms of 
      accommodating food-allergic guests, but some establishments still handle 
      food allergies better than others and not all of the local restaurants 
      are run by Disney itself,&#8221; said Paul Antico, Founder of AllergyEats and 
      the father of three food-allergic children.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The new AllergyEats Disney World microsite allows people with food 
      allergies to learn more about their restaurant options and make more 
      informed decisions about where to dine while visiting the area,&#8221; Antico 
      added. "Whether people are planning their vacations in advance or 
      looking for a meal while onsite at the parks, the AllergyEats Disney 
      World microsite is a great resource to access restaurants&#8217; AllergyEats 
      allergy-friendliness ratings and review peer feedback from other 
      food-allergic and gluten intolerant diners."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the valuable ratings and peer-based feedback, the new 
      microsite features Disney Dining Tips, along with other helpful 
      information and resources for food-allergic families - and more features 
      are coming soon. The Disney microsite also provides easy access to the 
      main AllergyEats site, which features more than 600,000 restaurants 
      nationwide that users can rate, as well as restaurants&#8217; menus (including 
      gluten-free menus), allergen lists, nutrition information, 
      certifications, web links, directions and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AllergyEats is a free, user-friendly resource that provides valuable 
      peer-based feedback about how well (or poorly) restaurants accommodate 
      the needs of food-allergic customers. Most restaurant review sites 
      include information about establishments&#8217; food, ambiance or service, but 
      AllergyEats is singularly focused on food allergies, with peer reviews 
      spotlighting where people with food allergies or intolerances have more 
      comfortably eaten and where they&#8217;ve encountered challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AllergyEats also features a new, free AllergyEats app (available at 
      iTunes and the Android store), providing access to important information 
      about restaurants&#8217; peer ratings, feedback, menus and other information 
      while on-the-go.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The AllergyEats core site, smartphone app and new AllergyEats Disney 
      World microsite allow food-allergic and gluten intolerant diners to 
      quickly and easily find restaurants that will more likely cater to their 
      special dietary requirements &#8211; and avoid the ones that won&#8217;t.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In my professional life, running AllergyEats, and in my personal life, 
      dining out with my food-allergic children, I&#8217;ve seen firsthand that some 
      restaurants are genuinely concerned about the health and safety of their 
      guests and are very willing to accommodate food-allergic diners,&#8221; Antico 
      explained. &#8220;And those are the restaurants we visit and recommend to 
      others.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Whenever people dine out, whether their experience was positive, 
      negative or somewhere in between, we hope they&#8217;ll take just a minute to 
      rate the restaurant on AllergyEats, using the core website (www.allergyeats.com), 
      the AllergyEats app and the AllergyEats Disney World microsite (www.allergyeats.com/disney). 
      This valuable feedback helps the entire food allergy and intolerance 
      community make more informed decisions about where to dine out &#8211; and 
      which restaurants to avoid,&#8221; Antico continued.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AllergyEats has been endorsed by highly-respected food, health and 
      allergy organizations and individuals, including the Asthma and Allergy 
      Foundation of America, Gluten Intolerance Group, Massachusetts 
      Restaurant Association, Chef Ming Tsai and more. For more information, 
      please go to www.AllergyEats.com.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;DEC 5 - Payment processing company Visa Inc,
which plans to generate half of its revenue from markets outside
the United States,  signed an agreement with the government of
Rwanda to expand its electronic payments services in the African
country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, the San Francisco-based card processor
will install basic infrastructure for electronic payments for
issuance and acceptance of payment cards and localised clearing
and settlement services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Payment processors, such as Visa and rival Mastercard,
have been increasingly looking for growth through new gateways
including mobile phones and the Internet, because they are faced
with a saturated U.S. market for credit and debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			Visa-Rwanda Partnership to Drive Electronic Financial Services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Brings the benefits of electronic payments and banking to Rwanda
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) and the Government of Rwanda today announced a 
      wide-reaching Charter of Collaboration to develop localized solutions to 
      extend access to financial services to local and international consumers 
      throughout the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The partnership is a step in the Government of Rwanda&#8217;s Vision 2020 
      plan, the country&#8217;s blueprint to become a middle-income nation within 
      the coming decade, with per capita income of $1000 by 2020, up from $220 
      in 2000. The success of that plan relies on a number of pillars, 
      including shifting to a knowledge-based economy, private sector 
      development and improving infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Creating public-private partnerships is also a key component of Visa&#8217;s 
      global growth strategy. The company&#8217;s aim to generate 50 percent of its 
      revenue from markets outside of the United States by 2015 will partly be 
      enabled through its ability to build, buy and deploy new technologies 
      that extend its products to geographies where electronic payments are 
      limited today, such as Rwanda.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Charter of Collaboration encompasses 12 initiatives structured 
      around three key areas identified by the Government of Rwanda and Visa 
      as vital to the development of a fully-inclusive financial system (full 
      details of the Charter can be found at http://corporate.visa.com/corporate-responsibility/financial-inclusion/strategic-partnerships.shtml.)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			I.
			Lay the Foundations for Electronic Payments &#8211; Install 
      the basic infrastructure requirements to enable country-wide use of 
      electronic payments, including: (1) facilitating the widespread issuance 
      and acceptance of payment cards; and (2) localizing clearing and 
      settlement services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			II.
			Promote Electronic Payments Innovation &#8211; Enable Rwanda 
      to take advantage of modern technologies to reach Rwandans who are 
      under-served by traditional payments infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			III.
			Capacity Building &#8211; Develop training programs and 
      facilitate knowledge-transfer in order to ensure the long-term 
      sustainability of financial systems throughout the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The partnership was announced today in Kigali at a joint press 
      conference attended by the Governor of the National Bank of Rwanda, 
      Ambassador Claver Gatete and Elizabeth Buse, Group President, Asia 
      Pacific, Central Europe, Middle East and Africa, Visa Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ambassador Gatete said: &#8220;In all economies, well developed financial 
      systems are essential for sustained economic growth. The partnership 
      between the Government of Rwanda and Visa is an opportunity to increase 
      efficiency and inclusion through the use of electronic financial 
      services.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Buse described Visa&#8217;s role in the partnership: &#8220;We are deploying our 
      unique expertise and assets to bring the benefits of electronic payments 
      and banking to emerging markets like Rwanda. By working with governments 
      and stakeholders around the world to better understand the challenges of 
      the underserved, we can adapt our approach to ensure that we are not 
      only sharing our payments expertise, but are delivering meaningful local 
      programs that meet the needs of governments and their citizens. In the 
      long-run we believe this will also open up new growth opportunities for 
      Visa.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ambassador Gatete continued: &#8220;This partnership is aligned with the 
      National Bank of Rwanda&#8217;s strategy to reduce the widespread usage of 
      cash and increase liquidity within the banking system, which ultimately 
      reduces interest rates and improves price stability.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Noting the importance of government partnerships to Visa&#8217;s global 
      strategy, Joseph W. Saunders, Chairman and CEO of Visa Inc., said: &#8220;Visa 
      believes that everyone has the right to have access to basic financial 
      and payment services, and we are very pleased to be able to work with a 
      government as committed to this vision as the Rwandan government. 
      Partnerships such as this are the key to delivering the promise of 
      economic growth and financial inclusion that we know electronic payment 
      systems can provide.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REDWOOD CITY, Calif., Dec. 6, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Versant Corporation (Nasdaq:VSNT), a worldwide leader in high-performance database engines for complex, mission critical applications, launched today a code preview program for its new Versant Java Persistence API (JPA 2.0), a pure Java client for the Versant Database Server. With the new API, Versant is introducing support for the widely accepted JPA industry standard, enabling enterprises to implement Big Data applications more quickly and easily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Traditional database technology fails when presented with the scale and complexity of Big Data. While new NoSQL technologies offer alternatives, developing true mission critical applications on them, such as real-time analytics systems, typically requires learning proprietary APIs and custom coding when data models become complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Designed to manage complex object structures and relationships using the well-established Java programming standard, Versant JPA provides a foundation for real-time analytics with very large data sets by connecting to Versant's high performance database. Developers can use existing coding skills to process previously unmanageable Big Data sets without learning yet another proprietary persistence API.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Versant's Dirk Bartels, VP, Strategic Product Management, commented: "As data volumes have grown, so has the complexity of enterprises' information models. Businesses need databases and applications to link richer data sets and provide more intelligence, more quickly &#8211; extending beyond simple keys and values and traditional relational JOIN operations. To address this issue, we're introducing a standard JPA interface into the Versant portfolio. With this cornerstone solution, enterprises can leverage existing JPA coding skills that can now be applied to develop new Big Data and real-time analytics applications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The National Snow and Ice Data Center's (NSIDC) Associate Scientist III, Information Technology Services, David Gallaher, commented: "When analyzing 30 years' worth of information about Greenland's ice sheet, we explored the commonly used relational database options, but they collapsed under such a massive data volume. To accommodate our nearly petabyte-scale worth of data, we turned to Versant's databases, which were able to process billions of arbitrarily complex, time-series data objects with true database functionality, enabling a time-scaled analysis. Ultimately, adding this new API to Versant's technologies will allow even more development teams and organizations to derive the kind of value from Big Data that we have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Versant JPA is part of the company's new strategic initiative which builds on Versant's heritage for large, distributed database applications, enabling enterprises to become highly agile and data driven.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	A code preview of Versant JPA is available immediately for download in the Versant Developer Community.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Italian government debt yields look very attractive unless there is a "complete fiasco" at this week's critical European Union summit and there will be no euro without Italy, Jim O'Neill, Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, told Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the Reuters 2012 Investment Outlook Summit, O'Neill said the softening of Germany's stance on private sector involvement (PSI) in any euro government debt workout beyond Greece was "highly significant" if backed by European Central Bank action.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't believe EMU (European Monetary Union) could survive without Italy in it. At the same time, Italy can't survive with 7 pct bond yields -- so something's got to give," said O'Neill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unless it's a complete fiasco at the weekend, Italian bonds look to me like a good deal. Italian bond yields will have to get down to 4 pct if not lower."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spreading of the euro sovereign debt crisis to Italy this year has raised fears for the currency's future as many saw Italy and its massive debt mountain as too big to bail out. When 10-year Italian bond yields topped 7 percent, many saw that as unsustainable over time. They have since dropped back this week after Rome announced its latest austerity budget and fell below 6 percent on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the EU summit, France and Germany have formulated an agreement on more centrally enforced budget rules to keep euro state borrowings in check. Many hope the European Central Bank (ECB) will also agree to open-ended euro government bond purchases in return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;German Chancellor Angela Merkel, at a press conference with French President Nicolas Sarkozy on Monday, also gave ground on the rules of a future permanent rescue fund for the euro zone, the European Stability Mechanism (ESM), which have been cited as a deterrent to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Germany had insisted that explicit clauses be included in all bonds issued from mid-2013, stipulating that private bondholders may have to share the burden of any future bailouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the rules will say the ESM will respect standard International Monetary Fund principles and procedures, and that the write-down taken by Greek bondholders is a unique case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pending what the ECB does on Thursday, it (the PSI move) is certainly something that could be highly significant," O'Neill said, referring to an ECB policy meeting due on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It takes banks and to some extent sovereigns out of the funding dilemma that has faced all of them in the last three months. Assuming the ECB is going to play their part -- I think it does."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMU AND BRICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill's comments were echoed by other asset managers attending the Reuters summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stephen Jen, managing partner of London-based hedge fund SLJ Macro Partners, said Italian debt offered a 3.5-4 percent real yield, of which 300 basis points were a risk premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think, if I had the time horizon and patience, I would be very interested," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark 10-year Italian yield fell below 6 percent for the first time since late October on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boaz Weinstein, founder of hedge fund Saba Capital Management, was also in favor of Italian debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He recently bought Italian bonds when the yield crossed 7 percent because he thinks the risk of default is not as great as the market believes, adding that he sees a yield of around 5-6 percent as "fair value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see any reasonable chance where Italy would default and the banks wouldn't," Weinstein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alan Brown, chief investment officer at Schroders, however, is steering clear of Italy's debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do not see any reason to get in front of the train, I would wait to see the outcome. It's too much of a lottery, too much of a crapshoot," Brown told the summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill said Goldman Sachs AM, which has almost a trillion dollars of assets under management, had a base case for the year ahead that sees the 17 members of the euro remaining in the currency bloc, but there were significant risks that Greece and maybe even Portugal could leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of these countries shouldn't have joined in the first place. How do you improve your competitiveness without significant deflation?" he said. "There are new things to be considered in research about how a country can have a peaceful exit -- it's relevant for Greece, maybe Portugal and in certain circumstances other countries as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit ratings agency Standard &amp; Poors' warning late on Monday to all euro zone governments about possible downgrades would have a marginally negative impact, but it all depended on the EU summit outcome and the timing was "pretty ridiculous" as a result, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere O'Neill, who as Goldman's chief global economist invented the BRIC acronym 10 years ago to capture the rapid development of the giant emerging economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China, said U.S. and emerging market economies were still performing well and that made it easy to be bullish about global equities in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China and Mexico are his favored markets, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On exchange rates, O'Neill said the Swiss National Bank had done a good job in capping the Swiss franc and he saw the currency weakening further next year -- especially if the euro crisis eases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Swiss authorities have down a great job stopping the franc being a safe haven and I think the franc will weaken further," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Susan Fenton; graphics by Scott Barber)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Network Automation, the premier provider of scalable IT and business 
      process automation software, today announced the release of its latest 
      automation software solutions - AutoMate 
      9 and AutoMate 
      BPA Server 9. The release marks the expansion of the no-code 
      platform&#8217;s enhanced offerings including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Microsoft Azure &#8211; Fully enabled cloud storage automation via 
        Microsoft&#8217;s Azure Storage Services, such as Binary Large Objects 
        (BLOB), Table Service, and Queue Service, supports the software&#8217;s 
        existing AWS functionality;
      
			
        Microsoft Dynamics CRM &#8211; Automation of a wide range of entity data 
        management activities within the Microsoft Dynamics CRM software, 
        including creation, deletion, updating, query, retrieval, storage and 
        reporting of all customer, product and order data; and
      
			
        OCR &#8211; Automation of OCR, converting multiple text format documents 
        into stored data is now automated, covering formats such as PDF, TIFF, 
        JPEG, BMP, and GIF.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Extending AutoMate 9&#8217;s Cloud automation to Azure allows our customers 
      additional IaaS platform choices. The rate of uptake in our Amazon Web 
      Services automation exceeded 20% of our install base in under a year. 
      Adding to this success with new Azure automation was a key market-based 
      decision,&#8221; said Dustin 
      Snell, Founder and Chief Software Architect. &#8220;The market&#8217;s increased 
      deployment of our automation platform to support both back- and 
      front-office business processes drove the inclusion of OCR and Dynamics 
      support.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to an independent Forrester Research, Inc. report by
			Craig 
      Le Clair, ERP Process Woes Continue, But BPM Suites and Dynamic Case 
      Management Can Help, May 2011, &#8220;ERP vendors' provincial focus limits 
      the potential of acquired BPM solutions. When ERP providers integrate 
      workflow or BPM solutions that they've developed or acquired, they focus 
      on the capabilities that will improve their existing systems and thus 
      integrate their own applications first. This narrow view often defeats 
      customer goals of end-to-end process improvement.&#8221; Network Automation 
      customers use AutoMate extensively to improve ERP process automation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AutoMate 9 builds upon the Unicode compliance released with AutoMate 8 
      to include six new languages. Local language support extends the value 
      of AutoMate to enable IT and business users alike to quickly, and 
      easily, automate a countless number of tasks. All actions are 
      pre-programmed and can be described in plain English, Spanish, 
      Portuguese, Japanese, French and Chinese, enabling configuration without 
      programming capabilities. For example, any Microsoft CRM Dynamics 
      database can be easily integrated with external business processes like 
      FTP, website interaction, quote generation, and other wide-ranging 
      mission-critical activities. The inclusion of Dynamics CRM automation 
      addresses the gap between CRM and ERP integration and workflow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;AutoMate 9 has been one of the most valuable strategic investments our 
      company has made,&#8221; said Eric Jones, Practice Director, JCMR Technology. 
      &#8220;With its new functionalities we expect to drastically reduce our time 
      to execute on client projects.&#8221; Benjamin Korper, President, Korper ICT, 
      continued, &#8220;The Azure platform automation, OCR feature, as well as the 
      new ability to install the software in French will benefit us greatly. 
      All of the new features allow almost any organization to reduce costs, 
      streamline processes, and increase efficiency.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional features include revamped automation development and 
      deployment interfaces, increasing productivity and control of production 
      environments. The new user experience coupled with enhanced permissions 
      processing, versioning, international calendaring and workflow graphics 
      further establish AutoMate as the premier automation platform delivering 
      innovation and value with reduced complexity for every type of user -- 
      from the smallest SMB to mid-market businesses and global enterprises.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AutoMate 9 is currently available for purchase at www.networkautomation.com. 
      The full platform is also available for a 30-day, 100% free trial 
      through Network Automation.

			Goodwin 
      Procter LLP, a national Am Law 50 firm, has been recognized as one 
      of the &#8220;Best 
      Places to Work in New York City&#8221; by Crain&#8217;s New York Business 
      for the third consecutive year. Goodwin was one of 50 employers named, 
      and one of only seven law firms selected, in the extensive survey of 
      businesses with 25 or more employees in New York City.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Crain&#8217;s cited Goodwin&#8217;s recognition of its attorneys, the firm&#8217;s 
      flexibility, and its efforts to foster relationships between employees 
      in naming Goodwin to this year&#8217;s ranking. Online survey responses from 
      approximately 12,500 randomly chosen employees across New York City were 
      the most critical component in the selection of companies for the list.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re excited to be recognized by Crain&#8217;s for the third time in 
      as many years,&#8221; said Albert J. Solecki, Jr., chair of Goodwin&#8217;s New York 
      office. &#8220;Goodwin has continued to focus on providing challenging client 
      work, professional development opportunities and family-friendly 
      policies to help create an engaging work environment for all of our 
      employees.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Attorneys in Goodwin&#8217;s New York office counsel a diverse client base, 
      ranging from entrepreneurial emerging companies to established 
      multinationals, on sophisticated transactional work and 
      precedent-setting litigation. The office&#8217;s litigation practice advises 
      clients in matters involving intellectual property, white collar crime, 
      products liability, securities, general commercial disputes, and labor 
      and employment issues. Goodwin&#8217;s corporate lawyers represent clients in 
      financing, fund and insolvency work, mergers and acquisitions, joint 
      ventures, private equity deals, and capital markets transactions in a 
      variety of industries, including private equity, real estate capital 
      markets, financial services, securities and corporate finance, 
      technology and life sciences, and financial restructuring.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Scores from employees, who answered a confidential 72-question survey, 
      were combined with scores from an 80-question survey of employers, 
      focused on benefits and policies. Results from the employee surveys made 
      up 75% of the total score, with the employer surveys comprising the 
      remaining 25%.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DataCore Software, one of the industry&#8217;s premier providers of storage 
      virtualization software, today introduced the SANsymphony&#8482;-V 
      Monitoring Pack for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager. The new 
      offering enables customers to easily monitor and manage the diverse

      their data center from System Center.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Storage Hypervisor Integration into System Center
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The DataCore SANsymphony-V storage 
      hypervisor enhances the value of diverse storage resources by 
      unifying advanced services, such as provisioning, auto-tiering, 
      replication and performance acceleration, through a common storage 
      virtualization layer. The SANsymphony-V Monitoring Pack brings constant 
      visibility into the health, performance and availability of these 
      virtualized storage resources in System Center. The combined solution 
      uniquely encompasses both on-premise and cloud-based, off-premise 
      components, including redundant high-availability elements and those in 
      remote disaster recovery sites. Information appears on a &#8220;single pane of 
      glass&#8221; alongside other facets of the data center, simplifying end-to-end 
      service management of diverse storage environments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Customers with mission-critical systems depend on Microsoft System 
      Center to manage across their physical and virtualized environments," 
      said Andrew Conway, director, product management, System Center, 
      Microsoft. "The DataCore SANsymphony-V Monitoring Pack for Operations 
      Manager is designed to give these customers the ability to monitor their 
      virtualized storage infrastructure."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DataCore&#8217;s SANsymphony-V Monitoring Pack easily integrates with System 
      Center Operations Manager 2007 and System Center Operations Manager 2010.

			StoredIQ Extends Information Governance to the Cloud with Support for 
      Microsoft Office 365
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			StoredIQ Supports Growing Customer Demand for eDiscovery, Records 
      Management, and Compliance Solutions for Cloud-Based Exchange and 
      SharePoint Data
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			StoredIQ, 
      a global leader in actionable 
      information governance solutions for eDiscovery, 
      records 
      management, compliance 
      and storage 
      management, today announced support for cloud-based Exchange and 
      SharePoint data residing within Microsoft Office 365 (formerly Microsoft 
      Business Productivity Office Suite &#8211; BPOS). With this extended 
      capability, Microsoft Office 365 customers can utilize StoredIQ to gain 
      the same deep visibility and understanding of their cloud-based email 
      and SharePoint data as they do with StoredIQ&#8217;s on-premise information 
      governance solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Customers, including a major U.S. car manufacturer, are using StoredIQ 
      to quickly connect to Microsoft Office 365 to identify, collect and 
      manage Exchange email and SharePoint data for responding to eDiscovery 
      requests, applying 
      records policies, and adhering 
      to regulatory compliance mandates. As a result, StoredIQ provides 
      enterprises with actionable 
      information governance solutions to realize the benefits of cloud 
      computing while still fulfilling their legal and compliance requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to 451 Research, a division of The 451 Group, cloud computing 
      continues to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 24 percent and 
      will reach $16.7 billion in revenue by 2013. &#8220;As enterprises continue 
      moving data to the cloud, information governance challenges are becoming 
      more complex,&#8221; said&#160;David 
      Horrigan, analyst, eDiscovery and information governance at 451 
      Research. &#8220;StoredIQ&#8217;s Platform connects to Microsoft Office 365 and 
      indexes its data, combining the ability to identify, collect, and manage 
      cloud-based data for legal discovery and records management into an 
      integrated information governance application as a means of preempting 
      litigation and reducing potential legal risks associated with cloud data 
      storage.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As a way to minimize storage costs and IT investments, we are seeing 
      more and more customers move data to the cloud," said Amir Jaibaji, vice 
      president of product management for StoredIQ. &#8220;Whether on-premise or in 
      the cloud, StoredIQ can provide a highly scalable solution for governing 
      all enterprise data and ensure that data placed in the cloud is 
      discoverable for litigation, regulatory inquiries, and records retention 
      scheduling.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			StoredIQ&#8217;s support for Microsoft Office 365 includes:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Identification and collection of data from both Microsoft Exchange 
        Online and Microsoft SharePoint Online
      
			
        Integration with Active Directory
      
			
        Auto&#8211;detection of both mailboxes and SharePoint sub-sites in the cloud
      
			
        Connection throttling to Microsoft Office 365 in order to maximize 
        network efficiency
      
			
        Managed security and access, along with automatic activity and 
        chain-of-custody reporting

&lt;p&gt; The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is enlisting some Hollywood heavy hitters to help raise money for the proposed Academy Museum.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Co. president and CEO Bob Iger will serve as chairman of the capital campaign for the upcoming museum. Actress Annette Bening and actor-producer Tom Hanks will join as co-chairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We want people to know that this is for real, Sherak told TheWrap on Wednesday afternoon. With Bob involved, that makes it real. That makes the statement that this dream is real to us, and we are going to do it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In October, the group behind the Oscars announced plans to locate a museum in the old May Company department store building, which is owned by the Los Angeles County Museum of Art&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also read:Academy Museum Finds Home at LACMA (Exclusive)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though Los Angeles is the center of the film industry, the city has yet to have a top-shelf museum devoted to its most famous industry. With permanent and rotating exhibitions, the museum is intended to rectify that by documenting the history of the motion picture industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed Academy Museum will occupy a 300,000 square-foot space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Academy Museum of Motion Pictures represents a bold new way of saving and presenting film history, Iger said in a statement. It will innovate not only the museum experience, but also the publics relationship to the art form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sherak told TheWrap that he, Academy CEO Dawn Hudson and COO Ric Robertson met with Iger last week and asked him to become involved; the Disney chief, whose ABC network has televised the Oscars for 36 years and has a contract to do so for another 10, asked for a few days to think about it before agreeing to become involved over lunch on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Igers involvement, Sherak said, AMPAS governors Bening and Hanks immediately agreed to serve as co-chairs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sherak says the fundraising will start in earnest after the first of the year, and that he expects the bulk of the money to come in over the first year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Economic conditions are not that great, he admitted. The bottom line is, its still going to be hard. But we think that we have enough passionate people in this town to get us where we need to go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sherak would not say how much the Academy needed to raise for the new museum, except to say that it would be a lot lot lot lot less than the estimated $400 million that would have been required to build a museum from scratch on Vine Street, which AMPAS once planned to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That time around, fundraising efforts were halted by the economic meltdown. The Academy still owns the land on which that museum would have been built, adjacent to its Pickford Center for Motion Picture Study in Hollywood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This time, we are not building a building, he said. We are designing interior spaces in a building that already exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first $50 million toward the museum at LACMA, he added, would be provided by the Academy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; I am thrilled to be part of this crucial phase in what will be an extraordinary landmark, Bening remarked in a statement. It will give so much to our city, to historians, and to visitors from all over the world, who love movies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additional reporting by Steve Pond&lt;/p&gt; Related Articles: Academy Museum Finds Home at LACMA (Exclusive, Updated) Dawn Hudson: New Academy Museum on Fast Track&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Sees 2011 outlay at $28 bln, $2 bln more than expected&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Brings Chevron spending into line with Exxon&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 7 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp , the second-largest
U.S. oil company, is increasing its spending in 2012 by about a
sixth as it invests heavily in deepwater developments and two
massive Australian liquefied natural gas projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $32.7 billion capital and exploratory budget compares
with the $28 billion it expects to have spent this year, which
is $2 billion more than the company originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are building new legacy positions with major
investments in LNG projects and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico,"
Vice Chairman George Kirkland said in a statement. "Our global
LNG investments are estimated to reach peak spending in 2012
and 2013."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase brings Chevron's spending closer to that of
larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp , which expects its annual
budget in the next several years to range from $33 billion to
$37 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's budget growth is similar to that of
ConocoPhillips , which said on Friday its 2012 capital
spending will grow 15 percent to $15.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also reflects a broader trend as producers respond to
oil prices at $100 per barrel or more, and spend record sums in
order, in many cases, simply to maintain production at current
levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's worldwide oil and gas output has failed to grow
in the past year, and Chief Executive John Watson reiterated
that the big investments now would pay off in the years ahead.
He repeated a prediction of 20 percent production growth to 3.3
million barrels per day (bpd) by 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This growth profile, along with our current financial
strength, supports our priority of continuously growing our
dividends," Watson said. The company announced a 3.8 percent
rise in its quarterly dividend in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Australia, the Gorgon LNG project is one-third complete
and entering its third year of construction, on track for first
production in 2014. The Wheatstone LNG development, located 60
miles (100 km) south, is entering its first year of
construction, and expected to start producing in 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together they will add up to a net 350,000 bpd for Chevron,
and sustain those levels for "many years," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said 30 percent of the $28.5 billion budgeted
for its upstream exploration and production arm in 2012 will
support currently producing assets and mitigate natural field
decline. About $3 billion will go toward exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has also included the development of the Papa-Terra
deepwater field in its plans, despite the political fallout of
a leak at another deepwater project off Brazil last month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY Dec 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has
agreed to convert A$975 million ($1 billion) of debt in CVC Asia
Pacific's Nine Entertainment TV network into equity
after the private equity owner's refinancing plans fell through,
the Australian Financial Review reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CVC last month asked lenders to agree to a two-and-a-half
year extension for A$2.6 billion in senior debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that proposal was effectively killed by a rush of hedge
funds buying up debt from the banks, the AFR reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, a fund run by Goldman Sachs will convert its
mezzanine debt into equity in the media group.&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Announces $32.7 Billion Capital and Exploratory Budget for 
      2012
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Upstream spending projected at $28.5 billion, as Liquefied 
        Natural Gas (LNG) and deepwater investments propel a step change in 
        future production
			
			
				U.S. investments total nearly $9 billion, with substantial

        and Pennsylvania
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced a $32.7 billion capital 
      and exploratory spending program for 2012. Included in the 2012 program 
      are $3 billion of planned expenditures by affiliates, which do not 
      require cash outlays by Chevron.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total investments for 2011 are estimated at $33 billion, reflecting 
      approximately $28 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures and 
      $4.5 billion for the acquisition of Atlas Energy, Inc., which closed 
      earlier in the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We continue to develop an unparalleled project queue,&#8221;&#160;said Chairman 
      and CEO John Watson. &#8220;Our 2012 capital program covers a number of 
      multi-year projects currently in the construction phase, including two 
      world-class Australian LNG projects and multiple deepwater 
      developments.&#160;We believe these investments will yield significant 
      production growth and reward our shareholders for years to come.&#160;By 
      2017, we expect our net crude oil and natural gas production to grow 
      about 20 percent to 3.3 million barrels per day. This growth profile, 
      along with our current financial strength, supports our priority of 
      continuously growing our dividends.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Watson continued, &#8220;Our 2012 capital program includes spending of nearly 
      $9 billion in the United States, with major new investments in the 
      deepwater Gulf of Mexico, the Marcellus Shale in Pennsylvania and our 
      refinery at Pascagoula, Mississippi. These projects are expected to 
      result in new jobs and new sources of revenues for the communities where 
      we operate. Our investments, both in the United States and elsewhere 
      around the globe, help provide affordable new energy supplies to support 
      a growing economy.&#8221;

      Approximately 87 percent of the 2012 spending program is budgeted for 
      upstream crude oil and natural gas exploration and production projects. 
      Another 11 percent is associated with the company&#8217;s downstream 
      businesses that manufacture, transport and sell gasoline, diesel fuel 
      and other refined products, fuel and lubricant additives, and 
      petrochemicals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Upstream
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Spending of $28.5 billion is planned for exploration and production 
      activities, including major natural gas-related projects. Major capital 
      investments include developments in Australia, the deepwater Gulf of 
      Mexico, Nigeria, Angola and China. Planned capital spending is also 
      directed toward improving crude oil and natural gas recovery and 
      reducing natural field declines of existing producing assets throughout 
      the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are building new legacy positions with major investments in LNG 
      projects and the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Our global LNG investments 
      are estimated to reach peak spending in 2012 and 2013,&#8221; said Vice 
      Chairman George Kirkland. &#8220;In 2014 we expect to begin reaping the 
      benefits of these investments as Gorgon and our deepwater projects ramp 
      up production and begin contributing substantially to cash flow.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Australia, the Gorgon LNG project is entering its third year of 
      construction, with first production scheduled for 2014. The project is 
      approximately one-third complete and has awarded contracts worth over 
      $25 billion. The Wheatstone LNG project was sanctioned in September 2011 
      and is entering its first year of construction. First production is 
      expected in 2016. The project has already awarded $6 billion in 
      contracts. Once online, these two LNG projects are expected to add 
      approximately 350,000 barrels net oil-equivalent production per day. 
      Production from these LNG plants is expected to be sustained at these 
      same levels for many years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the Gulf of Mexico, projects under development include Jack/St. Malo, 
      Big Foot, Tahiti-2 and Tubular Bells. Both the Jack/St. Malo and Big 
      Foot projects are approximately 20 percent complete. First production 
      for both projects is expected in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Upstream spending for major capital projects in other regions includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Global exploration funding is expected to be $3 billion in 2012. This 
      planned spending includes initial appraisal of new acreage captured over 
      the past two years, including Liberia, China and various international 
      shale gas plays. The program also supports continued exploration and 
      appraisal activity in Chevron&#8217;s focus areas of Western Australia, the 
      Gulf of Mexico and western Africa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      About 30 percent of the Upstream capital program is targeted to support 
      currently-producing assets and mitigate natural field decline. This 
      includes further development of recently-acquired acreage in the 
      Marcellus trend in the northeast U.S., the Wolfcamp play in West Texas 
      and the Pattaini Basin offshore Thailand.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Downstream
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Capital spending of $3.6 billion in 2012 is budgeted for downstream 
      operations. Investments include refinery projects geared toward 
      improving returns by increasing energy efficiency and feedstock 
      flexibility, and producing cleaner fuels. Investments also are targeted 
      toward producing base oils at Pascagoula, Mississippi, and expanding 
      Oronite additives production in Singapore.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional investments are expected to be funded by Chevron affiliates. 
      These include the continued upgrading of the Yeosu refining complex in 
      South Korea associated with the company&#8217;s 50 percent-owned GS Caltex 
      affiliate, and additional chemicals projects in the United States and 
      Saudi Arabia associated with the company&#8217;s 50 percent-owned Chevron 
      Phillips Chemical Company LLC.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N) said it has the authority to repurchase more of its shares after spending less money than regulators had allowed on dividends.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The second largest U.S. bank can buy back $950 million in stock and warrants as part of an adjustment to a capital plan approved by the Federal Reserve Board earlier this year, Chief Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said at a Goldman Sachs investor conference in New York on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is allowed to buy back stock right away but "will decide what to do over time," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has repurchased about $8 billion in stock in 2011, the limit outlined by the Fed as part of a stress test completed in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks have been eager to buy back their own shares at depressed prices, but also face regulatory pressure to conserve capital as a cushion against future losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks will undergo another round of Fed stress tests starting in January to determine whether they can increase dividends or buy back more shares. Dimon said he expects the results for his bank will be "fine."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks also face impending international capital rules that could require large "systematically important" banks to attain a Tier 1 common equity ratio -- a measure of capital compared to assets weighted by risk -- of 9.5 percent by the end of 2018.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan could achieve 9.5 percent ahead of schedule, by the end of 2012, if its board decides to do so, Dimon said. He noted there may be a "race to the top" among banks to reach that mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon also provided an update on the bank's fourth-quarter and 2012 outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Total investment banking revenue in the fourth quarter could be down from the third quarter, excluding an accounting adjustment, if December is a weak month, Dimon said. In the third quarter, JPMorgan posted investment banking net income of $1.6 billion on revenue of $6.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a presentation on Tuesday, Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said the bank's global banking and markets unit had seen better sales and trading results in the fourth quarter, compared to a "very weak" third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In consumer banking, JPMorgan expects low interest rates to reduce 2012 net income by about $400 million, Dimon said. The bank expects to add 175 branches next year, down from a previous estimate of about 300, as new regulations crimp debit card and other fees made by banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Rick Rothacker in Charlotte, North Carolina; Additional reporting by David Henry in New York; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SILVER SPRING, Maryland (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc won unanimous expert backing for its Inlyta experimental drug for patients with advanced kidney cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee voted 13-0 on Wednesday that the drug, also called axitinib, had a favorable benefit-risk profile for such patients after initial treatment has failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA, which usually approves products that win support from its advisory panels, is due to make a final decision in the first half of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panelists said the oral drug was at least as safe and effective as previously-approved treatments, such as Nexavar, which is sold by Bayer AG and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also had different side effects than other drugs for the disease, which could be important for patients who cannot tolerate older treatments, said Dr. Wyndham Wilson, chair of the panel and chief of the lymphoma therapeutics section at the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's my take that the toxicity profile is different, there's benefit there, and it's not inferior to currently approved TKIs," Dr. Wilson said, referring to drugs in the same class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have two drugs that are equivalently effective, ... different toxicity profiles can be very useful for the individual," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 61,000 Americans will be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year, and about one in five of them are expected to die from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 20 to 30 percent of these patients have advanced disease at the time of diagnosis, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. DIFFERENCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA staff said Pfizer's kidney cancer drug showed the same degree of liver enzyme elevation and potential for liver failure as some other drugs in its class, but had lower rates of skin related side effects and anemia than Nexavar in a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, in review documents released on Monday, FDA staff expressed concern Inlyta appeared to work better in patients previously treated with cytokines, which are rarely used in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. kidney cancer patients are far more likely to be given Pfizer's Sutent as an initial treatment option rather than cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, in Pfizer's clinical trial, Inlyta slowed down the progression of cancer by two months compared to Nexavar for patients who had already been treated for advanced kidney cancer, or renal cell carcinoma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the findings differed depending on which particular drug patients took beforehand. For patients who initially took Pfizer's Sutent, Inlyta slowed the disease by only 1.4 months, versus 5.6 months in patients previously treated with cytokines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on the data, panel members said Inlyta was not a significant advance over previous treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I voted yes reluctantly," said panel member Dr. Mikkael Sekeres, from the department of hematologic oncology at the Cleveland Clinic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It moves the ball forward for renal cell carcinoma but it certainly didn't score a touchdown; it probably didn't even make a first down," he said of Pfizer's drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inlyta, which inhibits certain receptors that can influence tumor growth and progression of cancer, is one of several new drugs Pfizer is banking on to help replace lost revenue from its top-selling cholesterol fighter, Lipitor, which began facing generic competition last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 1.5 percent at $20.53 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, slightly outperforming the wider Arca Pharmaceutical Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inlyta is awaiting an approval decision in Europe for use in patients who failed to be helped by prior treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is also being tested in another late-stage trial for kidney cancer as both an initial treatment option and in previously treated patients. It is also being tested as a treatment for liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Anna Yukhananov, Editing by Tim Dobbyn, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Repurchase authority already approved by the Fed&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Q4 investment banking revenue to be flat&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 7 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has the
ability to repurchase $950 million of its own shares, under an
authority previously approved by the Federal Reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second largest U.S. bank didn't spend as much as it was

away but "will decide what to do over time," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan repurchased $4.4 billion in shares during the

reduce 2012 net income by about $400 million.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SILVER SPRING, Md., Dec 7 - Pfizer Inc won unanimous expert backing for its Inlyta experimental drug for patients with advanced kidney cancer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A Food and Drug Administration advisory committee voted 13-0 on Wednesday that the drug, also called axitinib, had a favorable benefit-risk profile for such patients after initial treatment has failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA, which usually approves products that win support from its advisory panels, is due to make a final decision in the first half of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Panelists said the oral drug was at least as safe and effective as previously-approved treatments for the disease, such as Nexavar, which is sold by Bayer AG and Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also had different side effects than other drugs for the disease, which could be important for patients who cannot tolerate older treatments, said Dr. Wyndham Wilson, chair of the panel and chief of the lymphoma therapeutics section at the National Cancer Institute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's my take that the toxicity profile is different, there's benefit there, and it's not inferior to currently approved TKIs," Dr. Wilson said, referring to drugs in the same class.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have two drugs that are equivalently effective, ... different toxicity profiles can be very useful for the individual," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 61,000 Americans will be diagnosed with kidney cancer this year, and about one in five of them are expected to die from the disease, according to the American Cancer Society.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FDA staff said Pfizer's kidney cancer drug showed the same degree of liver enzyme elevation and potential for liver failure as some other drugs in its class, but had lower rates of skin related side effects and anemia than Nexavar in a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inlyta, which inhibits certain receptors that can influence tumor growth and progression of cancer, is one of several new drugs Pfizer is banking on to help replace lost revenue from its top-selling cholesterol fighter, Lipitor, which began facing generic competition last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 1 percent at $20.43 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, slightly outperforming the wider Arca Pharmaceutical Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Inlyta is awaiting an approval decision in Europe for use in patients who failed to be helped by prior treatment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug is also being tested in another late-stage trial for kidney cancer as both an initial treatment option and in previously treated patients. It is also being tested as a treatment for liver cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Anna Yukhananov, Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Online sales climbed 15.6 percent in November and are doing well so far in December, as shopping from computers, tablets and mobile phones gain in popularity, according to data released by IBM Benchmark on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The findings from IBM Benchmark, a unit of International Business Machines Corp, come after retailers saw record growth on Cyber Monday, the Monday after Thanksgiving that is a huge U.S. online shopping day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales for the week of November 27 through December 3 rose 10.7 percent from the comparable week of November 28 through December 4, 2010, IBM Benchmark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During that week, mobile traffic to web sites and sales from mobile devices more than doubled. Mobile traffic more than doubled to 11.77 percent from 4.74 percent, while mobile sales rose to 8.25 percent from 3.13 percent, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm expects to see significant growth continue this season, especially during promoted days such as Free Shipping Day on December 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jessica Wohl in Chicago; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Array 
      Networks Inc., (TWO: 3664) a global leader in application, desktop 
      and cloud service delivery, today announced the immediate availability 
      of its Microsoft-approved application delivery and load balancing 
      solutions for Exchange&#8482; 2010. The joint Array and Microsoft&#174; solution 
      delivers compelling economics and value for enterprises and service 
      providers offering Exchange 2010 messaging services. The solution 
      combines Array&#8217;s award-winning APV 
      Series application delivery controllers and SPX 
      Series universal access controllers with Microsoft Exchange 2010 to 
      deliver secure, scalable and highly-available messaging services to any 
      user, anywhere on any device.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Array has worked closely with Microsoft to create a solution that 
      secures, accelerates and optimizes the delivery of Exchange services,&#8221; 
      said Sunil Cherian, VP of Product Marketing at Array Networks. &#8220;In 
      essence, the qualification by Microsoft assures enterprises and service 
      providers that they will gain the greatest value from their 
      mission-critical Exchange investment. The joint solution is now an 
      integral part of Array&#8217;s application delivery architecture and addresses 
      the growing challenge of securing access to email from any user, 
      traditional or highly-mobile, on any device.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Maximum Value and Superior Economics
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Array&#8217;s application delivery controller and universal access controller 
      appliances are purpose-built for simplicity, scale and performance. 
      Enterprises and service providers can leverage these feature-rich 
      appliances to secure and intelligently load balance and optimize 
      Exchange traffic across client access servers (CASs) and datacenters for 
      an improved local and global user experience. In addition, Array&#8217;s 
      purpose-built appliances deliver lower TCO through reducing costs 
      associated with servers, software licenses, bandwidth and energy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our goal is to empower our customers to deliver application services 
      without compromising the user experience, security or 
      return-on-investment. Our joint solution with Microsoft for Exchange 
      2010 is a perfect example of how we are working with application 
      developers to create end-to-end solutions that ensure the performance, 
      availability and security of applications over the Internet,&#8221; said 
      Michael Zhao, CEO of Array Networks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Solution Highlights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Array&#8217;s application delivery controllers and universal access 
      controllers, with their core security, load balancing, SSL offloading 
      and other service optimization capabilities, can now be made an integral 
      part of Exchange deployments by providing:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Intelligent load balancing of Exchange services across multiple servers
      
			
        Service persistence to mobile and non-mobile devices
      
			
        Health-checks for Exchange services to detect failed or overloaded 
        servers and automatically re-route traffic
      
			
        Offloading SSL processing, certificate management, connection 
        management and other non-core Exchange functions from application 
        servers to dedicated appliances
      
			
        Local and global availability of services with seamless redirection of 
        users in the event of server or site failure
      
			
        Secure access to Exchange services from any device with data leakage 
        protection that includes access control, two-factor authentication, 
        integrity checks and cache cleaning
      
			
        Protection of Exchange servers from DDoS attacks; and
      
			
        Scalability from ten to tens-of-thousands concurrent users on a single 
        appliance, with the ability to cluster up to 32 appliances for 
        unlimited scalability

		&lt;p&gt;
      "Diversity is one of Wells Fargo&#8217;s core values and a personal priority 
      of mine,&#8221; said Wells Fargo Chairman and CEO John Stumpf. &#8220;Wells 
      Fargo can&#8217;t be one of the world&#8217;s great companies unless we&#8217;re also 
      recognized as a leader in diversity and inclusion. Jimmie&#8217;s experience 
      in leading award-winning programs and teams will help us realize this 
      goal."

      HMSHost Corporation).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Paschall is the right person at the right time for this critical role,&#8221; 
      added Campbell. &#8220;She knows what it takes to foster a diverse and 
      inclusive culture, and she possesses the change management and 
      interpersonal skills that are required to move organizations forward 
      toward new levels of achievement.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Former Lone Pine and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) executives are aiming to raise $1 billion (640 million pounds) in an Asia-focused hedge fund, three sources said, hoping to break into a very small group of funds of that size in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The plan indicates that more blockbuster fund launches in Asia could follow as investors, despite volatile markets, are willing to risk their money with managers who have track records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eashwar Krishnan, a former analyst at Greenwich-based hedge fund Lone Pine Capital, and Tanvir Ghani, former head of capital introduction for Asia-Pacific at Goldman Sachs Group Inc, are preparing to launch the fund in April, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund will be based in Hong Kong, said the sources who were familiar with the duo's plan, but declined to be named as the matter was not publicly disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ghani, who left Goldman Sachs in November after more than a decade at the Wall Street bank, would be the fund's chief operating officer while Krishnan would lead the fund as chief investment officer, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Well-known managers and traders in Asia are setting up brand new investment firms, lifting the prospects of the nascent Asian hedge fund industry. Tried and tested fund managers expand options for an increasing number of institutional investors looking to raise exposure to the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Major launches in Asia attract a lot of interest because investors looking to invest in the region are generally seeking critical mass in terms of assets under management," said Frederick Ingham, head of hedge fund investments in the Asia-Pacific for money manager Neuberger Berman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These large, high-profile launches help bring attention to the many trading opportunities available to hedge funds throughout Asia and is typical of an industry that is maturing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krishnan could not be reached for comment.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Dec 7 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs cut its
holdings in disgraced camera maker Olympus to a 3.78
percent stake from 6.67 percent, a Japanese government filing
showed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman reduced its stake before Nov. 30, according to the
filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. investment bank had become the second-largest
shareholder in Olympus by boosting its stake to 6.67 percent,
according to a filing issued on Nov. 22. Goldman said at the
time that it bought the shares from clients in the normal course
of business as a market maker, and was not making a strategic
investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Olympus shares, which closed at 869 yen on Nov. 22, rose 18
percent to 1,025 yen on Nov. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the entire board of Olympus signalled its plans
to quit, maybe as early as February, over a $1.7 billion
accounting fraud, and set up an outside committee to advise
whether to sue those responsible for the scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Carbon dioxide emissions from energy sources will rise until 2030, when they will level off as fuels such as natural gas replace dirtier supplies of coal, Exxon Mobil said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That forecast, part of Exxon's annual global outlook that stretches out to 2040, calls for total energy demand to rise by 30 percent over the next three decades, with fossil fuels such as oil, natural gas and coal contributing 80 percent of the supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 90 percent of this fuel demand growth through 2040 will come from China and other developing countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emissions of carbon dioxide, the gas widely blamed for climate change, are already falling in North America, Europe and other developed economies, the company said, and China, the world's largest emitter, is expected to follow the same path eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China's emissions are expected to begin declining after about 2025, ending decades of very large increases associated with rapid economic development and industrial activity," the oil giant said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Electricity demand will be the main growth driver for world energy consumption, jumping 80 percent from 2010 levels, while commercial transportation will also push use of liquid fuels higher, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand from private vehicles, however, would be curbed by a steep increase in fuel efficiency, the company said, largely based on expectations that hybrid cars will make up 40 percent of that market in 2040 versus about 1 percent now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand for natural gas, which has been Exxon's biggest investment focus in recent years, will rise by 60 percent in 2040 from 2010 level, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By 2040, Exxon expects natural gas to account for 30 percent of global electricity demand," William Colton, Exxon's vice president for corporate strategic planning, told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The projected 80 percent increase in electricity usage will be offset somewhat by the efficiency improvements in power generation, which will boost demand for all power-generating fuels by a more modest 45 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coal demand will peak in 2025, and even China, which uses about 50 percent of the world's coal currently, will see its consumption fall by more than 10 percent by 2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Much of that shift away from carbon-intensive coal sources will be driven by the rising costs of carbon dioxide emissions, which Exxon said would likely be near $60 per ton in most developed economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is about six times more expensive than carbon emissions currently cost in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon also remained pessimistic about the growth of renewable energy, forecasting that wind, solar and biofuels will account for only 4 percent of global demand in 2040.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and natural gas will make up 60 percent of the global demand in 2040, up from about 55 percent today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded company, has poured more than $125 billion into oil and gas projects over the past five years largely to tap into shale rocks, oil sands and Arctic regions that were once too difficult to reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing By Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 8 (Reuters) - Puma Energy, a unit of Europe-based
commodities trading giant Trafigura, said on
Thursday it agreed to buy Caribbean region fuel distribution
and storage assets from U.S. oil major Chevron , in a
bid to expand its presence in the region.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Puma will buy Chevron's fuel marketing and aviation
businesses in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands for an
undisclosed sum, the company said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The assets include 192 retail service stations, an aviation
fuel supply business in the Virgin Islands, and storage tanks
in Puerto Rico and St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, whose
total capacity is around 430,000 barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has sought a buyer for the assets since earlier
this year, Puma said, adding that it has plans to expand the
facilities once the deal is approved by regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puma has been building its fuel distribution business in
the Caribbean and Latin America since 2010 with purchases of
storage and fuel distribution from Capeco, or Caribbean
Petroleum Corp, in Puerto Rico and from Exxon Mobil 
throughout Central America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Active in several world regions, Puma in September sold a
20 percent stake of itself to Angolan state oil company
Sonangol. The company told Reuters in September that it is
considering an initial public offering of stock within the next

&lt;p&gt;The formula had been in a vault at the SunTrust Bank in Atlanta for more than 86 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its 125th anniversary, the soft drink company moved the formula to a vault it built at the  World of Coca-Cola, and opened an exhibit called The Vault of the Secret Formula.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the contents of the formula will not be made public at the new location.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola is the top-selling soft drink brand in the United States, and the Atlanta-based company is the world's largest soft drink maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Greg McCune)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co has been sued by Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP, a pension fund for public employees in the Netherlands, over residential mortgage-backed securities it purchased.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fund bought the pools of home loans based on false and misleading statements, according to the lawsuit, filed on Wednesday in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mortgage loans backing the securities were worth much less than had been represented and were taken out by borrowers "who were much less creditworthy than had been represented," the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The securities were collateralized against mortgages that originated or were acquired by JPMorgan Bank, as well as Bear Stearns' mortgage arm, EMC, and Washington Mutual Bank, among others, the lawsuit said. JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loans went into default and delinquency at high rates, and they could not be sold at anywhere near the prices paid, causing losses on the investment, the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan representative did not immediately return a call for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Stichting Pensioenfonds ABP v. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., 653383/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan)&lt;/p&gt;

			Edizione 2012 degli Scenari Energetici della ExxonMobil: l&#8217;efficienza 
      energetica, la crescita economica dei paesi emergenti e il gas naturale 
      ridisegnano la domanda globale al 2040
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Si prevede che, al 2040, il fabbisogno energetico sar&#224; di circa il 30% 
        superiore rispetto al 2010, alimentato dalla crescita demografica e 
        dal raddoppio del PIL a livello mondiale; la domanda nei paesi in via 
        di sviluppo aumenter&#224; di circa il 60%.
      
			
        I combustibili a basso contenuto di carbonio, in particolare il gas 
        naturale, guadagneranno quote di mercato, mentre il carbone 
        raggiunger&#224; il suo picco di massimo consumo e inizier&#224; una fase di 
        declino, per la prima volta nella storia moderna.
      
			
        Al 2040, il gas da scisti e da altre formazioni rocciose non 
        convenzionali rappresenter&#224; il 30% della produzione globale di gas.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nel Rapporto pubblicato oggi, Scenari 
      Energetici al 2040, la Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) sottolinea come la domanda di energia 
      aumenter&#224;, al 2040, alimentata dal raddoppio del prodotto interno lordo 
      a livello mondiale e dalla diffusione del benessere tra la popolazione 
      mondiale che si prevede andr&#224; a crescere fino a raggiungere quasi i 9 
      miliardi di persone. Quest&#8217;anno la ExxonMobil ha esteso al 2040, per la 
      prima volta, le proprie previsioni di lungo termine in campo energetico 
      e i dati emersi indicano diversi andamenti che influenzeranno il modo in 
      cui l&#8217;energia sar&#224; utilizzata nei prossimi decenni.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Secondo gli Scenari, al 2040 la domanda globale di energia sar&#224; 
      superiore di circa il 30% rispetto al 2010, stimolata dalla crescita in 
      aree in via di sviluppo come Cina, India, Africa e altre economie 
      emergenti.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Il petrolio rimarr&#224; il combustibile maggiormente utilizzato, ma la 
      domanda globale di energia sar&#224; ridisegnata da un costante spostamento 
      verso fonti energetiche a pi&#249; basso contenuto di carbonio &#8211; come il gas 
      naturale &#8211; e da sensibili incrementi dell&#8217;efficienza energetica in 
      settori come quello dei trasporti, dove la diffusione dei veicoli 
      ibridi, al 2040, contribuir&#224; a ridurre il consumo medio di carburante 
      delle nuove autovetture a circa 4,7 litri ogni 100 km.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Gli Scenari Energetici illustrano come, grazie 
      all&#8217;innovazione e alla tecnologia, il mondo non ha pi&#249; bisogno di 
      scegliere tra crescita economica e salvaguardia ambientale" ha 
      dichiarato Rex W. Tillerson, Presidente e Amministratore Delegato della 
      Exxon Mobil Corporation. " Mentre i paesi sviluppati mirano a riprendere 
      slancio sotto il profilo economico e la popolazione mondiale aspira a 
      migliorare il proprio tenore di vita, la ExxonMobil continua a investire 
      nelle tecnologie che ci consentono di fornire al mondo, in maniera 
      affidabile ed economicamente sostenibile, l&#8217;energia necessaria per la 
      crescita economica e il progresso umano."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Come nelle precedenti edizioni degli Scenari Energetici, la 
      crescita della domanda di elettricit&#224; &#232; identificata come l&#8217;unico 
      fattore davvero determinante nell&#8217;influenzare i trend energetici. La 
      ExxonMobil prevede un incremento della domanda globale di energia 
      elettrica, al 2040, pari all&#8217;80%, determinato dal miglioramento della 
      qualit&#224; della vita e della situazione economica nonch&#233; dal fatto che i 
      consumatori incrementeranno l&#8217;uso di energia elettrica per impieghi per 
      i quali oggi ricorrono ad altre fonti energetiche quali petrolio, 
      carbone o biomasse. Al 2040, ogni 10 unit&#224; di energia prodotte nel 
      mondo, 4 saranno destinate alla produzione elettrica.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Il mix di combustibili utilizzati per produrre energia elettrica, 
      tuttavia, cambier&#224; sensibilmente con il passaggio dal carbone a fonti a 
      pi&#249; basso contenuto di carbonio quali il gas naturale che, nella 
      produzione elettrica, emette fino al 60% in meno di CO2 
      rispetto al carbone. Al 2040, il 30% dell&#8217;elettricit&#224; a livello mondiale 
      sar&#224; prodotta utilizzando gas naturale, mentre la domanda di carbone 
      toccher&#224; il picco massimo per registrare poi, nel lungo termine, la sua 
      prima flessione nell&#8217;arco della storia moderna.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gli Scenari Energetici sottolineano, inoltre, l&#8217;importanza del 
      ruolo delle nuove tecnologie nell&#8217;approvvigionamento energetico globale, 
      come ad esempio i progressi nelle tecniche di produzione che hanno reso 
      accessibili risorse di gas naturale sufficienti a soddisfare cento anni 
      di domanda negli Stati Uniti. La ExxonMobil stima che, al 2040, il gas 
      naturale da scisti e fonti similiari rappresenter&#224; il 30% della 
      produzione globale di gas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Elaborati da un team di esperti utilizzando un insieme di fonti 
      pubbliche e interne, gli Scenari Energetici costituiscono una 
      guida nella definizione delle strategie globali d&#8217;investimento della 
      ExxonMobil. Molti dei risultati in essi contenuti sono simili a quelli 
      riportati da altre organizzazioni autorevoli, tra cui l&#8217;Agenzia 
      Internazionale per l'Energia. La ExxonMobil pubblica gli Scenari 
      Energetici per contribuire a migliorare la conoscenza delle 
      tematiche energetiche tra le istituzioni e l&#8217;opinione pubblica.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tra i risultati di quest&#8217;anno:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Mentre negli Stati Uniti e in altre economie sviluppate il fabbisogno 
        energetico rimarr&#224; abbastanza costante, la crescita globale della 
        domanda di energia sar&#224; trainata dalla Cina e da altri paesi non 
        facenti parte dell&#8217;Organizzazione per la Cooperazione e lo Sviluppo 
        Economico (OCSE). Si prevede che la domanda energetica dei paesi non 
        OCSE aumenter&#224; di circa il 60% tra il 2010 e il 2040.
      
			
        Si stima una crescita del fabbisogno mondiale di energia pari a circa 
        il 30% tra il 2010 e il 2040, ma tale aumento di circa quattro volte 
        superiore senza i previsti miglioramenti dell&#8217;efficienza. L&#8217;efficienza 
        &#232; il fattore che incide maggiormente nel contenere la crescita media 
        della domanda energetica soltanto all&#8217;1% l&#8217;anno, nonostante un aumento 
        annuo del PIL globale di circa il 3%. Per la stessa ragione, al 2040, 
        la domanda di energia dell&#8217;OCSE rimarr&#224; sostanzialmente invariata 
        nonostante la produzione economica andr&#224; pressoch&#233; a raddoppiare.
      
			
        Nei trasporti, il secondo settore a pi&#249; rapida crescita dopo quello 
        della produzione elettrica, la ExxonMobil prevede che, al 2040, i 
        veicoli ibridi avanzati rappresenteranno il 50% del parco circolante, 
        rispetto all&#8217;attuale 1% circa. Questo andamento, insieme alla 
        riduzione dei consumi di carburante nei veicoli convenzionali, 
        manterr&#224; la domanda energetica per i veicoli privati essenzialmente 
        invariata al 2040, nonostante il numero di veicoli a livello mondiale 
        andr&#224;, invece, a raddoppiare.
      
			
        La domanda energetica del settore dei trasporti commerciali &#8211; camion, 
        aerei, navi e treni &#8211; aumenter&#224; di oltre il 70%, sulla scia della 
        crescita economica, in particolare nei paesi non OCSE.
      
			
        Il fabbisogno di petrolio e di altri combustibili liquidi aumenter&#224; di 
        quasi il 30% e tale incremento sar&#224; legato per lo pi&#249; ai trasporti. 
        Tra le fonti utilizzate per soddisfare la domanda di combustibili 
        liquidi un ruolo sempre crescente sar&#224; rappresentato dai giacimenti in 
        acque profonde, dalle sabbie bituminose, dal tight oil, dai 
        liquidi da gas naturale e dai biocarburanti.
      
			
        Il gas naturale continuer&#224; ad essere la fonte con la crescita pi&#249; 
        veloce e la sua domanda aumenter&#224; di circa il 60% tra il 2010 e il 
        2040. La crescita sar&#224; sostenuta per lo pi&#249; nei paesi non OCSE 
        dell&#8217;area Asia-Pacifico, dove si prevede che il fabbisogno di gas 
        naturale sia destinato a triplicare nel corso dei prossimi 30 anni.
      
			
        Per il breve termine, si prevede un rallentamento della crescita della 
        capacit&#224; di produzione di energia nucleare, ma si stima che la domanda 
        sia destinata quasi a raddoppiare nel periodo preso in esame dagli Scenari 
        Energetici, trainata dall&#8217;obiettivo dei paesi di ridurre le 
        emissioni e diversificare le fonti energetiche.
      
			
        Il ruolo delle rinnovabili aumenter&#224; sensibilmente . Al 2040, oltre il 
        15% dell&#8217;elettricit&#224; prodotta a livello mondiale sar&#224; generata da 
        fonti rinnovabili: solare, eolico, biocarburanti, biomasse, energia 
        geotermica e idroelettrica. Tra queste, l&#8217;energia eolica sar&#224; quella 
        che far&#224; registrare la crescita maggiore, con un incremento di circa 
        l&#8217;8% annuo tra il 2010 e il 2040.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ogni comunit&#224;, ogni giorno ha bisogno di energia affidabile e 
      sostenibile sotto il profilo economico. Il soddisfare questa domanda 
      necessita di una pianificazione di lungo termine, efficace e 
      lungimirante, che richiede ingenti investimenti e anni di lavoro per la 
      costruzione delle infrastrutture necessarie per la produzione e la 
      distribuzione di energia e prodotti chimici. Quest&#8217;impegno richiede 
      anche una costante capacit&#224; di comprendere e gestire un insieme di 
      rischi tecnici, finanziari, geopolitici e ambientali continuamente in 
      evoluzione in un mondo dinamico. Gli Scenari Energetici rappresentano 
      uno strumento essenziale per la ExxonMobil per fornire al mondo 
      l&#8217;energia necessaria per il continuo sviluppo dell&#8217;umanit&#224;.

        La demande en &#233;nergie sera d'environ 30&#160;% sup&#233;rieure en 2040 par 
        rapport &#224; 2010 du fait de la croissance d&#233;mographique et du doublement

      important facteur d'influence sur les orientations &#233;nerg&#233;tiques. 
      ExxonMobil pr&#233;voit que la demande mondiale en &#233;lectricit&#233; augmentera de 
      80&#160;% d'ici 2040, conjointement &#224; l'am&#233;lioration de l'&#233;conomie et du

		&lt;p&gt;
      Parmi les enseignements de cette ann&#233;e&#160;:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Tandis que la demande aux &#201;tats-Unis et dans les autres pays 
        &#233;conomiquement d&#233;velopp&#233;s restera relativement constante, la 
        croissance mondiale de la demande &#233;nerg&#233;tique sera tir&#233;e par la Chine 
        et les autres pays non membres de l'Organisation pour la Coop&#233;ration 
        et le D&#233;veloppement &#201;conomique (OCDE). On pr&#233;voit que la demande en 
        &#233;nergie des pays non-membres de l'OCDE augmentera de presque 60&#160;% 
        entre 2010 et 2040.
      
			
        Tandis que l'on s'attend &#224; ce que la demande mondiale &#233;nerg&#233;tique 
        augmente d'environ 30&#160;% entre 2010 et 2040, la croissance de cette 
        demande serait approximativement quatre fois sup&#233;rieure sans les gains 
        pr&#233;vus d&#8217;efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique. L'efficacit&#233; &#233;nerg&#233;tique est la 
        principale raison pour laquelle la demande en &#233;nergie augmentera de 
        seulement 1&#160;% par an en moyenne, quand le PIB mondial augmente de 3&#160;% 
        par an. C'est &#233;galement la raison pour laquelle la demande &#233;nerg&#233;tique 
        de l'OCDE restera relativement stable jusqu'en 2040, m&#234;me si sa 
        production sera presque multipli&#233;e par deux.
      
			
        Pour le transport, le deuxi&#232;me secteur qui connait la plus forte 
        croissance de la demande derri&#232;re la production d'&#233;lectricit&#233;, 
        ExxonMobil pr&#233;voit que les v&#233;hicules hybrides repr&#233;senteront 50&#160;% des 
        voitures en circulation en 2040, comparativement &#224; 1&#160;% aujourd'hui. 
        Ceci, ajout&#233; &#224; une r&#233;duction de consommation de carburants dans les 
        v&#233;hicules conventionnels, fera que la demande en &#233;nergie pour les 
        voitures particuli&#232;res restera relativement stable jusqu'en 2040, 
        malgr&#233; le quasi doublement du nombre de v&#233;hicules individuels dans le 
        monde.
      
			
        Cependant, la demande &#233;nerg&#233;tique pour les transports de marchandises 
        - par voie routi&#232;re, a&#233;rienne, maritime et ferroviaire - augmentera de 
        plus de 70&#160;%, pouss&#233;e par la croissance &#233;conomique, particuli&#232;rement 
        dans les pays non-membres de l'OCDE.
      
			
        La demande en p&#233;trole et autres carburants liquides augmentera de 
        presque 30&#160;%, et la majeure partie de cette augmentation sera li&#233;e au 
        secteur des transports. Une part grandissante de l'approvisionnement 
        utilis&#233; pour r&#233;pondre &#224; la demande de p&#233;trole liquide proviendra des 
        forages en eaux profondes, des sables bitumineux, des r&#233;servoirs 
        compacts, du gaz naturel liquide et des biocarburants.
      
			
        Le gaz naturel continuera &#224; &#234;tre le combustible ayant la plus forte 
        croissance parmi les combustibles majeurs, et sa demande augmentera 
        d&#8217;environ 60&#160;% entre 2010 et 2040. Cette croissance est 
        particuli&#232;rement forte dans les pays non-membres de l'OCDE en 
        Asie-Pacifique, o&#249; la demande en gaz naturel devrait tripler au cours 
        des 30 prochaines ann&#233;es.
      
			
        Alors que la croissance de la capacit&#233; nucl&#233;aire devrait ralentir &#224; 
        court terme, la demande d&#8217;&#233;nergie nucl&#233;aire devrait presque doubler 
        pendant la p&#233;riode retenue par les Perspectives &#233;nerg&#233;tiques, 
        les nations cherchant &#224; r&#233;duire leurs &#233;missions et &#224; diversifier leurs 
        sources d'&#233;nergie.
      
			
        Les combustibles renouvelables conna&#238;tront une forte croissance. En 
        2040, plus de 15&#160;% de l'&#233;lectricit&#233; mondiale sera g&#233;n&#233;r&#233;e par des 
        &#233;nergies renouvelables, solaire, &#233;olienne, biocarburants, biomasse, 
        g&#233;othermique et hydro&#233;lectrique. Celle qui conna&#238;tra la plus forte 
        croissance sera l'&#233;nergie &#233;olienne qui augmentera d'environ 8&#160;% par an 
        entre 2010 et 2040.

      La demande pour une &#233;nergie fiable et bon march&#233; existe chaque jour, 
      dans chaque communaut&#233;. R&#233;pondre &#224; cette demande exige des pr&#233;visions et

			ExxonMobils Outlook for Energy 2012 ziet effici&#235;ntie, ontwikkeling 
      van de mondiale economische groei en verandering in de vraag naar 
      aardgas tot en met 2040
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        De vraag zal in 2040 ongeveer 30 procent hoger zijn vergeleken met 
        2010, omdat de bevolking groeit en het wereldwijde BNP verdubbelt; de 
        vraag in de ontwikkelingslanden stijgt bijna 60 procent.
      
			
        Brandstoffen die minder koolstofdioxide-intensief zijn, met name 
        aardgas, verhogen hun marktaandeel, terwijl steenkool op zijn 
        hoogtepunt is en voor de eerste maal in de moderne geschiedenis aan 
        een daling begint.
      
			
        Gas van leisteen (schalie) en andere onconventionele rotsformaties zal 
        in 2040 dertig procent uitmaken van de wereldwijde gasproductie.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      De vraag naar energie zal tot en met 2040 stijgen, omdat de wereldwijde 
      economische productie verdubbelt en de welvaart uitbreidt in een wereld 
      waarin de bevolking tot bijna 9 miljard mensen zal groeien, meldt Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) in hun vandaag verschijnende The
				Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040. ExxonMobil heeft hun 
      jaarlijkse langetermijn voorspelling voor de eerste keer uitgebreid tot 
      2040 en zegt dat de Outlook van dit jaar verscheidene trends laat 
      zien die invloed zullen hebben op de manier waarop de wereld in de 
      komende decennia energie gebruikt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      De Outlook voorspelt dat de wereldwijde vraag naar energie in 
      2040 ongeveer 30 procent hoger zal zijn dan in 2010, op geleide van de 
      groei in ontwikkelingsgebieden zoals China, India, Afrika en andere 
      opkomende economie&#235;n.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Terwijl olie de meest gebruikte brandstof zal blijven, zal de totale 
      vraag naar energie een andere vorm krijgen vanwege een voortdurende 
      verschuiving in de richting van energiebronnen die minder 
      koolstofdioxide-intensief zijn - zoals aardgas - en sterke verbeteringen 
      in energie-effici&#235;ntie op gebieden zoals vervoer, waar het toegenomen 
      gebruik van hybride voertuigen zal helpen het gemiddelde 
      brandstofverbruik in nieuwe auto&#8217;s tot 2040 te verlagen tot bijna 50 
      mijl per gallon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The
			Outlook for Energy laat zien dat door de 
      toepassing van vernieuwing en technologie de wereld niet hoeft te kiezen 
      tussen economische groei en milieurentmeesterschap," aldus Rex W. 
      Tillerson, chairman en chief executive officer van Exxon Mobil 
      Corporation. "Omdat de mensen in de ontwikkelde landen hun economisch 
      momentum willen terugkrijgen en omdat iedereen een betere 
      levensstandaard wil voor zichzelf en zijn naasten, zal ExxonMobil 
      doorgaan met investeren in de technologie&#235;n die ons in staat stellen om 
      de betrouwbare, betaalbare energie te leveren die centraal staat in de 
      economische groei en de vooruitgang van de mens."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net als in eerdere uitgaven van The Outlook for Energy, wordt het 
      verhogen van de vraag naar elektriciteit beschouwd als de enige en 
      grootste invloed op de energietrends. ExxonMobil voorspelt dat de 
      wereldwijde vraag naar elektriciteit met 80 procent zal stijgen tot en 
      met 2040 omdat de economie&#235;n en de levensstandaard verbeteren en 
      consumenten van andere bronnen zoals olie, steenkool of biomassa zullen 
      overstappen op elektriciteit. Tot 2040 zullen vier op de 10 
      energie-eenheden die in de wereld worden geproduceerd naar de productie 
      van elektriciteit gaan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      De mix van brandstoffen die wordt gebruikt voor het produceren van 
      elektriciteit zal zeer sterk veranderen, maar omdat landen van steenkool 
      overstappen op bronnen met minder koolstofdioxide zoals aardgas, die tot 
      60 procent minder CO2 uitstoten dan steenkool indien zij 
      worden gebruikt voor het genereren van elektriciteit. Tot 2040 zal 30 
      procent van de elektriciteit in de wereld worden geproduceerd met 
      gebruikmaking van aardgas, terwijl de vraag naar steenkool een piek zal 
      vertonen en vervolgens voor het eerst in de moderne geschiedenis een 
      daling op de lange termijn zal vertonen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Outlook for Energy laat ook de impact van nieuwe 
      technologie&#235;n zien die de wereldwijde energievoorraden uitbreiden, zoals 
      vooruitgang in productietechnieken die in de Verenigde Staten een 
      hoeveelheid aardgas hebben vrijgemaakt die voldoende is voor een eeuw. 
      ExxonMobil schat dat aardgas van schalie en soortgelijke bronnen tot 
      2040 dertig procent van de wereldwijde gasproductie zal uitmaken.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ontwikkeld door een team deskundigen met gebruikmaking van een 
      combinatie van publieke en eigen bronnen, is The Outlook for Energy een 
      leidraad voor ExxonMobils wereldwijde investeringsbeslissingen. Veel van 
      de bevindingen zijn gelijk aan die van andere gezaghebbende organisaties 
      waaronder de International Energy Agency. ExxonMobil publiceert The
			Outlook
			for
			Energy om een breder begrip van de 
      energieproblematiek te stimuleren onder beleidsmakers en het publiek.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tot de bevindingen van dit jaar behoren:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Terwijl de vraag in de Verenigde Staten en andere geheel ontwikkelde 
        economie&#235;n relatief constant blijft, zal de wereldwijde groei van de 
        vraag naar energie worden geleid door China en andere landen die geen 
        deel uitmaken van de Organization for Economical Cooperation and 
        Development (OECD). Voorspeld wordt dat in de niet-OECD-landen de 
        vraag naar energie van 2010 tot 2040 met bijna 60 procent zal stijgen.
      
			
        Terwijl de wereldwijde vraag naar energie van 2010 tot 2040 naar 
        verwachting zal stijgen met ongeveer 30 procent, zal de groei van de 
        vraag ongeveer vier maal die hoeveelheid bedragen zonder voorspelde 
        stijgingen van de effici&#235;ntie. Effici&#235;ntie is de voornaamste reden 
        waarom de vraag naar energie zal stijgen met slechts gemiddeld 
        ongeveer 1 procent per jaar, zelfs als het wereldwijd BNP jaarlijks 
        stijgt met bijna 3 procent. Het is ook de reden waarom de vraag naar 
        energie in de OECD-landen tot en met 2040 relatief onveranderd zal 
        blijven, zelfs als de economische productie bijna verdubbelt.
      
			
        Op het gebied van vervoer, de sector met de op &#233;&#233;n na snelst groeiende 
        vraag achter elektriciteitsopwekking, ziet ExxonMobil dat geavanceerde 
        hybride voertuigen 50 procent uitmaken van de auto&#8217;s waarin mensen in 
        2040 zullen rijden, vergeleken met ongeveer 1 procent nu. Dit, plus de 
        verbeterde brandstofeconomie in conventionele voertuigen, zal ertoe 
        leiden dat de vraag naar energie voor personenauto&#8217;s hoofdzakelijk 
        gelijk blijft tot en met 2040, zelfs als het aantal personenauto&#8217;s in 
        de wereld verdubbelt.
      
			
        De vraag naar energie voor commercieel vervoer -- vrachtwagens, 
        vliegtuigen, schepen en treinen -- zal echter met meer dan 70 procent 
        stijgen als gevolg van economische groei, met name in niet-OECD-landen.
      
			
        De vraag naar olie en andere vloeibare brandstoffen zal met bijna 30 
        procent stijgen en het grootste deel van die stijging zal zijn 
        gekoppeld aan vervoer. Een groeiend aandeel van de voorraden die 
        worden gebruikt om te voldoen aan de vraag naar vloeibare brandstof 
        zal afkomstig zijn uit diep water, oliegebieden, uit laag-permeabel 
        gesteente gewonnen olie, vloeibaar aardgas en biobrandstoffen.
      
			
        Aardgas zal de snelst groeiende belangrijke brandstof blijven en de 
        vraag zal van 2010 naar 2040 met ongeveer 60 procent stijgen, De groei 
        is met name sterk in de niet-OECD-landen in de regio Asia Pacific, 
        waar de vraag naar aardgas naar verwachting de komende 30 jaar zal 
        verdrievoudigen.
      
			
        Terwijl de groei in nucleaire capaciteit naar verwachting op de korte 
        termijn langzamer zal gaan verlopen, is de voorspelling dat de vraag 
        naar kernenergie in de periode van The Outlook for Energy bijna 
        zal verdubbelen, omdat landen op zoek zijn naar lagere uitstoot en 
        diversificatie van energiebronnen.
      
			
        Herbruikbare brandstoffen zullen een sterke groei vertonen. In 2040 
        zal meer dan 15 procent van de elektriciteit in de wereld worden 
        gegenereerd door herbruikbare brandstoffen -- zonne-, wind-, 
        biobrandstof-, biomassa-, geothermische en hydro-elektrische energie. 
        De snelstgroeiende hiervan zal de windenergie zijn; deze zal van 2010 
        tot 2040 stijgen met ongeveer 8 procent per jaar.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      De vraag naar betrouwbare, betaalbare energie is elke dag in elke 
      gemeenschap aan de orde. Om aan deze vraag te kunnen voldoen zijn een 
      vooruitziende blik en effectieve langetermijnplanning nodig, gevolgd 
      door enorme investeringen en jaren werk om de infrastructuur op te 
      bouwen die is vereist voor het produceren en leveren van energie en 
      chemische stoffen. Ook is een voortdurend vermogen nodig om een zich 
      ontwikkelende set technische, financi&#235;le, geopolitieke en milieurisico&#8217;s 
      te begrijpen en te managen in een dynamische wereld. The Outlook for 
      Energy is een essentieel hulpmiddel om ExxonMobil te helpen bij het 
      leveren van de energie die nodig is om de vooruitgang van de mens te 
      kunnen voortzetten.

			Energieprognose von ExxonMobil f&#252;r 2012: Effizienzsteigerungen, 
      Wirtschaftswachstum der Schwellenl&#228;nder und Erdgas ver&#228;ndern die globale 
      Nachfrage bis 2040
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Der Energiebedarf wird infolge des Bev&#246;lkerungswachstums und der 
        Verdopplung des globalen Bruttosozialprodukts im Jahr 2040 etwa 30 
        Prozent h&#246;her sein als im Jahr 2010. In den Schwellenl&#228;ndern ist mit 
        einem Anstieg von nahezu 60 Prozent zu rechnen.
      
			
        Weniger kohlenstoffintensive Kraftstoffe, insbesondere Erdgas, 
        gewinnen Marktanteile, w&#228;hrend die Kohlenutzung ihren H&#246;hepunkt 
        erreichen und erstmals in der modernen Geschichte zur&#252;ckgehen wird.
      
			
        Erdgas aus Schiefer und anderen unkonventionellen Gesteinsformationen 
        wird bis 2040 30 Prozent der globalen Gasproduktion ausmachen.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Der Energiebedarf wird bis zum Jahr 2040 weiter ansteigen, w&#228;hrend sich 
      die globale Wirtschaftsleistung verdoppelt und sich Wohlstand in einer 
      Welt ausbreitet, deren Bev&#246;lkerung auf nahezu neun Milliarden Menschen 
      anw&#228;chst. Davon geht Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) aus in ihrer heute ver&#246;ffentlichten 
      Energieprognose mit dem Titel &#8222; 
      The Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040 &#8220;. In dieserAusgabe ihrer 
      j&#228;hrlichen Langzeitprognose, die erstmals bis 2040 reicht, verweist 
      ExxonMobil auf verschiedene Trends, welche die weltweite Energienutzung 
      in den kommenden Jahrzenten pr&#228;gen werden.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dem Outlook zufolge wird der globale Energiebedarf im Jahr 2040 
      ungef&#228;hr 30 Prozent h&#246;her sein wird als im Jahr 2010, was im 
      Wesentlichen auf das Wachstum von Schwellenm&#228;rkten wie China, Indien, 
      Afrika und anderen aufstrebenden Wirtschaftsr&#228;umen zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren ist.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      W&#228;hrend Erd&#246;l der meistgenutzte Energietr&#228;ger bleiben wird, verlagert 
      sich die Energienachfrage insgesamt in die Richtung weniger 
      kohlenstoffintensiver Alternativen wie beispielsweise Erdgas. Auch 
      weitreichende Verbesserungen der Energieeffizienz tragen zur Reduzierung 
      von CO2 bei: Beispielsweise. im Transportwesen, wo der zunehmende 
      Einsatz von Hybridfahrzeugen den durchschnittlichen Kraftstoffverbrauch 
      von Neufahrzeugen bis zum Jahr 2040 auf nahezu 4,7 Liter pro 100 km 
      senken wird.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222; Der Outlook for Energy veranschaulicht, dass sich die Welt dank 
      Innovationen und Technologien nicht zwischen Wirtschaftswachstum und 
      Umweltschutz entscheiden muss&#8220;, sagte Rex W. Tillerson, der Vorsitzende 
      und CEO der Exxon Mobil Corporation. &#8222;W&#228;hrend die Menschen in 
      entwickelten L&#228;ndern danach streben, ihre Wirtschaft wieder in Gang zu 
      bringen und jeder versucht, den Lebensstandard f&#252;r sich und seine 
      Familie zu verbessern, wird ExxonMobil weiterhin in die Technologien 
      investieren, die es dem Unternehmen erm&#246;glichen, verl&#228;ssliche und 
      kosteng&#252;nstige Energie zu liefern, die Voraussetzung ist f&#252;r 
      Wirtschaftswachstum und menschlichen Fortschritt.&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wie in fr&#252;heren Ausgaben des Outlook for Energy dargelegt, hat 
      der steigende Bedarf an Elektrizit&#228;t den gr&#246;&#223;ten Einfluss auf 
      Energietrends. ExxonMobil erwartet bis zum Jahr 2040 einen 
      80-prozentigen Anstieg der globalen Stromnachfrage, w&#228;hrend sich die 
      Lebensstandards der Menschen und die Wirtschaftsleistung weiter 
      verbessern und die Verbraucher von anderen Energiequellen wie &#214;l, Kohle 
      oder Biomasse auf Elektrizit&#228;t umsteigen. Weltweit werden im Jahr 2040 
      40 Prozent aller produzierten Energieeinheiten f&#252;r die Stromerzeugung 
      eingesetzt werden.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Der Energiemix der Stromerzeugung wird sich jedoch dramatisch ver&#228;ndern, 
      da sich die Nationen zunehmend von der Kohle abwenden und statt dessen 
      weniger kohlenstoffintensive Quellen wie Erdgas bevorzugen. Deren CO2-Aussto&#223; 
      bei der Stromerzeugung ist bis zu 60 Prozent geringer als der von Kohle. 
      Bis zum Jahr 2040 werden 30 Prozent der weltweiten Strommenge mit Erdgas 
      erzeugt, w&#228;hrend die Nachfrage nach Kohle ihren H&#246;chststand erreichen 
      und erstmals in der modernen Geschichte langfristig abnehmen wird.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Der Outlook for Energy zeigt auch die Auswirkungen neuer 
      Technologien, die zur Erh&#246;hung der globalen Reserven f&#252;hren. Dazu 
      geh&#246;ren zum Beispiel Fortschritte bei den Produktionstechniken, die in 
      den USA bereits Erdgas f&#252;r ein ganzes Jahrhundert nutzbar gemacht haben. 
      ExxonMobil sch&#228;tzt, dass der Anteil von Erdgas aus Schiefer und 
      &#228;hnlichen Quellen bis 2040 bei 30 Prozent der globalen Erdgasproduktion 
      liegen wird.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Die
			Prognose Outlook for Energy wurde von einem 
      Expertenteam unter Verwendung &#246;ffentlicher und firmeneigener Quellen 
      erstellt und dient ExxonMobil als Grundlage f&#252;r globale 
      InvestitionsentscheidungenViele Ergebnisse decken sich mit denen anderer 
      angesehener Organisationen, zum Beispiel der Internationalen 
      Energieagentur. ExxonMobil ver&#246;ffentlicht den Outlook for Energy, 
      um Politik und &#214;ffentlichkeit eine realistische Diskussionsgrundlage f&#252;r 
      Energiethemen zu vermitteln.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Zu den diesj&#228;hrigen Erkenntnissen geh&#246;ren:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Der Bedarf in den USA und anderen Industriestaaten bleibt relativ 
        konstant. Der globale Anstieg der Energienachfrage wird von China und 
        anderen L&#228;ndern getrieben, die nicht zur Organisation f&#252;r 
        wirtschaftliche Zusammenarbeit und Entwicklung (OECD) geh&#246;ren. Der 
        Bedarf dieser L&#228;nder wird zwischen 2010 und 2040 voraussichtlich um 
        nahezu 60 Prozent ansteigen.
      
			
        Prognostiziert wird ein globaler Anstieg der Energienachfrage zwischen 
        2010 und 2040 um etwa 30 Prozent. Der Zuwachs w&#228;re ohne die erwarteten 
        Effizienzsteigerungen etwa viermal h&#246;her. Die Effizienzsteigerung ist 
        der wichtigste Grund daf&#252;r, weshalb der Energiebedarf lediglich um 
        durchschnittlich etwa ein Prozent pro Jahr steigen wird, w&#228;hrend sich 
        das globale Bruttosozialprodukt um j&#228;hrlich fast drei Prozent erh&#246;ht. 
        Sie ist zudem der Grund, weshalb die Energienachfrage von OECD-L&#228;ndern 
        bis zum Jahr 2040 relativ unver&#228;ndert bleibt, obwohl sich ihre 
        Wirtschaftsleistung nahezu verdoppelt.
      
			
        Der Transportsektor ist nach der Stromerzeugung der zweitgr&#246;&#223;te 
        Wachstumssektor. ExxonMobil geht davon aus, dass im Jahr 2040 50 
        Prozent aller zugelassenen Autos fortschrittliche Hybridfahrzeuge sein 
        werden, verglichen mit etwa einem Prozent heute. Dies wird in 
        Verbindung mit dem geringeren Kraftstoffverbrauch herk&#246;mmlicher 
        Kraftfahrzeuge dazu f&#252;hren, dass der Energiebedarf f&#252;r Privatfahrzeuge 
        bis 2040 weitegehend unver&#228;ndert bleibt, obwohl sich deren Anzahl 
        weltweit verdoppelt.
      
			
        Der Energiebedarf f&#252;r den gewerblichen Verkehr -- Lastkraftwagen, 
        Flugzeuge, Schiffe und Z&#252;ge -- wird jedoch infolge des 
        Wirtschaftswachstums um &#252;ber 70 Prozent steigen, insbesondere in 
        Nicht-OECD-L&#228;ndern.
      
			
        Der Bedarf an Erd&#246;l und anderen fossilen Energietr&#228;gern wird sich um 
        nahezu 30 Prozent erh&#246;hen. Der Gro&#223;teil dieses Anstiegs stammt aus dem 
        Transportsektor. Dieser Nachfragezuwachs wird in zunehmendem Ma&#223;e mit 
        Tiefseebohrungen, &#214;lsanden, Schiefer&#246;l, Fl&#252;ssiggasen und 
        Biokraftstoffen gedeckt werden.
      
			
        Unter den bedeutenden Energietr&#228;gern bleibt Erdgas der 
        wachstumsst&#228;rkste. Die Gasnachfrage wird zwischen 2010 und 2040 um 
        etwa 60 Prozent zunehmen. Dieser Anstieg ist insbesondere auf die 
        Nicht-OECD-L&#228;nder in der Asien-Pazifik-Region zur&#252;ckzuf&#252;hren, wo sich 
        der Erdgasbedarf im Laufe der n&#228;chsten 30 Jahre voraussichtlich 
        verdreifachen wird.
      
			
        Kurzfristig wird sich der Bau von weiteren Atomkraftwerken 
        verlangsamen. Doch bis 2040 ist anzunehmen, dass sich der Bedarf an 
        Atomenergie fast verdoppelt haben wird, da alle L&#228;nder ihre Emissionen 
        verringern und ihre Energiequellen diversifizieren wollen.
      
			
        Erneuerbare Energien werden ein starkes Wachstum erfahren. Bis zum 
        Jahr 2040 werden &#252;ber 15 Prozent der weltweit genutzten Elektrizit&#228;t 
        aus erneuerbaren Quellen stammen -- Solar- und Windenergie, 
        Biobrennstoffe, Biomasse, Geothermie und Wasserkraft. Das schnellste 
        Wachstum verzeichnet dabei die Windenergie, die von 2010 bis 2040 um 
        etwa acht Prozent pro Jahr zulegen wird.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Der Bedarf an verl&#228;sslicher und kosteng&#252;nstiger Energie besteht Tag f&#252;r 
      Tag in jeder Gesellschaft. Die Deckung dieser Nachfrage erfordert 
      Weitsicht und effektive langfristige Planung, gefolgt von immensen 
      Investitionen und vielen Jahren Arbeit, um die ben&#246;tigte Infrastruktur 
      zur Erzeugung und Lieferung von Energie aufzubauen. Eine weitere 
      Voraussetzung ist die kontinuierliche Erfassung und Analyse der sich 
      ver&#228;ndernden technischen, finanziellen, geopolitischen und &#246;kologischen 
      Risiken innerhalb einer dynamischen Welt. Der Outlook for Energy 
      ist ein unverzichtbares Hilfsmittel f&#252;r ExxonMobil, um die Energie zu 
      liefern, die der andauernde menschliche Fortschritt erfordert.

      La demanda de energ&#237;a aumentar&#225; hasta el 2040 a medida que la producci&#243;n 
      econ&#243;mica mundial se duplica y la prosperidad se expande en un mundo 
      donde la poblaci&#243;n crecer&#225; hasta llegar a cerca de 9 millones de 
      personas, informa Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) en su Perspectivas 
      para la energ&#237;a: una visi&#243;n para el 2040, publicado hoy. Al 
      extender por primera vez su pron&#243;stico anual sobre energ&#237;a en el largo

      a&#241;o varias tendencias que influir&#225;n en c&#243;mo el mundo usar&#225; la energ&#237;a en 
      las pr&#243;ximas d&#233;cadas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Seg&#250;n Perspectivas la demanda de energ&#237;a mundial en el 2040 ser&#225; 
      de aproximadamente un 30 por ciento m&#225;s que en el 2010, impulsada por un 
      crecimiento en las regiones en desarrollo como China, India, &#193;frica y 
      otras econom&#237;as emergentes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mientras que el petr&#243;leo seguir&#225; siendo el combustible m&#225;s utilizado, la 
      demanda mundial de energ&#237;a se transformar&#225; debido a un cambio continuo 
      hacia fuentes de energ&#237;a menos intensivas en carbono &#8211;como el gas 
      natural&#8211; as&#237; como marcadas mejoras en la eficiencia energ&#233;tica en &#225;reas 
      como el transporte, donde un mayor uso de veh&#237;culos h&#237;bridos ayudar&#225; a

      millas por gal&#243;n para el a&#241;o 2040.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Perspectivas para la energ&#237;a demuestra que mediante la 
      aplicaci&#243;n de la innovaci&#243;n y la tecnolog&#237;a, el mundo no tiene por qu&#233; 
      elegir entre el crecimiento econ&#243;mico y la protecci&#243;n del medio 
      ambiente&#8221;, dijo Rex W. Tillerson, presidente y director ejecutivo de 
      Exxon Mobil Corporation. &#8220;A medida que la gente en los pa&#237;ses 
      desarrollados busca recuperar su impulso econ&#243;mico, y como todo el mundo 
      desea mejorar las condiciones de vida para ellos y sus familias,

		&lt;p&gt;
      Al igual que en ediciones anteriores de Perspectivas para la energ&#237;a, 
      la creciente demanda de electricidad se identifica como el factor de 
      mayor influencia sobre las tendencias de la energ&#237;a. Seg&#250;n los 
      pron&#243;sticos de ExxonMobil, la demanda de electricidad mundial aumentar&#225; 
      en un 80 por ciento hasta el 2040 a medida que mejore la econom&#237;a y la 
      calidad de vida, y los consumidores cambien de otras fuentes de energ&#237;a 
      como el petr&#243;leo, el carb&#243;n o la biomasa a la electricidad. En el 2040, 
      cuatro de cada 10 unidades de energ&#237;a producidas en el mundo se usar&#225;n 
      para electricidad.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sin embargo, la mezcla de combustibles utilizada para producir 
      electricidad va a cambiar dr&#225;sticamente a medida que los pa&#237;ses dejen de 
      usar carb&#243;n en favor de fuentes de energ&#237;a bajas en carbono como el gas 
      natural, que emiten hasta un 60 por ciento menos de CO2 que 
      el carb&#243;n cuando se utiliza para la generaci&#243;n de electricidad. En el 
      2040, el 30 por ciento de la electricidad mundial ser&#225; producida a 
      partir de gas natural, mientras que la demanda de carb&#243;n alcanzar&#225; su 
      punto m&#225;ximo y luego experimentar&#225; su primera declinaci&#243;n a largo plazo

        Mientras que la demanda en los Estados Unidos y otras econom&#237;as 
        plenamente desarrolladas se mantiene relativamente constante, el 
        crecimiento de la demanda mundial de energ&#237;a ser&#225; liderado por China y 
        otros pa&#237;ses que no forman parte de la Organizaci&#243;n para la 
        Cooperaci&#243;n y el Desarrollo Econ&#243;mico (OCDE). Se prev&#233; que la demanda 
        energ&#233;tica de pa&#237;ses que no son de la OCDE aumentar&#225; en casi un 60 por 
        ciento entre el 2010 y el 2040.
      
			
        Si bien se espera que la demanda mundial de energ&#237;a aumente en un 30 
        por ciento entre el 2010 y el 2040, la demanda de crecimiento ser&#237;a de 
        aproximadamente cuatro veces esa cantidad sin las ganancias en 
        eficiencia proyectadas. La eficiencia es la raz&#243;n clave por la cual la 
        demanda de energ&#237;a aumentar&#225;, en promedio, en solo un 1 por ciento 
        anual, aun cuando el PIB mundial aumentar&#225; en casi un 3 por ciento por 
        a&#241;o. Tambi&#233;n es la raz&#243;n por la cual la demanda de energ&#237;a de la OCDE 
        se mantendr&#225; relativamente sin cambios hasta el 2040 aun cuando su 
        producci&#243;n econ&#243;mica casi se duplica.
      
			
        En el transporte, el segundo sector de mayor crecimiento en cuanto a 
        la demanda despu&#233;s de la generaci&#243;n de electricidad, ExxonMobil 
        considera que los veh&#237;culos h&#237;bridos de avanzada constituir&#225;n el 50 
        por ciento de los autom&#243;viles en los cuales se desplazar&#225; la gente en 
        el a&#241;o 2040, en comparaci&#243;n con el 1 por ciento en la actualidad. 
        Esto, sumado a un mayor ahorro de combustible en los veh&#237;culos 
        convencionales, har&#225; que la demanda de energ&#237;a para los veh&#237;culos 
        personales permanecer&#225; mayormente estable hasta el 2040 aun cuando el 
        n&#250;mero de veh&#237;culos personales en el mundo se duplica.
      
			
        Sin embargo, la demanda de energ&#237;a para el transporte comercial 
        -camiones, aviones, barcos y trenes- se incrementar&#225; en m&#225;s del 70 por 
        ciento, impulsada por el crecimiento econ&#243;mico, particularmente en los 
        pa&#237;ses que no son de la OCDE.
      
			
        La demanda de petr&#243;leo y otros combustibles l&#237;quidos aumentar&#225; en casi 
        un 30 por ciento, y la mayor parte de este incremento estar&#225; vinculado 
        con el transporte. Habr&#225; una creciente participaci&#243;n de los insumos 
        provenientes de aguas profundas, arenas bituminosas, petr&#243;leo 
        proveniente de formaciones compactas, l&#237;quidos de gas natural y 
        biocombustibles para satisfacer la demanda de combustible l&#237;quido.
      
			
        El gas natural seguir&#225; siendo el principal combustible de mayor 
        crecimiento, y la demanda se incrementar&#225; en un 60 por ciento entre el 
        2010 y el 2040. El crecimiento ser&#225; particularmente pronunciado en los 
        pa&#237;ses que no son de la OCDE de la regi&#243;n del Pac&#237;fico asi&#225;tico, donde 
        se espera que la demanda de gas natural se triplique en los pr&#243;ximos 
        30 a&#241;os.
      
			
        Si bien se prev&#233; que el crecimiento de la capacidad nuclear sufra una 
        desaceleraci&#243;n en el corto plazo, se pronostica que la demanda de la 
        energ&#237;a nuclear casi se duplicar&#225; en el per&#237;odo comprendido en Perspectivas 
        para la energ&#237;a a medida que los pa&#237;ses busquen reducir las 
        emisiones y diversificar las fuentes de energ&#237;a.
      
			
        Habr&#225; un fuerte crecimiento de los combustibles renovables. En el 
        2040, m&#225;s del 15 por ciento de la electricidad mundial se generar&#225; a 
        partir de combustibles renovables: energ&#237;as solar, e&#243;lica, geot&#233;rmica, 
        hidroel&#233;ctrica, biocombustibles y biomasa. La de mayor crecimiento 
        ser&#225; la energ&#237;a e&#243;lica, la que aumentar&#225; en un 8 por ciento por a&#241;o 
        entre el 2010 y el 2040.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Entre as descobertas do ano est&#227;o:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Enquanto a demanda nos Estados Unidos e em outras economias 
        inteiramente desenvolvidas continuar&#225; relativamente constante, o 
        crescimento global por demanda energ&#233;tica ser&#225; conduzido pela China e 
        outros pa&#237;ses que n&#227;o fazem parte da Organiza&#231;&#227;o de Coopera&#231;&#227;o e de 
        Desenvolvimento Econ&#244;mico (OECD). A demanda por energia fora da OECD &#233; 
        projetada em 60% entre 2010 e 2040.
      
			
        Enquanto a demanda energ&#233;tica global deve crescer em cerca 30% entre 
        2010 e 2040, o crescimento da demanda seria de aproximadamente quatro 
        vezes aquele volume, sem ganhos de efici&#234;ncia projetados. Efici&#234;ncia &#233; 
        a principal raz&#227;o para o aumento da demanda energ&#233;tica em apenas 1% 
        por ano em m&#233;dia, mesmo que o PIB global aumente em quase 3% ao ano. &#201; 
        tamb&#233;m a raz&#227;o pela qual a demanda energ&#233;tica da OECD vai continuar 
        relativamente imut&#225;vel at&#233; 2040, mesmo que seu rendimento econ&#244;mico 
        quase dobre.
      
			
        No transporte, o segundo setor de mais r&#225;pido crescimento da demanda 
        por tr&#225;s da gera&#231;&#227;o de eletricidade, a ExxonMobil v&#234; os ve&#237;culos 
        h&#237;bridos avan&#231;ados respondendo por 50% dos carros que as pessoas v&#227;o 
        conduzir em 2040, em compara&#231;&#227;o com os cerca de 1% de hoje. Isto, e a 
        maior economia de combust&#237;vel em ve&#237;culos convencionais, v&#227;o levar a 
        demanda por energia para os ve&#237;culos pessoais a permanecer 
        essencialmente est&#225;vel at&#233; 2040, mesmo que o n&#250;mero de ve&#237;culos 
        pessoais do mundo dobre.
      
			
        No entanto, a demanda energ&#233;tica por transporte comercial &#8211; caminh&#245;es, 
        avi&#245;es, navios e trens &#8211; v&#227;o aumentar em mais de 70%, conduzida pelo 
        crescimento econ&#244;mico, especialmente nas na&#231;&#245;es fora da OECD.
      
			
        A demanda por petr&#243;leo e outros combust&#237;veis l&#237;quidos vai aumentar em 
        quase 30%, e a maior parte deste aumento estar&#225; ligada ao transporte. 
        Uma crescente parcela dos suprimentos usada para atender &#224; demanda por 
        combust&#237;vel l&#237;quido vir&#225; de &#225;guas profundas, areias betuminosas, 
        l&#237;quidos de g&#225;s natural e biocombust&#237;veis.
      
			
        O g&#225;s natural vai continuar a ser o combust&#237;vel de mais r&#225;pido 
        crescimento e a demanda vai aumentar em quase 60% entre 2010 e 2040. O 
        crescimento &#233; especialmente forte nos pa&#237;ses fora da OECD na regi&#227;o da 
        &#193;sia Pac&#237;fico, onde a demanda por g&#225;s natural deve triplicar nos 
        pr&#243;ximos trinta anos.
      
			
        Enquanto o crescimento da capacidade nuclear deve ser reduzido no 
        curto prazo, a demanda por energia nuclear est&#225; projetada para quase 
        dobrar no per&#237;odo do The Outlook for Energy, conforme as na&#231;&#245;es 
        buscam reduzir as emiss&#245;es e diversificar as fontes de energia.
      
			
        Os combust&#237;veis renov&#225;veis t&#234;m forte crescimento. At&#233; 2040, mais de 
        15% da eletricidade do mundo ser&#225; gerada por combust&#237;veis renov&#225;veis &#8211; 
        energia solar, e&#243;lica, biomassa, geot&#233;rmica e hidroel&#233;trica. O 
        crescimento mais r&#225;pido ser&#225; o da energia e&#243;lica, que vai aumentar em 
        cerca de 8% ao ano entre 2010 e 2040.

			ExxonMobil&#8217;s 2012 Outlook for Energy Sees Efficiency, Developing 
      World Economic Growth and Natural Gas Reshaping Global Demand through 
      2040
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Demand to be about 30 percent higher in 2040 versus 2010 as population 
        grows and global GDP doubles; demand in developing nations rises 
        nearly 60 percent.
      
			
        Less-carbon-intensive fuels, particularly natural gas, gain market 
        share, while coal peaks and begins a decline for the first time in 
        modern history.
      
			
        Gas from shale and other unconventional rock formations will account 
        for 30 percent of global gas production by 2040.
      
			
        Demand growth would be more than four times the projected 30 percent 
        without expected gains in efficiency.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand for energy will rise through 2040 as global economic output 
      doubles and prosperity expands across a world where population will grow 
      to nearly 9 billion people, Exxon 
      Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) states in its The
				Outlook for Energy: A View to 2040, issued today. Extending 
      its annual long-term energy forecast to 2040 for the first time, 
      ExxonMobil said this year's Outlook reveals several trends that 
      will influence how the world uses energy over the coming decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Outlook projects that global energy demand in 2040 will be 
      about 30 percent higher than it was in 2010, led by growth in developing 
      regions such as China, India, Africa and other emerging economies.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While oil will remain the most widely used fuel, overall energy demand 
      will be reshaped by a continued shift toward less-carbon-intensive 
      energy sources &#8211; such as natural gas &#8211; as well as steep improvements in 
      energy efficiency in areas like transportation, where the expanded use 
      of hybrid vehicles will help push average new-car fuel economy to nearly 
      50 miles per gallon by 2040.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "The
			Outlook for Energy demonstrates that by applying 
      innovation and technology, the world does not need to choose between 
      economic growth and environmental stewardship," said Rex W. Tillerson, 
      chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation. "As 
      people in developed countries look to regain their economic momentum, 
      and as everyone seeks improved living standards for themselves and their 
      families, ExxonMobil will continue to invest in the technologies that 
      enable us to provide the reliable, affordable energy central to economic 
      growth and human progress."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As in previous editions of The Outlook for Energy, rising demand 
      for electricity is identified as the single largest influence on energy 
      trends. ExxonMobil projects that global electricity demand will rise by 
      80 percent through 2040 as economies and living standards improve, and 
      consumers switch to electricity from other sources such as oil, coal or 
      biomass. By 2040, four out of every 10 units of energy produced in the 
      world will be going toward the production of electricity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The mix of fuels used to produce electricity will change dramatically, 
      however, as nations shift away from coal in favor of lower-carbon 
      sources such as natural gas, which emit up to 60 percent less CO2 
      than coal when used for electricity generation. By 2040, 30 percent of 
      the world's electricity will be produced using natural gas, while demand 
      for coal will peak and experience its first long-term decline in modern 
      history.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Outlook for Energy also reveals the impact of new 
      technologies that are expanding global energy supplies, such as advances 
      in production techniques that have unlocked a century's worth of natural 
      gas across the United States. ExxonMobil estimates that natural 
      gas from shale and similar sources will account for 30 percent of global 
      gas production by 2040.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Developed by a team of experts using a combination of public and 
      proprietary sources, The Outlook for Energy guides ExxonMobil's 
      global investment decisions. Many of its findings are similar to those 
      from other respected organizations, including the International Energy 
      Agency. ExxonMobil publishes The
			Outlook
			for Energy 
      to encourage broader understanding of energy issues among policy makers 
      and the public.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among this year&#8217;s findings:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        While demand in the United States and other fully developed economies 
        will remain relatively constant, global growth in energy demand will 
        be led by China and other countries which are not part of the 
        Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Non OECD 
        energy demand is projected to rise by nearly 60 percent from 2010 to 
        2040.
      
			
        While global energy demand is expected to rise by about 30 percent 
        from 2010 to 2040, demand growth would be approximately four times 
        that amount without projected gains in efficiency. Efficiency is the 
        key reason why energy demand will rise by only about 1 percent a year 
        on average even as global GDP rises by nearly 3 percent a year. It 
        also is the reason why OECD energy demand will remain relatively 
        unchanged through 2040 even as its economic output nearly doubles.
      
			
        In transportation, the second-fastest growing demand sector behind 
        electricity generation, ExxonMobil sees advanced hybrid vehicles 
        accounting for 50 percent of the cars people will drive in 2040, 
        compared to about 1 percent today. This, plus improved fuel economy in 
        conventional vehicles, will cause demand for energy for personal 
        vehicles to remain essentially flat through 2040 even as the number of 
        personal vehicles in the world doubles.
      
			
        However, demand for energy for commercial transportation -- trucks, 
        airplanes, ships and trains -- will rise by more than 70 percent, 
        driven by economic growth, particularly in Non OECD nations.
      
			
        Demand for oil and other liquid fuels will rise by nearly 30 percent, 
        and most of that increase will be linked to transportation. A growing 
        share of the supplies used to meet liquid-fuel demand will come from 
        deepwater, oil sands, tight oil, natural gas liquids and biofuels.
      
			
        Natural gas will continue to be the fastest-growing major fuel, and 
        demand will increase by about 60 percent from 2010 to 2040. Growth is 
        particularly strong in the Non OECD countries in the Asia Pacific 
        region, where demand for natural gas is expected to triple over the 
        next 30 years.
      
			
        While growth in nuclear capacity is expected to slow in the near-term, 
        demand for nuclear power is projected to nearly double over The 
        Outlook for Energy period as nations seek to lower emissions and 
        diversify energy sources.
      
			
        Renewable fuels will see strong growth. By 2040, more than 15 percent 
        of the world's electricity will be generated by renewable fuels -- 
        solar, wind, biofuels, biomass, geothermal and hydroelectric power. 
        The fastest-growing of these will be wind, which will increase by 
        about 8 percent per year from 2010 to 2040.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand for reliable, affordable energy exists every day in every 
      community. Meeting this demand requires foresight and effective 
      long-term planning followed by huge investments and years of work to 
      build the infrastructure required to produce and deliver energy and 
      chemicals. It also takes an ongoing ability to understand and manage an 
      evolving set of technical, financial, geopolitical and environmental 
      risks in a dynamic world. The Outlook for Energy is an essential 
      tool to help ExxonMobil provide the energy needed for continuing human 
      progress.

		&lt;p&gt;
			The Avoca Group Announces Consortium on Quality Management and 
      Oversight Sponsored by Eli Lilly and Pfizer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The 
      Avoca Group, an industry-leading research organization specializing 
      in clinical outsourcing and client service, today announced the 
      formation of the 
      Quality Consortium, a pharmaceutical industry consortium focused on 
      quality management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Avoca Group&#8217;s 2011 
      Report on Quality and CRO Oversight revealed some insightful data 
      regarding industrywide dynamics between sponsors and CROs,&#8221; said 
      Patricia Leuchten, president and CEO of The Avoca Group. &#8220;Through our 
      analysis we identified opportunities to potentially improve outcomes 
      through collaboration in quality management and metrics. The Quality 
      Consortium will effectively share industry best practices and establish 
      new standards.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the direction and guidance of Leuchten and The Avoca Group, the 
      Quality Consortium will bring together lead sponsors Eli 
      Lilly and Pfizer, 
      other pharmaceutical and biotech companies, and leading CROs to create 
      standards for quality management, initially with a focus on quality 
      agreements and metrics. The consortium&#8217;s long-term goal is the 
      development of a new paradigm in the industry&#8217;s approach to quality 
      management and partnering with CROs to ensure high quality and risk 
      mitigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jeff Kasher, Ph.D., vice president and chief operating officer, global 
      clinical development, at Eli Lilly and co-sponsor of the Quality 
      Consortium, said: &#8220;At Eli Lilly, we place a high priority on the success 
      of our CRO partnerships. We are excited about our sponsorship and 
      participation in the Quality Consortium and look forward to the 
      possibility of quality oversight standardization. We believe that by 
      establishing industry standards for quality oversight we can optimize 
      our partnerships with CROs and improve our ability to ensure data 
      integrity and patient safety.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to sponsors Eli Lilly and Pfizer, the consortium continues 
      adding members, including Amgen, Astellas, Biogen Idec, Bristol-Myers 
      Squibb, Cubist, GlaxoSmithKline, Grunenthal and Purdue Pharma. Members 
      will collaborate with industry professionals, share quality management 
      best practices with colleagues and experts, gain specific tools and 
      knowledge that will have immediate impact in enhancing their 
      organizations&#8217; approach to oversight, and identify and proactively 
      address current gaps between pharmaceutical sponsors and CROs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Membership is still available for a limited time to qualifying 
      organizations. The consortium&#8217;s work begins this month and the inaugural 
      Quality Summit to review and share member insights and analyses, 
      sponsored by PharmaNet/i3, is scheduled for May 2012. For membership 
      inquiries or to become part of the consortium, contact Caryn Laermer at 
      609-799-0511 or visit the consortium&#8217;s website.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 8 (Reuters) - Natural gas will replace coal as the
leading fuel for generating electricity in the United States by
2025 due to its easy availability and a drive for
cleaner-burning energy, the Wall Street Journal said, citing the
latest long-term outlook from Exxon Mobil Corp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exxon's study, which is set to be released Thursday,
forecasts that global energy demand will grow about 30 percent
by 2040 as the world population climbs to nine billion from
seven billion, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natural gas will overtake coal as the second-largest fuel
source overall, ranking behind oil and powering everything from
electrical plants to home-heating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to the Exxon report, coal use will continue to
grow through 2025 around the world, primarily in developing
nations such as China and India and the African continent,
because economic growth will be fastest in emerging nations, the
newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon in recent years has bet big on the natural gas
business and had purchased U.S. shale gas producer XTO Energy in
2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon could not immediately be reached for comment by
Reuters outside of regular U.S. business hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 50-50 venture, which is yet to be named, will initially employ about 700 people and be based near Microsoft's headquarters in Redmond, Washington, the companies said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to develop open software systems that would allow multiple healthcare providers to track patients -- for example, allowing a diabetic patient's primary care physician to see how recently he or she has been to the podiatrist to check blood flow to his or her feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of the problem in healthcare is there's so many doctors; there's so much information to bring together. There's not a single place for that," said Michael Simpson, a GE Healthcare executive who will serve as chief executive of the new venture when it begins operations next year. "When you talk about how do you bend the cost curve, it's not about making big monolithic systems; it's about joining systems and aggregating the data together so that people can make better decisions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies, who would not disclose the financial terms of the deal, said they are rolling Microsoft's Amalga, Verence and Expresso systems, as well as GE's eHealth and Qualibria systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE, whose core healthcare business is making medical-imaging devices, has been stepping up its presence in healthcare computer systems in recent years.

      System Transformation
		&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), through its healthcare IT business, 
      and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) today announced plans to create a 
      joint venture aimed at helping healthcare organizations and 
      professionals use real-time, system-wide intelligence to improve 
      healthcare quality and the patient experience. Upon formation, the new 
      company will develop and market an open, interoperable technology 
      platform and innovative clinical applications focused on enabling better 
      population health management to improve outcomes and the overall 
      economics of health and wellness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As healthcare providers and payers around the globe shift from episodic 
      single-patient care to continuous population management, new 
      requirements have emerged for integrated care processes, greater insight 
      and engaging patient experiences. These delivery system reforms, 
      including a shift toward new payment models, require healthcare 
      providers to address gaps and integrate data across silos of care 
      delivery to help enable better care coordination and performance 
      improvement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This new venture will combine Microsoft&#8217;s deep expertise in building 
      platforms and ecosystems with GE Healthcare&#8217;s experience in clinical and 
      administrative workflow solutions, empowering healthcare professionals 
      and organizations with the intelligence and capabilities to respond to 
      the rapidly evolving and complex healthcare landscape.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The complementary nature of GE Healthcare&#8217;s and Microsoft&#8217;s individual 
      expertise will drive new insights, solutions and efficiencies to further 
      advance the two companies&#8217; shared vision of a connected, patient-centric 
      healthcare system, &#8221; said Jeffrey R. Immelt, Chairman and CEO of GE. 
      &#8220;The global healthcare challenges of access, cost and quality of care 
      delivery are creating a new focus on the performance and accountability 
      of healthcare delivery systems &#8211; in every country, at every level of 
      care. This venture will demonstrate what is possible when leading 
      companies with complementary capabilities work together to meet a common 
      goal.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new company will deliver a distinctive, open platform that will give 
      healthcare providers and independent software vendors the ability to 
      develop a new generation of clinical applications. The venture will 
      develop healthcare applications on the platform using in-house 
      developers and the platform will connect with a wide range of healthcare 
      IT products, including those from GE Healthcare IT and other vendors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;High quality affordable healthcare is one of the biggest challenges 
      facing every nation, but it&#8217;s also an area where technology can make a 
      huge difference,&#8221; said Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft. &#8220;Combining 
      Microsoft&#8217;s open, interoperable health platforms and software expertise 
      with GE&#8217;s experience and healthcare solutions will create exciting 
      opportunities for patients and healthcare providers alike. Working 
      together, GE and Microsoft can help make healthcare systems more 
      intelligent and cost efficient while improving patient care.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The two parent companies bring complementary expertise to this new 
      venture and will contribute intellectual property, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Microsoft Amalga, an enterprise health intelligence platform
      
			
        Microsoft Vergence, a single sign-on and context management solution
      
			
        Microsoft expreSSO, an enterprise single sign-on solution
      
			
        GE Healthcare eHealth, a Health Information Exchange
      
			
        GE Healthcare Qualibria, a clinical knowledge application environment 
        being developed in cooperation with Intermountain Healthcare (Salt 
        Lake City, Utah) and Mayo Clinic
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The long-term vision of the venture is to create new value by offering a 
      healthcare performance management suite that includes many of these 
      products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the new joint venture, GE Healthcare and Microsoft will 
      each maintain a strong presence in the healthcare IT industry, as both 
      parent organizations will continue to sell other products and services 
      to healthcare organizations around the globe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Improving the quality of healthcare through innovative collaboration is 
      a goal that we share with GE Healthcare and Microsoft. Working together 
      with others to identify new ways to improve health outcomes and drive 
      down cost is a hallmark of our patient-care philosophy,&#8221; said C. Michel 
      Harper, M.D., Executive Dean for Practice, Mayo Clinic. &#8220;We&#8217;re pleased 
      to see healthcare IT companies embrace this same idea and come together 
      in new ways. We look forward to seeing the progress this new endeavor 
      will bring in medicine.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Intermountain Healthcare and GE have a strong history and partnership 
      in developing and advancing transformational healthcare information 
      technologies," stated Charles S. Sorenson, MD, president and CEO of 
      Intermountain Healthcare. "Our common vision is driving powerful 
      advancements in healthcare and improving the clinical work process by 
      making real-time information available at the point of care. We look 
      forward to continuing our efforts to further these principles, achieving 
      our combined objectives, and putting these important technologies into 
      practice."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new company&#8217;s products and services will provide the information and 
      insight required to help address many critical problems in the 
      healthcare system today, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Healthcare Associated Infections &#8211; In the US alone, an estimated 1.7 
      million healthcare associated infections (HAI) occur annually, resulting 
      in $35 billion in additional healthcare costs1
			,2 
      and the loss of nearly 100,000 lives3 . By pulling together 
      data from disparate IT systems, identifying those patients most at risk 
      for a given HAI, and surfacing guidelines and protocols within provider 
      workflow, the solutions will enable healthcare organizations to more 
      effectively deploy their resources and deliver better care at lower 
      costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chronic Disease Management &#8211; According to the Centers for Disease 
      Control, about 133 million Americans (nearly half of all adults) live 
      with at least one chronic illness
			and most chronic diseases 
      require a lifetime of ongoing care.4 To help patients and 
      their physicians work together more efficiently to manage chronic 
      conditions, the platform and applications will support the sharing of 
      data from at-home medical devices (such as blood pressure cuffs, scales, 
      glucometers) with caregivers to facilitate better tracking of chronic 
      conditions, coordination of treatment schedules, management of 
      medication regimens and timely interventions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new venture complements the existing offerings from both parent 
      companies and is expected to yield job growth in its first five years of 
      existence. It will operate globally, offering interoperability platforms 
      and application solutions targeting both healthcare providers and 
      payers. Michael J. Simpson, vice president and general manager at GE 
      Healthcare IT, will serve as the company&#8217;s CEO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new company, which has yet to be named, will be headquartered near 
      the Microsoft campus in Redmond, Wash., with significant presence in 
      Salt Lake City, Utah and additional cities around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Launch of the new joint venture is subject to customary conditions, 
      including regulatory approvals, and is expected in the first half of 
      2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) disclosed an agreement on Thursday to sell more than 70 million shares of the world's largest retailer by a firm controlled by members of the founding Walton family.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wal-Mart agreed with Walton Enterprises LLC, controlled by S. Robson Walton, Alice L. Walton, Jim C. Walton and the John T. Walton Estate Trust, to register for sale 70,615,608 shares of company stock. That represents about two percent of Wal-Mart's outstanding shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 70.6 million shares were registered on behalf of several Walton charitable trusts. The stock will be re-sold by these trusts periodically through the end of 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The descendants of Wal-Mart Founder Sam Walton currently own about 49 percent of the company. These sales will reduce that stake by about two percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Wal-Mart is in the midst of share buyback program, so it's not clear what portion of the company the Waltons will end up owning after the share sales are completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walton Enterprises, the selling shareholder, agreed to reimburse Wal-Mart for all expenses related to the share offer and sale, the company noted in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alistair Barr, editing by Bernard Orr and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's biggest drugmaker, named Chief Executive Ian Read to the additional post of chairman and authorized buying back company stock for up to $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Read succeeds George Lorch, who will become lead independent director of Pfizer's board. The appointment is effective immediately. The company, whose best-selling Lipitor cholesterol fighter lost U.S. patent protection on November 30, also raised its quarterly dividend by 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As of November 1, Pfizer bought $6.5 billion in company stock this year, or 332 million shares, toward a goal of buying back $7 billion to $9 billion worth of shares during the full year. The new stock repurchases will be in addition to the funds left from the earlier repurchase program, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it expects to repurchase about $5 billion of its common stock in 2012. It said the remaining amounts would be available for stock repurchases in 2013 and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also announced the election of two new directors to its board: Marc Tessier-Lavigne, president of Rockefeller University in New York and former chief scientific officer at Genentech, and Helen Hobbs, a professor at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer raised its first-quarter dividend to 22 cents per share, from 20 cents per share in each quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is relying heavily on share buybacks and dividends to retain investors and attract new ones as U.S. sales of Lipitor continue to plunge with the arrival of cheaper generic forms of the $10 billion-a-year drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors remain anxious about whether growing sales of other Pfizer drugs and launches of new medicines will adequately offset lost sales of Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The dividend increase and new share repurchase program are a testament to our continued commitment to enhancing shareholder value and our continued confidence in the business," Read said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said the size of the dividend increase and the new authorization for stock buybacks were roughly in line with his expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schott, citing data from IMS Health, said generics represented 14.6 percent of the overall U.S. Lipitor market in their first week after reaching U.S. drugstores. He predicted the copycats will continue gaining ground and capture a 60 percent market share within the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares closed 0.8 percent lower at $20.39 on the New York Stock Exchange on Monday, performing slightly better than the 1 percent fall in the Arca Pharmaceutical Index .DRG.

&lt;p&gt;There was a very interesting paragraph near the end of Burford Capitals announcement Monday that it has acquired a British litigation insurance provider. Burford, you may recall, is the litigation-finance company that in November 2010 made a controversial $4 million investment in the Ecuadorean litigation accusing Chevron of despoiling the Lago Agrio region of the Amazonian rainforest. Burford put up the money to pay the plaintiffs new lawyers at Patton Boggs after Chevrons counsel at Gibson, Dunn  Crutcher succeeded in driving their longtime lawyer, Steven Donziger, out of the litigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Burfords investment  along with money from other, less conventional litigation funders  kept the Ecuadoreans case alive through a megabillions Ecuadorean court judgment against Chevron and into appellate review of the award. It has also permitted the Ecuadorean plaintiffs to battle Chevrons efforts to block enforcement of the judgment through U.S. courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But according to Mondays press release, Burford is not putting any more capital into the Chevron case, despite a maximum financing commitment of $15 million. Further developments have led Burford to conclude that no further financing will be provided and thus decide to reduce the commitment level in the special situations portfolio accordingly, the release said. Burford also disclosed that it hedged its initial $4 million investment by selling a corresponding interest in the case to a third party in December 2010. So at this point, according to Burford, it has no remaining exposure in the Chevron litigation, only upside potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;James Tyrrell Jr. of Patton Boggs told me that Burford decided to distance itself from the case after Chevron made it clear that there would be repercussions if [Burford] continued funding, he said. Chevron dealt with them directly. (Burford principal Christopher Bogart didnt respond to my email request for comment.) According to Tyrrell, Burford sold the hedge against its initial $4 million investment to a corporate entity. He said Burfords decision not to up its investment doesnt mean the litigation funder has developed doubts about the plaintiffs case, but rather is a sign that Chevron has intimidated funders. (As Leigh Jones of Reuters has reported, Patton Boggs made the same assertions in two suits against Gibson Dunn that have been dismissed; Tyrrell said the firm is appealing the dismissals.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Funding for the plaintiffs case has become a big issue in the most recent briefing in the 18-year (and counting) litigation. In November, two months after the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit lifted an injunction barring the Ecuadoreans from acting to enforce the foreign courts judgment, Chevron returned to the trial judge who originally entered the injunction, U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan of Manhattan federal court, with a new request. Gibson Dunn asked Kaplan for a prejudgment attachment of any award against it by the Ecuadorean court, citing its interest in its own pending racketeering suit against some of the plaintiffs and some of their former lawyers and experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a 44-page brief that details the plaintiffs funding arrangements, Chevron argued that the Ecuadoreans are selling interests in what the oil company calls a corrupt judgment because thats their only asset. If they disperse their judgment to overseas funders, Chevron asserted, Chevron wont be able to collect whatever award it obtains in the RICO suit. The brief disclosed that in addition to $4 million from a Cayman-based Burford subsidiary, the Ecuadoreans have received $4.25 million from Torvia Limited, a Gibraltar company owned by online-poker billionaire Russell DeLeon. According to Chevron, several other funders have invested smaller amounts in the Ecuadoreans case, ranging from $150,000 from an individual investor to $1 million from a U.S. entity called the New Orleans Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ecuadoreans responded to Chevrons latest sally not in Kaplans courtroom but at the Second Circuit. In an appellate brief filed this weekend, Patton Boggs argued that Chevrons attachment request was simply an alternative route to the injunction the appeals court lifted in September. The firm asked the appeals court to extend its stay on one piece of Chevrons countersuit against the Ecuadoreans to halt the oil companys racketeering claims as well. The TRO and attachment that Chevron seeks would effectively restore the portion of the vacated preliminary injunction that this court apparently considered to be most objectionable of all  barring the Ecuadorean plaintiffs from funding their cause, the brief said. They would prevent the Ecuadorean plaintiffs from being able to fund the preparation and analysis of any future recognition or enforcement actions. Perversely, they would also prevent the Ecuadorean plaintiffs from funding the defense against Chevrons racketeering allegations in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Second Circuit still hasnt issued an order explaining its decision in September to lift the injunction, so Im not sure of the basis for Patton Boggss assertion that the appeals court was more deeply concerned about the Ecuadoreans ability to fund the litigation than, say, respect for foreign courts. Certainly Patton Boggs and its clients are concerned with funding this case to a conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I sent emails requesting comment to a Chevron spokesman and Chevron counsel Randy Mastro of Gibson Dunn but didnt hear back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For more of my posts, please go to Thomson Reuters News  Insight&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow me on Twitter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said it struck a deal to acquire a mutual fund specializing in dividend-paying stocks, citing investor demand for income-generating strategies to sustain them in turbulent, no-growth markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management will buy Dividend Growth Advisors LLC's $153 million Rising Dividend Growth Fund ICRDX.O for an undisclosed sum. It is the second acquisition announced this year by the division, which historically has preferred to build up its business internally,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the acquisition, Goldman will now offer its first dividend-growth stock fund, an indication of growing customer demand for safety and income over risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment bank and trading giant intends to re-brand the fund as Goldman Sachs Rising Dividend Growth Fund. DGA executives will continue to manage the portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is subject to approval by the fund's shareholders, who will vote in the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to see significant client demand for equity income products," James McNamara, president of Goldman Sachs Funds, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DGA's managers invest in companies that have paid dividends at an increasing rate, averaging 10 percent a year, for at least 10 years. The price of the fund's shares is up 1.2 percent this year, but it pays a yield of 1.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Ridgeland, South Carolina-based firm managed $750 million as of October 31, including the $153 million dividend-only fund. DGA will continue to manage money and serve as sub-adviser to the fund it is selling to Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipper said the fund's performance, for the past five years, ranked seventh out of 205 similar funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last decade has generated little in terms of stock price growth, which makes dividends all the more important in generating higher total returns. Razor-thin interest rates, meanwhile, have made high-yielding stocks attractive relative to Treasuries and other bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While U.S. fund investors overall have withdrawn a net $73.6 billion from domestic stock funds this year, equity-income funds focused on dividend-paying stocks had net inflows of $19 billion, according to Lipper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Asset Management managed $821 billion of mutual funds, hedge funds and other assets at the end of September. It manages $190 billion in mutual funds sold through third-party brokerages and investment advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The division has announced four acquisitions in the past eight years, most recently its agreement in March to buy India's Benchmark Asset Management Co, an exchange-traded fund provider with $700 million under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also purchased 26 AXA Enterprise Funds in 2007 from French insurance giant AXA (AXAF.PA), and in 2006 it bought $3 billion of investment funds from insurer Allmerica Financial, now known as Hanover Insurance Group (THG.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And in 2003, Goldman acquired a $6 billion U.S. money manager, Ayco Company LP, for its private wealth management business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;MILAN Dec 12 (Reuters) - Fondiaria-SAI SpA, Italy's
largest motor insurer, named U.S. bank Goldman Sachs on
Monday to advise on efforts to boost its weak capital base as
worries over fresh fund-raising by the insurer weighed on its
shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Italy's Mediobanca, a key creditor of
Fondiaria, and UniCredit, which owns 6 percent of
Fondiaria, urged a rights issue of up to 600 million euros ($793
million), sources close to the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts believe that Fondiaria-SAI's solvency margin -- a
measure of an insurer's capital -- has fallen close to the
regulatory minimum of 100 percent, from 111 percent on Nov. 1,
due to investment writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement on Monday, Fondiaria-SAI said its board
examined possible operations to boost its solvency margin and
gave top management the task of deepening the study of possible
initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In order to give the process maximum effectiveness and
timeliness, the board has decided to have the assistance of a
primary independent financial adviser, singling out Goldman
Sachs" for the role, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Studio Carbonetti was named legal adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fondiaria shares closed down 9 percent at an historic low.
The STOXX Europe 600 insurance index lost 4.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brokers said a newspaper report on a possible bond issued by
Fondiaria but payable in shares in unit Milano Assicurazioni
 was depressing the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Various options to get Fondiaria's solvency margin up to its
targeted 120 percent are being studied, including a spin-off of
its strategic equity stakes, such as in rival Generali 
and Italy's biggest bank UniCredit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few days, newspaper reports have said Italian
regulator ISVAP does not favour a spin-off vehicle for the
stakes in which Credit Suisse would take 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The insurer made no comment on the spin-off on Monday but
said top management would look at structural measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vehicle company was seen adding around 10 percentage
points to Fondiaria-SAI's solvency margin by a source close to
the company. Analysts expect a smaller figure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impact of Fondiaria-SAI's 450 million euros capital
increase in July on its solvency margin has been wiped out by
the equity market falls this autumn.&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The board of directors of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today declared a 
      22-cent first-quarter 2012 dividend on the company&#8217;s common stock, 
      payable March 6, 2012, to shareholders of record at the close of 
      business on February 3, 2012. Pfizer increased the dividend by 10 
      percent, to 22 cents from 20 cents per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first-quarter 2012 cash dividend will be the 293rd 
      consecutive quarterly dividend paid by Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The board of directors also authorized a new share repurchase program 
      for up to $10 billion in addition to the amount remaining under the 
      current repurchase program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The dividend increase and new share repurchase program are a testament 
      to our continued commitment to enhancing shareholder value and to our 
      continued confidence in the business,&#8221; stated Ian Read, Pfizer president 
      and chief executive officer. &#8220;While the dividend level remains a 
      decision of the board, we continue to target a dividend payout ratio of 
      approximately 40 percent by the end of 2013. In addition, we currently 
      expect to repurchase approximately $5 billion of our common stock in 
      2012, with the remaining authorized amount available in 2013 and beyond.&#8221;

exploited a previously unknown bug in its Windows operating
system to infect computers with the Duqu virus, which some
security experts say could be the next big cyber threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are working diligently to address this issue and will
release a security update for customers," Microsoft said on&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of Duqu surfaced in October when security software
maker Symantec Corp said that a research lab with
international connections had alerted it to a mysterious
computer virus that "appeared to be very similar to Stuxnet," a
piece of malicious software believed to have wreaked havoc on
Iran's nuclear program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Government and private investigators around the world are
racing to unlock the secret of Duqu, with early analysis
suggesting that it was developed by sophisticated hackers to
help lay the groundwork for attacks on critical infrastructure
such as power plants, oil refineries and pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Details on how Duqu got onto infected machines emerged for
the first time on Tuesday as Microsoft disclosed its link to
the infection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Symantec researchers said they believe hackers
sent the virus to targeted victims via emails with tainted
Microsoft Word documents attached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If a recipient opened the Word document and infected the PC,
the attacker could take control of the machine and reach into
an organization's network to propagate itself and hunt for
data, Symantec researcher Kevin Haley told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said some of the source code used in Duqu was also used
in Stuxnet, a cyber weapon believed to have crippled
centrifuges that Iran uses to enrich uranium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That suggests that the attackers behind Stuxnet either gave
that code to the developers of Duqu, allowed it to be stolen,
or are the same people who built Duqu, Haley said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe it is the latter," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

			GameStop Selects Veeam as Ultimate Player to Monitor Virtual 
      Environment in Microsoft System Center
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GameStop Corp., the world&#8217;s largest multichannel video game retailer, 
      has chosen the Veeam 
      nworks Management Pack&#8482; (MP) for VMware to monitor and manage its 
      virtual environment through Microsoft System Center. Already nworks MP 
      has proven to accelerate the progression of tracking root cause 
      problems. As the holiday season swings into full gear, maximizing 
      availability and performance of its e-commerce sites and 45,000 
      employees worldwide is a top priority for GameStop, and the nworks MP 
      will help them to meet this objective.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The nworks MP provides scalable, fault-tolerant and agentless VMware 
      monitoring and management directly in Microsoft System Center, 
      giving GameStop a complete view of its virtual and physical environments 
      from the Operations Manager console. The solution enables all Operations 
      Manager functionality for all VMware components and includes a detailed 
      health model with hundreds of metrics and events, as well as a 
      comprehensive knowledge base that serves as a VMware &#8220;expert in a box.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      End-to-end visibility and granular performance data from the nworks MP 
      help GameStop identify the source of potential problems much faster than 
      its previous monitoring process. Before the Veeam solution was 
      implemented, it could take several hours to discover the root cause of a 
      VMware problem. Today, VMware problem MTTR (Mean Time To Resolution) has 
      substantially decreased.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our Operations team had limited visibility into the virtual environment 
      before we began using the nworks MP,&#8221; said Albert Uy, IT Engineering &#8211; 
      APM Manager for GameStop. &#8220;Now we get the specific details we need to 
      proactively troubleshoot issues before they become problems and affect 
      our business. We chose Veeam after testing several other products on the 
      market and discovering it was the only one to identify all the issues we 
      created for our test plan. For example, Veeam discovered all six, while 
      other products discovered two to four. Identifying only half the 
      problems is not acceptable in an IT environment where hundreds of 
      virtual machines run essential applications such as Microsoft SQL 
      Server, Exchange and web servers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The nworks MP provides continuous monitoring of the most 
      mission-critical virtual environments, and the success GameStop has 
      realized after two months is a testament to this fact,&#8221; said Alec King, 
      Director of Product Management for Veeam Software. &#8220;It&#8217;s a scalable, 
      reliable and mature solution that has been proven in deployments 
      worldwide, allowing companies such as GameStop to tune their IT 
      infrastructures and maximize performance and availability.&#8221;

			About ZELTIQ Aesthetics &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	We are a medical technology company focused on developing and commercializing products utilizing our proprietary controlled-cooling technology platform. Our first commercial product, the CoolSculpting System, is designed to selectively reduce stubborn fat bulges that may not respond to diet or exercise. CoolSculpting is based on the scientific principle that fat cells are more sensitive to cold than the overlying skin and surrounding tissues. CoolSculpting utilizes our patented technology of precisely controlled cooling to reduce the temperature of fat cells in the treated area, which is intended to cause fat cell elimination through a natural biological process known as apoptosis, without causing scar tissue or damage to the skin, nerves, or surrounding tissues. We developed CoolSculpting to safely, noticeably, and measurably reduce the fat layer within a treated fat bulge without requiring the patient to diet or exercise.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Josh Brumm

&lt;p&gt;By Quentin Webb
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan may soon rank among Germany&#8217;s top cable-TV broadcasters. The U.S. investment bank committed to be a back-up buyer if regulators stop Liberty Global acquiring number three cable firm, Kabel Baden-Wuerttemberg. But if JPMorgan finds itself on the hook, that won&#8217;t automatically be the death knell for these unusual agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm made the commitment in March before the euro zone crisis intensified. Its position now appears awkward. The Federal Cartel Office must decide by Dec. 15 whether Liberty, run by media tycoon John Malone, can combine KabelBW with the number two in German cable, Unitymedia. The watchdog worries the deal could disadvantage television stations, which pay to transmit programmes, and housing associations, which buy cable for whole apartment blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberty has offered some remedies. But if these don&#8217;t suffice, JPMorgan has to shell out 910 million euros to buy KabelBW from EQT, the Swedish buyout firm it advised originally. Then it would have to re-auction the company. Taking on illiquid, leveraged buyout equity is the last thing a bank should want to do right now. But it&#8217;s not hard to see why JPMorgan agreed to help its client in this way. Its balance sheet wasn&#8217;t shot to pieces in the crisis, and it has obtained some safeguards. Liberty would help fund the purchase and has indemnified JPM against loss on any re-sale. What&#8217;s more, JPMorgan wouldn&#8217;t actually own KabelBW until early 2012 and would then class it as an asset held for sale. Effectively, JPM&#8217;s role is purely as a legal owner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, a new KabelBW auction shouldn&#8217;t be hard. Private equity loves cable&#8217;s cashflows, and KabelBW is on a tear: EBITDA leapt 15 percent in the year to end-September. Former suitors like CVC would probably re-bid. A buyer could keep in place KabelBW&#8217;s capital structure, with its keenly priced junk bonds issued in March &#8211; financing impossible to obtain in today&#8217;s crisis-ravaged markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Liberty has done similar things before, getting banks to &#8220;warehouse&#8221; a Czech MA target before regulatory approval. Such devices resolve a common MA dilemma: the best fit between buyer and seller can lead to both the highest offer price, and the biggest risk regulators say no. Assuming JPM escapes a prolonged tangle, the &#8220;backstop&#8221; may not stop here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Hypermarcas (HYPE3.SA), the largest Brazilian
maker of disposable consumer goods, could reverse part of their
61 percent tumble this year if management successfully manages
to rapidly integrate the 20-plus acquisitions that the company
made in the past years, Goldman Sachs Group analyst Irma Sgarz
said in a report on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We believe that executing on the challenge of integrating
its core activities will be the main driver for shares," she
said. Sgarz, who has a "neutral" rating on the stock, said the
company's sale of steel wool and food brands this week are
"positive from a management focus and a deleveraging
perspective."

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By Denny Thomas and Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Dec 12 (Reuters) - The Goldman Sachs Group
Inc banker who was co-head of the firm's Asia investment
banking operation for six years is retiring, according to an
internal memo obtained by Reuters on Monday, the second senior
Asia banker to depart Goldman in the last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Machin, whose most recent title was Asia-Pacific
ex-Japan vice chairman, is retiring from the firm after 20
years, the memo said. Machin spent the past few years based in
Beijing, where he was closely involved with the bank's joint
venture Gao Hua Securities. Machin serves on the board of Gao
Hua.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machin relocated to Beijing in March 2009, at a time when
Goldman was pushing to improve the Gao Hua securities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his move to mainland China from Hong Kong,
Machin was Goldman's co-head of Asia Investment Banking,
ex-Japan, with Ravi Sinha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinha retired from the bank in June 2010, and was replaced
by Goldman's Southeast Asia Chairman, David Ryan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Ryan became the bank's sole president in the
region when co-head Yusuf Alireza retired after 19 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Machin joined Goldman in 1991 and moved to Asia three years
later, becoming partner in 2002.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bloomberg was first to report Machin's departure. A Goldman
Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong confirmed the content of the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities is a joint venture between
Goldman Sachs and Beijing Gao Hua Securities, offering
investment banking services to domestic mainland China clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing Gao Hua Securities is a domestic Chinese securities

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Charlie Sheen was fired from his starring role on TV sitcom "Two and A Half Men" because he was so addicted to cocaine that program makers feared he might die, or cause someone else to die, producer Chuck Lorre said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorre, co-creator of the most-watched comedy on U.S. television, broke his silence about Sheen's meltdown and the decision to shutter the show down earlier this year in an interview with TV Guide Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheen, the highest paid actor on U.S. television at the time, was fired in March following weeks of drug-fueled partying, a half-hearted attempt at rehab and a series of wild public rants against Lorre and producers of the CBS network show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorre said program makers Warner Bros and CBS "chose to make a moral decision as opposed to a financial one. This was not a game. This was drug addiction writ large. This was big-time cocaine, and in his own words, an 'epic drug run' that could have ended with either his death or someone else's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorre said that he and others on the show had tried to intervene for months with Sheen, without success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was so afraid my friend was going to die. When we would shoot a show on a Friday night, there was always that 'I'll see you Monday. I hope.' The holidays were the worst, because those long stretches of time were the ones we feared the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't want to be writing a sitcom while my friend died. Or worse, hurt someone else. We couldn't be complacent. There was a tragedy unfolding right in front of us. There was violence and blackouts. On a certain level, if you're looking the other way, you're responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You couldn't do that much cocaine and work. It was falling apart. It was heartbreaking to be around here then," Lorre told the magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheen played drinking, womanizing bachelor Charlie Harper in a thinly-veiled version of himself on the show. When he was fired, the future of the series was up in the air until Ashton Kutcher was hired to replace Sheen and play a heart-broken Internet billionaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record 27.7 million U.S. viewers watched the first episode of the show with Kutcher in September, which began with the funeral of Sheen's character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorre said that Sheen, the character of Charlie Harper and the very public acrimony of the actor's split had become part of the fabric of the TV show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To not deal with it felt like a cheat. The unbelievably public nature of this debacle is part of our legacy now. It happened, and the dividing line between Charlie Harper and Charlie Sheen is forever blurred," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheen issued a series of public apologies in September, admitting he was out of control in the months before and after his firing. He also signed a deal to star in a new comedy called "Anger Management", starting on the FX cable channel in mid-2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full TV Guide Magazine interview with Lorre can be seen in the issue which hits newsstands on December 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Bob Tourtellotte)&lt;/p&gt;

			Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 Announces Update on Agreement of Sale for 
      Alliston Property
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;) and its general 
      partner, Walton Ontario Land 1 Corporation, announced today that the 
      purchase and sale agreement that the Partnership entered into for the 
      disposition of the Partnership&#8217;s Alliston Property (the &#8220;Agreement&#8221;) 
      will not proceed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As first reported on June 27, 2011, under the terms of the Agreement, 
      the Partnership had agreed to sell its 154.93-acre Alliston Property for 
      an aggregate consideration of $23,239,500, being a price of $150,000 per 
      acre. The conditions of the Agreement have not been satisfied by the 
      purchaser, and as a result, the proposed sale of the land will not 
      proceed. The Partnership will continue to advance the entitlement 
      activities to ready the land for development through the Draft Plan of 
      Subdivision application to the Town of New Tecumseth to accommodate 
      industrial and other employment uses with the statutory public (open 
      house) meeting and presentation to Council in early 2012. The 
      Partnership believes that these planning activities along with the 
      recently announced addition of 400 workers to accommodate the making of 
      the new 2012 CR-V compact sport-utility vehicles at the Honda 
      manufacturing facilities adjacent to the property should increase the 
      attractiveness of the property to end-users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The objective of the Partnership is to maximize returns to its limited 
      partners through the acquisition, management, concept planning, and 
      eventual sale of two properties in Ontario&#8212;the Alliston Property which 
      consists of two parcels totaling 154.93 acres near the Toronto area in 
      Alliston, Ontario, and the Ottawa Property which consists of 300 acres 
      in the southwest quadrant of the City of Ottawa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership is managed by Walton International Group Inc., a part of 
      the Walton Group of Companies (the &#8220;Walton Group&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;

      currently manages approximately CAD $3.0 billion of pre-development and 
      development real estate assets, including more than 62,000 acres of land

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Brooke Mueller, the ex-wife of actor Charlie Sheen, has entered an in-patient rehabilitation center, her spokesman said on Tuesday, following her recent arrest in Colorado for possessing cocaine and assault,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"After further reflection and consideration, Brooke has decided to remove herself from the media spotlight and has entered a long-term in-patient treatment center where she can focus on her recovery without distraction," her spokesman Steve Honig said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Brooke's goal is to maintain her sobriety and she believes this is the best option to reach that goal," the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tuesday's decision follows a similar announcement one day earlier which said Mueller planned to participate in a daytime program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mueller, 34, was arrested earlier this month in the posh ski resort town of Aspen, Colorado following a claim by another woman that Mueller assaulted her at a bar. Police found cocaine with Mueller and she was later charged with assault and possession of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days after her arrest, her spokesman issued a statement saying Mueller had hired an attorney to "vigorously defend Brooke with the goal of having all charges dropped once the facts of the case come to light."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mueller and Sheen, who is coming off a turbulent year in his personal and professional life, have twin sons who continue to be in Mueller's custody, her spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jill Serjeant)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reversing a trial court, the appeals court threw out a lawsuit against Chubb Corp's Vigilant Insurance and other insurers, holding that the money paid in the settlement between the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and Bear Stearns did not constitute an "insurable loss" because the actions that led to the agreement represented an intentional violation of the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2006 deal settled the SEC's claim that Bear Stearns had facilitated late trading and deceptive market timing for certain customers, mostly hedge funds, between 1999 and 2003, providing them with hundreds of millions of dollars in profits at the expense of mutual-fund shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns in 2008 after it collapsed during the subprime mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In agreeing to settle the case, Bear Stearns paid $160 million in disgorgement and $90 million in civil penalties. While the brokerage specifically did not admit or deny the findings, as is common in SEC settlements, a five-judge panel ruled that the evidence overwhelmingly supported the company's culpability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"ead as a whole, the offer of settlement, the SEC Order, the NYSE order and related documents are not reasonably susceptible to any interpretation other than that Bear Stearns knowingly and intentionally facilitated illegal late trading for preferred customers, and that the relief provisions of the SEC Order required disgorgement of funds gained through that illegal activity," Justice Richard Andrias wrote for the Appellate Division, First Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vigilant Insurance Company, a unit of Chubb Corp, and several other insurers, including Travelers, Liberty Mutual and Lloyd's of London, were not responsible for paying losses incurred through "any deliberate, dishonest, fraudulent or criminal act or omission," according to the policy, as long as there was an "adverse final adjudication to that effect," Andrias wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for both sides did not immediately comment on the ruling.

&lt;p&gt;* Judge tosses lawsuit brought by JP Morgan vs insurers&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Pact between Bear Stearns and SEC not covered by insurers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Joseph Ax&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Dec 13 (Reuters) - A JPMorgan unit cannot

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp co-founder Paul Allen is planning to build a spaceship that could replace the Space Shuttle and put paying passengers into orbit this decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifelong space enthusiast Allen is hoping to launch unmanned rockets from a massive flying carrier plane to put government and commercial satellites into space and eventually evolve to human space missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative comes only months after the United States retired the Space Shuttle program after 30 years, opening the door to private enterprise to supply space vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen's rocket will be launched from what will be the world's biggest plane, a massive carrier aircraft powered by six jumbo jet engines, to be constructed by Scaled Composites, a unit of defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its wingspan will be about 385 feet, bigger than a football field and 70 percent longer than the wings of a Boeing 747.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rocket itself will be made by private space company SpaceX, created by Elon Musk, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal. The rocket and carrier will be integrated by aviation and missile specialists Dynetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first test flight is targeted for 2015 with the first commercial flight the year after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have long dreamed about taking the next big step in private space flight," said Allen. "To offer a flexible, orbital space delivery system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new company to manage the project, called Stratolaunch Systems, has the slogan "Any orbit. Any time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen, the sole funding source for development, did not say how much he would spend on the project, but indicated it would be $200 million or more, an "order of magnitude" greater than the $20 million he spent backing the first privately funded, manned space flight in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPACE FAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-eight-year-old Allen - listed by Forbes magazine as the world's 57th-richest person, with a fortune of $13.2 billion - is the latest in a line of tech billionaires with interests in the privatization of space travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His space ambitions put him alongside Musk and Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, whose Blue Origin aims to put people into space at an affordable price, rather than the millions of dollars it has cost up to now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic is also looking to transport passengers into sub-orbital space in the next two years, for about $200,000 a trip. It already has nearly 500 reservations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen said he has long harbored space fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I dreamed of becoming an astronaut," he said at the company's launch at his offices in downtown Seattle. Poor eyesight ruined his dreams of becoming a pilot, but he said his ambitions for space travel never died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, Stratolaunch will aim to fly unmanned rockets to put mid-sized satellites into orbit, and perhaps fly cargo to the International Space Station, if permitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the space shuttle's retirement this summer, the United States is dependent on partner countries to ferry cargo and crew to the outpost, although NASA is investing in some private enterprise options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, Allen's target is to fly paying customers into space, which he said had a massive potential market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His former Microsoft colleague Charles Simonyi paid about $20 million for a trip aboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station, but now the U.S. space shuttle is defunct, the tab could be three times as high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG SPENDER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen, who made up the name Microsoft, co-founded what became the world's biggest software company with Bill Gates in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking Gates' single-minded drive for business success, he left Microsoft in 1983, as he dealt with a first battle with cancer. He recently completed a second course of treatment for a different type of cancer, but says he is healthy now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen's interests and investments range far and wide, but are focused on his native Seattle and the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He owns the Seattle Seahawks professional football team, the&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trail Blazers basketball team in Portland, and his investment firm developed much of the South Lake Union neighborhood, which is central to Seattle's re-emergence as a technology center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is a generous donor to the University of Washington and is funding new research into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For leisure pursuits, he owns one of the world's largest yachts and built the Experience Music Project and Science Fiction Museum in Seattle. Allen's memoir, titled "Idea Man," was published earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Additional reporting by Irene Klotz in Cape Canaveral, Florida; Editing by Gunna Dickson, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.'s fund division is banking on the idea that if it can help advisers and investors understand what's going on in the markets, they will buy its funds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stock market volatility, the European debt crisis and uncertain macro-economic trends have left investors and some advisers uncertain about where to put their money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the industry has a great record of delivering products and services in a way that helps people understand them," George Gatch, CEO of the investment management Americas business of J.P. Morgan Asset Management, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But J.P. Morgan is taking a different approach. The goal: take sophisticated market themes and investment products and present them in easy-to-understand tidbits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm next year plans an array of initiatives including hiring more sales staff, launching an iPad application for financial advisers and expanding its online information -- all in an effort to "advise the advisers," Gatch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past few years, J.P. Morgan has caught the attention of advisers by showcasing its knowledge, primarily through chief market strategist, Dr. David Kelly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of quarterly calls, Kelly also hosts calls amid rapid market changes, including an August discussion after Standard &amp; Poor's downgraded U.S. debt. Nearly 8,000 advisers tuned in. It was the asset manager's biggest call ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOT SEAT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a year, each of J.P. Morgan's sales staff stand in front of a panel of portfolio managers, investment strategists and sales managers, who grill them on their product, market knowledge and overall sales skills.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Training coaches use these videotaped sessions to identify areas for improvement, which could include knowing details of products to better presentation, Gatch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our sales people hate it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, J.P. Morgan's approach appears to be working. With $392.3 billion in assets, the mutual fund group is the fifth largest, behind Fidelity Management Research Co, Vanguard Group, Capital Research &amp; Management Co and Pacific Investment Management Co, according to Lipper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors added $17 billion to the firm's long-term mutual funds during the first 11 months of the year, making J.P. Morgan third in inflows behind Vanguard and PIMCO, according to Strategic Insight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emphasizing simplicity is not easy for a firm that has such complex offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One example: The fund division offers 16 alternative funds, including 130/30 funds. The funds aim to have 130 percent long exposure to equities and 30 percent short. Most competitors use the 130/30 in the name of these funds. But J.P. Morgan's first retail 130/30 fund, launched in 2005, was called J.P. Large Cap Core Plus Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason, said Gatch: Most 130/30 funds, J.P. Morgan's included, do not usually stick to a 130/30 strategy. It's a strategy in name, but not always in practice -- confusing for investors and advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;401(k) REVAMP&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the fund division's biggest forays into simplifying complexity came in November when J.P. Morgan introduced a new plan design for large 401(k) plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most 401(k)s offer target date funds and 18 or more investment options in a plan. But J.P. Morgan offered an alternative: Target date funds and three investment "buckets" consisting of diversified portfolio of equity funds, bond funds and cash alternatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Simple on its surface, the details behind it are more complex. Employers can have J. P. Morgan customize the buckets to the needs of the plan, which might include mutual funds or managed accounts, resulting in an array of investment options. But participants just see the bucket names and descriptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Next year, the firm hopes to bring this concept to smaller plans, or those with less than $1 billion, Gatch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This idea of simplification isn't about being simple, but about bringing sophisticated capabilities in a customized way to investors," Gatch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, J.P. Morgan will expand the "Market Insights" section on its website to house more of Dr. Kelly's views. The firm's marketing and sales budget will also increase by 10 percent in 2012, Gatch said, declining to elaborate on specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all the talk of simplicity, J.P. Morgan is staying away from what many investors see as the most basic of choices: exchange traded funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund company has filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to launch active ETFs, but has made no move to develop them. Gatch does not believe active ETFs are worthwhile for investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The day that we see that will be the day that you see us enter the ETF market," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jessica Toonkel, editing by Jennifer Merritt and Chelsea Emery)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Charlie Sheen was fired from his starring role on TV sitcom "Two and A Half Men" because he was so addicted to cocaine that program makers feared he might die, or cause someone else to die, producer Chuck Lorre said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lorre, co-creator of the most-watched comedy on U.S. television, broke his silence about Sheen's meltdown and the decision to shutter the show down earlier this year in an interview with TV Guide Magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheen, the highest paid actor on U.S. television at the time, was fired in March following weeks of drug-fueled partying, a half-hearted attempt at rehab and a series of wild public rants against Lorre and producers of the CBS network show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorre said program makers Warner Bros and CBS "chose to make a moral decision as opposed to a financial one. This was not a game. This was drug addiction writ large. This was big-time cocaine, and in his own words, an 'epic drug run' that could have ended with either his death or someone else's."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorre said that he and others on the show had tried to intervene for months with Sheen, without success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was so afraid my friend was going to die. When we would shoot a show on a Friday night, there was always that 'I'll see you Monday. I hope.' The holidays were the worst, because those long stretches of time were the ones we feared the most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I didn't want to be writing a sitcom while my friend died. Or worse, hurt someone else. We couldn't be complacent. There was a tragedy unfolding right in front of us. There was violence and blackouts. On a certain level, if you're looking the other way, you're responsible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You couldn't do that much cocaine and work. It was falling apart. It was heartbreaking to be around here then," Lorre told the magazine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheen played drinking, womanizing bachelor Charlie Harper in a thinly-veiled version of himself on the show. When he was fired, the future of the series was up in the air until Ashton Kutcher was hired to replace Sheen and play a heart-broken Internet billionaire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record 27.7 million U.S. viewers watched the first episode of the show with Kutcher in September, which began with the funeral of Sheen's character.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorre said that Sheen, the character of Charlie Harper and the very public acrimony of the actor's split had become part of the fabric of the TV show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To not deal with it felt like a cheat. The unbelievably public nature of this debacle is part of our legacy now. It happened, and the dividing line between Charlie Harper and Charlie Sheen is forever blurred," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheen issued a series of public apologies in September, admitting he was out of control in the months before and after his firing. He also signed a deal to star in a new comedy called "Anger Management", starting on the FX cable channel in mid-2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full TV Guide Magazine interview with Lorre can be seen in the issue which hits newsstands on December 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jill Serjeant; Editing by Bob Tourtellotte)&lt;/p&gt;

			J.P. Morgan launches the first fixed income frontier markets index, 
      the NEXGEM&#8480; J.P. Morgan Next Generation Markets Index
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Latest addition to J.P. Morgan&#8217;s renowned family of fixed income 
      indices
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan today announced the introduction of the first fixed income 
      Next Generation markets index, which tracks dollar-denominated 
      government bonds issued by frontier markets. The new index, J.P. 
      Morgan Next Generation Markets Index (NEXGEM&#8480;),
			is a 
      fixed-income benchmark that provides exposure to non-investment grade 
      rated, smaller, less liquid population of emerging market economies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Growing demand for exposure to Next Generation markets is part of the 
      expansion and deepening of the emerging markets debt asset class. The 
      focus on Next Generation markets is expected to continue as investors 
      seek diversification and higher yields. With NEXGEM&#8480; we will provide 
      investors with a well-defined and diligently-managed benchmark for these 
      markets within the emerging markets framework,&#8221; Gloria Kim, JP Morgan&#8217;s 
      Head of Global Index Research said. &#8220;It continues a legacy of premier 
      index products developed by J.P. Morgan and underscores the firm&#8217;s 
      dedication to developing emerging markets,&#8221; Kim addded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NEXGEM&#8480; closely follows the methodology of J.P. Morgan&#8217;s EMBI Global 
      Diversified, which is the most widely used benchmark for investors in 
      dollar-denominated emerging market government bonds. NEXGEM&#8480; selects 
      countries from this benchmark that meet our criteria for Next Generation 
      Markets. Today, NEXGEM&#8480; includes 18 countries representing Sub-Saharan 
      Africa, Central American, the Caribbean, Middle East, Europe and Asia: 
      Belarus, Belize, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Gabon, 
      Georgia, Ghana, Iraq, Ivory Coast, Jamaica, Jordan, Nigeria, Pakistan, 
      Senegal, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. Allocation to Next Generation markets 
      will likely increase as investors seek diversification and higher 
      yields. NEXGEM&#8480; serves as a tracker for these markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Next Generation emerging markets will continue to gain investor 
      interest due to high yield and continued growth momentum,&#8221; Joyce Chang, 
      Global Head of Emerging Markets and Credit Research, said. &#8220;We believe 
      that NEXGEM countries have the potential to outperform the EMBI Global 
      Diversified next year, delivering double-digit returns on the back of 
      the current high yield of 8% for NEXGEM countries, stronger growth 
      prospects compared to core EM and DM economies, and supportive 
      technicals on the back of light investor positioning,&#8221; added Chang.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      from December 31, 2001 for the aggregate, regional, country and rating 
      bucket subindices of NEXGEM. Clients and investors can access index

&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Goldberg is on something of an anti-Walmart campaign  and theres nothing particularly wrong with that. Theres a lot of things to dislike about Walmart, including the fact, as Goldberg notes in his latest Bloomberg View column, that its stores dont have windows. But having decided that he doesnt like Walmart, Goldberg is attacking the company and its founding family on grounds which dont stand up to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For instance, take this seemingly damning statistic from Goldbergs column:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, according to the labor economist Sylvia Allegretto, the six Walton family members on the Forbes 400 had a net worth equal to the bottom 30 percent of all Americans. The Waltons are now collectively worth about $93 billion, according to Forbes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;This sounds outrageous, until you stop for a second and take note of the fact that Jeffrey Goldberg, individually, has a net worth greater than the bottom 25% of all Americans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the latest data we have, 24.8% of American households had zero or negative net worth  add them all together, and you get zero. Jeffrey Goldbergs net worth, its safe to say, is greater than zero. And while its definitely a bad thing that one in four Americans have no net worth at all, I dont think you can really blame Walmart for that. Indeed, Walmart saves money for poor Americans  while it might not be a great employer, there are many more poor Americans than there are poor Walmart employees. From a financial perspective, Walmart has been a decidedly positive force in terms of bringing down the cost of living for those on extremely limited budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldbergs thoughts, on the other hand, are in a higher place. The main subject of his column is the new Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, in Bentonville  a museum which Goldberg (or at least his headline writer) considers a moral blight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes Goldberg say that? Well, while the museum itself is beautiful, he says, and contains much beautiful art, the American landscape has been systematically disfigured by thousands of hangar-sized warehouses bearing the Wal-Mart name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This might be true  although to be honest I cant recall ever seeing a Walmart erected anywhere particularly beautiful; they tend to pop up, in my experience, in vast and dreary expanses of exurbia. But even if Walmart is a beauty-destroying monster, that hardly makes Crystal Bridges equally monstrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warming to his theme, Goldberg notes that the messages of Norman Rockwell&#8217;s &#8220;Rosie the Riveter&#8221; and Jacob Lawrence&#8217;s &#8220;Ambulance Call&#8221; stands in contrast to, respectively, the way that Walmart treats its female employees, and the way in which its denying many of them healthcare coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does Goldberg celebrate the fact that these messages are being displayed for perpetuity in the town where Walmart has its headquarters, and might somehow serve to remind Walmarts executives of the broader American context in which theyre making their decisions? He does not. Instead, he thinks that this art does not deserve to be in Bentonville at all:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;I&#8217;m not begrudging Alice Walton her inherited wealth. What I am begrudging are her priorities. Walton has the influence to help Wal-Mart workers, especially women, earn more money and gain access to affordable health care.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But her response so far to the needs of the people whose sweat pays for her paintings is a simple one: Let them eat art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talk about looking a gift horse in the mouth. Firstly, its not clear that Alice Walton does have a lot of influence within Walmarts senior managerial ranks. Could Walton really help Wal-Marts workers earn more money and get better healthcare? Maybe she could; Im not convinced. But heres the thing: in what way does building a beautiful museum prevent her from doing just that? The only way, it seems to me, is if were in some kind of a zero-sum game, here, where the alternative to building the museum would be for Walton to take the money she would otherwise have spent on Crystal Bridges, and give it directly to Walmart workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Except, Goldberg says quite explicitly that he doesnt begrudge Walton her wealth. Does he want her to give it away or not?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lets say that Walton has spent a total of $1 billion on this museum. According to its latest annual report, Walmart has 2.1 million associates: if you shared $1 billion between them, that would be an investment of $476 apiece in giving them more money and better healthcare on an ongoing basis. Even if you could somehow manage to use 10% of that value every year on a sustainable basis, thats less than a buck a week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walmart is a public company, now  its owned by hundreds of thousands of individual and institutional shareholders. (Goldberg himself is probably a beneficial shareholder somehow, through a pension plan or insurance policy somewhere.) Walmart has been good to Alice Walton, and shes giving back to Bentonville and to America by building a fine museum in a part of the country which is relatively starved for cultural goodness. Her impulses and her museum are admirable, whatever you think of Walmart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the East Coast liberal elite, in the form of Jeffrey Goldberg, sneers at Waltons generosity and calls her museum a moral blight, that only serves to make us seem even more elitist and out of touch. Its pretty clear that Goldberg would have preferred Asher Durand&#8217;s &#8220;Kindred Spirits&#8221; to have remained in New York, rather than being moved to Bentonville  maybe we have finer aesthetic sensibilities up here, and therefore the painting would be better housed in the Stephen A. Schwarzman Building on the corner of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street. Im sure that Stephen A. Schwarzman, for one, would like that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Arkansas is America too. And its fantastic that a wide range of exciting American art  including the likes of Jenny Holzer and Kara Walker  is being displayed in the heart of Red State America. Well done to Alice Walton for making that happen. Arkansas is a better place, now, thanks to Crystal Bridges, and Walton deserves our thanks. Not brickbats.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 13 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs and
BNP Paribas have invested in U.S. trading technology
firm Broadway Technology as big banks look to grab a trading
advantage while profits and costs get squeezed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Broadway supplies banks and hedge funds with tools to
develop speedy technology to trade bonds and foreign exchange,
and cost pressures at banks are prompting more to use
independent IT platforms they can customise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Broadway said Goldman had invested alongside another unnamed
investor. That is France's BNP Paribas, people familiar with the
matter said, although BNP and Broadway declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investors had taken a minority stake, but Broadway
declined to provide further financial details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company was formed eight years ago by Tyler Moeller and
Joshua Walsky, a pair of algorithmic traders with advanced
degrees in computer science.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief executive Moeller told Reuters he planned to use the
investment to expand in Europe and Asia and into other asset
classes, such as equities and commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

			About Accretive Health
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Accretive Health is a leading provider of services to healthcare 
      providers. Our business purpose is to help U.S. hospitals, physicians 
      and other healthcare providers more efficiently manage their revenue 
      cycle operations and population-based health management initiatives. Our 
      distinctive operating model that includes people, processes and 
      sophisticated integrated technology, which we refer to as our solutions, 
      helps our customers realize sustainable improvements in their operating 
      margins and improve the satisfaction of their patients, physicians and 
      staff. Our customers typically are multi-hospital systems, including 
      faith-based or community healthcare systems, academic medical centers 
      and independent ambulatory clinics, and their affiliated physician 
      practice groups. Our revenue cycle solution spans our customers' entire 
      revenue cycle, unlike competing services that we believe address only a 
      portion of the revenue cycle or focus solely on cost reductions. Our 
      revenue cycle management customers have historically achieved 
      significant improvements in cash collections measured against the 
      contractual amount due for healthcare services, which we refer to as net 
      revenue yield. Our population health management infrastructure spans the 
      entire healthcare delivery continuum and enables providers to manage the 
      health of their patient populations delivering higher quality care while 
      reducing aggregate cost of care. For more information, please visit www.accretivehealth.com.

      Certification to Enter South American Market
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			WatchPAT&#8482; and EndoPAT&#8482; receive ANVISA 
      certification as Itamar Medical signs distribution contracts in Brazil 
      and Chile
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Itamar Medical, the world's leading developer of non-invasive technology 
      for early detection of cardiovascular disease and home testing of 
      obstructive sleep apnea, continues to penetrate new markets and has 
      announced a breakthrough in South America by receiving ANVISA 
      certification. The flagship products, WatchPAT and EndoPAT, may now be 
      imported and sold freely to the clinical market of South America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Itamar Medical announced the signing of an exclusive 
      distribution agreement with Politec Sa&#250;de, one of the largest companies 
      in Brazil, as well as with Smart Medical for the distribution of the 
      WatchPAT in Chile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Politec Sa&#250;de, as the exclusive distributor of Itamar products in 
      Brazil, is proud to help Brazilian HealthCare professionals and patients 
      with this great new technology,&#8221; said Claudio Rigamonti, President of 
      Politec Sa&#250;de.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brazil, the largest economy in the CALA (Central America / Latin 
      America) region, is experiencing a good growth rate in recent years. 
      Both Itamar products are being used for research purposes in leading 
      university hospitals in all major Brazilian cities. The EndoPAT is 
      currently part of the ELSA study that is covering 6 Brazilian states and 
      has the objective to set the benchmark for investigating mainly 
      cardiovascular disease, diabetes, biological, behavioral, environmental, 
      occupational and social behavior.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Brazil, which boasts a population of 190 million people, offers great 
      potential for WatchPAT home testing to surpass in-lab sleep labs and 
      greater cost savings for consumers,&#8221; said Dr. Dov Rubin, CEO and 
      President Itamar Medical. &#8220;We expect to see similar success for EndoPAT.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;US National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) to Conduct Clinical Study on Biotie's Nepicastat in Cocaine Dependence&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&#183; Ongoing clinical study on nepicastat in post-traumatic stress disorder, funded and conducted by US Department of Defense, expected to complete in H2 2012&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Biotie Therapies announced today that it has signed a Collaborative Research and Development Agreement&#160; with the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) at the US National Institutes of Health.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, NIDA and Biotie will investigate the safety and efficacy of Biotie's nepicastat (SYN117) in the treatment of cocaine dependence. NIDA will fund the conduct of a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial, lasting 11 weeks, in 180 treatment-seeking cocaine-dependent subjects using nepicastat supplied by Biotie. The study will be conducted at approximately 12 US clinics specializing in the treatment of drug dependence.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to be working with NIDA and some of the world's most renowned investigators of treatments for cocaine dependence," said Timo Veromaa, Chief Executive Officer of Biotie. "There is currently no approved treatment for cocaine dependence, a condition which exacts a heavy toll on individuals, their families and society as a whole."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Biotie and NIDA have previously collaborated on preclinical studies evaluating potential pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic interactions between nepicastat and drugs of abuse. Biotie retains rights to nepicastat and will be able to use data from studies conducted with NIDA to support future potential regulatory submissions.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The trial is expected to start in H1 2012 and take approximately two years to complete. &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;About nepicastat (SYN117)&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nepicastat is an orally administered, potent and selective inhibitor of the enzyme dopamine &#946;-hydroxylase (DBH). The compound has demonstrated potential as a treatment for cocaine dependence and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).&#160; &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Like many other addictions, cocaine dependence is driven by dysregulation in the dopamine-reward system. Inhibition of DBH by nepicastat increases levels of dopamine, which may reduce craving for cocaine, and reduces the levels of norepinephrine, which may decrease the pleasurable responses to cocaine and the potential for stress-induced relapse following withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Biotie has previously conducted a placebo-controlled Phase 2a study in non-treatment seeking cocaine addicts. This study showed that nepicastat had a favourable safety profile and was well tolerated when administered with cocaine.&#160; &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Nepicastat is also in a Phase 2 US Department of Defense-funded study for the treatment of PTSD.&#160; This is a condition with significant unmet medical need and is becoming more prevalent in both the civilian and military communities. The ongoing placebo-controlled, double blind trial is scheduled to enroll up to 120 patients and is now expected to complete in H2 2012, instead of 2013 as previously announced.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;SYN117 was licensed from Roche in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;About Biotie&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Biotie is an international biopharmaceutical company focused on the development of innovative, clinically differentiated medicines to address unmet medical needs primarily associated with neurological and psychiatric diseases and selected inflammatory diseases. Biotie aims to develop treatment solutions that will improve the lives of patients with conditions such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's diseases, drug dependence and inflammatory liver disease. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Biotie's highly experienced development teams in Europe and the US are focused on efficiently delivering safety and efficacy data for the company's compounds. For niche indications, Biotie will consider bringing products to market by itself. For larger indications, it will seek strategic partnerships with pharmaceutical partners for late-stage development and commercialization. Current pharmaceutical partners include Lundbeck, Roche, UCB Pharma, and Seikagaku.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Biotie's most advanced product, nalmefene for alcohol dependence, has completed Phase 3 clinical development by licensing partner Lundbeck.&lt;/p&gt;</body></entry><entry author="None" date="2011-12-15T02:16:52+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/15/us-chevron-transocean-idUSTRE7BE03B20111215"><headline>Chevron, Transocean in $11 billion Brazil oil suit</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazilian prosecutors sued Chevron Corp, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, and top offshore oil rig operator Transocean Ltd for 20 billion reais ($10.6 billion) over their alleged roles in a November oil spill near Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The civil suit filed by federal prosecutors in Rio de Janeiro state also seeks to suspend the companies from operating in Brazil, the prosecutor's office said in a statement on its website on Wednesday, a move that could halt operations of the 10 Transocean offshore drilling rigs operating in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During investigations the prosecutors found that Chevron and Transocean were not capable of controlling the damages caused by the leakage," the statement said. "This is evidence of a lack of planning and environmental management by the companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some legal experts said the action may be a politically motivated suit that could be difficult to win given Brazil's extensive oil regulations, the case's technical complexity and the lack of evidence to date of serious negligence or wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case will add to already-large legal headaches for both companies. Chevron has already faced years of litigation over alleged pollution by Texaco, a company it bought, in Ecuador's Amazon region decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron was ordered by Ecuadorean courts in February to pay damages of $18 billion. The suit is now under appeal in Ecuador, and the dispute is also being reviewed by an international arbitration tribunal. Transocean was the rig operator in the giant four-billion-barrel Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit could also jeopardize oil companies' plans to step up their presence in Brazil after the discovery of huge offshore reserves several kilometers (miles) beneath the ocean floor estimated at 50 billion barrels or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reaching that oil will be technically challenging but Brazil expects it will push its crude output to 7 million barrels a day by 2020. That could see it challenge the United States for the rank of world No. 3 oil producer after Russia and Saudi Arabia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also risks alarming foreign oil companies eager to expand in one of the world's fastest-growing oil frontiers, where state-controlled oil company Petrobras accounts for more than 90 percent of the output, and government leaders are moving to assert even greater control of natural resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, which has said it takes full responsibility for the spill, said it has not received any formal notice of the suit and that the spill was staunched in four days with minimal or no damage to the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transocean had similar comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have not received a formal notice of this action. At present, our rigs are operating in Brazilian waters and we continue to cooperate with the authorities," it said in a statement to Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares ended nearly 3 percent lower on Wednesday while Transocean stock fell 3.9 percent, both on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"NEW TERRITORY"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are really entering new territory here," said Marilda Rosado De Sa Ribeiro, a lawyer and former official at Brazil's oil agency, the ANP. "There are high hurdles to make a technical case like this work, but the public prosecutors are professional and serious."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government of Brazilian president Dilma Rousseff has been expanding the funding and training of the public prosecutors' office, helping the prosecutors realize their constitutional role as national watchdog and win more high-profile cases against corruption and environmental wrongdoing, said the lawyer, a partner at Doria, Jacobina, Rosado, Godinho in Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand Brazil's legal system allows a large number of appeals and few major cases are settled quickly, meaning that even if successful, Chevron and Transocean could operate for years before facing any fine or sanction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Ramon, California-based Chevron has already assumed responsibility for leaking what it estimates at 2,400 barrels of oil into water off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. It has been fined $28 million by environmental authorities for the spill, and its local president has made a public apology before Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The public outrage at Chevron, which did no damage to beaches and has left less than a barrel of oil on the ocean according to Chevron, has led some to suggest the prosecution may be based more on politics than the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The lawsuit sounds like politics. If you have an inadequate contingency plan in place then maybe you can be suspended from operating or face an administrative fine, but how do you get to $10.6 billion in damages here?," said John Lowe, energy law professor at SMU Dedman law School in Dallas, who has studied Brazilian energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a government with strong Populist ties and they may feel political pressure to take some kind of action. We did not take this kind of action in the United States against BP during the Macondo spill."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The document outlining the prosecutor's case did not give a breakdown of how it arrived at the 20 billion reais figure but said the fine was to compensate for environmental and social damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The November spill came from the Frade Field northeast of Rio de Janeiro, which produces nearly 80,000 barrels of oil a day and is owned 52 percent by Chevron, 30 percent by Brazil's state-controlled Petrobras and 18 percent by Frade Japao, a Japanese group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The well involved in the spill was being drilled by Transocean aboard its SEDCO 706 rig.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suspending Transocean's operations could stop drilling in some of the country's most promising oil fields including the 8 billion-barrel Lula and Cernambi complex, a Petrobras-led area part-owned by BG Group Plc and Galp, which is one of world's largest discoveries in three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 1.8773 reais)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Todd Benson, Silvio Cascione and Jeb Blount; additional reporting by Joshua Schneyer in New York and Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Writing by Jeb Blount; editing by Matthew Lewis, Bob Burgdorfer and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAMPA, Fla., Dec. 14, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Burton W. Wiand, who was appointed Receiver in S.E.C. v. Arthur Nadel et al., Case No. 8:09-cv-87-T-26TBM (M.D. Fla.), over various entities associated with Arthur Nadel's Ponzi scheme, announced today that he has reached a settlement with Goldman Sachs Execution  Clearing, L.P. ("GSEC"). GSEC provided customary prime brokerage services to Nadel and certain of the entities associated with his scheme at the request of an independent introducing broker/dealer, including clearing securities transactions initiated through the introducing broker/dealer.&#160;Under the terms of the settlement, which must be approved by the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, GSEC will pay $9,850,000 to the receivership estate in exchange for a broad release of claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Also as part of the settlement, in the motion for its approval the Receiver will ask the Court to bar claims against GSEC.&#160;However, before any such bar is ordered by the Court, the Receiver has asked the Court to grant him permission to send notice of the settlement and the request for a bar to investors in Nadel's scheme and other interested parties.&#160;The notice will inform recipients that, should they desire to file any response to the Receiver's motion for approval of the settlement, they may do so by filing it with the Court on or before January 17, 2012.&#160;A copy of the settlement agreement, the motion for approval, and the notice is available on the receivership's website, www.nadelreceivership.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Mr. Wiand's investigation of these matters revealed information indicating that while GSEC had no actual knowledge of Nadel's scheme, it may have failed to appropriately respond to certain "red flags" that, if investigated, could have revealed fraud.&#160;Although GSEC has maintained that it acted appropriately, from the beginning it has cooperated with Mr. Wiand and has displayed a good-faith willingness to resolve these matters amicably.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	For the reasons explained in Mr. Wiand's submissions to the Court, including the possible value of recoverable damages, the costs and risks of litigation, and possible defenses available to clearing firms, he believes the resolution reached with GSEC is in the best interests of the receivership.&#160;Mr. Wiand stated, "GSEC's payment of $9,850,000 under the settlement is an amount that is larger than the fees GSEC received from the securities transactions underlying these matters, and it represents a very significant benefit for the receivership estate and defrauded investors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Mr. Wiand is represented in these matters by Gianluca Morello, Michael Lamont, and Jared Perez of Wiand Guerra King P.L. in Tampa, Florida.&#160;For further information, contact Gianluca Morello at Wiand Guerra King P.L., 813.347.5100 or gmorello@wiandlaw.com.&lt;/p&gt;CONTACT: Gianluca Morello, Esq.

			Chevron Responds to Reported Lawsuit by Federal District Attorney in 
      Campos Brazil
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) said a Brazilian federal district 
      prosecutor has told reporters that he will file a civil lawsuit against 
      Chevron and other companies seeking a reported 20 billion reais ($10.7 
      billion) in damages, and an injunction stopping Chevron&#8217;s activities in 
      Brazil. Chevron has not received any formal notice of this action. 
      Chevron also has not received any instruction from the regulatory 
      agencies with oversight responsibility for our activities in Brazil 
      regarding suspension of our operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      From the outset, Chevron responded responsibly to the incident at its 
      Frade Field and has dealt transparently with all Brazilian 
      authorities.&#160;The flow of oil from the source was stopped within four 
      days and the company continues to make significant progress in 
      containing any residual oil.&#160;Chevron has also continued to address the 
      surface sheen, which is now less than a single barrel.&#160;There have been 
      no coastal or wildlife impacts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is one of the world&#8217;s leading integrated energy companies, with 
      subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company is involved in 
      virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for, 
      produces and transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and 
      distributes transportation fuels and lubricants; manufactures and sells

&lt;p&gt;DUBAI (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) is buying a stake in Saudi Arabia-based beverage company Aujan Industries for $980 million in what is seen as a bid to catch up with rival PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Coke and Aujan on Wednesday said the deal would be the largest-ever investment by a multinational company in the Middle East's consumer goods sector. The transaction is slated to close in the first half of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Coke dominates the global beverage business, Pepsi is the leader in the Middle East, Beverage Digest editor and publisher John Sicher told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This deal begins to give Coke more critical mass in these countries where Pepsi dominates and should, over time, enhance Coke's presence in those markets," Sicher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, Coca-Cola will acquire a 50 percent stake in the entity that holds the rights to Aujan's brands and a 49 percent stake in Aujan's bottling and distribution company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aujan brands include Rani, a line of juices, and Barbican, a flavored malt beverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Middle East is a high-growth region" with some of the highest rates of nonalcoholic drink consumption per capita, Ahmet Bozer, Coca-Cola's president for Eurasia and Africa, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Middle East currently contributes a small fraction of Coke's overall sales. The company in October announced plans to invest $5 billion in the Middle East and North Africa over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aujan Chairman Adel Aujan told Arabiya television in an interview that he hoped to double revenue in five years, from the current 3 billion riyals ($800 million) annually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sixty-five percent of our sales are outside the kingdom (of Saudi Arabia) and we compete with international companies, so as time goes by I see that these giant international companies -- we don't have their capabilities," Aujan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement excludes Aujan's Iranian manufacturing and distribution business, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke gets a significant portion of its sales from outside the United States and has been buoyed by its presence in emerging markets, where workers with rising incomes are supporting more beverage sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Coca-Cola were down 16 cents at $66.42 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Rachana Khanzode in Bangalore, Isabel Coles in Dubai, Martinne Geller in New York and Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles; Editing by Joyjeet Das and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs resumed coverage on the U.S. Internet sector, saying it presented an attractive investment idea as revenue growth at some Web-based companies would likely outpace consensus expectations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The brokerage expects the rapid adoption of online retail and the shift of advertising dollars to the online market, will drive growth in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investment spending for many companies will exceed consensus, though we believe above-forecast revenue growth will more than offset those costs," the brokerage said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect to see margins flat, as companies invest in development and acquisitions to stay ahead of the changing competitive landscape."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage said online commerce and auction site eBay Inc, which is on its "conviction buy" list, was among the companies that offered the best risk/reward proposition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online travel agency Priceline.com Inc, daily-deal company Groupon Inc, and Ancestry.com Inc, which operates a website that allows people to trace their family roots by scouring online records, were also among Goldman's Internet picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sayantani Ghosh in Bangalore; Editing by Esha Dey)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      The Shaw Group Inc. (NYSE: SHAW) today announced it has been awarded a 
      contract by Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP (Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical) to license its proprietary technology and provide a process 
      design package for a 1.5 million ton per annum grassroots ethylene 
      plant. The new facility, which will be located at Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical&#8217;s existing Cedar Bayou Plant in Baytown, Texas, will be 
      designed to use economical supplies of ethane feedstock derived from 
      increased shale gas production.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This project represents a significant change in the ethylene 
      marketplace as no U.S. plants have been added in approximately ten 
      years,&#8221; said James Glass, president of Shaw&#8217;s Energy  Chemicals Group. 
      &#8220;The selection of Shaw&#8217;s technology for this project followed an 
      evaluation of the top ethylene licensors in the world. Our robust Ultra 
      Selective Conversion&#174; furnace and recovery system and 70 
      years of experience in designing and/or building more than 120 
      grassroots ethylene units were key factors.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shaw has a long history of providing services to Chevron Phillips 
      Chemical, having designed their ethylene plants in Jubail, Saudi Arabia, 
      and Port Arthur, Texas. In addition, Shaw has conducted studies and 
      performed revamps at most of the company&#8217;s other sites.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The undisclosed value of the contract will be included in Shaw&#8217;s Energy 
       Chemicals segment&#8217;s backlog of unfilled orders in the first quarter of 
      fiscal year 2012.

			Chevron Phillips Chemical Advances Plans for USGC Petrochemicals 
      Project
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LP (Chevron Phillips Chemical) 
      announced today that it has completed several key elements of the 
      feasibility study announced earlier this year and plans to pursue a 
      project to construct a world-scale ethane cracker and ethylene 
      derivatives facilities in the U.S. Gulf Coast region.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s existing Cedar Bayou facility in Baytown, 
      Texas, would be the location of the new ethylene unit. The company has 
      executed agreements with Shaw Energy  Chemicals to design a 1.5 million 
      metric tons/year (3.3 billion pounds/year) ethane cracker utilizing 
      proprietary Shaw technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Phillips Chemical&#8217;s proprietary technologies would be utilized 
      for the construction of two new polyethylene facilities, each with an 
      annual capacity of 500,000 metric tons (1.1 billion pounds). The new 
      polyethylene units would be located either at the Cedar Bayou facility 
      or a site nearby the Chevron Phillips Chemical Sweeny facility in Old 
      Ocean, Texas. A final site selection decision for these units is 
      anticipated during the first quarter of 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Peter L. Cella, president and chief executive officer, discussed the 
      study&#8217;s findings during a presentation today at the Gulf Petrochemicals 
      and Chemicals Association (GPCA) conference in Dubai, United Arab 
      Emirates. He also announced that the Environmental Protection Agency 
      (EPA) greenhouse gas and Texas Commission on Environmental Quality 
      (TCEQ) air permit applications for the new cracker would be filed this 
      week. Cella indicated that the project is on track for final approvals 
      in 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The owners and management of Chevron Phillips Chemical are pleased to 
      have taken these critical steps, and believe that executing this project 
      will benefit our customers, suppliers, local communities and existing 
      and future employees,&#8221; said Cella. &#8220;It is our opinion that this project 
      offers unique advantages, including co-location of the cracker with our 
      Cedar Bayou facility and other ancillary assets such as our broad 
      feedstock and ethylene pipeline and storage cavern networks, proximity 
      to the expanding natural gas liquids hub in Mont Belvieu and utilization 
      of proprietary technology to meet the growing demand of our customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If approved, the USGC Petrochemicals Project is expected to create 
      approximately 400 long-term direct jobs and 10,000 engineering and 
      construction jobs. &#8220;We are pleased that the development of shale gas 
      resources in the United States has set the stage for major petrochemical 
      investment and job creation in our own backyard,&#8221; said Cella.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The estimated completion date for the USGC Petrochemicals Project is 
      2017.

equity in the beverage business of Saudi Arabia-based Aujan
Industries for $980 million to expand its presence in
non-alcoholic beverages in the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the agreement, Coca-Cola will acquire a 50 percent

a 49 percent stake in its bottling and distribution company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahmet Bozer, president of Coca-Cola in Eurasia and Africa,
said in a statement that the region was poised for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Middle East is a high-growth region with some of the
highest rates of non alcoholic ready To drink per capita

current 3 billion riyals ($800 million) per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sixty-five percent of our sales are outside the kingdom (of
Saudi Arabia) and we compete with international companies so as
time goes by I see that these giant international companies  --
we don't have their capabilities," Aujan said in the televised
interview. "So I saw a necessity to partner with the people who
can give us strength and Coca Cola are the most suitable people
for that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement excludes Arjan's Iranian manufacturing and
distribution business, the companies said, and the transaction
is expected to close in the first half of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By John Kemp&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 14 (Reuters) - For the second year
running, analysts at Goldman Sachs are among the most bullish
for oil prices over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, the bank's analysts took a risk by making a bold
call on prices -- and won big when prices soared. Rivals and
customers will be watching closely to see if its call for
continued price rises in 2012 proves equally prescient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman predicts Brent crude will average $120 per barrel in
2012, up from $111 in 2011, with only a handful of trading days
left before the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's optimism is matched by UniCredit (which is also
predicting average prices of $120) and outdone only by CIBC
($123).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's analysts have consistently been among the most
optimistic for the past five years -- earning them the nickname
"perma-bulls", and a mixture of envy and admiration from rivals,
as prices have regularly surprised on the upside, making the
bank more right than wrong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has triumphed again as the most accurate forecaster
in 2011, as strong demand from emerging markets in the first
half, coupled with the civil war in Libya and other supply
disruptions, sent prices surging 40 percent compared with 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's track record ensures its forecast has become the
benchmark and the one to beat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN'S BOLDNESS PAYS OFF&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Goldman predicted Brent prices would average $100
in 2011, which was considered aggressive, when the average
forecast was just $87, according to a Reuters poll carried out
in December 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the bank's prediction was wrong, but only
because it turned out $11 (10 percent) too low. It was
significantly more accurate than the next nearest prediction,
which was out by $16 or 15 percent, let alone the average, which
was off by $24 or 21 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's analysts have been distinguished by their
readiness to break with the herd and defy market convention by
predicting prices will change rather than remain roughly the
same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In December 2010, the average forecast for 2011 of $87 was
not meaningfully different from the prevailing price ($92) or
the forward curve. Most of the "forecasts" were really
"nowcasts" (Chart 1).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2011 forecasts were also tightly clustered, with a
standard deviation of just $5.50 (6 percent), which some would
say was unrealistically low, given prices typically move much
more from one year to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, Goldman's bullish call for $100 Brent deviated
from the consensus almost three times as much as the average. In
predicting prices would change significantly, rather than
continue around current levels, Goldman proved correct, though
even the bank failed to appreciate how far the market would
move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MOST STICK WITH THE CONSENSUS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price forecasts for 2012 look very much like those for 2011.
The baseline has moved up $20 but most analysts are again
predicting little change over the next 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average Brent price forecast in a poll conducted by
Reuters in late November was $107 per barrel in 2012, virtually
identical to the prevailing price of $109 and not significantly
different from the $111 average in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price forecasts for 2012 are again strongly clustered. The
standard deviation is $9.33 per barrel. While the deviation is
almost twice as large as at the same time last year, in
percentage terms (8.7 percent) the predictions are only slightly
more dispersed than for 2011 (6.4 percent) once adjusted for the
higher base price (Chart 2).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On average, forecasters expect prices to move less than 4
percent next year. Nearly half the analysts in the survey (17
out of 36) think average prices will differ from 2011 ($111) by
$5 or less ($106-116). Less than a third think prices would fall
10 percent to $100 or lower (11/36). Only 3 analysts think
prices would rise by more than 5 percent on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such continuity would be unusual. The oil market has rarely
exhibited stability for such an extended period. The average
rise or fall in prices from one year to the next over the last
two decades has been 22 percent (Chart 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices have moved less than 10 percent on only six occasions
since 1990. The last time prices moved 4 percent or less was
2002, and before that 1997. So analysts are forecasting an
atypical degree of stability in 2012. It is more likely they
will all prove wrong than that they will all prove right.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAIL RISKS AND CENTRAL TENDENCY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tight clustering of the price forecasts around the
current level stands in marked contrast to prominent warnings
about tail risk on both the upside (from supply problems) and
the downside (from Europe's debt crisis and slowing global
growth).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Published commentaries and many news stories highlight the
possibility of sharp price moves if some of these risks
eventuate. But the broadly flat forecast distribution for 2012
suggests this is not the central scenario for many analysts in
the survey (or even the perma-bulls at Goldman).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the broadly flat distribution implies: (1) the
probability of a large price spike or collapse is not high; (2)
any large move is expected to be swiftly reversed; and (3) risks
to the upside are largely matched by threats to the downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many commentators talk in apocalyptic terms, almost
all the analysts in the survey have a conservative outlook --
one which emphasises unstable stability and more of the same
rather than large changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) co-founder Paul Allen is planning to build a spaceship that could replace the Space Shuttle and put paying passengers into orbit this decade.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lifelong space enthusiast Allen is hoping to launch unmanned rockets from a massive flying carrier plane to put government and commercial satellites into space and eventually evolve to human space missions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The initiative comes only months after the United States retired the Space Shuttle program after 30 years, opening the door to private enterprise to supply space vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen's rocket will be launched from what will be the world's biggest plane, a massive carrier aircraft powered by six jumbo jet engines, to be constructed by Scaled Composites, a unit of defense contractor Northrop Grumman Corp (NOC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its wingspan will be about 385 feet (117 meters), bigger than a football field and 70 percent longer than the wings of a Boeing (BA.N) 747.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rocket itself will be made by private space company SpaceX, created by Elon Musk, the billionaire co-founder of PayPal. The rocket and carrier will be integrated by aviation and missile specialists Dynetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first test flight is targeted for 2015 with the first commercial flight the year after.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have long dreamed about taking the next big step in private space flight," said Allen. "To offer a flexible, orbital space delivery system."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new company to manage the project, called Stratolaunch Systems, has the slogan "Any orbit. Any time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen, the sole funding source for development, did not say how much he would spend on the project, but indicated it would be $200 million or more, an "order of magnitude" greater than the $20 million he spent backing the first privately funded, manned space flight in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPACE FAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fifty-eight-year-old Allen - listed by Forbes magazine as the world's 57th-richest person, with a fortune of $13.2 billion - is the latest in a line of tech billionaires with interests in the privatization of space travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His space ambitions put him alongside Musk and Amazon.com (AMZN.O) founder Jeff Bezos, whose Blue Origin aims to put people into space at an affordable price, rather than the millions of dollars it has cost up to now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic is also looking to transport passengers into sub-orbital space in the next two years, for about $200,000 a trip. It already has nearly 500 reservations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen said he has long harboured space fantasies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I dreamed of becoming an astronaut," he said at the company's launch at his offices in downtown Seattle. Poor eyesight ruined his dreams of becoming a pilot, but he said his ambitions for space travel never died.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Initially, Stratolaunch will aim to fly unmanned rockets to put mid-sized satellites into orbit, and perhaps fly cargo to the International Space Station, if permitted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the space shuttle's retirement this summer, the United States is dependent on partner countries to ferry cargo and crew to the outpost, although NASA is investing in some private enterprise options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, Allen's target is to fly paying customers into space, which he said had a massive potential market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His former Microsoft colleague Charles Simonyi paid about $20 million for a trip aboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft to the International Space Station, but now the U.S. space shuttle is defunct, the tab could be three times as high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG SPENDER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen, who made up the name Microsoft, co-founded what became the world's biggest software company with Bill Gates in 1975.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lacking Gates' single-minded drive for business success, he left Microsoft in 1983, as he dealt with a first battle with cancer. He recently completed a second course of treatment for a different type of cancer, but says he is healthy now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen's interests and investments range far and wide, but are focused on his native Seattle and the Pacific Northwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He owns the Seattle Seahawks professional football team, the Trail Blazers basketball team in Portland, and his investment firm developed much of the South Lake Union neighbourhood, which is central to Seattle's re-emergence as a technology centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He is a generous donor to the University of Washington and is funding new research into the brain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For leisure pursuits, he owns one of the world's largest yachts and built the Experience Music Project and Science Fiction Museum in Seattle. Allen's memoir, titled "Idea Man," was published earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Additional reporting by Irene Klotz in Cape Canaveral, Florida; Editing by Gunna Dickson, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Dec 14 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators
accepted concessions offered by International Business Machines
Corp to end an antitrust investigation and avert a
possible fine, the European Commission said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. information technology hardware company proposed in
September to provide certain spare parts and technical
information to other companies which maintain its mainframe
hardware and software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said it was satisfied that the
concessions, which were revised after a market test and are
valid for five years, were sufficient to address competition
problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am pleased that we could find a swift solution with IBM
to our competition concerns. Timely interventions are crucial in
fast moving technology markets," EU Competition Commissioner
Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission's decision confirmed a Reuters report last
week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said in September it did not agree with the Commission's
charge that it might have abused its dominant position by
imposing 'unreasonable' supply conditions for some products to
competitors of mainframe maintenance services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many big companies and governments use mainframe computers
to store and process large quantities of data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the second case involving IBM that the European
Commission has wrapped up this year. The EU watchdog closed an
investigation into IBM in August after three small rivals
dropped complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission, which acts as competition regulator for the
EU and can fine companies up to 10 percent of their global
turnover, has imposed billion-euro fines against technology
firms such as Microsoft and Intel for breaching EU rules.&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Takes Action on JPMorgan's Support Ratings and Support Rating 
      Floors; IDRs Unaffected
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In accordance with the Fitch Report titled 'U.S. Banks - Sovereign 
      Support: When Does it End' dated Dec. 15, 2011, Fitch has raised the 
      Support and Support Rating Floor for JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPMorgan) to 
      '1' and 'A' from '5' and 'NF', respectively, reflecting the company's 
      status as a globally systemically important financial institution 
      (G-SIFI). See the full list of ratings at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are no implications for JPMorgan's or its bank subsidiaries' long- 
      or short-term Issuer Default Ratings (IDR) or issue-level ratings as a 
      result of today's action. JPMorgan's ratings currently receive no 
      benefit from support, and on a stand-alone basis, JPMorgan's long-term 
      and short-term IDRs remain 'AA-' and 'F1+', respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Along with the aforementioned action, Fitch has lowered JPMorgan Chase 
      Bank N.A.'s Support Rating Floor to 'A' from 'A+' and removed the Rating 
      Watch Negative. The Support Rating Floor is the rating that would be 
      assigned were the institution to receive sovereign support.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrade of the Support Rating Floor reflects Fitch's opinion that 
      while Fitch may continue to embody a view of support for U.S. G-SIFIs in 
      ratings over the near term, Fitch believes that broad policy momentum 
      remains to reduce taxpayer funds to support banks in times of crisis, 
      although this is progressing at uneven paces. The issue of 'too big to 
      fail' is not one that can be solved rapidly and without increased global 
      cooperation, particularly against the backdrop of still volatile 
      financial markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch will continue to assess this view of support in light of further 
      regulatory developments, the macro environment, health of institutions 
      and the financial industry as a whole. As global market conditions 
      normalize and resolution regimes become more harmonized, Fitch would 
      reassess its current views for U.S. G-SIFIs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has upgraded the following ratings:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Support to '1' from '5';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Support floor to 'A' from 'NF'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has downgraded the following rating, and removed the Rating Watch 
      Negative:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Support floor to 'A' from 'A+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chase Bank USA, N.A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Support floor to 'A' from 'A+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed the following rating, and removed the Rating Watch 
      Negative:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase Bank N.A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Support at '1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chase Bank USA, N.A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Support at '1'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      Fitch Downgrades Goldman Sachs' L-T IDR to 'A'; Outlook Now Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.'s (Goldman) 
      long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) to 'A' from 'A+', the viability 
      rating (VR) to 'a' from 'a+' and the short-term IDR to 'F1' from 'F1+'. 
      The Rating Outlook is Stable. A complete list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These actions culminate a broader, global review of financial 
      institutions. Fitch has taken actions on several issuers globally, 
      including several global trading and universal banks (GTUBs) that were 
      put on Rating Watch Negative in October. For additional details on these 
      actions, refer to 'Fitch Downgrades Viability Ratings of Eight Global 
      Trading and Universal Banks'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's VR downgrade reflects challenges faced by the sector as a 
      whole, rather than negative developments in idiosyncratic fundamental 
      creditworthiness. Assigned ratings for Goldman, in sum, also consider 
      peer differentiation in relation to business fundamentals, 
      capitalization, liquidity strength and market position.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrade of Goldman's IDRs reflects the company's challenged 
      earnings prospects given the uncertain global economic environment and 
      the cost of increased regulation over the near to intermediate term. 
      Less robust earnings could impact the firm's capital generation. Goldman 
      relies significantly on trading revenues, more so than many of its peer 
      GTUBs, which are more volatile than other more traditional banking 
      activities. Many of its activities are also expected to carry higher 
      risk weights under Basel III, making these activities potentially less 
      profitable going forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ultimately, higher capital requirements, central clearing of 
      derivatives, restricted proprietary trading and investment activity 
      result in a potentially more conservative risk profile for Goldman and 
      peers, which is a benefit to debt holders. However, the costs to comply 
      with these rules will add to margin pressure and earnings over time will 
      conceivably be lower.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, Goldman is primarily wholesale funded, which Fitch believes makes 
      it more vulnerable to funding and rollover risks than its GTUB peers. 
      While all GTUBs are susceptible to confidence sensitivity, the risk for 
      investment banks can be more acute during periods of market-wide 
      dislocation or idiosyncratic company-specific stress. Mitigating this 
      risk is the fact that the company is now a financial holding company 
      regulated by the Federal Reserve Bank, which provides access to 
      contingent funding programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the aforementioned rating actions, Fitch upgraded 
      Goldman's support rating to '1' and its support rating floor to 'A'. 
      This action acknowledges that Goldman was recently designated a global 
      systemically important financial institution (G-SIFI). Fitch has 
      determined that an expectation of future extraordinary capital support 
      would be less likely than that previously received.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, for the foreseeable future, Fitch is likely to maintain its 
      view of support for U.S. based G-SIFIs given the still fragile state of 
      the global financial markets. For more details on Fitch's rationale on 
      its support ratings and support floors, please refer to 'U.S. Banks -- 
      Sovereign Support: When Does it End' dated Dec. 15, 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Stable Outlook reflects the firm's solid liquidity position and 
      reduced balance sheet leverage, which positions the firm to more 
      effectively withstand a weaker market environment. The current rating 
      level also acknowledges Goldman's leading global investment banking 
      franchise, as well as strong risk management culture.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The firm has taken several positive steps to strengthen its liquidity 
      profile so that it can withstand meaningful market stresses. Goldman 
      maintains excess liquidity in the form of its global core excess against 
      stressed liquidity outflows. The firm also has a more liquid balance 
      sheet and has extended its maturity profiles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Any material losses, significant increase in leverage for more than a 
      few quarters or liquidity deterioration would likely result in downward 
      rating pressure. Likewise, any unforeseen outsized or unusual fines, 
      settlements or charges levied could also have adverse ratings 
      implications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman's hybrid capital instruments (preferred securities) were 
      downgraded in tandem with the lower long-term IDR. The Rating Watch 
      Negative that remains on the bank's hybrid securities reflects 
      heightened downgrade risk. Resolution of this Rating Watch will occur 
      upon completion of Fitch's pending review of its rating approach for 
      bank regulatory capital and similar securities. This review was 
      initiated by the exposure draft entitled 'Rating Bank Regulatory Capital 
      Securities' published on July 28, 2011 and available at 'www.fitchratings.com'. 
      All other debt instruments are removed from Rating Watch Negative.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. is a top tier global bank, providing 
      capital markets, financial advisory, asset management and securities 
      services. The company is an active market maker in most global markets, 
      facilitating trading on behalf of its customers, and also committing 
      firm capital to investing and lending opportunities. Business activities 
      are divided into four segments: (1) Investment Banking, (2) 
      Institutional Client Services (3) Investing  Lending, and (4) 
      Investment Management.

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - A $10.6 billion lawsuit against U.S. oil company Chevron (CVX.N) and rig contractor Transocean (RIGN.VX) could further cool an increasingly chilly investment climate in Brazil's natural resources industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in response to a small oil spill off Brazil's coast on November 7, will likely drag on for years and seeks to shut down the companies' local operations. But its biggest impact may be on investors, both foreign and Brazilian, who are being asked to spend upward of $600 billion to turn Brazil up among the world's top three or four oil producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case comes at a time when Brazil is rewriting its oil regulations to give the government greater control over the country's oil wealth, an overhaul that has forced delays in investment projects and auctions for new drilling licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chevron lawsuit is an abrupt reminder of the legal pitfalls that companies also face in Brazil, where a new generation of crusading prosecutors has emerged in recent years, irking the public and private sector alike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The situation is extremely worrisome," said Wagner Freire, a former exploration and production director at Petrobras (PETR4.SA) (PBR.N), Brazil's state-controlled oil company. "Not only does there seem to be almost no technical basis for the suit, the political overtones are the latest example of the enormous steps backward the industry is taking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, for 20 billion reais ($10.6 billion), was filed on Wednesday by federal prosecutors in Campos, a city in Rio de Janeiro state close to Brazil's main offshore oil fields. It seeks punitive damages for the spill of about 3,000 barrels of oil from the Chevron-operated Frade field in the Atlantic Ocean northeast of Rio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the lawsuit does not name Petrobras, a partner in Frade, it may be affected since seven of Transocean's 10 rigs working in Brazil are under contract with the local giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spill was met with an uproar that highlighted a resurgence of nationalism around Brazil's vast natural resources, with government officials and legislators publicly lambasting Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's Federal Police and oil regulator ANP are still investigating the causes of the Chevron leak, which was less than 1 percent of the size of the 2010 Macondo spill involving a Transocean rig working for BP (BP.L) in the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit claims that Chevron, which has accepted full responsibility for the spill, and Transocean did not have proper contingency plans in place to respond to an accident. It also says they failed to estimate well pressure and rock strength, showing negligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the oil reached shore or formed a slick, Brazilian authorities said. Less than one barrel remains on the surface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This looks like an unfortunate accident caused by a kick, or unexpected reservoir pressure, a pretty common occurrence," said Benjamin Sodre, a Rio de Janeiro petroleum geologist with nearly 70 years of experience. "The equipment on site worked and prevented a blowout like the one in the Gulf."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar trend is playing out in Brazil's mining industry, underscoring the growing concerns about the investment climate here. Earlier this year, the government pressed for management changes at mining giant Vale (VALE5.SA)(VALE.N), a private company. It is also rewriting the mining code, and two states are trying impose new taxes on metals extraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CRUSADING PROSECUTORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the damages sought in the Chevron case surprised even those who want less foreign involvement in Brazilian oil and none of Brazil's four largest newspapers considered the suit serious enough to put on their front pages on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have to be reasonable," Candido Vaccarezza, the leader of President Dilma Rousseff's Workers' Party in the lower house of Congress, told Reuters in Brasilia. "It's strange that prosecutors have come up with this number. Do you think it's right to ask for 20 billion reais without a study, nothing? Has Chevron even made that much profit in Brazil? I don't know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company has net assets worth about $4.2 billion in the country, or about $2 per share, analysts at Tudor Pickering Holt said on Thursday. Chevron shares were down by less than 1 percent at $99.67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While respected for cracking down on government corruption in recent years, some prosecutors in Brazil have been accused of mixing politics with the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Brazilian Amazon, the Rousseff government is asking for the removal of the lead prosecutor in a suit against a government-backed hydroelectric dam after newspapers reported that he was allegedly involved in organizing anti-dam protests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chevron lawsuit comes at a time of heightened political debate around oil in Brazil, where the nationalist slogan "o petr&#243;leo &#233; nosso," or "the oil is ours," is back in vogue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Congress has voted to redistribute billions of dollars of oil royalties from Rio and other oil-producing states to the rest of the country, threatening the main revenue source of cities such as Campos, where the suit was filed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The royalty issue is part of series of "negative" changes to Brazil's oil laws in the last few years, said a former top executive of one of the three largest foreign oil companies operating in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include reducing the independence of regulator ANP and changes to oil concession rules boosting the dominance of Petrobras, already a source of national pride, in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unable to totally change the rules that built this industry, they're subverting them instead," the executive said, speaking on condition of anonymity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This environment will slow development, raise costs in the expensive and technologically challenging offshore areas where most of Brazil's oil lies, and boost government power over oil wealth, said Freire, the former Petrobras director. Petrobras, despite $225 billion of planned investment over five years, a continuation of the world's largest investment plan, will see output grow by less than 1 percent in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cases like this will chase away the Exxons, and Shells that have the know-how to create a competitive and efficient oil industry," he said. "Petrobras can't do it on its own."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 1.86 Brazilian reais)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Leila Coimbra in Rio de Janeiro, Maria Carolina Marcello in Brasilia and Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Editing by Todd Benson and Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Executives at the Mexican Coke giant told Reuters they expect to make further acquisitions and use their solid cash position to pay down debt they will acquire with the latest purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are going to keep looking for opportunities to continue growing this business," Chief Executive Carlos Salazar said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke Femsa dominates Mexico's Coke bottling industry and the acquisition announced on Thursday will widen the gap with its closest rival, Arca Continental (AC.MX), which began the bottling consolidation rush with its combination at the start of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest deal to combine Coke Femsa's (KOFL.MX), or KOF's, bottling business with that of Grupo Fomento Queretano is valued at 6.6 billon pesos ($479 million), including 1.2 billion pesos in debt that it will assume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The debt could be paid off immediately, Coke Femsa's Chief Financial Officer Hector Trevino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Grupo Fomento Queretano is one of the oldest Coke bottlers in Mexico and it operates in the center of the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders in the smaller company will receive 45.1 million of series L FEMSA shares in a new offering valued at 119.29 pesos per share, or 5.38 million pesos ($390 million) in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is subject to approval by Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), which is a joint-venture partner in Coke Femsa with Mexican retailer Femsa, and Mexico's competition regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Coke Femsa were up 1.6 percent at 121.95 pesos in local trading on Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares are up 17.5 percent since the start of the year, partly on the string of acquisitions the company has announced, even as higher prices for raw materials have dragged on recent earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ACQUISITIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Grupo Fomento Queretano purchase is Coke Femsa's third announced this year, after it completed its acquisition of family-owned bottler Grupo Cimsa earlier this week and another bottler known as Tampico in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The three deals that we have announced this year will add ... more than 12 billion pesos in revenues to our Mexican operations, which is about a 30 percent increase," said Salazar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke Femsa also completed the purchase in March this year of a Panama dairy company it had announced it would buy in October 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even after shelling out for multiple purchases this year, analysts fully expect Coke Femsa will consider further expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the combined scale of the businesses will reinforce KOF's leadership position in Mexico and help the company realize some synergies," said analysts at ratings agency Standard &amp; Poor's in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We further believe the company will continue pursuing growth opportunities in Mexico and internationally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke Femsa produces and sells Coke and other drinks in Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Panama, Colombia, Venezuela, Brazil and Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 13.77 Mexican pesos)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Veronica Gomez and Elinor Comlay; Editing by Dave Zimmerman, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) will stay the course in Brazil even as that country said it has filed a massive $11 billion lawsuit related to an offshore oil spill, a top company executive said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"We are committed to Brazil," Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron's Latin American exploration and production unit, told reporters at a conference in Houston. "We continue to work with the federal government of Brazil, with all the agencies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release of 2,400 barrels of oil from the Frade Field was an "unfortunate incident" and the company is doing what it can to solve the problem and move ahead, Moshiri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazilian prosecutors sued Chevron and rig operator Transocean Ltd (RIGN.VX) on Wednesday over their alleged roles in the November oil spill. The lawsuit seeks to suspend the companies from operating in that country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Phil Weiss, oil analyst at Argus Research in New York, found the figure to be "really excessive," adding that no other oil company would ever drill off of Brazil if this was the potential penalty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a hard time seeing how it's going to stick," Weiss said on Wednesday. "Unless this is Brazil's way of saying they want Petrobras to do everything themselves offshore."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Petrobras (PETR4.SA), Brazil's national oil company, accounts for more than 90 percent of the country's output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's Moshiri said it was important to note that the oil company stopped the source of the leak in four days and it has provided all of its resources to make sure there is no environmental impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil has vast offshore reserves of crude oil and large western oil companies like Chevron are eager for access to those resources to grow their own output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Ramon, California-based Chevron has already assumed responsibility for leaking oil into water off the coast of Rio de Janeiro. It has been fined $28 million by environmental authorities for the spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Chevron said the company has yet to receive formal notice of the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron fell 1 percent to $99.63 in late New York Stock Exchange trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Braden Reddall; editing by Gerald E.McCormick, Bernard Orr )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Barbara Walters said she had hoped to get an interview with the person atop her 2011 Most Fascinating People list, but those hopes were dashed in October.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Walters revealed in her annual "10 Most Fascinating People of 2011" ABC special Wednesday that Apple founder Steve Jobs, who died on October 5, was still her top choice for the list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walters noted that picking Jobs went against a rule for her specials -- that the most fascinating people are always people who are still alive. But she added that it was appropriate because "rules were made to be broken, and that's certainly how Steve Jobs lived his life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the 90-minute special, Walters did chat with other celebs on her list, including Simon Cowell, who 'fessed up to wanting to have sex with Paula Abdul during their "American Idol" days; Yankee all-star Derek Jeter, who said he hopes to own his own baseball team someday; and, yes, the Kardashians, with Walters grilling Kim Kardashian about her infamous, career-launching sex tape and massive success despite a perceived lack of talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About the sex tape: "I've made mistakes in my life for sure," Kardashian admitted, before mom Kris Jenner jumped in to add, "It was devastating for the whole family. You cry yourself to sleep for a few nights, then you hire an attorney."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And then you turn your whole family into a brand....&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And about that, Walters actually went there, telling Kim, "You don't really act, you don't sing, you don't dance &#8230; you don't have any -- forgive me -- any talent!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Kardashian's defense: "I think it's more of a challenge for you to go on a reality show, and get people to fall in love with you for being you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"None of us think we have talent," sister Khloe Kardashian added. "None of us think we can sing or act or dance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least we can all agree on that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other celebs on Walters' list: Pippa Middleton, Katy Perry, Herman Cain, Amanda Knox, Donald Trump, Eric Stonestreet and Jesse Tyler Ferguson.&lt;/p&gt;

			Procter  Gamble Box Elder Employee Resource 
      Center First New PG Building to Earn LEED Certification
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Procter  Gamble [NYSE: PG] announced that the new Employee Resource 
      Center opening today at its Family Care Box Elder Plant has received 
      LEED Silver certification.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to announce this first LEED certified office building 
      for PG globally,&#8221; says Yannis Skoufalos, PG global product supply 
      officer. &#8220;This is the first step on our journey to certify all 
      new PG sites. We are committed to the sustainable design of our 
      facilities, and earning LEED certification is a great way to ensure that 
      we are applying the best design and construction practices to our 
      buildings.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG announced plans on February 25, 2011 to pursue LEED (Leadership in 
      Energy and Environmental Design) certification for all new sites. While 
      most of the new Box Elder plant was already up and running, last spring 
      the site began constructing a new employee services building, including 
      work to pursue LEED certification. The certification has ensured rigor 
      in the design and construction process, including waste management 
      programs to recycle/reuse construction materials, improved environmental 
      quality of the building through abundant natural lighting and indoor air 
      quality control.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Established by the U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC), LEED is the 
      internationally recognized preeminent program for the design, 
      construction and operation of high performance green buildings. &#8220;PG is 
      to be commended for achieving LEED Silver on its Employee Resource 
      Center. This facility is one that both its employees and the larger 
      community can be proud of,&#8221; said President, CEO,  Founding Chair, U.S. 
      Green Building Council, Rick Fedrizzi. &#8220;PG&#8217;s Employee Resource Center 
      will be a showcase for high-performance, energy-efficient, healthy plant 
      facilities, and an inspiration for others.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All new PG sites that are currently in design phase or early 
      construction are working toward achieving LEED certification. This 
      effort advances PG&#8217;s environmental sustainability program, which is 
      focused on reducing the environmental footprint of its products and 
      operations. This supports PG&#8217;s long-term environmental vision, 
      announced in September 2010, which includes powering all plants with 
      renewable energy and having zero manufacturing waste going to landfill.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Box Elder site has continued to drive notable environmental 
      performance such as:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Water: The plant is reducing the amount of water used by 
        reusing and recycling water internally for reuse in its process 
        cleaning operations.
      
			
				Waste: The site has implemented a program to minimize solid 
        waste and increase reuse offsite. As a result, it is on track to 
        achieve status as Family Care&#8217;s first site to achieve zero 
        manufacturing waste to landfill.
      
			
				Energy: Innovative facility features such as day-lighted 
        production and warehousing space makes Box Elder among Family Care&#8217;s 
        most energy efficient plants.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Several additional new PG sites are currently working toward the same 
      distinction globally. PG is currently pursuing LEED certification for 
      plants in Taicang, China and Indonesia, and its Singapore Innovation 
      Center.

      Fitch: No Rating Actions on 2 SF Transactions Following JPMorgan Chase 
      Bank Downgrade
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings announces that the underlying note ratings on the Bear 
      Stearns Asset Backed Securities Trust 2003-ABF1 and Juniper CBO 2000 I 
      Ltd. transactions are not negatively affected by the recent downgrade of 
      JPMorgan Chase Bank. N.A. (JPM) by another rating agency. As a hedge 
      provider in the two transactions, JPM's current rating ('AA-/F1+') is 
      currently in line with Fitch's counterparty criteria. The agency would 
      expect remedial action (or a possible negative rating action) if JPM's 
      rating were downgraded below 'A' or 'F1' in the future.

      Fitch Takes Various Actions JPMCC 2004-PNC1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded two subordinate classes and upgraded one 
      class of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., series 
      2004-PNC1 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed list 
      of rating actions follows the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades of classes F and G reflect greater certainty of Fitch 
      expected losses from specially serviced assets which will reduce credit 
      enhancement to the classes. Fitch modeled losses of 4.32% of the 
      outstanding pool, of which 1.61% are from specially serviced loans. The 
      expected losses of the original pool are at 5.16%, which includes losses 
      of 4% to date. Current cumulative interest shortfalls totaling 
      $2,437,144 are affecting classes H through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the November 2011 distribution date, the pool's certificate 
      balance has paid down 24.21% to $787.7 million from $1 billion. Fitch 
      has identified 19 (14.6%) Fitch Loans of Concern (LOC), of which 3 
      (3.1%) are specially serviced. In addition, there are 16 (26.7%) 
      defeased loans within the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to Fitch expected losses is a loan (0.83%) 
      secured a by 236 unit apartment building located in Arlington, TX. The 
      most recent occupancy reported by the Master Servicer is 39.4% as of 
      June 2011 and the property does not produce sufficient income to meet 
      its debt service obligations. The loan remains current and the master 
      servicer continues to monitor performance of the loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to Fitch expected losses is a loan 
      (1.12%) collateralized by a 77,952 square feet (sf) suburban office 
      building located in Phoenix, AZ. The loan transferred to special 
      servicing in November 2009 for monetary default due to the loss of the 
      largest tenant. Occupancy has not improved and a receiver has been 
      appointed. The special servicer is working to stabilize occupancy before 
      disposing of the asset.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to Fitch expected losses is a loan (1.54%) 
      secured by a 172,758-sf grocery anchored retail center located in Palm 
      Coast, FL. The loan transferred to special servicing in April 2011 for 
      imminent maturity default. The borrower was granted a one year extension 
      and is current on debt service payments. In June 2011 second largest 
      tenant (20.6%), Beall's, went dark but continues to pay rent through the 
      April 2012 lease maturity. In addition, Blockbuster (3.8%) is vacating 
      their space in Dec. 2011. The special servicer reports the property is 
      57% occupied as of Oct. 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch downgrades the following classes and assigns Recovery Estimates 
      (REs) as indicated:

      --$16.4 million class F to 'CCCsf' from 'B-sf'; RE 100%;--$10.9

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      indicated:

      Stable;--$10.9 million class E at 'Bsf'; Outlook Stable;--$16.4 
      million class H at 'Dsf'; RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not rate class NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Class A-1 and A-2 have paid in full. Classes J, K, L, M, N and P remain 
      at 'D' with a Recovery Estimate of 0% due to losses incurred.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has previously withdrawn the ratings on the interest-only class X.

&lt;p&gt;* Moscow pledges at least $10 bln in eurozone aid via IMF&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Russia, EU agree roadmap to visa-free travel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* EU Van Rompuy issues qualified criticism of Russia vote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Alexei Anishchuk and Sebastian Moffett&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Russia and the European
Union agreed on Thursday on moves towards visa-free travel and
funds for indebted euro zone countries, but they failed to make
any breakthrough on long-term energy disagreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Advances towards visa-free travel depend on the
implementation of a number of "common steps" such as introducing
biometric passports and preventing illegal migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This decision has clear potential benefits to our citizens
and for people-to-people contacts," said European Commission
President Jose Manuel Barroso, who participated in EU-Russia
summit. "But this will probably not happen next year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia pledged to give at least $10 billion to help indebted
euro zone countries via the International Monetary Fund.
Previous statements from Moscow had indicated $10 billion would
be the upper limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kremlin economic aide Arkady Dvorkovich told reporters
before the main summit meeting: "Ten billion dollars is the
minimum commitment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer followed a summit of EU leaders last week, where
nearly all countries agreed to a pact for tighter fiscal rules
and to give new funds and loans to the IMF - with a provisional
total of up to 200 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Russia has 41 percent of its currency reserves invested in
euro or euro-nominated securities," President Dmitry Medvedev
told the summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Therefore we will provide aid ... and we are ready to
invest," he said, adding Russia was also "ready to consider
other support measures".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medvedev visited Brussels against the background of
declining economic fortunes on both sides and political
controversy in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks after parliamentary elections that drew
accusations of fraud, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin confirmed on
Thursday he intends to appoint Medvedev as prime minister
following a March election expected to return Putin to the
presidency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Herman Van Rompuy, President of the European Council, which
represents EU member states' governments, criticised the
elections - though tempered this by praising the handling of
recent demonstrations and welcoming Russian government pledges
to investigate problems with the elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are concerned by irregularities and lack of fairness,"
Van Rompuy told a news conference after meetings with Medvedev.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And we are concerned by the detention of protesters. In
contrast, the recent large demonstrations were peaceful and the
authorities, in my view, handled it very well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INTER-DEPENDENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU and Russia have become heavily inter-dependent
through energy and commercial links, but they also disagree
sharply on some subjects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual trade between the two sides is worth about 400
billion dollars - about half the value of Russia's total foreign
trade. Commercial links are expected to grow after Russia joins
the World Trade Organisation, which is scheduled to be finalised
in Geneva on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa-free travel could enhance economic and other links,
officials say. Currently the 2.5 million or so Russians that
visit the Schengen border-free area each year need to apply in
advance for visas - which likely dissuades potential tourists to
southern European countries such as Greece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Russia has repeatedly criticised EU regulations,
known as the third energy package, that seek to liberalise the
European gas market by barring suppliers from controlling the
transport infrastructure used to deliver their gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medvedev has also said a proposed gas pipeline that would
transport natural gas from Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan to
Europe, circumventing both Russia and Iran, violated the
interests of Caspian states and could damage the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Medvedev praised the launch last month of the first
arm of the 1,224 kilometre (761 mile) Nord Stream pipeline from
Western Siberia to Germany, which will initially handle 27.5
billion cubic metres of gas a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is expected to rise to 55 billion cubic metres once a
second adjacent pipeline is completed in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In any case Russia remains a reliable exporter of
hydrocarbons to Europe and this long term successful experience
of joint work will be continued," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

      Denver-based Junction Solutions (www.junctionsolutions.com), 
      a provider of vertical, market-specific on-premise and on-demand 
      software applications and services for the Food and Beverage, 
      Multi-Channel Retail and Distribution industries, today announced that 
      Simon Pearce (www.simonpearce.com), 
      a designer, manufacturer and marketer of original products in hand blown 
      glass and handmade pottery, has implemented Microsoft Dynamics&#174; AX, 
      Microsoft Dynamics AX for Retail, and JunctionMCR&#8482;, an end-to-end 
      solution set designed for multi-channel retailers. Built in Microsoft 
      Dynamics AX, JunctionMCR gives Simon Pearce the flexibility to 
      accommodate business growth, access to real-time business and reporting 
      information throughout the enterprise and across all sales channels, and 
      the ability to expand into mobile retail.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Junction Solutions completed the implementation of Microsoft Dynamics AX 
      and JunctionMCR against a challenging six month schedule to get Simon 
      Pearce live in time for the busy holiday season. The Junction Solutions 
      team also worked with Simon Pearce&#8217;s human resources team to roll out an 
      innovative training program that got employees ready for the go live and 
      established training processes for new employees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We wanted to have a solution we could really build upon over time and 
      that is what Microsoft Dynamics AX and JunctionMCR will allow us to do,&#8221; 
      said Bill Heston, director of information services, Simon Pearce. &#8220;The 
      world is changing so fast. You don&#8217;t know what direction you&#8217;ll need to 
      move in. That&#8217;s why flexibility is so critical. The solution allows us 
      to move with a fast-paced marketplace.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With this new solution, many of Simon Pearce&#8217;s manual processes are 
      streamlined and automated. Numerous disparate systems have been unified, 
      providing employees across the company with complete visibility into 
      customer and order data. The company has also updated its gift card and 
      gift registry capabilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Simon Pearce required a unified platform to provide us with a singular 
      view of reporting data across our operations to make better business 
      decisions,&#8221; said Terri Pare, executive director of finance and 
      administration, Simon Pearce. &#8220;We also required both flexibility and 
      scalability to enable growth, in a user-friendly solution. This solution 
      set will also allow us to expand and we won&#8217;t have to go through this 
      implementation process in another two years to meet our needs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The strong partnership between Junction Solutions and Simon Pearce has 
      allowed us to successfully implement an integrated solution that will 
      provide them with the capabilities they need to deliver on their 
      customer&#8217;s high service expectations,&#8221; said Jeff Marker, senior vice 
      president, retail, Junction Solutions. &#8220;They now have a complete 
      solution that gives them visibility, flexibility, and scalability for 
      future growth and expansion &#8211; all in a familiar, user-friendly 
      environment.&#8221;

      &#8220;While the technology to make biobased materials in a lab has been 
      available for many years, we believe Gevo possess technologies that have 
      high potential to create it on a global commercial level within the next 
      few years,&#8221; said Rick Frazier, Vice President Commercial Product Supply, 
      The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;This is a significant RD investment in 
      packaging innovation and is the next step toward our vision of creating 
      all of our PET plastic packaging from responsibly sourced plant 
      materials.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola identified Gevo as a leader in the race to commercialize 
      renewable PET following an exhaustive search and evaluation of 
      technologies from around the world. The global market for PET is 54 
      million metric tons and has a value of $100 billion, with approximately 
      30% used for plastic bottles. In this next generation of PlantBottle&#8482; 
      packaging, Coca-Cola plans to produce bottles entirely from renewable 
      raw materials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are extremely gratified to have won the confidence of The Coca-Cola 
      Company and are excited to support Coca-Cola&#8217;s sustainable packaging 
      goals with this agreement to develop and commercialize technology to 
      produce para-xylene from biobased isobutanol,&#8221; said Patrick Gruber, CEO 
      of Gevo. &#8220;New technologies need champions. The Coca-Cola Company is in a 
      unique position to drive and influence change in the global packaging 
      supply chain with this development. You cannot ask for a better champion 
      than one of the world&#8217;s most respected and admired consumer brands.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Isobutanol is a four-carbon fermentation alcohol that can be converted 
      into para-xylene using known chemical processes. Para-xylene is a key 
      raw material in PET production. Gevo has previously announced supplying 
      Japanese chemical giant Toray with lab-scale quantities of renewable 
      para-xylene. Toray has successfully converted Gevo&#8217;s para-xylene into 
      PET films and fibers.

			The Coca-Cola Company Announces Partnerships to 
      Develop Commercial Solutions for Plastic Bottles Made Entirely from 
      Plants
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Breakthrough Technologies from Virent, Gevo and Avantium Selected 
      to Reach Global Scale
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company today announced multi-million dollar partnership 
      agreements with three leading biotechnology companies to accelerate 
      development of the first commercial solutions for next-generation 
      PlantBottle&#8482; packaging made 100% from plant-based materials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This effort to commercialize a plastic bottle made entirely from plants 
      builds on the Company&#8217;s ground-breaking introduction and roll-out of its 
      first generation PlantBottle&#8482; package which was the first ever 
      recyclable PET beverage bottle made partially from plants. Since 
      introduced in 2009, the Company has already distributed more than 10 
      billion PlantBottle&#8482; packages in 20 countries worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Agreements with Virent, Gevo and Avantium &#8211; industry leaders in 
      developing plant-based alternatives to materials traditionally made from 
      fossil fuels and other non-renewable resources &#8211; were signed following 
      an in-depth two year analysis of different
			technologies by The 
      Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s RD team and technical advisory board.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While the technology to make bio-based materials in a lab has been 
      available for years, we believe Virent, Gevo and Avantium are companies 
      that possess technologies that have high potential for creating them on 
      a global commercial scale within the next few years,&#8221; said Rick Frazier, 
      Vice President, Commercial Product Supply, The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;This 
      is a significant RD investment in packaging innovation and is the next 
      step toward our vision of creating all of our plastic packaging from 
      responsibly sourced plant-based materials.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Agreements with these three companies will help The Coca-Cola Company 
      support its long-term commitments through sustainable practices in 
      sourcing and packaging supply. While Virent, Gevo and Avantium will 
      follow their own route to make bio-based materials, all materials will 
      be developed in line with Company and industry recycling requirements.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Virent&#8217;s long term agreements with The Coca-Cola Company are pioneering 
      milestones in the commercialization of our technology to produce 
      plant-based materials,&#8221; said Virent CEO Lee Edwards. &#8220;Our patented 
      technology features catalytic chemistry to convert plant-based sugars 
      into a full range of products identical to those made from petroleum, 
      including bio-based paraxylene &#8211; a key component needed to deliver 100% 
      plant-based PET packaging.&#8221; PET made from Virent&#8217;s bio-based paraxylene 
      features the same high quality and recyclability as materials used 
      today, with the added benefit of being made from a wide range of 
      renewable materials. The company is targeting early 2015 for the opening 
      of its first full-scale commercial plant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are extremely gratified to have won the confidence of The Coca-Cola 
      Company and are excited to support Coca-Cola&#8217;s sustainable packaging 
      goals with this agreement to develop and commercialize technology to 
      produce paraxylene from bio-based isobutanol,&#8221; said Patrick Gruber, CEO 
      of Gevo. &#8220;New technologies need champions. The Coca-Cola Company is in a 
      unique position to drive and influence change in the global packaging 
      supply chain with this development. You cannot ask for a better champion 
      than one of the most respected and admired consumer brands.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Avantium is very proud to partner with The Coca-Cola Company to 
      demonstrate that our patented &#8220;YXY&#8221; technology produces bio-based PEF 
      bottles with exceptional functional properties at a competitive price,&#8221; 
      says Tom van Aken, CEO of Avantium. &#8220;YXY is a very exciting solution for 
      today&#8217;s packaging challenges, using plant-based materials as feedstock 
      to enable the manufacture of more sustainable packaging materials, such 
      as PEF bottles. We have produced PEF bottles with promising barrier and 
      thermal properties and look forward to our work with Coca-Cola to 
      further develop and commercialize PEF bottles. Our production process 
      fits with existing supply and manufacturing chains and we are targeting 
      commercial production in the next few years.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s first generation PlantBottle&#8482; packaging is the 
      only fully recyclable PET bottle made with up to 30% plant-based 
      material available today. PlantBottle&#8482; packaging is made up of two 
      components: MEG (mono-ethylene glycol), which makes up 30% of the PET, 
      and is already made from plant materials, and PTA (purified terephthalic 
      acid), which makes up the other 70%. In this next step, PTA will be 
      replaced with plant-based materials, too.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PlantBottle&#8482; packaging makes a difference by reducing our dependence on 
      nonrenewable fossil fuels and minimizing the carbon impact of PET 
      plastic. It is estimated the use of PlantBottle&#8482; packaging in the first 
      two years alone has helped save the equivalent annual emissions of more 
      than 100,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide. Coca-Cola will continue to 
      make investments in PlantBottle&#8482; technology and aims to use PlantBottle&#8482; 
      packaging for the Company&#8217;s entire virgin PET supply by 2020.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a leader in sustainable packaging, the Company also looks for 
      opportunities to advance smart innovation across the industry. Earlier 
      this year, The Coca-Cola Company announced an industry-first partnership 
      with H.J. Heinz Company that allows Heinz to produce its ketchup bottles 
      using PlantBottle&#8482; technology. Heinz PlantBottle&#8482; packaging launched 
      this summer in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Separately, Coca-Cola already produces a fully recyclable HDPE (high 
      density polyethylene) plastic that is made 100% from plant material and 
      is available through Odwalla&#8482; juice brand products. While HDPE is an 
      ideal package for some refrigerated juice products, it is not suitable 
      for shelf-stable carbonated and still beverages.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N), the biggest U.S. bank, and two large credit unions have taken the lead in cleaning up the banking industry's fee-laden fine print for checking accounts, an advocacy group said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase, the Pentagon Federal Credit Union and the North Carolina State Employees' Credit Union have started presenting account fee schedules in simple, boxed tables of three pages or less, according to the Pew Health Group, the health and consumer-product safety arm of the Pew Charitable Trusts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fee disclosure documents for large banks typically run 111 pages and hide important fees from customers in technical fine print, according to an April report by Pew's Safe Checking in the Electronic Age Project. Bank fees became a focus of federal lawmakers in the aftermath of the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many people have been surprised by fees they were charged, Pew researchers found in interviews with consumers. Fee disclosures are too dense for consumers to know better, said Susan Weinstock, director of the Pew project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is basically impossible to comparison shop for a checking account," Weinstock said in an interview. She hopes the new tables will change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase is posting its first table online on Thursday for its most-used "Total Checking" account. The bank plans to roll out similar presentations for other types of accounts in the new year, Ryan McInerney, CEO of the company's consumer bank, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another large bank and some regional banks and other credit unions are working to bring out simplified tables of their own soon, Weinstock said . She is calling on the government's new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to require all banks to do the same.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks' fee revenue could come under pressure if it is easier for consumers to compare charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As JPMorgan Chase began to boil down the fees into a table, executives decided some were bad for business and had to go. For example, the bank dropped charges of $25 for closing an account within 90 days of opening it and $15 to receive a rush copy of an item.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think this will create more loyal customers and grow our business," McInerney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;McInerney said the moves will pay off with higher revenues over time by winning over more customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase began work on the new disclosure shortly after Pew released its critical report in April. The bank tested the table with customers in focus groups and interviews, and then refined it , McInerney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long legal disclosures of terms and conditions will continue to exist. For those who want to check the details, McInerney said the bank intends to embed Internet links to the fine print in online copies of its tables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By David Henry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CORAL GABLES, Fla., Dec. 15, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Catalyst Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. (Nasdaq:CPRX) (Company) today announced that a scientific paper on CPP-115 describing preclinical data supporting its use as a treatment for cocaine addiction, its pharmacological target specificity, and its visual safety was accepted for publication in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (JMC). The paper, entitled "(1S,3S)-3-Amino-4-difluoromethylenyl-1-cyclopentanoic Acid (CPP-115), a Potent y-Aminobutyric Acid Aminotransferase Inactivator for the Treatment of Cocaine Addiction" by Yue Pan, Madina R. Gerasimov, Trine Kvist, Petrine Wellendorph, Karsten K. Madsen, Elena Pera, Hyunbeom Lee, Arne Schousboe, Mary Chebib, Hans Brauner-Osborne, Cheryl M. Craft, Jonathan D. Brodie, Wynne K. Schiffer, Stephen L. Dewey, Stephen R. Miller, and Richard B. Silverman, was recently posted in JMC's web edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About The Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Vigabatrin, a GABA aminotransferase (GABA-AT) inactivator, is used to treat infantile spasms and refractory complex partial seizures and is in clinical trials to evaluate its effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine addiction. CPP-115, Catalyst's novel GABA-AT inactivator, was evaluated and it was observed that CPP-115 does not exhibit other GABAergic or off-target activities and is rapidly and completely orally absorbed and eliminated. Using in vivo microdialysis techniques in freely moving rats and micro-PET imaging techniques, CPP-115 produced superior inhibition of cocaine-induced increases in extracellular dopamine and in synaptic dopamine in the nucleus accumbens at 1/300-1/600 the dose of vigabatrin. CPP-115 also blocks expression of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference at a dose that is 1/300 of vigabatrin. Electroretinographic (ERG) responses in rats, treated at doses 20-40 times higher than those needed to treat addiction in rats, exhibited reductions in ERG responses, which were significantly less than the reductions observed in rats treated with vigabatrin at the same dose needed to treat addiction in rats. In conclusion, CPP-115 can be administered at much lower doses than vigabatrin, which suggests a potential new treatment for addiction with a significantly reduced risk of visual field defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			About Catalyst Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Catalyst Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. is a development-stage biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of prescription drugs targeting diseases of the central nervous system with a focus on the treatment of addiction and epilepsy. Catalyst has two products in development, and is currently evaluating its lead product and first-in-class GABA aminotransferase inhibitor candidate, CPP-109 (vigabatrin), for the treatment of cocaine addiction. CPP-109 has been granted "Fast Track" status by the U.S. Food  Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of cocaine addiction. Catalyst also expects to evaluate CPP-109 for the treatment of other addictions. Catalyst is also developing CPP-115, another GABA aminotransferase inhibitor that is more potent than vigabatrin and has reduced side effects (e.g., visual field defects, or VFDs) from those associated with vigabatrin. Catalyst is planning to develop CPP-115 for several indications, including drug addiction, epilepsy (initially infantile spasms) and for other selected central nervous disease indications. CPP-115 has been granted orphan-drug designation for the treatment of infantile spasms by the FDA. Catalyst believes that it controls all current intellectual property for drugs that have a mechanism of action related to the inhibition of GABA aminotransferase.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CORAL GABLES, Fla., Dec. 15, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Catalyst Pharmaceutical Partners, Inc. (Nasdaq:CPRX) (Company) today announced that a scientific paper on CPP-115 describing preclinical data supporting its use as a treatment for cocaine addiction, its pharmacological target specificity, and its visual safety was accepted for publication in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry (JMC). The paper, entitled "(1S,3S)-3-Amino-4-difluoromethylenyl-1-cyclopentanoic Acid (CPP-115), a Potent y-Aminobutyric Acid Aminotransferase Inactivator for the Treatment of Cocaine Addiction" by Yue Pan, Madina R. Gerasimov, Trine Kvist, Petrine Wellendorph, Karsten K. Madsen, Elena Pera, Hyunbeom Lee, Arne Schousboe, Mary Chebib, Hans Brauner-Osborne, Cheryl M. Craft, Jonathan D. Brodie, Wynne K. Schiffer, Stephen L. Dewey, Stephen R. Miller, and Richard B. Silverman, was recently posted in JMC's web edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
			About The Article&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Vigabatrin, a GABA aminotransferase (GABA-AT) inactivator, is used to treat infantile spasms and refractory complex partial seizures and is in clinical trials to evaluate its effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine addiction. CPP-115, Catalyst's novel GABA-AT inactivator, was evaluated and it was observed that CPP-115 does not exhibit other GABAergic or off-target activities and is rapidly and completely orally absorbed and eliminated. Using in vivo microdialysis techniques in freely moving rats and micro-PET imaging techniques, CPP-115 produced superior inhibition of cocaine-induced increases in extracellular dopamine and in synaptic dopamine in the nucleus accumbens at 1/300-1/600 the dose of vigabatrin. CPP-115 also blocks expression of cocaine-induced conditioned place preference at a dose that is 1/300 of vigabatrin. Electroretinographic (ERG) responses in rats, treated at doses 20-40 times higher than those needed to treat addiction in rats, exhibited reductions in ERG responses, which were significantly less than the reductions observed in rats treated with vigabatrin at the same dose needed to treat addiction in rats. In conclusion, CPP-115 can be administered at much lower doses than vigabatrin, which suggests a potential new treatment for addiction with a significantly reduced risk of visual field defects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

			Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. Provides Business 
      Update and 2012 Guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Full-year 2011 comparable earnings per diluted common share is 
        expected at the high end of our previously disclosed range of $2.14 to 
        $2.18.
			
			
				Share repurchase programs remain on track, with $1 billion in 
        cumulative purchases by the end of 2011 and at least $500 million in 
        planned purchases for 2012.
			
			
				2012 performance expected to generate 10 percent to 12 percent 
        currency neutral, comparable diluted earnings per common share growth.
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE/Euronext Paris: CCE) today affirmed earnings 
      per share guidance for full-year 2011 in a range of $2.14 to $2.18, with 
      results expected at the higher end of the range. Also, the company 
      expects to achieve 2012 earnings per diluted common share growth in a 
      range of 10 percent to 12 percent on a comparable and currency neutral 
      basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For both 2011 and 2012, our outlook calls for growth at or above our 
      long-term targets, demonstrating our ability to execute successfully and 
      realize the long-term potential of our territories,&#8221; said John F. Brock, 
      chairman and chief executive officer. &#8220;While we continue to face 
      challenges as a result of sustained macroeconomic weakness, we believe 
      our strategies and our successful brand portfolio will continue to 
      create value for consumers, for customers, and ultimately, for our 
      shareowners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This growth, driven by the skill and dedication of our employees and a 
      solid commitment to increasing effectiveness and enhancing customer 
      service, will, over time, enable us to achieve our most important goal &#8211; 
      creating increased value for our shareowners,&#8221; Mr. Brock said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2011 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE now expects earnings per diluted common share at the high end of the 
      range of $2.14 to $2.18. This includes a currency benefit of 
      approximately 15 cents to full-year earnings per share based on recent 
      rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revenue is expected to grow in a mid single-digit range, with expected 
      operating income growth in a high single-digit range. Full-year cost of 
      goods sold per case is expected to increase approximately 3 percent to 
      3&#189; percent. Though gross margins are expected to be down modestly for 
      the full year, operating margins are expected to be up modestly for the 
      full year. This outlook is comparable, currency neutral, and relative to 
      2010 pro forma financials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We also expect free cash flow of approximately $525 million, with 
      capital expenditures of approximately $375 million. Weighted average 
      cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent and the effective 
      tax rate for 2011 is expected to be in a range of 26 percent to 27 
      percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SHARE REPURCHASE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Share repurchase plans remain on track. CCE began repurchasing shares in 
      the fourth quarter of 2010 and this program is expected to conclude at 
      the end of 2011, with a total of $1 billion in shares repurchased. As 
      previously disclosed, a new $1 billion share repurchase program will 
      begin in January 2012, with a goal of at least $500 million in share 
      repurchases in 2012. These plans may be adjusted depending on economic, 
      operating, or other factors, including acquisition opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2012 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For 2012, we expect comparable diluted earnings per common share to grow 
      in a range of 10 percent to 12 percent, with mid single-digit to high 
      single-digit revenue growth. Comparable operating income growth is 
      expected in a mid single-digit to high single-digit range. This outlook 
      is comparable and currency neutral. Although it is very early to predict 
      the 2012 currency impact accurately, based on recent rates, currency 
      translation would decrease full-year earnings per share by approximately 
      6 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company also expects 2012 free cash flow of approximately $550 
      million, with capital expenditures of approximately $400 million. 
      Weighted average cost of debt is expected to be approximately 3 percent, 
      and the comparable effective tax rate for 2012 is expected to be in a 
      range of 26 percent to 28 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have excellent market-based programs in place that will allow us to 
      maximize the potential of opportunities such as the 2012 London Olympics 
      and the 2012 European Soccer Championship,&#8221; said Hubert Patricot, 
      executive vice president and president, European Group. &#8220;In addition, we 
      will build on our success with our Red, Black, and Silver product 
      portfolio.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ADDITIONAL KEY ITEMS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The outlook for 2012 does not reflect the potential impact of proposed 
      tax increases in France. If the current tax proposal is implemented, we 
      would expect volume growth to be impacted in France, but we are prepared 
      to manage our overall business to deliver operating income and earnings 
      per share growth at the lower end of our guidance. This guidance 
      excludes items affecting comparability and is currency neutral. The 
      company will provide an update, as appropriate, in conjunction with our 
      fourth quarter 2011 earnings call in February 2012.

			Covidien envisage une scission de sa branche Pharmacie
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Covidien plc (NYSE: COV), une soci&#233;t&#233; internationale de premier plan de 
      produits de soins de sant&#233;, a annonc&#233; aujourd'hui qu'elle envisageait 
      une scission de sa branche Pharmacie pour cr&#233;er une soci&#233;t&#233; ind&#233;pendante 
      cot&#233;e en bourse.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      La branche Pharmacie de Covidien est l'un des plus importants 
      producteurs mondiaux d'ac&#233;taminoph&#232;nes en gros, le plus important 
      fournisseur de m&#233;dicaments contre la douleur &#224; base d'opio&#239;des aux 
      &#201;tats-Unis et figure parmi les 10 plus grands fabricants de m&#233;dicaments 
      g&#233;n&#233;riques aux &#201;tats-Unis, sur la base du nombre de prescriptions. 
      Depuis 2008, cette branche a re&#231;u des autorisations de la FDA (Food and 
      Drug Administration) am&#233;ricaine pour huit nouveaux produits, dont deux 
      produits de marque contre la douleur lanc&#233;s en 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      En outre, la branche Pharmacie de Covidien est l'un des principaux 
      fournisseurs au monde de g&#233;n&#233;rateurs utilis&#233;s pour produire du 
      techn&#233;tium-99m, un isotope m&#233;dical essentiel utilis&#233; dans le diagnostic. 
      C'est &#233;galement le seul fabricant &#224; offrir un syst&#232;me enti&#232;rement 
      int&#233;gr&#233; de produits de contraste pour le diagnostic dans les seringues 
      pr&#233;-remplies et les injecteurs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#171; Depuis plusieurs ann&#233;es, nous avons &#233;valu&#233; si nous devions s&#233;parer ces 
      activit&#233;s du fait des diff&#233;rences majeures entre les secteurs des 
      produits m&#233;dicaux et de la pharmacie. Nous sommes d'avis que le moment 
      opportun est arriv&#233; car nous avons nettement am&#233;lior&#233; les op&#233;rations, le 
      rendement et le pipeline de notre activit&#233; dans les produits 
      pharmaceutiques &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; Jos&#233; E. Almeida, pr&#233;sident et directeur 
      g&#233;n&#233;ral. &#171; Bien que les deux activit&#233;s occupent des positions de premier 
      plan dans l'industrie, elles ont des mod&#232;les d'entreprise, des canaux de 
      vente, des clients, des besoins en capitaux et des r&#233;servoirs de talents 
      diff&#233;rents. Par ailleurs, leurs pipelines respectifs en mati&#232;re 
      d'innovation diff&#232;rent substantiellement en longueur, exigences 
      d'autorisation r&#233;glementaire, risques possibles et rendements 
      potentiels. &#187;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#171; Cette transaction, si elle est finalis&#233;e, procurera aux deux activit&#233;s 
      davantage de flexibilit&#233; pour se concentrer sur et poursuivre leurs 
      strat&#233;gies de croissance respectives, tout en offrant potentiellement 
      aux actionnaires plus de valeur sur le long terme &#187;, a ajout&#233; M. Almeida.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Si la scission se r&#233;alise, l'activit&#233; r&#233;sultante de Covidien dans les 
      produits m&#233;dicaux affichera des ventes annuelles d'environ 9,6 milliards 
      de dollars (sur la base des ventes communiqu&#233;es pour 2011), somme 
      partag&#233;e de fa&#231;on presque &#233;gale entre le march&#233; am&#233;ricain et le march&#233; 
      hors &#201;tats-Unis. Le segment commercial Dispositifs m&#233;dicaux 
      repr&#233;senterait environ 80 % des ventes de la soci&#233;t&#233;, celui des 
      Fournitures m&#233;dicales repr&#233;sentant la partie restante. La soci&#233;t&#233; 
      occuperait la premi&#232;re ou la deuxi&#232;me position sur le march&#233; dans des 
      cat&#233;gories repr&#233;sentant environ 90 % de ses ventes1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      La branche Pharmacie de Covidien g&#233;n&#232;re actuellement environ 2 milliards 
      de dollars de ventes annuelles, dont les deux tiers environ proviennent 
      du march&#233; am&#233;ricain. Cette concentration aux &#201;tats-Unis, o&#249; la soci&#233;t&#233; 
      occupe la position de leadership &#233;voqu&#233;e ci-dessus, permettrait &#224; la 
      nouvelle soci&#233;t&#233; de soutenir la concurrence plus efficacement dans la 
      cat&#233;gorie en pleine croissance des produits de gestion de la douleur. La 
      scission procurerait &#233;galement &#224; la nouvelle soci&#233;t&#233; de meilleures 
      opportunit&#233;s pour mettre sur le march&#233; des produits innovants 
      actuellement dans son pipeline et lui offrirait la flexibilit&#233; 
      financi&#232;re et strat&#233;gique n&#233;cessaire pour poursuivre ses plans de 
      croissance, y compris son expansion en dehors des &#201;tats-Unis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			D&#233;tails de la transaction
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Covidien anticipe que la transaction s'effectuera sous la forme d'une 
      distribution qui sera exempte d'imp&#244;t pour les actionnaires aux 
      &#201;tats-Unis d&#233;tenteurs d'une nouvelle action cot&#233;e en Bourse de la 
      nouvelle soci&#233;t&#233; pharmaceutique. Covidien estime actuellement que la 
      r&#233;alisation de la transaction pourrait prendre jusqu'&#224; 18 mois.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      La finalisation de la transaction devrait &#234;tre assujettie &#224; certaines 
      conditions dont, entre autres, la r&#233;ception des autorisations 
      r&#233;glementaires, la garantie quant au statut de franchise d'imp&#244;t de la 
      scission de l'activit&#233; Pharmacie pour nos actionnaires aux &#201;tats-Unis, 
      l'efficacit&#233; d'une d&#233;claration d'enregistrement sur formulaire 10 &#224; 
      d&#233;poser aupr&#232;s de la commission des valeurs mobili&#232;res des &#201;tats-Unis 
      (la &#171; SEC &#187;), ainsi que l'autorisation finale accord&#233;e par le conseil 
      d'administration de la soci&#233;t&#233;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Il n'est pas possible de garantir le calendrier d&#233;finitif de la 
      transaction propos&#233;e, ni m&#234;me que celle-ci sera finalis&#233;e. Covidien ne 
      pr&#233;voit pas de fournir des mises &#224; jour r&#233;guli&#232;res des progr&#232;s r&#233;alis&#233;s 
      en vue de cette s&#233;paration, mais annoncera l'approbation finale de la 
      s&#233;paration par le conseil d'administration de Covidien ou la 
      finalisation de la transaction, et effectuera les communications exig&#233;es 
      par la l&#233;gislation en vigueur.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Vos-1 discovery adds to drilling success and further underpins 
      development of world-class LNG business
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) today announced a natural gas discovery by its 
      Australian subsidiary in the Exmouth Plateau area of the Carnarvon 
      Basin, offshore Western Australia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Vos-1 well encountered&#160;approximately 453 feet (138 meters) of net 
      gas pay. Located in the WA-439-P permit area approximately 186&#160;miles 
      (300 kilometers) from Exmouth on the Western Australian coast, the well 
      was drilled in 4869 feet (1484 meters) of water to a depth of 12,461 
      feet (3798 meters).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      George Kirkland, vice chairman, Chevron Corporation, said, &#8220;The find at 
      Vos-1 represents our twelfth offshore discovery in Australia since 
      mid-2009. Our successful drilling program offshore Western Australia 
      demonstrates Chevron&#8217;s global exploration capability.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - A consortium of private equity group Silver Lake, software giant Microsoft Corp and venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz are reworking their bid for a minority stake in Internet company Yahoo Inc, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Silver Lake's consortium is working on a new offer for a stake of 10 to 15 percent in Yahoo after the company asked for improved terms, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new offer would be predicated on Yahoo finding a new, world-class chief executive that the consortium would support, the source added. Yahoo's board fired CEO Carol Bartz in September and has yet to hire a permanent replacement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported earlier on Friday, citing people familiar with the matter, that private equity firms seeking to acquire just under 20 percent of Yahoo were working on new offers for a smaller stake at a higher per-share valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TPG Capital, which sources previously told Reuters had also bid for a minority stake, did not respond to a request for comment. Representatives of Silver Lake and Microsoft declined to comment while an Andreessen Horowitz spokeswoman could not immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As previously announced, the board is evaluating various alternatives as part of its comprehensive strategic review process, all of which are designed to enhance shareholder value and promote growth and innovation at Yahoo," a Yahoo spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The board's process is open to all alternatives and has not restricted the range of various options or proposals in any way," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first offer by Silver Lake's consortium valued Yahoo at $16.6 per share, about $1 per share less than what TPG proposed, people familiar the matter had previously told Reuters. Yahoo shares closed down 1.3 percent at $14.96 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has several available options. Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, in which Yahoo has a 40 percent stake, is preparing a $4 billion bank loan to buy back that stake, Thomson Reuters publication Basis Point reported on Thursday, citing sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Alibaba could choose to partner with buyout groups Blackstone Group LP and Bain Capital and Japan's Softbank Corp for a full-out bid for Yahoo, sources familiar with the matter have previously told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity firm Thomas H. Lee Partners is interested in buying the U.S. operations of Yahoo, people familiar with the matter have also told Reuters previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's difficulty in competing with Internet heavyweights such as Google and Facebook have forced it to explore proposals to revamp its business. Yahoo has a market capitalization of $18.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Greg Roumeliotis in New York, Alexei Oreskovic in San Fransisco and Bill Rigby in Seattle; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A law firm that led mortgage bondholders to extract a $8.5 billion settlement from Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) is turning its sights on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co (JPM.N).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Houston-based Gibbs &amp; Burns LP said on Friday its clients have instructed trustees overseeing $95 billion of securities issued in the housing boom by JPMorgan's affiliates to investigate whether ineligible mortgages were included in collateral behind the bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gibbs &amp; Burns said its clients represent holders of more than 25 percent of the voting rights on 243 residential mortgage backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan spokeswoman Kristin Lemkau declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The development marks an escalation of legal challenges from the housing bust for JPMorgan. The largest U.S. bank by assets, JPMorgan has been setting aside billions of dollars for claims that mortgage bonds sold by Chase bank, and by companies it bought, were backed by fraudulent loans or otherwise flawed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortgage securities typically set a threshold of 25 percent of voting rights above which organized investors gain additional legal power over the pools, said Greg Taxin of Spotlight Advisors LLC, which advises pension funds on mortgage bond investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is what started the ball rolling that ultimately led to the $8.5 billion settlement with Bank of America," said Taxin. "The best defense for JPMorgan has been that the investors were not coordinated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paul Miller, an analyst at FBR Capital Markets, said, "It was only a matter of time before they went after JPMorgan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement with Bank of America is pending and being challenged in court as insufficient by other holders of its mortgage bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kathy Patrick of Gibbs &amp; Bruns LLP said in a statement, "Our clients continue to seek a comprehensive solution to the problems of ineligible mortgages in RMBS pools and deficient servicing of those loans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investors represented by the firm own securities issued in 2005, 2006 and 2007. They include bonds from Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual, two firms which JPMorgan took over during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is in a better position than Bank of America to deal with the legal claims, said Miller. It is not clear that the bank is responsible for mortgages made by Washington Mutual, which the government put into JPMorgan's hands after it failed, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, in contrast, had bought mortgage-maker Countrywide, the source of most of its problem securities, on its own before the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, JPMorgan has already booked litigation expenses when it added to reserves. "For something like this, they are well-reserved," Miller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed up 14 cents to $31.90 on the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Welcomes Petroecuador Clean-up Announcement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX)
			today released the following 
      statement from Hewitt Pate, vice president and general counsel, 
      regarding the recent announcement by Ecuador&#8217;s state oil company, 
      Petroecuador, that the company will complete its remediation of the 
      sites it is responsible for under a 1995 agreement entered into with 
      Texaco Petroleum Co. (TexPet) at the conclusion of an oil-producing 
      consortium:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron welcomes Petroecuador&#8217;s announcement that it will remediate the 
      remaining sites it is responsible for under the remediation agreement. 
      Petroecuador&#8217;s $70 million remediation budget, which covers an area 
      larger than that of TexPet&#8217;s remediation, is within a reasonable cost 
      range under U.N. standards. This figure stands in contrast to the 
      multi-billion dollar claim fabricated by American plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers to 
      extort money from Chevron through a ghost-written judgment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Ecuadorian government deserves credit for taking positive steps to 
      help the people and environment of the Oriente and to break the cycle of 
      corruption and misinformation caused by the fraudulent case against 
      Chevron.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Petroecuador&#8217;s remediation should be completed without further 
      interference, and the perpetrators of the fraudulent litigation -- who 
      have lobbied to delay the remediation -- should be brought to justice. 
      Chevron would welcome a constructive dialogue with the government of 
      Ecuador on both topics.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Background
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is defending itself against false allegations that it is 
      responsible for environmental and social harms in the Amazon region of 
      Ecuador. Chevron has never conducted oil production operations in 
      Ecuador, and its subsidiary TexPet fully remediated its share of 
      environmental impacts arising from its participation in an oil producing 
      consortium with Petroecuador prior to 1992. After the remediation work, 
      defined in a Remedial Action Plan negotiated with the government of 
      Ecuador and Petroecuador, was certified by all agencies of the 
      Ecuadorian government responsible for oversight, TexPet received a 
      complete release from Ecuador&#8217;s national, provincial and municipal 
      governments prior to being acquired by Chevron in 2001. Petroecuador was 
      the majority owner of the consortium in which TexPet participated until 
      1992 and has been the sole owner of greatly expanded oil operations in 
      the former concession area over the past two decades.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Products Manufacturing Industry Featuring JJ, Estee Lauder and Procter 
       Gamble
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/6102d2/personal_care_prod) 
      has announced the addition of the "Personal 
      Care Products Manufacturing" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US personal care products manufacturing industry includes about 800 
      companies with combined annual revenue of $40 billion. Major companies 
      include Estee Lauder, Johnson  Johnson, and Procter  Gamble. The 
      industry is concentrated: the 50 largest firms account for about 85 
      percent of industry revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This industry includes companies engaged primarily in preparing, 
      blending, compounding, and packaging toilet preparations. Products 
      include makeup, shampoo, and various creams and lotions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The global personal care products industry has revenue of about $250 
      billion per year, according to the Personal Care Products Council. Top 
      producers include manufacturers in the US, the EU, Russia, and Brazil. 
      The BRIC nations, Brazil, Russia, India, and China, are the fastest 
      growing markets for personal care products. Major companies outside the 
      US include L'Oreal (France), Shiseido (Japan), and Unilever (the 
      Netherlands and the UK).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Competitive Landscape:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand is driven by population growth and consumer preferences. The 
      profitability of individual companies depends on product innovation, 
      effective sales and marketing, and efficient operations. Large companies 
      have scale advantages in purchasing, manufacturing, distribution, and 
      marketing. Small companies can compete effectively by offering 
      specialized products. The industry is capital-intensive: average annual 
      revenue per worker exceeds $800,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nearly all large US manufacturers are expanding operations, sales, and 
      distribution internationally. Exports, primarily to Canada and the UK, 
      are about 15 percent of US production. Imports are significant, 
      representing about 12 percent of the US market.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Fitch Ratings, the third-biggest of the major credit rating agencies, on Thursday downgraded Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and five other large banks based in Europe and the United States, citing "increased challenges" in the financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fitch cut long-term ratings on Barclays Plc and Credit Suisse AG by two notches to 'A' from 'AA-'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency cut by one notch its long-term ratings on Bank of America Corp, BNP Paribas, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank AG and Goldman Sachs Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The financial market challenges the banks face "result from both economic developments as well as a myriad of regulatory changes," Fitch said in an announcement issued shortly after regular market hours in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate announcement about the downgrade of Citigroup, Fitch cited "policy momentum" against using taxpayer money to support banks during a crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch's actions follow downgrades by Standard &amp; Poor's of several major banks at the end of last month. S's moves came as part of an overhaul of its ratings methods to incorporate lessons learned in the financial crisis. Moody's also issued downgrades recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jerry Dubrowski, a spokesman for Bank of America, which has had ratings cut by all three agencies, said in an email, "This decision is driven more by concerns about the global economy than the specific credit quality of Bank of America. We continue to maintain strong liquidity levels and to build capital."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fitch on Thursday also affirmed its long-term 'A' ratings on JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co, Morgan Stanley and UBS AG, as well as its 'A+' rating on Societe Generale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry and Walter Brandimarte in New York and Rick Rothacker in Charlotte, North Carolina; Editing by Steve Orlofsky and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's Lyrica pain treatment benefited patients with Restless Legs Syndrome in a late-stage clinical study, the company said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Phase III study of more than 700 patients met its three main goals, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Restless Legs Syndrome is an urge to move the legs, and sometimes other parts of the body, particularly at night, preventing those with the condition from sleeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it does not have plans at this time to seek regulatory approval for Lyrica to address Restless Legs Syndrome. Lyrica, which is one of Pfizer's top-selling products, is approved to treat diabetic nerve pain, pain after shingles and fibromyalgia, among other conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Gerald E.

      Research and Markets: Kenya Telecommunications Report Q1 2012 - This New 
      Forecast Envisages Total Mobile Subscriptions to Reach 35.9mn By 2015
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/2df63f/kenya_telecommunic) 
      has announced the addition of the "Kenya 
      Telecommunications Report Q1 2012" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Q112 update to the Kenya Telecommunications market report incorporates 
      market data from the Communications Commission of Kenya (CCK) relating 
      to the end of June 2011. It also contains our new forecast which extends 
      to 2016 as well as analysis of key regulatory and industry developments 
      in the telecoms sector.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One key development in Kenya's mobile market during H111 is a 
      significant slowdown in overall subscriber growth, following net losses 
      by second-ranked Airtel Kenya and fourth-ranked Essar (Yu).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to market data published by the CCK, the mobile market 
      expanded by just 1.2% during H111 with net additions of 312,000 
      subscribers. This was significantly less than net additions of 4.941mn 
      subscribers in H210, equivalent to 23.3% growth during that period. BMI 
      believes the slower growth in H111 reflects market saturation in urban 
      areas, a development that supports our view that rural roll-out holds 
      the most potential for future subscriber growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The author has downgraded our forecast this quarter to reflect new 
      trends in the market. Our , representing a penetration rate of 83.1%. 
      BMI believes renewed effort at rural roll-out will boost subscriber 
      growth over our forecast period. In a bid to encourage network expansion 
      to underserved areas, the Kenyan government reduced spectrum fees by an 
      average of 41% in October 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the CCK, the number of internet users in Kenya reached 
      12.5mn by June 2011. However, the regulator revised down its historical 
      data for internet subscriptions. We also revised our broadband figures 
      by excluding 3G subscriptions through mobile handsets. Our broadband 
      figures now comprise fixed broadband connection and wireless broadband 
      connections through dedicated data cards and USB modems. Our new 
      broadband forecast show broadband subscriptions in Kenya will reach 
      788,000, equivalent of a penetration rate of 1.7%.

			Pfizer Reports Positive Results From Phase 3 Trial Of Lyrica 
      (prebabalin) Capsules CV In Restless Legs Syndrome
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Top-Line Results Show Lyrica Met All Co-Primary Endpoints
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that a Phase 3 study for Lyrica 
      (pregabalin) in patients with Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) met each of 
      its three co-primary endpoints, showing significant benefit as compared 
      with placebo and pramipexole. Pfizer will continue to further analyze 
      these top-line results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The study, A0081186, was a randomized, double-blind, 12-month trial. It 
      enrolled more than 700 patients, who received either a placebo, Lyrica 
      at 300 mg/day, pramipexole at 0.25 mg/day or pramipexole at 0.5 mg/day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Patients treated with Lyrica experienced a statistically significant 
      improvement compared with placebo in RLS symptom severity as measured by 
      the International Restless Leg Group Rating Scale following 12 weeks of 
      treatment. The Lyrica group also demonstrated a statistically 
      significant improvement following 12 weeks of treatment in the 
      proportion of patients responding to treatment compared with those on 
      placebo as measured by the Clinical Global Impression Improvement scale. 
      In addition, Lyrica treatment resulted in a statistically significant 
      reduction in the rate of augmentation (worsening of RLS symptoms that 
      occur after starting a medication to treat RLS) compared with 
      pramipexole 0.5 mg/day over 12 months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The results for this study indicate that the most common adverse events 
      in Lyrica-treated patients were dizziness, somnolence, fatigue, headache 
      and nasopharyngitis (inflammation of the nasal cavity and throat). The 
      adverse event profile is consistent with that known for pregabalin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Restless Legs Syndrome is a neurological condition that is characterized 
      by an unpleasant irresistible urge to move the legs and, in severe 
      cases, other parts of the body. The symptoms have a circadian pattern 
      and occur mostly in the evening and bedtime. It often results in 
      difficulty falling or staying asleep and can result in periodic limb 
      movements while sleeping, causing partial awakenings that disrupt sleep. 
      RLS has profound negative impact on patients&#8217; quality of life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Top-line results from a previous Phase 3 study in RLS patients, 
      A0081185, showed Lyrica demonstrated statistically significant 
      improvements in the primary endpoint, sleep maintenance, compared with 
      placebo in adults with RLS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The preliminary results of the previous study indicate that the most 
      common adverse events in Lyrica-treated patients were dizziness, 
      somnolence, headache, nausea, dry mouth, upper respiratory tract 
      infection and disturbance of attention. The adverse event profile is 
      consistent with that known for pregabalin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At present, Pfizer does not have plans to seek regulatory approval for 
      an indication in Restless Legs Syndrome.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

			Pfizer Broadens and Extends Commitment to Help Prevent Pneumococcal 
      Disease in Infants and Young Children in the World&#8217;s Poorest Countries
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On Heels of Historic Anniversary, Pfizer Commits to Supply Up to a Total 
      of 480 Million Doses of Prevenar 13* to Help Prevent Leading Cause of 
      Vaccine-Preventable Death in Young Children
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced it has entered into a second 
      supply agreement which will broaden and extend the duration of the 
      Company&#8217;s commitment to help protect millions of infants and young 
      children in the developing world from pneumococcal disease &#8211; the leading 
      cause of vaccine-preventable death in young children. Pfizer is now 
      committed to supply up to a total of 480 million doses of Prevenar 13* 
      (Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Conjugate Vaccine [13-valent, adsorbed]) 
      through 2023 building on its original commitment announced in March 2010 
      to supply up to 300 million doses of the vaccine under the auspices of 
      the Advance Market Commitment (AMC) for pneumococcal vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The AMC, an innovative program piloted by the GAVI Alliance, is a 
      public-private approach to health funding designed to create a 
      sustainable marketplace, ensure an affordable and stable supply of 
      pneumococcal vaccines at a steeply discounted price and stimulate the 
      development and expansion of manufacturing capacity for vaccines 
      specifically for the world&#8217;s poorest countries. The agreements for 
      supply of pneumococcal vaccines have been financed by GAVI, five donor 
      countries &#8211; Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, the Russian Federation, 
      Norway &#8211; and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer is proud to broaden and extend access to our vaccine to advance 
      public health,&#8221; said Mark Swindell, president of Vaccines, Pfizer Inc. 
      &#8220;Public-private partnership programs like the AMC are vital to 
      accelerating the availability of affordable vaccines, faster than ever 
      before, to those children who are most vulnerable. We are proud to help 
      protect even more children at risk for the potentially devastating 
      consequences of pneumococcal disease &#8211; which claims more young 
      children&#8217;s lives than any other vaccine-preventable disease.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In December 2010, Pfizer&#8217;s 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was 
      introduced into the childhood immunization program of Nicaragua &#8211; the 
      first developing country to launch a program under the auspices of the 
      AMC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Prevenar 13 was introduced into the childhood immunization program of a 
      developing country within one year of its launch in the United States 
      and European Union &#8211; a historic precedent given the average 10-15 year 
      lag between the introduction of newer vaccines in developed versus 
      developing countries,&#8221; added Swindell. &#8220;One year later, Prevenar 13 is 
      now available in 14 of 16 countries which have launched pneumococcal 
      immunization programs under the AMC. While there is much more work to be 
      done, we are encouraged by this progress.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To date, Prevenar 13 has been introduced into the national childhood 
      immunization programs of the following GAVI-eligible countries: Benin, 
      Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of 
      Congo, the Gambia, Guyana, Honduras, Malawi, Mali, Nicaragua, Rwanda, 
      Sierra Leone and Yemen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To meet the growing global demand for Prevenar 13, Pfizer is increasing 
      its manufacturing capabilities through a combination of capital 
      investment, process improvements and efficiency measures throughout its 
      supply network. Additionally, Pfizer is engaged in the development of a 
      preserved, multi-dose vial which, subject to the required regulatory 
      approval, World Health Organization (WHO) prequalification and AMC 
      eligibility requirements, would provide an alternative option for 
      developing world countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Additional Information About Prevenar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 has been approved for use in infants and young children in 
      more than 100 countries, to date. It provides coverage against the 13 
      most prevalent invasive disease-causing serotypes in young children 
      worldwide. Additionally, Prevenar 13 is the only pneumococcal conjugate 
      vaccine indicated for the prevention of invasive disease caused by 
      serotypes 3, 6A, and 19A. Prevenar 13 uses CRM197 &#8211; a carrier 
      protein that has been used in various approved pediatric conjugate 
      vaccines for more than 20 years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About the Advance Market Commitment (AMC)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A new approach to public health funding, AMCs are designed to procure 
      vaccines specifically for least developed countries. The GAVI Alliance 
      hopes to assist up to nearly 60 of the world&#8217;s poorest countries 
      introduce pneumococcal conjugate vaccines that meet a target product 
      profile by 2015. Early estimates suggest this pilot project could 
      prevent more than seven million childhood deaths by 2030. For more 
      information on the AMC, please go to www.vaccineamc.org.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pneumococcal Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Every year, up to one million children are estimated to die from 
      pneumococcal disease, the majority of whom are in the developing world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease is complex and describes a group of illnesses, all 
      caused by the bacterium S. pneumoniae. It affects both children 
      and adults and includes invasive infections such as bacteremia, sepsis 
      and meningitis, as well as non-invasive disease including pneumonia and 
      acute otitis media.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 is marketed in the United States for pediatric use as 
      Prevnar 13 (Pneumococcal 13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 
      Protein]). In the United States, Prevnar 
      13 is not indicated for the prevention of pneumonia.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Indication for Prevnar 13&#174; in the United States
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the United States, Prevnar 13 is a vaccine approved for use in 
      children 6 weeks through 5 years of age (prior to the sixth birthday). 
      Prevnar 13 is indicated for active immunization for the prevention of 
      invasive disease caused by 13 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae 
      (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevnar 13 is also indicated for the prevention of otitis media (ear 
      infection) caused by 7 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (4, 
      6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F). No efficacy data for ear infections are 
      available for strains 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			World Health Organization Indication for 
      Prevenar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevenar 13 is prequalified by the WHO for the active immunization of 
      infants and children from 6 weeks through 5 years of age against 
      invasive disease, pneumonia and otitis media caused by S. pneumoniae 
      serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F and 23F.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information for Prevenar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevenar 13 should not be given to anyone with a severe allergic 
        reaction to any component of Prevenar 13, Prevenar, or any diphtheria 
        toxoid&#8211;containing vaccine.
      
			
        Prevenar 13 may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine. 
        Protection against ear infections is expected to be less than that for 
        invasive disease. Children with weakened immune systems may have a 
        reduced immune response to Prevenar 13. A temporary pause of breathing 
        following vaccination has been observed in some infants born 
        prematurely.
      
			
        The most commonly reported serious adverse events include 
        bronchiolitis (an infection of the lungs; 0.9%, 1.1%), gastroenteritis 
        (inflammation of the stomach and small intestine; 0.9%, 0.9%), and 
        pneumonia (0.9%, 0.5%) for Prevenar 13 and Prevenar, respectively.
      
			
        The most common side effects are redness, swelling and tenderness at 
        the injection site, fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased 
        sleep, and decreased sleep. Only a healthcare provider can decide if 
        Prevenar 13 is appropriate for a given child.

				Capacity to increase to 80,000 tons per year
			
			
				Second Kashima expansion in five years
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil Yugen Kaisha (EMYK) announced today that Japan Butyl Co. Ltd. 
      (JBC) will expand the capacity of its halobutyl 
      rubber manufacturing plant at Kashima to 80,000 tons per year. The 
      expansion is planned to be completed in 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Demand for halobutyl rubber is expected to grow at about six percent 
      per year, mainly in the Asia Pacific region,&#8221; said John Lyon, vice 
      president, butyl polymers, ExxonMobil Chemical Company. &#8220;The expansion 
      by our affiliate&#8217;s joint venture at Kashima will add 10,000 tons per 
      year of capacity in the region. This aligns with ExxonMobil Chemical&#8217;s 
      long-term commitment to meet industry demand.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the second capacity expansion in five years at the Kashima 
      halobutyl rubber plant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The JBC butyl polymers manufacturing plant at Kawasaki also completed a 
      major expansion in 2010 to bring its total capacity to 98,000 tons per 
      year. That expansion incorporated ExxonMobil proprietary technology that 
      enables significant energy savings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lyon adds, &#8220;Auto production is growing at a rapid pace in Asia, 
      especially in China. This has led to increased tire sales for new cars 
      and trucks as well as the sale of replacement tires as these vehicles 
      age. Halobutyl rubber holds air in tubeless radial tires for both 
      passenger cars and heavy duty trucks.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil Chemical has more than doubled its global halobutyl rubber 
      capacity since 1995. The company is a world leader in synthetic rubber 
      technology, products and customer support.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) claimed the spot as the top U.S. M adviser in 2011 as rivals JP Morgan (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) fell in the standings due to the collapse of AT's (T.N) $39 billion deal to buy Deutsche Telekom's (DTEGn.DE) T-Mobile USA unit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan, which had previously been the top U.S. M adviser for the year, advised AT along with Greenhill (GHL.N) and Evercore (EVR.N). Morgan Stanley, which had been No. 2 in U.S. M based on the dollar value of transactions on which it had advised, was working for Deutsche Telekom along with Citigroup (C.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) and Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gooldman had been the top M adviser in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The AT deal, announced in March, met with opposition from the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Communications Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The advisers stand to lose a total of $150 million in fees. According to earlier estimates from Thomson Reuters/Freeman Consulting, they were on course to earn between $18 million and $36 million apiece.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide, Citi and Evercore dropped a spot to sixth and twelfth, respectively, in the 2011 standings after the deal fell apart.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Explorer Gulf Keystone Petroleum (GKP.L) said it was not in talks with U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) about a 7 billion pounds ($11 billion) sale, scotching a newspaper report that sent the Kurdistan-focused group's shares 24 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Independent on Sunday newspaper reported Exxon was considering making an estimated 800 pence per share bid -- five times Gulf Keystone's closing share price on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gulf Keystone said in a statement on Monday it was "not in discussions with regard to a sale of the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) said last month Exxon had signed contracts for six exploration blocks, the latest in a list of ever-larger corporations investing in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increased investment reflects signs the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of northern Iraq may be about to agree a deal with Baghdad on oil revenue sharing and licensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gulf Keystone, which says it has found billions of barrels of oil at its Shaikan discovery, has frequently been the subject of takeover rumors and said in September it was seeking a buyer for its 20 percent interest in the Akri-Bijeel block to help finance ongoing development of other assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry sources said the company has mulled a possible sale of other parts, or all, of its interests in Kurdistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday the company acknowledged the "increasing interest" in the region but said it was committed to continuing its exploration and appraisal of its assets itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dealers and analysts had earlier dismissed the prospect of an usually high bid from the notoriously financially disciplined Texas-based oil giant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We fear an element of yuletide wishful thinking may also be playing a part," said Richard Savage, oil analyst at brokerage Mirabaud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acquirers rarely make offers at more than a 50 percent premium to a target's pre-bid share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gulf Keystone shares opened 24 percent higher before falling back to close up 7.7 percent at 178.25 pence following the company's denial of talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One dealer said he was especially surprised by the report's claim that Gulf Keystone's board would not accept the estimated 800 pence per share bid and that chief executive Todd Kozel wanted a price tag over 10 billion pounds in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I bet the shareholders would jump for anything over 250 pence a share," the dealer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's Kurdistan deal prompted criticism from the Baghdad government, which has challenged the regional government's right to issue licenses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would make Exxon the first company in the top tier of the industry to move into the Kurdish region, but Exxon has not confirmed it and declines all comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry sources said that many big western oil companies have been mulling an entry into Kurdistan, by either buying existing players in the region, many of whom are small independents, or by buying new licensing blocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sarah Young; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter, Mike Nesbit and Mark Potter)&lt;/p&gt;

			DataCore Software Celebrates Holidays by Offering Free Storage 
      Hypervisor to Microsoft Certified and System Center Professionals
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Experience the Advantages of SANsymphony-V for Free and Gain the 
      Expertise to Meet the Storage Challenges in the Year Ahead
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DataCore Software, the industry&#8217;s premier provider of storage 
      virtualization software, announced today that in the spirit of the 
      holiday season it will offer free license keys of its SANsymphony&#8482; 
      -V storage hypervisor to Microsoft Certified and System Center 
      professionals. The not-for-resale (NFR) license keys &#8211; may be leveraged 
      for non-production uses such as course development, proof-of-concepts, 
      training, lab testing and demonstration purposes &#8211; are intended to 
      support virtualization consultants, instructors and architects involved 
      in managing and optimizing storage within private clouds, virtual server 
      and VDI deployments. DataCore is making it easy for these certified 
      professionals to benefit directly and learn for themselves the power of 
      this innovative technology &#8211; the storage hypervisor &#8211; and its ability to 
      redefine storage management and efficiency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In 2012, organizations will need to pay closer attention to their 
      storage environments and the impact they will have on their IT and 
      virtualization goals,&#8221; said Linda 
      Haury, vice president worldwide marketing at DataCore Software. 
      &#8220;DataCore&#8217;s storage virtualization solutions have always been designed 
      to support Microsoft 
      platforms and the professionals who use them. By providing 
      SANsymphony-V to these experts for home and office labs, they will be 
      able to realize the benefits of the storage hypervisor and inform others 
      of the need to not only create a dynamic storage infrastructure, but how 
      to better manage it.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The SANsymphony-V 
      storage hypervisor is a portable, centrally-managed software suite 
      capable of enhancing the combined value of multiple disk storage 
      systems, including the many purpose-built storage appliances and solid 
      state disks (SSD) type devices arriving to the market daily. The storage 
      hypervisor supplements the individual capabilities of specialized 
      equipment with a broad range of device-independent, integrated services. 
      The SANsymphony-V software executes on physical and virtual servers or 
      can co-reside with server hypervisors. Other major features include, but 
      are not limited to, &#8220;Quick serve&#8221; storage provisioning, automated 
      tiering across SSDs, disk devices and different cloud storage 
      providers and continuous data protection (CDP).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The free NFR license keys of SANsymphony-V are available during the 2011 
      holiday season and this offer will expire on January 31, 2012. The 
      licenses may be used for non-production purposes only and the software 
      can be installed on both physical servers and Hyper-V virtual machines 
      as a virtual storage appliance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To receive a free license key, please email: NFRsoftware@datacore.com 
      or sign up at: http://pages.datacore.com/nfr-for-experts.html. 
      Proof of certification as a Microsoft 
      Certified Architect (MCA), Microsoft 
      Certified Master (MCM), Microsoft 
      Certified IT Professional (MCITP), Microsoft 
      Certified Professional Developer (MCPD) or Microsoft 
      Certified Technology Specialist (MCTS) is required.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The Cause Marketing Golden Halo Award, the highest honor for companies 
      and causes that collaborate to produce business and social dividends, 
      will be bestowed on Procter  Gamble and UNICEF at the 2012 Cause 
      Marketing Forum conference.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The awards will be accepted by Procter  Gamble Group President for 
      North America Melanie Healey and U.S. Fund for UNICEF President  CEO

      issues tackled by the company and its megabrands. In her acceptance 
      speech, Healey will describe how the adoption of a &#8220;Purpose Driven&#8221; 
      philosophy has enabled Procter  Gamble to prosper while touching and 
      improving lives around the globe.

      organization&#8217;s work in more than 150 countries to help children survive 
      and thrive. With partners such as IKEA, Gucci, ING, Procter  Gamble, 
      Starwood, and FC Barcelona, UNICEF has pioneered the development of 
      signature global and U.S. initiatives such as the iconic &#8220;Trick-or-Treat 
      for UNICEF&#8221; campaign. In her acceptance speech, Stern will share 
      insights into building impactful partnerships that advance UNICEF&#8217;s 
      mission and deliver business results for companies and brands around the 
      world.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Mobeam Partners with Procter  Gamble to Reinvent the Coupon
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New mobile technology aims to increase shoppers&#8217; power by putting 
      scannable coupons in their phones, saving time, effort and cost
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In its continuous effort to improve life for consumers, the Procter  
      Gamble Company (PG) (NYSE:PG) is partnering with mobeam inc. to bring 
      the first-ever fully mobile couponing system to market. The innovation, 
      created by mobeam of California, makes electronic coupons presented on a 
      phone or other mobile device scannable, so shoppers need only their 
      phones/handhelds, not a stack of coupons, at check out.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, couponing represents a growing $3.7 billion segment of the 
      consumer packaged goods (CPG) market in North America, with more than 
      300 billion coupons distributed every year and redemption on the 
      increase as consumers strive for greater value and savings. And while 
      smartphones are supporting users and simplifying life in a host of new 
      ways, until now, phone couponing has not been an option because barcodes 
      displayed on mobile phone screens are invisible to commonly used 
      in-store laser scanners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mobeam technology converts &#8211; or mobeams &#8211; the barcode data into a 
      beam of light that can be read by barcode scanners already found at 
      store checkout counters. No additional point of sale (POS) equipment is 
      needed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As impossible as it seems, even to technologists in the mobile 
      industry, a vividly displayed barcode cannot be read by the typical 
      barcode scanner,&#8221; said Nick Holland, senior analyst with Yankee 
      Group.&#160;&#8220;The inability for a red laser scanner to read information 
      displayed on a smartphone is not a small problem. This limiting factor 
      is stalling important innovation as the retail industry is stuck waiting 
      for next generation mobile technology to go mainstream. The mobeam 
      beaming solution eloquently fixes this problem, enabling current 
      generation mobile devices to interface with legacy red laser barcode 
      scanners.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PG, one of the world&#8217;s leading coupon distributors, developed a 
      partnership with mobeam through PG&#8217;s open innovation Connect+Develop 
      program, designed to bring leading innovation into PG and share PG 
      innovation with others.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The PG and mobeam partnership is aimed at exploring and testing a new, 
      highly efficient method for consumers to redeem &#8211; and retailers to 
      accept &#8211; coupons at the point of sale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our vision with PG is for the mobeam technology to be used and 
      leveraged broadly by many leading CPG companies, with PG and other key 
      consumer goods partners as first adopters,&#8221; said mobeam CEO Christopher 
      Sellers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next step in the partnership is to work with the mobile 
      communications industry to add the mobeam application into handheld 
      phones and then to test the application and process with shoppers and 
      selected retailers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited about the potential for this new technology and our 
      partnership with mobeam to make shopping simpler and faster for 
      consumers. Couponing is a great way for shoppers to try new products or 
      save on the trusted brands their families have come to love. If that can 
      be easier, faster and less costly for shoppers and retailers, we want to 
      help bring it to life,&#8221; said Jeff Weedman, vice president of PG Global 
      Business Development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mobeam is working with handset manufacturers to engineer its light-based 
      communications technology into new lines of handsets. PG, mobeam and 
      other partners expect to test the technology in market in 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A mobeam-enabled couponing service would provide significant benefit to 
      key stakeholders:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CONSUMERS:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumers would be able to collect and manage coupons received 
      electronically and redeem them from their phones at the point of sale. 
      Up to now, coupons received electronically either had to be printed to 
      be redeemed, downloaded to a loyalty card or a checkout clerk would have 
      to manually key in a coupon code. Not only will a shopper using the 
      mobeam technology benefit, so will all the shoppers standing behind her 
      in line.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			RETAILERS:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The service aims to enable North American retailers to accelerate 
      adoption of mobile coupons without hardware changes at POS. Because 
      coupons will be submitted digitally, mobile coupons would increase 
      efficiency and reduce costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CPG COMPANIES:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Digital coupons provide substantially deeper analytic capabilities, 
      allowing better measurement of campaign effectiveness, as well as 
      efficiencies in distribution, purchase validation and processing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About mobeam
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mobeam, inc. is transforming mobile commerce with its unique and 
      patented light based communications technology. Overcoming the technical 
      barrier preventing mobile phones from interacting with laser scanners at 
      checkout, mobeam&#8217;s technology provides universal access at point of sale 
      (POS), enabling the transmission of coupons, gift cards, tickets and 
      other barcode data at retailers worldwide. Mobeam&#8217;s technology powers 
      new capabilities for existing mobile phone designs, and requires no 
      changes to retailer POS infrastructure. Mobeam is headquartered in San 
      Francisco, California. For more information visit&#160;www.mobeam.com.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. trade panel judge found Motorola Mobility infringed a Microsoft patent in making its Android cellphones, the companies said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The patented technology makes it possible for users to schedule meetings using mobile devices. However, the U.S. International Trade Commission judge found there was no violation of six other patents that remained in the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a complaint filed in October 2010 with the ITC, Microsoft accused Motorola Mobility of infringing nine patents for Windows Mobile and Windows Phone, which do everything from monitoring remaining memory, updating contact lists and synchronizing on- and off-line use. Two patents were dropped from the case during litigation, leaving seven as of December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling now goes for review by the full commission, with a decision due in the spring. The commission will also consider Microsoft's request that the infringing phones be barred from importation into the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very pleased that the majority of the rulings were favorable to Motorola Mobility," Scott Offer, general counsel of Motorola Mobility, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The initial determination may provide clarity on the definition of the Microsoft... patent for which a violation was found and will help us avoid infringement of this patent in the U.S. market," said Offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Howard, Microsoft's deputy general counsel, also welcomed the decision, saying: "We are pleased with the ITC's initial determination finding Motorola violated four claims of a Microsoft patent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in its complaint that the infringing devices included Android phones like the Motorola Droid 2, the Droid X, Cliq XT, Devour, Backflip and others, including the associated software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case at the ITC is No. 337-744.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Diane Bartz; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Antares Pharma, Inc. (NYSE Amex: AIS) today announced that it has 
      licensed to Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s Consumer Healthcare Business Unit one of its 
      drug delivery technologies to develop an undisclosed product on an 
      exclusive basis for North America. Pfizer will assume full cost and 
      responsibility for all clinical development, manufacturing, and 
      commercialization of the product in the licensed territory, which also 
      includes certain non-exclusive territories outside of North America. 
      Antares will receive undisclosed upfront payments, development 
      milestones and sales based milestones, as well as royalties on net sales 
      for three years post launch in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are very pleased to enter this collaboration with Pfizer Consumer 
      Healthcare for an important product opportunity targeting a growing 
      therapeutic area which utilizes one of our technology platforms,&#8221; said 
      Paul K. Wotton, Ph.D., Antares&#8217; President and CEO. &#8220;We continue to 
      significantly diversify our existing and future product portfolio 
      through both internal product development programs and Pharma 
      partnerships. Our internal programs have yielded VIBEX MTX in 
      development for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and our recently 
      FDA approved oxybutynin gel 3% product for the treatment of OAB which 
      will be launched in 2012. In addition to this new collaboration our key 
      partnerships include products and product opportunities with world 
      leading companies such as Teva, Ferring and Watson. This combination of 
      marketed products, internal development and Pharma partnerships should 
      provide for potential significant business growth in the future.&#8221;

IPOs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Elzio Barreto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, Dec 22 (Reuters) - Stock sales in Asia
Pacific plunged to a three-year low in 2011 and the downturn is
expected to last well into 2012 as weak performance by most of
the IPOs in the region makes it harder to attract investors to
new deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly 75 percent of initial public offerings in Asia
ex-Japan, larger than $250 million, are trading below their
offer price, and fee revenues for banks have plunged in the
second half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a spike in volatility unseen since the 2008 global
financial crisis, 2011 also marked the first time in seven years
when UBS lost the top spot in equity underwriting in
the region to rival Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a busy first half that saw massive offerings from
commodities giant Glencore , Hutchison Port
Holdings Trust and fashion house Prada SpA,
demand evaporated in the second half, with dozens of deals
pulled or slashed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fund managers remain wary of taking on the risk of buying
into public offerings on concerns over Europe's debt crisis and
slower growth in China. Investment bankers say risk appetite is
not expected to return soon to the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors had difficulty finding ways to make money in the
equity capital markets in 2011. They are going to be more
cautious in 2012 as a consequence," said Steven Barg, co-head of
Asia ex-Japan equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Next year, and specifically the first half, is going to be
very difficult structurally."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Equity issuance in the region excluding Japan tumbled 42
percent in 2011 from a year earlier to $195 billion, the lowest
since the $111.4 billion recorded in 2008, according to Thomson
Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPO deals faced a worse setback, down 51.5 percent to $80.3
billion, the smallest amount raised since 2009, data showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which worked on four of the five biggest IPOs of
the year in Asia Pacific, underwrote $14.9 billion worth of
deals. UBS, which scored $12.03 billion this year, had been in
the top post since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese firms Ping An Securities and Guosen Securities raked
in more in underwriting fees than any of the international
giants in the region, with $231.7 million and $217.8 million
respectively, according to estimates from Thomson
Reuters/Freeman Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS, despite losing out to Goldman in dealmaking, came third
with $215.6 million in estimated fees, followed by the New
York-based firm's $207.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IPO WINNERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong has been in the limelight recently with the
biggest IPOs in the world and public offerings of famous luxury
brands. When it comes to performance, however, investors would
have earned much more buying into South Korean and Malaysian
offerings in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea was home to three of the 10 best-performing
offerings in 2011, Thomson Reuters data showed. Malaysia boasted
two top gainers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In Korea there is a lot of risk taking still, there's
plenty of domestic money looking for investment opportunities.
Obviously that's driven by a very strong performance of the
Korean economy," said Josef Schuster, founder of Chicago-based
IPO investment firm IPOX Schuster LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Korea Aerospace Industries Ltd led the pack
among IPOs in the region. The company, which develops fighter
jets and produces parts for companies including Boeing,
surged about 148 percent since going public in June in a $520
million deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Autoparts maker Hyundai WIA is up about 114
percent since its $466 million IPO in January, while electronics
retailer Himart climbed 35.4 percent after a $384
million offer in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Historically, the Korean IPOs are priced at a huge
discount. They are cheap and they are priced to go," said Kester
Ng, head of equity capital for Asia-Pacific at J.P. Morgan in
Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other big gainers in Asia this year included sugar refiner
MSM Malaysia Holdings, which raised $270 million in
June, and Malaysian offshore oil and gas service provider Bumi
Armada. MSM is up 37.4 percent, while Bumi Armada
gained 35 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIGGEST LOSERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies listed in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen
accounted for all but one of the 10 worst performing
medium-to-large IPOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stock offerings in Hong Kong sank 56.7 percent in 2011 from
2010, partly due to the weak performance of companies that have
gone public. The slump in shares has been widespread in the
region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Out of the 63 IPOs above $250 million in Asia Pacific, only
16 are trading above their offer price. The downturn is
reflected in the broader market, with the MSCI's index for Asia
ex-Japan down about 20 percent this year as
concerns over Europe's debt troubles worsened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pangda Automobile Trade Co Ltd had the
worst-performing IPO of the year, down 86 percent since the
company listed in Shanghai in April, while turbine maker Sinovel
Wind Group sank 81 percent since its
January debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS managed the Pangda offering, while Sinovel's deal was
handled by Deutsche Bank's Zhong De Securities and Chinese firms
Essence Securities and Citic Securities .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more a matter of uncertainties needing to be resolved
or partly resolved so that investors have more confidence
putting money to work again," said Michael Kurtz, chief Asia
equity strategist at Nomura International in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For companies looking to raise funds in Seoul, Singapore or
Shenzhen, the broad tumble could mean lower valuations in
upcoming IPOs and potentially a longer time to listing than
expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would also limit their options for new capital as global
credit conditions worsen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weak performance across the region could also reinforce
caution among retail and institutional investors already
unwilling to buy into new listings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Due to uncertainty over European debt issues, some of the
IPOs' performance is not very good. A lot of the IPOs that
listed are under the water, so the momentum for IPOs is not very
good," said Patrick Yiu, a director at Cash Asset Management in
Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Heungkuk Life Insurance Co has withdrawn a $47 million lawsuit against Goldman Sachs &amp; Co (GS.N) over the Timberwolf collateralized debt obligation (CDO) and will arbitrate the case instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The South Korean insurer accuses Goldman of placing bets against the $1 billion CDO after marketing it to clients as profitable, according to a lawsuit Heungkuk filed against Goldman earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a court filing made public on Wednesday, Heungkuk withdrew the lawsuit and the parties said they agreed to pursue an "extrajudicial resolution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heungkuk is looking forward to holding Goldman Sachs responsible for its fraud in the arbitration," said Jonathan Pickhardt, a partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart &amp; Sullivan LLP, who is representing Heungkuk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined to comment on the withdrawal of the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has said in court papers that it disclosed both the investment risks it knew of and its short positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank filed a motion in June to compel arbitration of the claims and hold off or dismiss the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the lawsuit, filed in state court in New York, Heungkuk said Goldman had marketed the CDO as "highly rated, secure and profitable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in an internal email a Goldman trader infamously described the Timberwolf CDO was "one shitty deal," the lawsuit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman began to structure and underwrite Timberwolf in late 2006. Unbeknown to Heungkuk and other investors, Goldman filled its collateral portfolio with inferior assets that would lose their value in the subprime mortgage market meltdown, the lawsuit said. The CDO was devised to enable Goldman to short the $1 billion portfolio, Heungkuk said in court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was one of a number winding their way through the courts that have grown out of the alleged misconduct of Goldman Sachs and other banks in connection with the subprime mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Heungkuk Life Insurance Co. limited v. The Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 650978/2011, New York state Supreme Court (Manhattan).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Karen Freifeld; Editing by Eddie Evans and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Microsoft's IDR at 'AA+'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings for Microsoft Corp. 
      (Microsoft):
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'AA+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR at 'F1+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial Paper (CP) program at 'F1+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations reflect the following considerations:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch anticipates modest revenue growth in FY 2012. Fitch expects 
      declines in PC unit volume in 2012 reflecting hard disk drive shortages 
      and macroeconomic concerns which should lead to declines in Microsoft's 
      Windows revenue. Fitch expects this to be offset by continued strong 
      business and server segment revenue growth reflecting enterprise demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch believes Microsoft's position in the handset and tablet market 
      has improved significantly over the past 12 months owing 1) to licensing 
      agreements with Android device manufacturers and original design 
      manufacturers that now cover in excess of 50% of all Android unit 
      shipments and generate an estimated $5 to $15 per unit, and 2) a 
      revamped version of the Windows phone and the expected launch of Windows 
      8 in 2012 which is tailored for tablet computers. Additionally, 
      Microsoft's partnership with Nokia should meaningfully contribute to 
      market share gains in FY 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch believes that Xbox sales could trail off as consumers begin to 
      delay purchases in anticipation of a new platform. However, Fitch 
      believes that Microsoft's current positioning in the entertainment space 
      bodes well for its competitiveness over the next 12 to 24 months, 
      particularly as Xbox's hardware platform, Xbox Live, and Kinect 
      controller become integral pieces of a longer-term strategy of 
      consumer-oriented offerings. Fitch believes Microsoft may need to invest 
      in its content offerings which could pressure margins going forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch believes Microsoft's Bing search engine platform, which has 
      continued to gain market share but remains a drag on profitability, 
      remains a critical component of a longer-term strategy in the consumer 
      market and can serve as a platform to monetize services across the 
      mobile, PC and Xbox platforms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch expects Microsoft to continue to produce strong FCF, in excess 
      of $15 billion per year, which the company utilizes to fund its share 
      repurchase and dividend programs. Fitch expects cash generation from 
      operations to be strong enough to pay for modest annual increases in 
      both dividends and share repurchases over next several years excluding 
      potential for meaningful acquisitions. Microsoft has $11.2 billion 
      remaining under its current share repurchase authorization that expires 
      in September 2013. Fitch expects all repurchases will be done within the 
      context of free cash flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The company's sizable liquidity and superior credit profile provide a 
      significant degree of financial flexibility within the current ratings. 
      Going forward, Fitch believes Microsoft will become more active with 
      acquisitions and share buybacks over time but continue to maintain a 
      significant net cash position.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Credit Strengths:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Leading market positioning in its core software businesses, including 
      over 90% in PC operating systems (OS) and 75% in servers;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Very strong balance sheet with $57 billion in cash and short term 
      investments partially offset by $12 billion in debt. Microsoft generates 
      nearly $1 billion in pretax income from interest and dividends alone;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Diversification of end market with consumers and enterprise demand as 
      well as strong geographic diversification. No customer is larger than 
      10% of revenue;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Industry leading liquidity, supported by a considerable cash position 
      and consistent strong free cash flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Credit Concerns:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Reliance on Windows and Office for vast majority of FCF and potential 
      high correlation between the two business segments if alternative 
      operating systems take meaningful PC market share. Microsoft's Windows 
      and Office segments account for approximately 90% of total EBIT;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Growing popularity of other operating systems outside of the core PC 
      space, principally Apple's iOS as well as Google's Android platform. 
      Fitch believes both platforms will continue to grow as competitive 
      threats to Windows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Minimal historical success in developing profitable businesses outside 
      of Microsoft's core Windows and Office ecosystem despite significant 
      investment over a decade-plus in other consumer markets which Fitch 
      believes is indicative of the challenging competitive environment 
      Microsoft has targeted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Significant dividend and share repurchase programs, although funded 
      entirely today by FCF, could pressure the company to issue increasing 
      amounts of debt to avoid repatriation of foreign earnings which 
      represent the majority of total annual FCF.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total liquidity as of Sep 30, 2011 was solid and consisted principally 
      of $12.9 billion in cash and equivalents as well as $45 billion in 
      short-term investments. Fitch believes that the majority of the 
      company's cash and investment balance is located overseas and would be 
      subject to incremental taxes (Fitch estimates approximately 15% to 20% 
      incremental taxes) if the company needed to access these funds. Free 
      cash flow of $19.7 billion in the latest 12 month period ending Sep 2011 
      further supports liquidity although the majority of cash flow is 
      generated outside the U.S..
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total debt as of Sept. 30, 2011 was $11.9 billion and consisted 
      principally of: i) $1.25 billion in 0% convertible notes due June 2013; 
      ii) $1 billion in 0.875% notes due September 2013; iii) $2 billion in 
      2.95% notes due June 2014 but callable in January 2012; iv) $1.75 
      billion in 1.625% notes due September 2015; v) $750 million in 2.5% 
      notes due February 2016; vi) $1 billion in 4.2% notes due June 2019; vi) 
      $500 million in 4% notes due February 2021; vii) $1 billion in 3% notes 
      due October 2020; viii) $750 million in 5.2% notes due June 2039; ix) $1 
      billion in 4.5% notes due October 2040; and x) $1 billion in 5.3% notes 
      due February 2041. Microsoft's 'F1+' short-term IDR and commercial paper 
      rating reflect Microsoft's very strong liquidity profile in absence of 
      100% backstop of the commercial paper facility.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 21 (Reuters) - Heungkuk Life Insurance Co and
Goldman Sachs &amp; Co have agreed to take a dispute over
mortgage-backed securities to arbitration, a lawyer for the
South Korean insurer said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Wednesday the two parties said in a court filing
that Heungkuk had withdrawn a lawsuit it filed against Goldman
over a collateralized debt obligation known as Timberwolf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Heungkuk is looking forward to holding Goldman Sachs
responsible for its fraud in arbitration," said Jonathan
Pickhardt, an attorney who is representing Heungkuk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, Calif., Dec. 21, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc. (Nasdaq:ALGN) today announced a significant software upgrade for its iTero 3D scanning system used in dental practices for a wide range of restorative dental procedures. The iTero 4.05 software upgrade includes the Invisalign Scanning Protocol for full interoperability with Invisalign treatment, as well as enhancements to software tools that deliver expanded features and greater efficiency in scanning for iTero customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	The iTero 4.05 software upgrade features full interoperability with Invisalign treatment, including links to the Invisalign Doctor Site and to the Invisalign Case Gallery for patient education. In addition, the software upgrade includes enhancements to bite registration scanning, guidance, the eraser tool, real-time modeling and other features that help deliver accurate 3D impressions of the patient's dentition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	After upgrading to iTero 4.05, customers can begin submitting 3D digital scans in place of physical impressions for Invisalign treatment through the Invisalign Doctor Site as part of the Invisalign case submission process. Current iTero customers will be upgraded through a phased software roll-out over the next several weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	"Dentists are already experiencing the benefits of the iTero digital scanning system for a wide range of restorative dental procedures, including implants, crown and bridge, veneers, and more," said Timothy A. Mack, Align Technology senior vice president of business development. "Integration with Invisalign treatment brings the same enhanced accuracy of digital impressions and greater treatment efficiency, along with a better overall patient experience, to practices that are also offering Invisalign treatment to their patients."&#160;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
	Earlier this year, Align announced Invisalign interoperability for its iOC scanning system, used predominantly by orthodontic practices. Both the iOC and iTero scanning systems utilize laser and optical scanning to capture the contours of the patient's dentition, gingival structures, and bite without the use of powder, resulting in an accurate digital orthodontic scan in minutes. The iTero and iOC scanning systems operate on an open architecture platform, providing doctors and labs with the ability to export custom and generic STL (stereolithography) files of their digital impressions to use with other third party dental service providers. This allows the digital impressions to integrate with cone beam CT images for implant and orthodontic treatment planning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

	Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 21 (Reuters) - Heungkuk Life Insurance Co has
withdrawn a lawsuit accusing Goldman Sachs &amp; Co of
secretly betting against a collateralized debt obligation the
bank had sold to its clients.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Heungkuk sued Goldman in state court in New York in April
claiming Goldman bet against a collateralized debt obligation
it structured known as Timberwolf. In the lawsuit, Heungkuk
quoted a Goldman trader describing Timberwolf as "one shitty
deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fraud suit was discontinued without prejudice,
according to a court filing made public Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

			Kroll Bond Rating Agency Assigns Final Ratings to JPMCC 2011-PLSD 
      Commercial Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kroll Bond Rating Agency (KBRA) assigned its final ratings to seven 
      classes of JPMCC 2011-PLSD, a $374.6 million CMBS Single Borrower 
      transaction. Concurrently, we have withdrawn our preliminary ratings on 
      the certificates, which were assigned on November 29, 2011 (see our 
      ratings listed below).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction is secured by one 5-year, fixed rate mortgage loan which 
      amortizes based on a 30 year schedule. The mortgage is collateralized by 
      a fee and leasehold interest in 1.94 million square feet of the 
      Palisades Center. KBRA&#8217;s analysis of the transaction included a detailed 
      evaluation of the mall's cash flow using our CMBS Property Evaluation 
      Guidelines, and the application of our CMBS Single Borrower  Large Loan 
      Rating Methodology. The results of our analysis yielded a KBRA Net Cash 
      flow (KNCF) of $43.1 million. We applied a KBRA 7.75% capitalization 
      rate to arrive at a value of $555.6 million, which was 35% less than a 
      third party appraisal value. Our resulting KBRA Loan to Value (KLTV) was 
      67.4%. KBRA Debt Service Coverage during the term (KDSCt) was 1.66x, and 
      KBRA Debt Service Coverage at maturity (KDSCm) is expected to be 1.45x. 
      The total indebtedness for this transaction of $524.6 million includes a 
      $150.0 million mezzanine loan secured by pledges of equity interests in 
      the borrower which is interest-only and with a maturity date that is 
      coterminous with the first mortgage. Together with the mezzanine debt, 
      the all-in KLTV for this financing is 94.4%. In our analysis of the 
      transaction, we also reviewed and considered third party engineering and 
      environmental reports, as well as our site inspection of the property 
      and the competition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palisades Center is a 2.26 million square foot super-regional mall and 
      destination shopping center located in West Nyack, New York, 
      approximately 22.0 miles northwest of New York City and directly off of 
      the New York State Thruway (I-87/I-287). The property offers 12 
      traditional mall and big-box anchor tenants, with a mid-price point 
      orientation, in addition to mall in-line stores and numerous 
      entertainment/dining offerings. Two anchors, Macy&#8217;s and Lord  Taylor, 
      which together comprise 321,000 square feet, own their stores and 
      therefore are not part of the collateral.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX)
			today published a letter 
      submitted to Galo Chiriboga, Ecuador&#8217;s Prosecutor General, documenting 
      evidence of fraud and corruption in the litigation against Chevron in 
      Ecuador. The company called on Ecuadorian authorities to investigate the 
      misconduct of the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers and the presiding judge, Nicholas 
      Zambrano, in the drafting of the fraudulent judgment rendered against 
      Chevron earlier this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron submitted evidence showing that plaintiffs&#8217; 
      representatives&#8212;including Steven Donziger, Pablo Fajardo, Juan Pablo 
      S&#225;enz, Julio Prieto, and Luis Yanza&#8212;covertly worked with Judge Zambrano 
      to draft the judgment. The letter states that the fraudulent conduct &#8220;is 
      causing serious, ongoing harm to Chevron Corporation and to the Republic 
      of Ecuador.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;To date, the plaintiffs&#8217; representatives have failed to offer any 
      explanation for how their internal, never-filed documents came to appear 
      in the fraudulent Lago Agrio judgment,&#8221; said Hewitt Pate, Chevron vice 
      president and general counsel. &#8220;Nor has the Judge explained how the 
      plaintiffs&#8217; private work came to be included in the decision bearing his 
      name. In the interest of justice and due process, it is incumbent upon 
      the authorities in Ecuador to investigate the full extent of this 
      misconduct.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is substantial and unrefuted evidence that the judgment against 
      Chevron is fraudulent. The evidence provided to the Prosecutor General 
      includes:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The judgment copies exact language from a June 2009 email that Fajardo 
        sent to Donziger, S&#225;enz, and Prieto. The body of the email includes a 
        short memo from a not-yet identified third party and a 
        &#8220;transcri[ption]&#8221; of a published Ecuadorian court opinion. That 
        &#8220;transcription&#8221; contains numerous mistakes not found in the published 
        court opinion itself. The judgment repeats all of these mistakes, 
        exactly, as well as a citation error Fajardo made in his email.
      
			
        The judgment also refers to several test samples by names that are not 
        found in the record, but rather in private spreadsheets created by the 
        plaintiffs, which contain information from the plaintiffs&#8217; own 
        database. The judgment replicates errors contained in the plaintiffs&#8217; 
        database and replicates errors in the database attributing data to the 
        wrong experts and confuses measurement units.
      
			
        The judgment contains language from a private memorandum authored by 
        plaintiffs&#8217; attorney Juan Pablo S&#225;enz and other members of plaintiffs&#8217; 
        legal team around November 2007 regarding a Chevron subsidiary&#8217;s 
        merger with Texaco. No fewer than fifteen instances, significant 
        portions of the S&#225;enz memorandum, including entire sentences, appear 
        verbatim or nearly verbatim in the judgment.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Much of this evidence is corroborated by expert analyses commissioned by 
      Chevron that found the similarities between the plaintiffs&#8217; documents 
      and the judgment are too great to be coincidence, and concluded that 
      either plaintiffs wrote at least part of the judgment, or the author(s) 
      of the judgment had access to documents prepared by the plaintiffs&#8217; 
      representatives and lawyers that were never submitted during the trial.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This evidence raises disturbing questions about who is really behind 
      the Lago Agrio judgment,&#8221; added Pate. &#8220;This is just the latest chapter 
      in an established pattern of fraud being carried out by plaintiffs&#8217; 
      lawyers and their representatives.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the letter, Chevron has submitted corresponding evidence 
      including video outtakes, emails, and other documents to prosecutors in 
      Ecuador. The letter can be reviewed at www.chevron.com/ecuador.

      received from JVP, as well as the opportunity to welcome the prominent 
      global investment group, Goldman Sachs, into the company. We look

&lt;p&gt;PARIS Dec 21 (Reuters) - A subsidiary of oil major
Total has agreed to buy Exxon Mobil's 35
percent stake in Fina Antwerp Olefins, a Belgian chemicals
plant, for an undisclosed amount, the French group said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Total already owned 65 percent of the plant, which it says
is Europe's second largest for the production of base chemicals
products, including ethylene, propylene and benzene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October, Total unveiled a plan to merge its chemicals and
fuel refining arms, in a move to bolster the business
profitability. Total has been struggling for years with its
refining business in Europe due to poor margins and weak demand
for fuel products.&lt;/p&gt;

      Oh, what fun it is to give! Coca-Cola is making spirits bright this 
      holiday season with more than a quarter million dollars in donations of 
      Arctic-themed toys and other gifts to the U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys 
      for Tots program. In addition to helping those in need at the holidays, 
      the donation helps raise awareness for the Coca-Cola &#8220;Arctic Home&#8221; 
      program, which supports polar bears and their Arctic habitat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola is celebrating its fifth year of partnership with Toys for 
      Tots by donating more than a quarter million dollars of Arctic-themed 
      gifts to local Toys for Tots chapters in seven U.S. cities, including: 
      Los Angeles, Dallas, Seattle, Charlotte, Chicago, New York and 
      Cincinnati. The toys and gifts for kids of all ages include plush polar 
      bears and polar bear hats, plus white MP3 players, skateboards, watches 
      and Velcro wallets. By sharing Arctic-themed gifts, Coca-Cola is helping 
      bring holiday joy to those who need it most, while reminding people to 
      take part in the &#8220;Arctic Home&#8221; program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This season, we&#8217;re giving back to our local communities with Toys for 
      Tots, while also raising awareness about our &#8216;Arctic Home&#8217; initiative to 
      support polar bears,&#8221; said Stuart Kronauge, Senior Vice President, 
      Coca-Cola Trademark Marketing, Coca-Cola North America. &#8220;We hope 
      everyone will express their inner Santa Claus this season by taking part 
      in our &#8216;Arctic Home&#8217; initiative to help polar bears and by supporting 
      Toys for Tots in their local communities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Arctic Home&#8221; is an initiative between Coca-Cola and World Wildlife Fund 
      (WWF) to raise awareness and generate funds to help protect the polar 
      bear&#8217;s Arctic habitat. To support polar bears, people can look for 
      limited-edition &#8220;Arctic Home&#8221; cans and caps on Coke products and donate 
      $1 by texting the package code to 357357. All donations go to WWF&#8217;s 
      efforts to protect the polar bear&#8217;s Arctic home. Donations can also be 
      made online at ArcticHome.com. 
      From the website, people can help spread the word to their friends and 
      families by sharing content on Facebook and Twitter using the hashtag 
      #ArcticHome. Coca-Cola will match all donations made with a package code 
      by March 15, 2012, up to $1 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are grateful for the very generous donation from Coca-Cola to local 
      communities across the nation, and we appreciate the continued 
      partnership,&#8221; said Marine Major Bill Grein, Vice President of the Marine 
      Toys for Tots Foundation. &#8220;These gifts will help children and teens in 
      need enjoy the magic of the Christmas holiday season.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The U.S. Marine Corps Reserve Toys for Tots Program is dependent on 
      charitable giving during this time of year. Donations are always in high 
      demand around the holidays, and the need for toys has skyrocketed in the 
      past year.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Coca-Cola has a long tradition of giving back at the holidays and 
      sharing season&#8217;s greetings and cheer. With holiday packaging and 
      advertising, the Coca-Cola Holiday Caravan tour &#8211; featuring festive

			About Toys for Tots
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Toys for Tots, a 65 year national charitable program run by the U.S. 
      Marine Corps Reserve, provides happiness and hope to economically 
      disadvantaged children during each Christmas holiday season. The toys, 
      books and other gifts collected and distributed by the Marines offer 
      these children recognition, confidence and a positive memory for a 
      lifetime. It is such experiences that help children become responsible 
      citizens and caring members of their community. Last year the Marine 
      Corps fulfilled the holiday hopes and dreams of 7.2 million less 
      fortunate children in over 700 communities nationwide. For more

			IBM&#8217;s Validation of ExaGrid&#8217;s TSM Integration Offers Customers 
      Enhanced Support for Scalable and Cost-effective Disk Backup and Restores
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ExaGrid 
      Systems, Inc., the leader in cost-effective, scalable disk-based 
      backup solutions with data 
      deduplication, today announced it has been awarded Ready 
      for IBM Tivoli support certification. In order to achieve Tivoli 
      Storage Manager (TSM) certification, IBM Tivoli testing teams have 
      validated that ExaGrid&#8217;s EX Series appliances are seamlessly integrated 
      and fully compatible to work with the Tivoli storage management software.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The achievement of Ready for IBM Tivoli software validation shows IBM 
      customers looking for a disk backup solution in their TSM environment 
      that the ExaGrid solution meets or exceeds IBM compatibility criteria. 
      ExaGrid is now included in the IBM Global Solutions Directory and the 
      Integrated Service Management Library (ISM).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier this quarter, ExaGrid announced 
      support for IBM TSM. The combination of the popular backup 
      application and ExaGrid&#8217;s disk backup with deduplication offers 
      additional reduction of up to 10:1 in the amount of backup data beyond 
      that offered by IBM TSM&#8217;s incremental forever methodology. ExaGrid&#8217;s 
      support for IBM TSM significantly reduces customer&#8217;s dependence on tape 
      and also allows IT users to free up expensive disk previously used for 
      backup that can be used for primary storage. In addition, IBM TSM 
      customers will benefit from ExaGrid&#8217;s GRID scalability to maintain the 
      fastest backup performance over time as data grows with no costly 
      forklift upgrades.

				Marc Crespi, VP of product management for ExaGrid: &#8220;We are 
        excited to have achieved Ready for Tivoli certification from IBM. Our 
        approach brings unique value to TSM users in enabling them to manage 
        backups more efficiently, reclaim expensive disk for primary storage, 
        and cost-effectively scale to support data growth. With this 
        certification, we look forward to bringing ExaGrid&#8217;s award-winning 
        disk backup with deduplication capabilities to IBM Tivoli Storage 
        Manager customers.&#8221;
      
			
				Jeff Harvey, Vice President of Business Development, S1 IT 
        Solutions: &#8220;Our customers using IBM Tivoli Storage Manager have 
        been eager to take advantage of ExaGrid&#8217;s industry-leading 
        scalability, performance and price. End users of TSM and ExaGrid can 
        now eliminate the management hassles of tape and gain much greater 
        backup efficiency. TSM has double-digit market share, and we&#8217;re 
        already seeing customers excited about this solution. We see great 
        potential in our customer base for the ExaGrid/TSM solution.&#8221;

			Important Features and Benefits of the ExaGrid EX Series Appliance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExaGrid's unique approach to disk-based backup delivers unparalleled 
      performance and scalability without requiring costly forklift upgrades 
      as data grows. ExaGrid customers achieve the fastest backup times 
      because data is written directly to disk and deduplication is performed 
      post-process after the data is stored, and most importantly because 
      ExaGrid adds full servers which include processor, memory, disk and 
      bandwidth versus just adding disk. This unique approach ensures that the 
      backup window does not re-explode as it would with other approaches. In 
      addition, ExaGrid's GRID scalability enables organizations to store up 
      to a 130TB full backup plus retention.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM TSM joins a growing list of leading backup applications and 
      utilities supported by the ExaGrid disk-based backup appliance. 
      ExaGrid&#8217;s disk backup system with data deduplication supports the 
      industry&#8217;s leading backup applications and utilities, including CA 
      ARCserve, CommVault Simpana, EMC NetWorker, HP Data Protector, Idera 
      SQLsafe, Linux/Unix File System Data Dumps, LiteSpeed for SQL Server, 
      Microsoft SQL dump, Oracle Recovery Manager (RMAN), Quest vRanger, Red

			About ZIOPHARM Oncology, Inc.:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ZIOPHARM Oncology is a biopharmaceutical company engaged in the 
      development and commercialization of a diverse portfolio of cancer 
      therapeutics. The Company&#8217;s small molecule programs include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palifosfamide (Zymafos&#174; or ZIO-201) is a novel DNA 
      cross-linker in class with bendamustine, ifosfamide, and 
      cyclophosphamide and is currently in a randomized, double-blinded, 
      placebo-controlled Phase 3 trial with palifosfamide administered 
      intravenously for the treatment of metastatic soft tissue sarcoma in the 
      front-line setting. The Company is also currently conducting a Phase 1 
      study of palifosfamide in combination with standard of care for 
      addressing small cell lung cancer; an oral form of palifosfamide 
      continues in preclinical study.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Darinaparsin (Zinapar&#174; or ZIO-101) is a novel mitochondrial- 
      and hedgehog-targeted agent (organic arsenic) currently in a solid tumor 
      Phase 1 study with oral administration and has been developed 
      intravenously for the treatment of relapsed peripheral T-cell lymphoma.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Indibulin (Zybulin&#8482; or ZIO-301) is a novel, oral tubulin binding agent 
      that is expected to have several potential benefits including oral 
      dosing, application in multi-drug resistant tumors, no neuropathy and a 
      quite tolerable toxicity profile. It is currently being studied in Phase 
      1/2 in metastatic breast cancer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ZIOPHARM is also pursuing the development of novel DNA-based 
      therapeutics in the field of cancer pursuant to a partnering arrangement 
      with Intrexon Corporation. The partnership includes two existing 
      clinical-stage product candidates, both of which are currently in Phase 
      1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ZIOPHARM's operations are located in Boston, MA and Germantown, MD with 
      an executive office in New York City. Further information about ZIOPHARM 
      may be found at www.ziopharm.com.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - "The Avengers" has a new superpower: 3D. Walt Disney Studios said Thursday that the movie will be released in the format when it debuts May 4.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The movie had previously been slated for 2D only.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the same announcement, Walt Disney Studios said another, untitled Marvel movie has moved up from a wide release on June 27, 2014, to a wide release on Apr. 4, 2014. There has been speculation that the sequel to "Captain America" might arrive in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Disney shed some light on a previously untitled movie scheduled for a November 27, 2013, release. It will be called "Frozen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A report saying "Frozen" is the untitled Pixar movie about dinosaurs -- which is due in 2013 -- is incorrect, a Disney representative told TheWrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Avengers" won't be the only major 2012 superhero film released in 3D. Another Marvel movie, Columbia Pictures' "The Amazing Spider-Man," will also be released in 3D when it comes out July 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Warner Bros.'

			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/77b275/indoor_location_po) 
      has announced the addition of the "Indoor 
      Location Positioning: Research Pipelines, Start-Ups and Predictions for

    &lt;/p&gt;

      In December, 2011, Google announced that Google Maps would now be able 
      to work indoors. This was followed quickly by announcements from other 
      major companies in the industry that their systems would also soon be 
      able to map and navigate indoors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The major players in mobile - Google, Microsoft, Samsung, Apple, RIM, 
      Nokia, Sony Ericsson  others - are actively developing new location 
      technologies that will work indoors. These technologies will 
      revolutionize smartphone usage by enabling mapping, navigation, local 
      search, check-ins, location-sharing and other location-based services to 
      work indoors in malls, megastores, offices, airports and other big 
      indoor places. Indoor location will also transform commerce, enabling 
      searching for items on store shelves, sending deals  promotions to 
      nearby customers, advertisements for nearby stores, and more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This 104 page report gives details of over sixty indoor-location 
      research projects at major mobile companies, and over a dozen start-up 
      companies in the area. It is a must-read for corporate planning groups 
      to know what their competition is doing, researchers to know the 
      approaches that others are working on, business development groups to 
      know which start-up companies will fit their needs, start-up companies 
      to know which major companies to pitch to, investors to know which 
      companies will lead this new area, venture capitalists to know which 
      start-ups fill niches in this area, cellular operators to know where 
      their next-generation of new capabilities will come from, and anyone 
      else who needs to track this exciting new technology.

			The Coca-Cola Foundation Awards $60,000 to 
      Three Atlanta Organizations Focused on Reducing Hunger
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Each receives a grant of $20,000
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Three local human service organizations focused on reducing hunger in 
      the Atlanta community were each surprised with donations of $20,000 from 
      The Coca-Cola Foundation. The Foundation awards unsolicited and 
      unrestricted &#8220;surprise&#8221; grants each year to local organizations as part 
      of its &#8220;Donations in Lieu of Decorations Initiative.&#8221; Since 1992, more 
      than $500,000 has been awarded to 45 organizations through this annual 
      tradition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hunger has become a growing concern in Georgia, which goes beyond 
      feeding the homeless. Almost two million Georgians, including children, 
      do not have enough food for an active healthy life. In fact, Georgia has 
      one of the highest poverty rates in the nation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We want to do our part during the holiday season to help our local 
      community thrive,&#8221; said Ingrid Saunders Jones, chair of The Coca-Cola 
      Foundation. &#8220;These grants will support the efforts of three outstanding 
      organizations that do the heavy lifting every day to reduce hunger in 
      our community. These organizations address the most basic of human needs 
      and improve lives, create opportunities, and help sustain our local 
      community.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Organizations receiving donations this year were:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Atlanta Community Food Bank, founded in 1979, distributes 
        nearly two million pounds of food each month to more than 700 
        nonprofit agencies in 38 counties in metro Atlanta and north Georgia.
      
			
				The Salvation Army Metro Atlanta Area Command helps 
        economically disadvantaged people within the community meet basic 
        needs through its Financial Emergency Service Center, Red Shield 
        Services and Transitional Housing Shelter, Residential Camping 
        program, and Boys and Girls Clubs.
      
			
				Hosea Feed the Hungry and Homeless, founded in 1969, works to 
        rescue, restore and stabilize at-risk homeless individuals and 
        families to self-sufficiency. More than 60,000 people are fed each 
        year during its signature holiday events on Thanksgiving, Easter, 
        Christmas and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company and The Coca-Cola Foundation have a strong history 
      of supporting hometown initiatives. More than $9 million has been 
      donated in 2011 to support environmental, fitness and nutrition, 
      educational, arts and culture, and civic initiatives in the Atlanta 
      Metropolitan area.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About The Coca-Cola Foundation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Foundation awarded more than $70 million to 263 community

			Pfizer Reports Results From Three Phase 4 Studies Demonstrating EMBEDA&#174; 
      (morphine sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride) Extended 
      Release Capsules CII Impact On Drug Liking And Withdrawal Symptoms
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today results from three Phase 4 
      studies of EMBEDA&#174; (morphine sulfate and naltrexone 
      hydrochloride) Extended Release Capsules CII designed to assess the 
      effect of the drug when crushed and taken either orally or intranasally.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Studies ALO-01-10-4005 and ALO-01-10-4004 were double-blind cross-over 
      designed studies in non-dependent, recreational opioid users that 
      compared subjective measures relating to abuse potential of crushed 
      EMBEDA to crushed extended-release morphine sulfate and placebo 
      following oral (study 4005) and intranasal (study 4004) administration. 
      In both studies, the use of EMBEDA was associated with significantly 
      (p0.01)lower scores on the primary endpoints of &#8220;drug liking&#8221; and 
      &#8220;high,&#8221; as well as the secondary endpoints including &#8220;good effects,&#8221; 
      &#8220;overall drug liking&#8221; and &#8220;take drug again&#8221; as compared with 
      extended-release morphine sulfate. Both medications had significantly 
      higher scores on all measures as compared with placebo. Common adverse 
      events observed following oral administration of crushed EMBEDA in study 
      ALO-01-10-4005 included somnolence, nausea, pruritis and dizziness, and 
      in study ALO-01-10-4004 following intranasal administration of crushed 
      EMBEDA included euphoric mood, somnolence and headache.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third study, ALO-01-09-111, was a double-blind cross-over study in 
      opioid-dependent patients with moderate-to-severe non-cancer chronic 
      pain stabilized on EMBEDA therapy. This study used an opioid withdrawal 
      scale to assess the ability of a single dose of crushed EMBEDA to induce 
      withdrawal symptoms compared with intact EMBEDA swallowed whole, as 
      crushing releases the sequestered naltrexone. The trial was not fully 
      enrolled as the study was discontinued early due to the voluntary recall 
      of EMBEDA. Only six patients completed the study, compared with a target 
      of 12 to 16 patients. Ingestion of crushed EMBEDA induced signs and 
      symptoms of withdrawal of at least moderate intensity in three of the 
      six patients. The most common adverse events reported in the trial 
      following administration of crushed EMBEDA were anxiety, tremor, 
      yawning, nausea, restlessness, diarrhea and flushing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EMBEDA is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the 
      management of moderate-to-severe pain when a continuous, 
      around-the-clock opioid analgesic is needed for an extended period of 
      time. EMBEDA is NOT intended for use as a prn analgesic. EMBEDA contains 
      pellets of an extended-release oral formulation of morphine sulphate, an 
      opioid receptor agonist, with a sequestered core of naltrexone 
      hydrochloride, an opioid receptor antagonist. Proper use requires EMBEDA 
      to be swallowed whole or the contents of the capsules to be sprinkled on 
      apple sauce. The pellets in the capsules are not to be crushed, 
      dissolved, or chewed before swallowing. Misuse or abuse of EMBEDA by 
      tampering with the formulation by crushing or chewing the pellets causes 
      the rapid release and absorption of both morphine and naltrexone. The 
      resulting morphine dose may be fatal, particularly in opioid-na&#239;ve 
      individuals. In opioid-tolerant individuals, the absorption of 
      naltrexone may increase the risk of precipitating withdrawal. There is 
      no evidence that the naltrexone in EMBEDA reduces the abuse liability of 
      EMBEDA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In March 2011, Pfizer voluntarily recalled from U.S. wholesalers and 
      retailers all dosage forms of EMBEDA because a pre-specified stability 
      requirement was not met during routine testing. Pfizer has been 
      continuing its efforts to address the stability requirement and 
      reintroduce EMBEDA to the U.S. market as quickly as possible. There are 
      several key decision points during 2012 that will determine the 
      necessary corrective action and associated timing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			WARNING: EMBEDA&#174; (morphine sulfate and 
      naltrexone hydrochloride) Extended Release Capsules contain morphine, an 
      opioid agonist and a Schedule II controlled substance with an abuse 
      liability similar to other opioid agonists.
			EMBEDA&#174; 
      can be abused in a manner similar to other opioid agonists, legal or 
      illicit.
			This should be considered when prescribing or dispensing 
      EMBEDA&#174; in situations where the physician or 
      pharmacist is concerned about an increased risk of misuse, abuse, or 
      diversion.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EMBEDA&#174; contains pellets of an 
      extended-release oral formulation of morphine sulfate, an opioid 
      receptor agonist, surrounding an inner core of naltrexone hydrochloride, 
      an opioid receptor antagonist indicated for the management of moderate 
      to severe pain when a continuous, around-the-clock opioid analgesic is 
      needed for an extended period of time.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EMBEDA&#174; is NOT intended for use as a prn 
      analgesic.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EMBEDA&#174; 100 mg/4 mg IS FOR USE IN 
      OPIOID-TOLERANT PATIENTS ONLY. Ingestion of these capsules or the 
      pellets within the capsules may cause fatal respiratory depression when 
      administered to patients not already tolerant to high doses of opioids.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Patients should not consume alcoholic beverages while on EMBEDA&#174; 
      therapy. Additionally, patients must not use prescription or 
      non-prescription medications containing alcohol while on EMBEDA&#174; 
      therapy.
			The co-ingestion of alcohol with EMBEDA&#174; 
      may result in an increase of plasma levels and potentially fatal 
      overdose of morphine.
			EMBEDA&#174; is to be 
      swallowed whole or the contents of the capsules sprinkled on apple sauce.
			The pellets in the capsules are not to be crushed, dissolved, or 
      chewed due to the risk of rapid release and absorption of a potentially 
      fatal dose of morphine.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Crushing, chewing, or dissolving EMBEDA&#174; 
      will also result in the release of naltrexone which may precipitate 
      withdrawal in opioid-tolerant individuals.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The common adverse events seen on initiation of therapy with EMBEDA&#174; are 
      dose dependent, and their frequency depends on the clinical setting, the 
      patient&#8217;s level of opioid tolerance, and host factors specific to the 
      individual. They should be expected and managed as part of opioid 
      analgesia. The most frequent of these include drowsiness, dizziness, 
      constipation, and nausea.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional common adverse events reported during clinical studies 
      include constipation, nausea, and somnolence.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Indications and Usage
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EMBEDA&#174; is an extended-release oral formulation of morphine 
      sulfate and naltrexone hydrochloride indicated for the management of 
      moderate to severe pain when a continuous, around-the-clock opioid 
      analgesic is needed for an extended period of time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EMBEDA&#174; is NOT intended for use as a prn analgesic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EMBEDA&#174; is not indicated for acute/postoperative pain or if 
      the pain is mild or not expected to persist for an extended period of 
      time. EMBEDA&#174; is only indicated for postoperative use if the 
      patient is already receiving chronic opioid therapy prior to surgery or 
      if the postoperative pain is expected to be moderate to severe and 
      persist for an extended period of time.

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Federal police in Brazil on Wednesday recommended the indictment of several Chevron and Transocean officials involved in an oil spill in early November for environmental crimes and withholding information in an investigation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The indictment is unrelated to a civil suit brought against the companies by a public prosecutor on December 14, seeking fines of $11 billion for their alleged roles in the spill at Chevron's Frade field off the coast of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This latest legal action against Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, and Transocean, one of the world's biggest drillers, for a 3,000-barrel spill that never reached Brazilian beaches highlights the major political risks of operating in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Head of the investigation for the federal police in Rio de Janeiro Fabio Scliar said on Wednesday he submitted his report to the Federal Public Ministry recommending that it bring charges against the two companies and its employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I affirmed my conviction ... of environmental crimes and withholding information," Scliar told Reuters by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees of the two companies, including Chevron's Brazil Chief Executive George Buck, could face charges if the federal prosecutor's office, which is in recess until 2012, accepts Scliar's recommendations and pursues them in the courts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scliar said the companies were increasing the risks of an environmental accident in drilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They were betting on luck and lost, which caused this whole problem that led to environmental losses of grand proportions," Scliar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it was advised the police were seeking indictments against its employees in Brazil, but that it believes these "are without merit," a company spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will vigorously defend the company and its employees," spokesman Kurt Glaubitz said in an email. "The facts ... will demonstrate that Chevron responded appropriately and responsibly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives from Transocean also said the indictments were groundless and that the facts would exonerate the company and employees when fully examined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although such alleged crimes could carry sentences of over 10 years, according to some experts, it is unlikely any of the employees of Chevron or Transocean would spend time in jail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soon after announcing a series of stunning discoveries in 2006 and 2007 that would become known worldwide, Chief Executive Jose Sergio Gabrielli at the state-controlled oil company Petrobras said exploration of the massive offshore subsalt deposits was virtually without risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The storm that Chevron's relatively small spill last month has caused in the local courts will cast a pall over one of the most promising new oil frontiers in decades and gives investors reason for pause before they pay top dollar for offshore blocks that concession holders are looking to farm out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting By Bruno Marfinati and Reese Ewing; Editing by Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's environment inspector fined Chevron Corp 10 million reais ($5.4 million) for breaching the terms of the U.S. oil company's environmental license when tackling an offshore spill at a well it drilled in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine on Friday is on top of a 50 million reais charge the inspector, Ibama, slapped on Chevron for causing the spill at the Frade field when rock gave way due to a pressure surge. Chevron estimates 2,400 barrels of oil spilled into the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fines pale into insignificance against the $11 billion lawsuit Rio de Janeiro state prosecutors are trying to bring against the company for a spill analysts consider fairly minor and which never reached the country's shores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibama said the latest fine was for Chevron's failure to adhere to the Individual Emergency Plan set out in the environmental license that it needs to operate. Ibama said Chevron lacked necessary equipment and was slow to respond to the leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chevron said it properly followed the emergency plan, which had been approved by Ibama.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The plan was deployed rapidly and standard procedures were quickly carried out in order to stem the source of the leak. In just four days, a period considered excellent by industry experts, the company managed to control the source of the leak," the company said in a statement late on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been concerns that unpredictable regulation could deter big oil companies from investing in Brazil just as it starts to tap vast new oil reserves of up to 50 billion barrels discovered in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's so-called subsalt reserves lie about 7 km (4.4 miles) under the sea, making them technically challenging to reach and thus carrying potentially greater risk of accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal police this week recommended the indictment of several officials from Chevron and rig contractor Transocean for environmental crimes and withholding information from investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transocean issued a statement late on Friday detailing some of the events in Brazil and reminding investors that its contract for the Sedco 706 rig, which Chevron operated in Brazil, required the California-based oil company to indemnify Transocean for claims arising for pollution below the surface of the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira in Sao Paolo and Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Writing by Peter Murphy; Editing by Dale Hudson, Bob Burgdorfer and Yoko Nishikawa)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Transocean says contract puts Chevron in line for claims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO Dec 23 (Reuters) - Brazil's environment inspector
fined Chevron Corp 10 million reais ($5.4 million) for
breaching the terms of the U.S. oil company's environmental
license when tackling an offshore spill at a well it drilled in
November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fine on Friday is on top of a 50 million reais charge

the company said in a statement late on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There have been concerns that unpredictable
regulation could deter big oil companies from investing in
Brazil just as it starts to tap vast new oil reserves of up to
50 billion barrels discovered in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's so-called subsalt reserves lie about 7 km (4.4
miles) under the sea, making them technically challenging to
reach and thus carrying potentially greater risk of accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal police this week recommended the indictment of
several officials from Chevron and rig contractor Transocean
 for environmental crimes and withholding information
from investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transocean issued a statement late on Friday detailing some
of the events in Brazil and reminding investors that its
contract for the Sedco 706 rig, which Chevron operated in
Brazil, required the California-based oil company to indemnify

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Brazil's environment inspector fined Chevron Corp 10 million reais ($5.4 million) for breaching the terms of the U.S. oil company's environmental license when tackling an offshore spill at a well it drilled in November.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The fine on Friday is on top of a 50 million reais charge the inspector, Ibama, slapped on Chevron for causing the spill at the Frade field when rock gave way due to a pressure surge. Chevron estimates 2,400 barrels of oil spilled into the sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fines pale into insignificance against the $11 billion lawsuit Rio de Janeiro state prosecutors are trying to bring against the company for a spill analysts consider fairly minor and which never reached the country's shores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That action has raised concerns that unpredictable regulatory oversight could deter big oil companies from investing in Brazil just as it starts to tap vast new oil reserves of up to 50 billion barrels discovered in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazil's so-called subsalt reserves lie about 7 km (4.4 miles) under the sea, making them technically challenging to reach and thus carrying potentially greater risk of accidents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ibama said the latest fine was for Chevron's failure to adhere to the Individual Emergency Plan set out in the environmental license it needs to operate. Ibama said Chevron lacked necessary equipment and was slow to respond to the leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal police have also recommended the indictment of several officials from Chevron and rig contractor Transocean for environmental crimes and withholding information from investigators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Transocean issued a statement late on Friday detailing some of these events and reminding investors that its contract for the Sedco 706 rig, which Chevron operated in Brazil, required the California-based oil company to indemnify Transocean for claims arising for pollution below the surface of the water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Marcelo Teixeira in Sao Paolo and Braden Reddall in San Francisco; Writing by Peter Murphy; Editing by Dale Hudson and Bob Burgdorfer)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Coca-Cola Femsa's IDRs at 'A'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed the following credit ratings of Coca-Cola Femsa 
      S.A.B. de C.V. (KOF):
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A';--Local 
      Currency IDR at 'A';--National Scale Long Term Rating at 
      'AAA(mex)';--National Scale Short Term Rating at 'F1+(mex)';--USD500 
      million Senior Notes Due 2020 at 'A'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating actions reflect KOF's substantial free cash flow generation, 
      solid financial position, and strong business profile. The FC IDR is 
      rated above Mexico's country ceiling of 'A-', country where the company 
      is domiciled, as in Fitch's opinion transfer and convertibility risks 
      are mitigated by the company's strategic relationship with The Coca-Cola 
      Company (KO, rated 'A+'/Stable) and the explicit and implicit financial 
      support KOF has received from KO. In addition, the ratings consider the 
      geographical diversification of the EBITDA generated outside Mexico, as 
      well as its strong credit profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's ratings incorporate the mergers of the bottling operations of 
      Grupo Tampico, S.A. de C.V. (Grupo Tampico), Corporacion de los Angeles, 
      S.A. de C.V. (Grupo CIMSA) and Grupo Fomento Queretano, S.A. de C.V. 
      (Grupo Foque). The total value of the mergers was MXN26.9 billion and 
      represented the largest investment of KOF since Panamco in 2003. Fitch 
      considers that the mergers will improve the company's business position 
      through the integration of contiguous territories and operations, 
      reaching expected synergies of around MXN760 million at EBITDA level in 
      the following 18 to 24 months. Additionally, these transactions were 
      primarily funded with equity and KOF balance sheet will assume MXN6 
      billion of additional net debt which, in Fitch's view, KOF has enough 
      financial flexibility to incorporate without having a significant effect 
      in its credit profile.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's ratings are underpinned by its solid business position as the 
      largest bottler in the world of Coca-Cola products with operations 
      across Latin America. Despite the strong competition present in the 
      industry, the company's profitability margins are among the highest in 
      the business, driven by excellent product segmentation, superior 
      execution at the point of sale and appropriate pricing architecture for 
      its broad portfolio of products
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's presence in Latin America provides the company with geographical 
      diversification of revenues and EBITDA generation that lowers business 
      risk and cash flow volatility. For the latest 12 months (LTM) ended 
      Sept. 30, 2011, Fitch estimates that operations outside Mexico accounted 
      around 63% of total sales, 49% of total volume and 60% of total EBITDA. 
      The effect of the recent mergers will not change significantly the 
      importance of the foreign operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's credit metrics remain solid within the rating category. For the 
      latest 12 months (LTM) ended Sept. 30, 2011, the company's total debt to 
      EBITDA and net debt to EBITDA were 1.0 times (x) and 0.2x, respectively, 
      while EBITDA to gross interest expenses was 13.7x. On a pro forma basis 
      for this same period and incorporating the full effect of Grupo Tampico, 
      Grupo CIMSA and Grupo Foque mergers, Fitch estimates a total debt to 
      EBITDA of around 1.1x and a net debt to EBITDA close to 0.4x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Free cash flow (FCF) generation of the company is strong supported by 
      its business position and operating margins. Fitch expects for 2011 a 
      FCF generation (defined as cash flow from operation less capital 
      expenditures and dividends) of approximately MXN2.5 billion. As of Sept. 
      30, 2011 LTM EBITDA margins had a slight improvement to 20.1% from 19.7% 
      when compared to the same period of 2010. Fitch estimates that EBITDA 
      margins will remain stable as main raw material cost (sweetener and PET) 
      and foreign exchange volatility will be partially offset by ongoing 
      productivity efficiencies and expected synergies coming from its mergers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF has ample liquidity. As of Sept. 30, 2011, the company had MXN18.6 
      billion of cash and marketable securities compared to short term 
      obligations of MXN4.9 billion. In addition, the company has ample access 
      to bank loans and capital markets. For the following months, Fitch 
      expects KOF to pay the assumed debt related to the mergers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's operative performance has been solid with sales and volume growth. 
      The company reported LTM net revenues of MXN115.2 billion as of Sept. 
      30, 2011 which represents an increase of 10% as compared to the same 
      period of 2010. Excluding Venezuela, all the territories reported 
      positive volume growth that combined with higher average selling prices, 
      contributed mainly to this increase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Downward movements in the ratings could be triggered by a large 
      debt-financed acquisition that significantly increases leverage and 
      results in long term changes to the company's capital structure. 
      Negative rating actions could also result from a sustained deterioration 
      of its free cash flow generation, driven by operating pressures or an 
      adverse economic climate, or a lack of support from KO.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN Dec 27 (Reuters) - Germany will ease its visa
controls next year, its foreign minister said on Tuesday, in a
move expected to help thousands of people and companies from
Russia and China seeking to do business in the European Union's
biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"I am pushing for a liberal visa policy which reflects
Germany's role in a globalised world," Guido Westerwelle told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new rules are designed to simplify and speed up visa
issuance by demanding fewer documents, making forms available on
the Internet and ensuring decisions are made within 72 hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the administration will be outsourced and
individuals, especially business people, will no longer be
required to appear to German authorities in person.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is of particular importance in large countries like
Russia where individuals have to travel long distances at great
expense to appear at a German consulate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China and Russia have for years complained that Germany's
visa rules, which experts say are tighter than other EU states',
are too restrictive. The issue came up at talks between Russian
President Dmitry Medvedev and Chancellor Angela Merkel in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Westerwelle stressed national security would not be
compromised. "This in no way contradicts our security
interests," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The influential East Committee for the German Economy, which
boosts business ties between Germany and eastern Europe and
Russia, has also called for a relaxation of what they describe
as "out of date" controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Biometric passports are by far the most suitable way to
control people entering the country," Rainer Lindner, head of
the committee, told Reuters, adding Germany had the tightest
rules within the EU's Schengen area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a Committee study, visa controls between the EU
and eastern neighbours such as Ukraine and Russia cost the
European economy and taxpayers hundreds of millions of euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trade between Germany and Russia could surpass a record of
$70 billion this year, Medvedev said in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russia and the EU are also working on moves towards
visa-free travel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* Deal for $179 mln plus about $14 mln in working capital&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;* Co to assume $118 mln in certain liabilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 27 (Reuters) - Westmoreland Coal Co said
it has agreed to buy the Kemmerer mine in southwestern Wyoming
from Chevron's unit for $179 million plus about $14
million in working capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchase price will be funded through a combination of
about $74 million in cash and the assumption of about $118
million in certain liabilities, Westmoreland said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colorado-based Westmoreland, which sees closing the deal by
Jan. 31, said it expects the transaction to be "cash-flow
positive" immediately upon closing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kemmerer mine on average has produced 4.7 million tons
of high-quality sub-bituminous coal over the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron owns interests in and operates three coal mines and

&lt;p&gt;By Rob Cox
The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a rough year for Goldman Sachs. With the environment still difficult, big changes can&#8217;t be ruled out. Breakingviews envisions some of the possibilities in an imagined memo to shareholders during 2012.
&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fellow shareholders:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2011 was a period of strong performance for Goldman Sachs in the context of a challenging year. Despite continuing uncertainty in the global economy and the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in Europe, an unwavering focus on clients allowed us to generate net revenue of $40 billion with net earnings of $8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was on a par with the previous year at a time when many of our competitors have struggled. But the 46 percent decline in our share price is not what you have come to expect from us. We are changing our business and management in ways that we believe will create value for our shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among these changes has been the separation of the chairman and chief executive roles. While joining the two positions made sense in the early years of our public market listing, the regulatory and political climate that has emerged since 2008 necessitates a new approach to managing your company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chairman Gerald Corrigan&#8217;s experience at the Federal Reserve positions him to lead our efforts in shaping and complying with the new framework of the global financial services business. Mr. Corrigan&#8217;s new role will give Michael Evans, our new chief executive, unprecedented freedom to focus on our operations, which are also undergoing transformation. As co-chairs of our Business Standards Committee, which reported early in 2011, Messrs. Evans and Corrigan are uniquely qualified to lead our fundamental re-commitment to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of these important changes would have been possible without the support of Lloyd Blankfein, our former chairman and CEO, who now chairs Partners Capital LP, the independent asset management and securities trading business we spun off earlier this year to allow the remainder of our businesses to focus on our clients and the regulated functions of a bank holding company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Being nimble is a very large part of our culture and our success story. Staying close to our clients and adapting our business and management to meet their evolving needs will remain a cornerstone of our long-term success.&#160;
&#160;
&#160;
Predictions: Breakingviews is publishing a series of articles over the holiday that look ahead to 2012. The pieces will be collected together in the annual &#8217;Predictions Book,&#8217; produced in print and electronic form early in the New Year.&lt;/p&gt;

			About Acorda 
      Therapeutics
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Acorda Therapeutics is a biotechnology company developing therapies for 
      multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury and related nervous system 
      disorders. The Company is commercializing and marketing AMPYRA&#174; 
      (dalfampridine) Extended Release Tablets, 10 mg, in the United 
      States. AMPYRA is a potassium channel blocker approved as a treatment to 
      improve walking in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS); this was 
      demonstrated by an improvement in walking speed. AMPYRA was developed 
      using Alkermes&#8217; Matrix Drug Absorption System (MXDAS&#174;) 
      technology and is manufactured by Alkermes Pharma Ireland Limited, a 
      subsidiary of Alkermes plc, based on a supply agreement with Acorda.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Acorda also markets ZANAFLEX 
      CAPSULES&#174; (tizanidine hydrochloride), a short-acting drug 
      for the management of spasticity. The Company's pipeline includes a 
      number of products in development for the treatment, regeneration and 
      repair of the spinal cord and brain.

			Forward-Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This press release includes forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. All 
      statements, other than statements of historical facts, regarding 
      management's expectations, beliefs, goals, plans or prospects should be 
      considered forward-looking. These statements are subject to risks and 
      uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially, 
      including Acorda Therapeutics' ability to successfully market and sell 
      Ampyra in the United States; third party payors (including governmental 
      agencies) may not reimburse for the use of Ampyra at acceptable rates or 
      at all and may impose restrictive prior authorization requirements that 
      limit or block prescriptions; the risk of unfavorable results from 
      future studies of Ampyra; the occurrence of adverse safety events with 
      our products; delays in obtaining or failure to obtain regulatory 
      approval of Ampyra outside of the United States and our dependence on 
      our collaboration partner Biogen Idec in connection therewith; 
      competition, including the impact of anticipated potential generic 
      competition on Zanaflex Capsules revenues; failure to protect Acorda 
      Therapeutics&#8217; intellectual property, to defend against the intellectual 
      property claims of others or to obtain third party intellectual property 
      licenses needed for the commercialization of our products; the ability 
      to obtain additional financing to support Acorda Therapeutics' 
      operations; and, unfavorable results from our research and development 
      programs. These and other risks are described in greater detail in 
      Acorda Therapeutics' filings with the Securities and Exchange 
      Commission. Acorda Therapeutics may not actually achieve the goals or 
      plans described in its forward-looking statements, and investors should 
      not place undue reliance on these statements. Forward-looking statements 
      made in this release are made only as of the date hereof, and Acorda 
      Therapeutics disclaims any intent or obligation to update any 
      forward-looking statements as a result of developments occurring after 
      the date of this press release.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI Dec 28 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said
on Wednesday it would launch an open offer Jan. 16-20 for the
shares it does not already own in Indian entertainment company
UTV Software Communications Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company, which controls 50.4 percent of UTV, said
in a newspaper advertisement it would pay 835.03 to 1,000 rupees
a share for delisting the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the top end the offer represents a premium of 1.6 percent
to UTV's closing price on Tuesday and would cost Disney about
$384 million for the buyout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in UTV, valued at $761 million, were trading up 1
percent at 993.65 rupees in a weak Mumbai market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney had said in July it plans to delist UTV, a provider

      Walton Yellowhead Development Corporation Completes Land Acquisition of 
      Yellowhead Property
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Yellowhead Development Corporation (the &#8220;Corporation&#8221;) 
      today announced the acquisition of 131.41 acres of land in Edmonton, 
      Alberta, referred to as the Yellowhead property (the &#8220;Property&#8221;) 
      in the Corporation&#8217;s prospectus (the &#8220;Prospectus&#8221;) dated October 
      28, 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation recently completed an initial public offering, raising a 
      total of $28,000,000 for the purposes of acquiring, managing and 
      developing the Property. The Corporation has now acquired the 131.41 
      acre Property for a total consideration, inclusive of lease and tax 
      adjustments, of $25,033,622.97. This was satisfied through the issuance 
      of 89,256 units at a price of approximately $9.475 per unit for an 
      aggregate value of $845,695.64 with the balance payable in cash. These 
      units are comprised of 89,256 class B non-voting shares at an issuance 
      price of $2.50 per share and a debenture having a face value of $669,420 
      at a discounted issuance price of $622,555.64. Walton International 
      Group Inc. received these units in exchange for its undivided interest 
      in the Property, all in accordance with the terms of the Prospectus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation has been established to provide investors with the 
      opportunity to participate in the returns available from industrial 
      development of the Property. The Corporation&#8217;s investment 
      objectives are to (i) preserve the capital investment of the investors 
      in the Units; (ii) make annual cash distributions on the Units 
      (comprised of payments of interest and/or principal on the Offering 
      Debentures and/or dividends or other distributions on the Shares) 
      beginning in December 2012 until the final distribution of funds from 
      the project, which is anticipated to be in December, 2014; and (iii) 
      achieve a net internal rate of return of 13% on the $10.00 purchase 
      price of the Units under the offering from the cash distributions 
      referred to in (ii) above.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Corporation will be managed by Walton Asset Management L.P. and the 
      development of the Property will be managed by Walton Development and 
      Management L.P., both of which are members of the Walton Group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades 14 Below Investment Grade Classes from JPMCC 2006-LDP9
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings downgrades 14 classes of JP Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2006-LDP9 commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates. A detailed listing of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades reflect an increase in Fitch modeled losses across the 
      pool, which includes assumed losses on loans in special servicing and on 
      performing loans with declines in performance indicative of a higher 
      probability of default. Fitch modeled losses of 14.7% (15.6% cumulative 
      transaction losses which includes losses realized to date). Fitch 
      expects classes F through P to be fully depleted by losses on specially 
      serviced loans and classes E and E-S to be impacted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the December 2011 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has been reduced by 7.2% to $4.53 billion from $4.88 
      billion at issuance. There are no defeased loans. There are cumulative 
      interest shortfalls in the amount of $11.9 million affecting classes E 
      through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to losses is the Belnord loan (7.9%) secured by 
      a 215 unit residential rental property located in the Upper West Side 
      neighborhood of New York City. In addition to the residential rentals, 
      the property also includes 60,514 square feet (sf) of retail space. The 
      loan is sponsored by Gary Barnett. The property consists of both rent 
      controlled/stabilized and market rent units. At issuance, the borrower 
      estimated that units would be converted from rent controlled/stabilized 
      to market rents benefiting from the upside in revenue. The New York 
      State Supreme Court recently ruled that if a property received a J-51 
      Tax Abatement from the city, such as the subject, they could not 
      increase the rents on rent controlled/stabilized units to market rents. 
      This decision will have a major impact on the borrower's ability to 
      execute its business plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loan transferred to the special servicer in June 2011 for imminent 
      default. Workout discussions are ongoing. The year-end (YE) 2010 debt 
      service coverage ratio (DSCR) and occupancy were 95% and 0.56 times (x) 
      compared to issuance of 98% and 0.47x, respectively. The loan was 
      structured with a $50 million reserve for debt service shortfall, of 
      which $12.2 million remains outstanding. Fitch expects that, at current 
      operating levels, the debt service reserve is sufficient to cover 
      shortfalls for approximately one more year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to losses is the Americold Portfolio, 
      which is secured by four cold storage warehouse/distribution facilities 
      totaling 3,328,621 sf (51,654,912 cubic feet) located across four 
      states. The properties are located in Carthage, MO (66% of portfolio 
      NRA); Fort Worth, TX (14.3% of portfolio NRA); West Point, MS (10.3% of 
      portfolio NRA) and Garden City, KS (9.5% of portfolio NRA). The loan is 
      sponsored by Vornado Realty Trust, Crescent Real Estate Equities and the 
      Yucaipa Companies. The servicer reported DSCR for YE 2010 and issuance 
      was 0.67x and 1.85x, respectively. The drop in DSCR is attributed to the 
      loss of a major tenant, Sarah Lee, who has ceased renting space in the 
      Fort Worth property. This Fort Worth property has since been closed in 
      an effort to reduce operating expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to losses is the Bank of America Plaza 
      loan which is secured by a 1,253,499 sf class A office property in 
      Atlanta, GA. The loan transferred to the special servicer in February 
      2011 due to imminent default. Workout discussions continue, however no 
      agreement has yet been reached. The loan is 60 days delinquent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The property was 82% occupied as of YE 2009 (the most recent figure 
      available), compared with approximately 100% at issuance. Ernst  Young 
      (17% of NRA) vacated upon expiration of its lease in April 2007. The 
      largest tenant, Bank of America, has indicated that it will 
      significantly downsize its space to approximately 13% of NRA from 30% 
      beginning in October 2011. Additionally, the lease rate on the space 
      will be approximately half of what Bank of America was previously paying.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (TheWrap.com) - Move over, Whitney and Bobby.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sinead O'Connor is wasting no time elaborating on the reasons why she broke up with her husband after 16 days of marriage. One of them? Crack cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Irish songstress previously revealed she and fourth husband Barry Herridge went on a search for marijuana on the night of their wedding in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems the singer's decision to bring her new husband, a drug-abuse counselor, along for a marijuana search in a seedy portion of Las Vegas on the night of their wedding wasn't such a great call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fact, the way O'Connor tells it, the newlyweds ended up with a drug somewhat harder than pot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elaborating on the "wild ride," she told British tabloid The Sun: "We ended up in a cab in some place that was quite dangerous. I wasn't scared -- but a drugs counselor. What was I thinking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then I was handed a load of crack," she added. "Barry was very frightened -- that kind of messed everything up a bit, really."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crack aside, it doesn't sound like the marriage was meant to last anyway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It felt like I was living in a coffin," she also told The Sun. "It was going to be a coffin for both of us, and I saw him crushed. The whole reason I ended it was out of respect and love for the man."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It seems that the experience has crushed O'Connor too -- or damaged her libido, at least. The singer -- who famously went hunting for "a very sweet sex-starved man" earlier this year -- said she doesn't plan to date anyone for awhile.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - Brazil's oil industry watchdog ANP said on Friday it issued a third citation against Chevron for a November oil spill at the Frade offshore field, signaling that regulators are stepping up oversight of the No. 2 U.S. oil company's offshore operations in Brazil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ANP can fine Chevron up to 50 million reais ($26.8 million) for each citation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron failed to put in practice procedures that would slow the depletion of reservoirs at the well 9-FR-50DP-RJS in the Frade field, ANP said in a statement sent to reporters by email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Chevron has been cited in a $20 billion civil lawsuit filed by public prosecutors regarding the oil spill. Brazilian federal police have indicted Chevron, the drilling company Transocean and executives from both companies in a criminal case alleging environmental crimes and obstruction of justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The procedures the ANP alleges Chevron failed to meet had been agreed to in a development plan approved by the agency. Failure to follow the plan led to the leaking of oil from the reservoir, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANP did not say how much it planned to fine Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. company said in a statement later on Friday that it will analyze ANP's allegations but added it was "confident that it has always acted in a diligent and appropriate way," and accordingly to the development plan approved by ANP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On November 20, Chevron said that the leak of 2,400 barrels of oil was the result of higher than expected pressure in the oil reservoir. When the company drilled into the reservoir, oil surged into the well in an event known as "a kick", Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the potential "blowout" was prevented by a valve on the seabed, pressure was so high that it cracked the walls of the well about 500 meters (1,640 ft) below the ocean floor. Oil then slowly worked its way through the porous undersea rock to the seabed from where it bubbled up to the surface, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron on November 20 said it took full responsibility for the spill and that the leak was a result of underestimating the oil reservoir pressure and overestimating the strength of the rock through which they were drilling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Frade field is 52 percent owned by San Ramon, California-based Chevron, which is also the fields operator. Brazil's state-controlled oil company Petrobras owns 30 percent and 18 percent by Japanese consortium Frade Japao.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies were producing about 80,000 barrels of oil a day in the Frade field at the time of the spill which occurred during the drilling of a new well using a rig owned by Transocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brazilian newspaper Folha de S.Paulo said Chevron had been fined as much as 100 million reais ($53.6 million) previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron fell 0.92 percent to $106.55 a share at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 1.865 reais)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sabrina Lorenzi and Inae Riveras; Writing by Jeb Blount; Editing by Guillermo Parra-Bernal,; Marguerita Choy and Bob Burgdorfer)&lt;/p&gt;

			Pfizer Receives FDA Approval to Extend Use of Prevnar 13&#174; 
      for Prevention of Pneumococcal Pneumonia and Invasive Disease in Adults 
      50 Years and Older
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			First pneumococcal conjugate vaccine for adults 50+ has potential 
      to help address high incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) has granted approval of the Company&#8217;s pneumococcal 
      conjugate vaccine Prevnar 13&#174;* (Pneumococcal 13-valent 
      Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]) as a single 
      dose for use in adults. Prevnar 13 is indicated for adults 50 years of 
      age and older for active immunization for the prevention of pneumonia 
      and invasive disease caused by the 13 Streptococcus pneumoniae (S. 
      pneumoniae) serotypes contained in the vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pneumococcal disease, including pneumonia, in adults 50 years and older 
      represents a significant personal and societal health burden in the 
      United States. The FDA approval of Prevnar 13 for these adults offers 
      the potential to contribute to the health of millions of aging 
      Americans,&#8221; said Ian Read, chairman and chief executive officer, Pfizer 
      Inc. &#8220;This approval is representative of Pfizer&#8217;s dedication to 
      discovering and bringing to market life-changing medicines and vaccines.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease (PD) is a leading public health issue in adults 50 
      years of age and older, a population rapidly increasing in the United 
      States. In this population, there are estimated to be hundreds of 
      thousands of S. pneumoniae infections per year, including more 
      than 440,000 cases of pneumococcal pneumonia, accounting for an 
      estimated 200,000 emergency department visits and 300,000 
      hospitalizations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Clearly, there remains a high incidence of pneumococcal pneumonia in 
      this adult population,&#8221; said Emilio Emini, Ph.D., chief scientific 
      officer, Vaccine Research, Pfizer Inc. &#8220;Prevnar 13 was licensed for 
      adults 50 years and older by the FDA under an accelerated approval 
      pathway because of its potential to help address this significant 
      disease burden.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer&#8217;s application to the U.S. FDA was based on safety and 
      immunogenicity studies involving approximately 6,000 adults 50 years of 
      age and older. In these Phase 3 trials, vaccination with Prevnar 13 was 
      shown to induce a functional antibody response to the 13 serotypes 
      contained in the vaccine in adults 50 years of age and older, including 
      individuals previously vaccinated with the conventional pneumococcal 
      polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) and those na&#239;ve to pneumococcal vaccines. 
      The effectiveness of Prevnar 13 administered less than five years after 
      PPSV is not known.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expanded indication approved by the U.S. FDA is based on immune 
      responses elicited by Prevnar 13, and there have been no controlled 
      trials in adults demonstrating a decrease in pneumococcal pneumonia or 
      invasive pneumococcal disease after vaccination with Prevnar 13.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer is currently conducting the Community-Acquired Pneumonia 
      Immunization Trial in Adults (CAPiTA) to fulfill requirements under the 
      accelerated approval pathway. CAPiTA is an efficacy trial involving more 
      than 84,000 subjects designed to evaluate whether Prevnar 13 is 
      effective in preventing the first episode of community-acquired 
      pneumonia (CAP) caused by the 13 pneumococcal serotypes contained in the 
      vaccine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Pfizer has agreed, as a post-marketing commitment in 
      connection with the approval by the U.S. FDA, to conduct a study 
      evaluating concomitant use of Prevnar 13 and TIV (annual trivalent 
      inactivated influenza vaccine) in adults 50 years of age and older who 
      have been previously immunized with PPSV.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As adults grow older they become more susceptible to infectious 
      diseases, such as pneumococcal pneumonia, due to their aging immune 
      systems,&#8221; said Thomas M. File, Jr., M.D., M.S., president-elect, 
      National Foundation for Infectious Diseases. &#8220;As a conjugate vaccine, 
      Prevnar 13 offers an important new option for adults 50 years and older 
      to include as part of their preventive strategy for healthy aging.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the United States, Pfizer has been granted approval for 
      use of Prevnar 13 for various indications in adults 50 years of age and 
      older in the European Union, Australia, Mexico and more than 10 other 
      countries. Prevnar 13 was first approved by the U.S. FDA in February 
      2010 for the prevention of invasive pneumococcal disease in infants and 
      young children from 6 weeks through 5 years of age.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Prevnar 13 and Conjugate Technology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevnar 13 uses Company-pioneered conjugate technology that links 
      pneumococcal polysaccharide sugar chains found on the surface of each 
      bacterial serotype with a carrier protein. Prevnar 13 uses the carrier 
      protein CRM197, which has more than 20 years of clinical and 
      commercial use in vaccines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pneumococcal Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease is a group of infections caused by the bacterium Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae, also known as pneumococcus. The most common 
      manifestation of PD in adults 50 years of age and older is 
      non-bacteremic pneumococcal pneumonia, a non-invasive form of the 
      disease. PD also causes invasive infections, such as bacteremia and 
      meningitis, in adults.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Indication for Prevnar 13 for Adults 50 Years of Age and Older
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        In adults 50 years of age and older, Prevnar 13 is indicated for 
        active immunization for the prevention of pneumonia and invasive 
        disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae serotypes 1, 3, 4, 
        5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F
      
			
        This indication is based on immune responses elicited by Prevnar 13. 
        There have been no controlled trials in adults demonstrating a 
        decrease in invasive pneumococcal disease or pneumococcal pneumonia 
        after vaccination with Prevnar 13
      
			
        Prevnar 13 will not protect against disease caused by Streptococcus 
        pneumoniae serotypes that are not in the vaccine
      
			
        The effectiveness of Prevnar 13 administered less than five years 
        after pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is not known

			Indication for Prevnar 13 for Children 6 Weeks through 5 Years of Age
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        In children 6 weeks through 5 years of age (prior to the 6th 
        birthday), Prevnar 13 is indicated for active immunization for the 
        prevention of invasive disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae 
        serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F

			Important Safety Information for Prevnar 13
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Severe allergic reaction (e.g., anaphylaxis) to any component of 
        Prevnar 13, Prevnar&#174; (Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate 
        Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]), or any diphtheria 
        toxoid&#8211;containing vaccine is a contraindication to the use of Prevnar 
        13
      
			
        Prevnar 13 does not provide 100% protection against vaccine serotypes 
        or protect against nonvaccine serotypes
      
			
        Immunocompromised children and adults or those with impaired immune 
        responsiveness due to the use of immunosuppressive therapy may have a 
        reduced antibody response to active immunization
      
			
        Apnea following intramuscular vaccination has been observed in some 
        infants born prematurely. Decisions about when to administer an 
        intramuscular vaccine, including Prevnar 13, to infants born 
        prematurely should be based on consideration of the individual 
        infant's medical status and the potential benefits and possible risks 
        of vaccination
      
			
        In pediatric clinical trials, the most commonly reported serious 
        adverse events were bronchiolitis (0.9%, 1.1%), gastroenteritis (0.9%, 
        0.9%), and pneumonia (0.9%, 0.5%) for Prevnar 13 and Prevnar, 
        respectively
      
			
        In infants and toddlers vaccinated at 2, 4, 6, and 12-15 months of age

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators approved the expansion of Pfizer Inc's blockbuster Prevnar vaccine for use in adults 50 and older to fight pneumonia, meningitis and other diseases cause by pneumococcus bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Prevnar 13 is designed to fight 13 forms of a bacterium called streptococcus pneumoniae, or pneumococcus. Pneumonia caused by the pneumococcal organism is one of the biggest causes of death in older people and its incidence begins to increase after age 50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine, which had been approved for children in the United States, is already one of Pfizer's biggest brands and an expanded population of adults could generate more than $1.5 billion in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration said about 300,000 adults in the United States in that older age group are hospitalized each year because of pneumococcal pneumonia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pneumococcal disease is a substantial cause of illness and death," said Dr. Karen Midthun, director of FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. "Today's approval provides an additional vaccine for preventing pneumococcal pneumonia and invasive disease in this age group."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's vaccine was considered under the FDA's accelerated approval process, meaning the agency believed the medicine represents an unmet medical need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In November, the vaccine secured the support of FDA advisers, who found it safe and as effective as Merck &amp; Co's Pneumovax, which is currently the only vaccine for pneumococcal bacteria approved in the United States for adults 50 years of age or older.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA has said the older vaccine from Merck, known as a free polysaccharide vaccine, was effective against invasive pneumonia, but was not shown to have an effect on pneumococcal pneumonia, which is more common in adults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prevnar 13 belongs to a new generation of pneumococcal vaccines known as conjugates, which can trigger a stronger and longer-lasting immune response.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine can prevent against pneumonia, when the pneumococcus bacteria infects the lungs, and is also effective against the bacteria's spread to other parts of the body such as the blood or spinal fluid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Side effects were similar to those for Merck's Pneumovax, including swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, and muscle and joint pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vaccine is already approved for adults aged 50 and older in the European Union, Australia, Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Thailand and the Philippines, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In total, the Prevnar franchise - known as Prevenar in Europe and other countries - had about $3.7 billion in global sales last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the conditions for accelerated approval, Pfizer must conduct a study to confirm Prevnar 13 can actually prevent pneumococcal pneumonia in adults, not just cause the body to produce antibodies - which is typically used as a surrogate in clinical trials, the FDA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results of the confirmatory trial, which enrolled more than 80,000 subjects in the Netherlands, are expected in 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf in New York and Anna Yukhananov in Washington, additional reporting by Alina Selyukh in Washington; Editing by Gerald E.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Super Senior Classes of JPMCC 2007-LDP12
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the super senior classes and downgraded 10 
      classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Mortgage Securities Trust, Series 
      2007-LDP12 commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed 
      list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades reflect greater certainty of expected losses on specially 
      serviced loans following updated valuations obtained by the servicer. 
      Fitch modeled losses of 14.8% of the remaining pool. Fitch has 
      designated 35 loans (32.4%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes 18 
      specially serviced loans (15.3%). Fitch expects classes L thru NR may be 
      fully depleted from losses associated with the specially serviced assets 
      and that class K will also be affected.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the December 2011 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has decreased by approximately 2.2% to $2.4 billion 
      from $2.5 billion at issuance. Interest shortfalls totaling $7.3 million 
      are affecting classes K through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Two of the largest contributors to loss are two office properties in 
      Atlanta, GA, that are also amongst the top 15 loans in the transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to loss (2.7%) is secured by a 438,709 square 
      foot (sf), office building located in Atlanta, GA. The largest tenants 
      are CitiCorp, Inc. (14%), Club Management Enterprises (8%), and Nsoro 
      Mastec, LLC (5.6%), with lease expirations of 2013, 2011, and 2017, 
      respectively. All remaining tenants in the building occupy less than 10% 
      of net rentable area (NRA). The property continues to exhibit declining 
      performance since issuance as a result of tenant vacancies and 
      challenging market conditions. As of June 30, 2011, the most recent debt 
      service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 0.63 times (x). The loan remains 
      current and the most recent servicer reported occupancy is 71.1% as of 
      June 2011, with average asking rent of $20 per square foot (psf). Per 
      REIS, as of third quarter 2011 (3Q'11), the Atlanta market had a vacancy 
      rate of 20.8% with average asking rent of $21.27 psf.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to loss (2.6%) is secured by a 415,324 
      sf, class A, multi-tenant, 18-story office building also located in 
      Atlanta, GA. Largest tenants are Wells Fargo Bank (8%), Willis Insurance 
      (4.6%), and Knowledge Development Centers (4.4%). The remaining tenants 
      occupy 5% NRA or less. The most recent servicer-reported June 30, 2011 
      DSCR was 0.57x, a decrease from 0.66x at year-end (YE) 2010 due to 
      free-rent incentives. The property was 80% occupied as of August 2011, 
      with average asking rent of $21.62 psf. Per REIS, as of 3Q'11, the 
      Atlanta market had a vacancy rate of 20.8% with average asking rent of 
      $21.27 psf. The property has yet to reach stabilization expectations as 
      net operating income (NOI) has declined since issuance. The loan remains 
      current with the sponsor, Berwind Properties Group, covering operating 
      shortfalls.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to loss (1.3%) is secured by a 189,610 sf 
      anchored retail center located in Edison, NJ. The loan transferred to 
      special servicing in January 2011 due to imminent monetary default as a 
      result of the anchor tenant vacating. The special servicer has rejected 
      a recent modification proposal from the borrower and filed a foreclosure 
      complaint. In September 2011, the borrower submitted a lease proposal 
      for 22,500 sf of the vacant 74,000 sf, but the special servicer has not 
      received sufficient information in order to approve it. The property is 
      currently approximately 60% occupied.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades and assigns Recovery Estimates (RE) as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$197.2 million class A-J to 'B-', RE 65% from 'B'; Outlook Negative;

      --$28.2 million class K to 'C', from 'CC', RE 0% from 95%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch also affirms the following classes and revises Outlooks as 
      indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$441.3 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$250.5 million class A-M at 'A'; Outlook to Stable from Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      --$9.4 million class L at 'C', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$9.4 million class M at 'C', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      --$6.3 million class N at 'C', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.3 million class P at 'C', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.3 million class Q at 'C', RE 0%;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$3.1 million class T at 'C', RE 0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch does not rate the $14.4 million class NR. Class A-1 has been paid 
      in full.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch previously withdrew the rating on the interest-only class X. (For 
      additional information on the withdrawal of the rating on class X, see 
      'Fitch Revises Practice for Rating IO  Pre-Payment Related Structured

    &lt;/p&gt;

      The long-term rating assigned to the bond continues to be 'A' with a

      by the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (rated 'A/F1', Stable Outlook).

      The ratings above were solicited by, or on behalf of, the issuer, and

&lt;p&gt;Dec 30 (Reuters) - German lender HSH Nordbank has sued
several banks, including Ally Financial and JPMorgan Chase
, over losses on $130.2 million in mortgage bond
investments, according to court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;HSH Nordbank said the defendants had misrepresented
underwriting standards and the quality of the underlying loans.
The bank said investments made in those mortgage securities sold
by the defendants have lost value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The offering materials also contained material
misrepresentations about the securities' credit ratings, which
understated the securities' risk profile," the bank said in the
court filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other defendants in the case includes Barclays Capital
 and Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The German bank had earlier sued JPMorgan and Barclays over
similar claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HSH Nordbank, like other landesbanks, lost billions of euros
on risky investments in the financial crisis, forcing its state
owners Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein to prop it up with 10
billion euros ($14.3 billion) in loan guarantees and a capital
injection of 3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ally Financial was formerly known as GMAC Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is HSH Nordbank vs Ally Financial, JPMorgan et al,
Case No. 653651/2011, New York State Supreme Court.&lt;/p&gt;
