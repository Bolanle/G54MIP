      Credit default swap (CDS) spreads on Pfizer are suggesting increased

		&lt;p&gt;
      Spreads on Pfizer (releasing first quarter results tomorrow) have 
      widened 13%, substantially underperforming the broader North America 
      health care sector. CDS liquidity increased slightly, moving to the 31st 
      regional percentile from the 33rd . 'Profit losses from its Lipitor 
      patent expiration and talks of a possible company breakup are 
      contributing to the increased uncertainty surrounding Pfizer,' said 
      Author and Director Diana Allmendinger.

      Elsewhere, CDS on Tesoro Corporation (reporting Wednesday) have rallied 
      9.4%. Credit protection on Tesoro is currently pricing one notch above 
      recent historical trading levels. CDS liquidity for Tesoro fell to the 
      16th regional percentile from trading in the fifth three months ago. 
      'Recent CDS spread and liquidity performance points to a stronger 
      footing for Tesoro,' said Allmendinger.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			5 Out of 10 Contactless Monkey Award Winners Use ViVOtech Technology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ViVOtech, the near field communication (NFC) software and systems 
      company, today announced it has won the 2011 Contactless Monkey Award in 
      the category of On High Street, for its NFC project with the National 
      Bank of Kuwait and Kuwait's Mobile Telecommunications Co., known as 
      Zain, using VISA EMV compliant payment cards, coupons and promotions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ViVOtech&#8217;s award winning project for the National Bank of Kuwait 
      introduced a unique prepaid card distribution application that allows 
      consumers to tap their NFC enabled phone on an NFC enabled smart poster 
      in a mall to download a prepaid VISA card in just a minute or two, said 
      Mohammed Khan, ViVOtech founder and president. This patent pending NFC 
      application utilizing ViVOtech software enables issuers to widely 
      distribute prepaid, gift, and loyalty cards to consumers&#8217; NFC mobile 
      phones from any public place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, using ViVOtech technology Zapa Technology won the High 
      Throughput Beverage Award for its project with Insomnia Coffee in 
      Ireland, U.K.-based EAT won the High Throughput Food and the VISA 
      Pay/Wave Awards; and Business Leader of the Year was given to Will 
      Judge, head of future ticketing at Transport for London.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The payments, loyalty, marketing and merchandising industry has just 
      begun a total transformation as mobile NFC technology moves from test 
      projects to full scale commercial rollout this year and next,&#8221; said 
      Khan. &#8220;The application we introduced in Kuwait was just the latest in a 
      history of NFC firsts at ViVOtech.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Contactless&#160;Monkey Awards are presented to companies, organizations 
      and retailers that have done the most to embrace and implement 
      contactless technology into their day-to-day operating practices. The 
      competition was open to all implemented contactless applications within 
      the relevant sectors, regardless of geographic region or size of 
      corporation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The On High Street award is given to the company or retailer that has 
      done the most to incorporate contactless into their service and payment 
      structure and had the most success from doing so. Other finalists for 
      the On High Street award included Clinton Cards in the U.K.; an NFC 
      trial in Sitges, Spain by La Caixa and Telefonica O2; and an NFC loyalty 
      solution for Allied Irish Bank by Zapa Technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fourth edition of the Contactless Monkey Award, organized annually 
      by Contactless Intelligence, saw a record number of entries, underlining 
      the growing significance of NFC payment, loyalty, marketing and 
      merchandizing applications.

&lt;p&gt; * Solomons going to Morgan Stanley, Ahuja to Wells Fargo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Nadia Damouni&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 2 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
lost two West Coast technology investment bankers to competing
firms last week, according to a source familiar with the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Solomons, a managing director who was responsible for
technology mergers and acquisitions at JPMorgan, will be
joining Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) technology group in Menlo Park,
California, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Akhil Ahuja, who is based in San Francisco and who was
covering storage software companies for JPMorgan, will be
joining Wells Fargo Corp's (WFC.N) technology investment
banking group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ahuja will report into Gerry Walters, head of West Coast
Technology at Wells Fargo, and Jon Weiss, who co-leads the
investment banking and capital markets team at Wells Fargo.
Both Walters and Weiss were formerly at JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As recruiting season heats up, a number of technology
bankers have been jumping ship to join competing firms or
boutique banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo has looked to ramp up its technology offering
over the last few years due to increased sector consolidation,
the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley is currently No. 1 in the league tables for
technology MA deals, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley declined to comment. JPMorgan and Wells
Fargo officials were not available for comment.

&lt;p&gt;  SUGAR LAND, TX, May 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Researched by Industrial Info Resources (Sugar Land, Texas) -- Higher
prices for crude oil and refined products boosted Chevron Corporation's
(NYSE:CVX) (San Ramon, California) first-quarter 2011 results, although
most production saw slight declines. Net income for the quarter was
reported to be $6.21 billion, a 36.45% increase from first-quarter 2010.

    Industrial Info is tracking 125 projects worldwide that are worth a total
of more than $79 billion, including the $15 billion Phase I construction
of the Wheatstone LNG Production Plant in Onslow, Western Australia. As a
part of the $30 billion Wheatstone LNG project, the project involves the
construction of two liquefied natural gas (LNG) trains, which each will
transport 4.5 million metric tons per year, and a production plant with
an initial capacity of 8.9 million metric tons per year of LNG, sourcing
the natural gas from the Wheatstone &amp; Iago offshore production fields.

			Moviegoers of Disneynature&#8217;s True Life 
      Adventure &#8220;African Cats&#8221; Help Save the Savanna
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Disneynature Collaborates with the African Wildlife Foundation to 
      Help Protect 50,000 Acres in Kenya&#8217;s Amboseli Wildlife Corridor
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disneynature announced today that its &#8220;See &#8216;African Cats,&#8217; Save the 
      Savanna&#8221; campaign will help protect more than 50,000 acres of land in 
      Kenya&#8217;s Amboseli Wildlife Corridor on behalf of the moviegoers who came 
      out to see Disneynature&#8217;s motion picture &#8220;African Cats&#8221; during its 
      opening week (April 22-28, 2011). A portion of the proceeds from the 
      opening-week ticket sales will be donated to the African Wildlife 
      Foundation (AWF) through the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund to 
      ensure the future of lions, cheetahs, elephants, zebras, giraffes and a 
      host of other animals in the vibrant African savanna.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The area to be protected equates to 100 Disney&#8217;s Animal Kingdom Theme 
      Parks or more than twice the size of Manhattan. The AWF will be working 
      to establish the Amboseli Wildlife Corridor, a passage between the 
      Amboseli, Tsavo West and Chyulu Hills National Parks that is frequently 
      used by a variety of wildlife.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re so proud that audiences nationwide have embraced the film and the 
      &#8216;See &#8220;African Cats,&#8221; Save the Savanna&#8217; initiative,&#8221; said Alan Bergman, 
      president of The Walt Disney Studios. &#8220;The conservation efforts 
      Disneynature has supported so far span the globe&#8212;from planting trees in 
      Brazil, to preserving coral reef in The Bahamas and now protecting this 
      essential passage in Kenya&#8212;they&#8217;ve become an extraordinary part of our 
      films and audiences have played a key role in helping our planet.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The &#8216;See &#8220;African Cats,&#8221; Save the Savanna&#8217; program transformed the 
      moviegoing experience into tangible on-the-ground conservation action,&#8221; 
      said Dr. Patrick Bergin, CEO, African Wildlife Foundation. &#8220;The 
      commitment of Disneynature combined with the passion of moviegoers will 
      raise critical funds to conserve the land that the magnificent species 
      featured in &#8220;African Cats&#8221; call home. Through this amazing 
      collaboration, we celebrate our 50th Anniversary together with 
      Disneynature and all the people who are helping establish the Amboseli 
      Wildlife Corridor.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While the opening-week ticket sales will help protect more than 50,000 
      acres of the Amboseli Wildlife Corridor, the conservation efforts tied 
      to &#8220;African Cats&#8221; do not end there. Additional collaborations are 
      committed to adding at least another 15,000 acres to the program&#8211;from 
      the sale of artwork and jewelry inspired by the film, to the sale of 
      Jordin Sparks&#8217; &#8220;The World I Knew&#8221; single, to the Cast Member Earth Month 
      pledges across the Walt Disney Company, plus more. These programs, many 
      of them ongoing, support the &#8220;Save the Savanna&#8221; initiative, which will 
      have a positive long term and sustainable impact on the animals and 
      people of Africa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;See &#8216;African Cats,&#8217; Save the Savanna&#8221; continues Disneynature&#8217;s 
      conservation efforts, which began with its first release, &#8220;Earth&#8221; 
      (2009), for which three million trees were planted in Brazil&#8217;s Atlantic 
      Forest. The program in support of &#8220;Oceans&#8221; (2010) helped establish 
      40,000 acres of marine protected areas in The Bahamas, which contain 
      miles of vital coral reef.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;African Cats&#8221; is in theaters now.

      Disneynature, the first new Disney-branded film label from The Walt 
      Disney Studios in more than 60 years, was launched in April 2008 to 
      bring the world&#8217;s top nature filmmakers together to share a wide variety 
      of wildlife subjects and stories with theatrical audiences. &#8220;Earth&#8221; 
      (opening Earth Day 2009) was the first film to premiere domestically 
      under the new label, and garnered a record-breaking opening weekend for 
      a nature documentary. Its &#8220;Buy a Ticket, Plant a Tree&#8221; initiative led to 
      the planting of three million trees in Brazil&#8217;s Atlantic Forest. Hitting 
      theaters on April 22, 2010, &#8220;Oceans&#8221; was the third highest grossing 
      feature-length nature film in history. Its &#8220;See &#8216;Oceans,&#8217; Save Oceans&#8221; 
      initiative helped establish 40,000 acres of marine protected area in The 
      Bahamas, preserving essential coral reefs. Walt Disney was a pioneer in 
      wildlife documentary filmmaking, producing 13 True-Life Adventure motion 
      pictures between 1949 and 1960, which earned eight Academy Awards&#174;. For

 (Adds details)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MELBOURNE May 4 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Amatil ,
Australian top soft drinks bottler, said it expects profit to
rise 5 percent in the first half, after extreme weather, higher
input costs and the strong Aussie dollar dampened growth at the
start of the year.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The forecast, before one-off items, suggests a slowdown from
full-year profit growth in 2010 of 10.8 percent.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The profit increase in the first half before currency
impacts would be a rise of 6-7 percent, Managing Director Terry
Davis told a shareholders meeting on Wednesday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Floods and cyclones in Queensland state and the earthquake
in New Zealand cut volume growth and boosted operating costs, he
said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola Amatil shares fell 1.8 percent to A$11.65 in early

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Software maker Novell Inc can proceed with a long-running antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft Corp after an appeals court reversed a lower court's summary judgment in favor of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Novell, which was bought by Attachmate Corp earlier this year, claimed that its operating system products and several of its software applications were unfairly squeezed out of the market by Microsoft in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1996 Novell made a deal assigning rights to sue Microsoft to a separate company called Caldera, which sued Microsoft over competition in the operating system market, receiving a $280 million settlement four years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2004, Novell sued Microsoft in its own right, claiming its WordPerfect word processing application was the victim of unfair competition by Microsoft, chiefly through its arrangements with computer makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Microsoft won a summary judgment against Novell on the grounds that Novell's claims were subject to the 1996 agreement with Caldera, which relinquished the right to sue Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court reversed that judgment in a ruling on Tuesday, in a 2-1 majority decision, saying that the previous agreement with Caldera covered a different set of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ruling means Novell can proceed with one remaining antitrust claim against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for Novell did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft played down Novell's claims and said it was considering its next move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are disappointed with the Fourth's Circuit's decision ... although we are pleased that at this point only one part of one of Novell's claims remains," said a Microsoft spokeswoman.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE May 3 (Reuters) - Software maker Novell Inc can
proceed with a long-running antitrust lawsuit against Microsoft
Corp (MSFT.O) after an appeals court reversed a lower court's
summary judgment in favor of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Novell, which was bought by Attachmate Corp earlier this
year, claimed that its operating system products and several of
its software applications were unfairly squeezed out of the
market by Microsoft in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1996 Novell made a deal assigning rights to sue
Microsoft to a separate company called Caldera, which sued
Microsoft over competition in the operating system market,
receiving a $280 million settlement four years later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2004, Novell sued Microsoft in its own right, claiming
its WordPerfect word processing application was the victim of
unfair competition by Microsoft, chiefly through its
arrangements with computer makers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, Microsoft won a summary judgment against Novell
on the grounds that Novell's claims were subject to the 1996
agreement with Caldera, which relinquished the right to sue
Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The appeals court reversed that judgment in a ruling on
Tuesday, in a 2-1 majority decision, saying that the previous
agreement with Caldera covered a different set of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ruling means Novell can proceed with one remaining
antitrust claim against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A representative for Novell did not immediately respond to
a request for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft played down Novell's claims and said it was
considering its next move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are disappointed with the Fourth's Circuit's decision
... although we are pleased that at this point only one part of
one of Novell's claims remains," said a Microsoft spokeswoman.
"We still are convinced that this lingering claim does not have
any merit, and we are considering our next steps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Novell Inc v Microsoft Corp, number 10-1482 in
the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Richard Chang)

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. authorities are facing a huge backlog of records involving people who have stayed in the United States after their visas expired, according to a report released on Tuesday, revealing that a security gap has not been fixed since the September 11, 2001 attacks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Department of Homeland Security's US-VISIT system had a backlog of some 1.6 million records of potential visa overstays as of January 2011, said the report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office, Congress' investigative arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five of the 19 men who hijacked the planes in the September 11 attacks had overstayed their visas and the report found that some 36 of the 400 people who have been convicted on terrorism-related charges since 2001 had also stayed after their visas expired.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is simply unacceptable that we are still unable to systematically identify people who overstay -- some of whom may be terrorists waiting to attack innocent Americans," Joe Lieberman, an Independent who is chairman of the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the records may include duplicates because of computer system changes, may not have been reviewed yet, or include cases that are not necessarily considered to be a priority, the GAO report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Officials in charge of the US-VISIT program told the GAO that it had spent $3.7 million of the $5 million available to help deal with the backlog but that it needed more money, a tough task as the government is facing deep spending cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a matter of policy, records involving visa overstays of 90 days or less or those who are not deemed to pose a national security or public safety risk do not trigger an immediate lookout warning, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials prefer to focus on finding the more egregious violators who have stayed long beyond their visa expiration, the GAO said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report was released a day before Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano is due to testify on border security before Lieberman's committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Napolitano said the agency gives priority to removing illegal immigrants who are a national security risk, are convicted criminals or pose other threats to public safety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We pursue overstay cases based on these priorities -- including by fully investigating 100 percent of overstay cases that have a nexus to national security and serious criminal acts," DHS spokesman Matthew Chandler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are also other ways for U.S. officials to identify those who have entered the United States legally but have stayed longer than they were initially allowed and to remove them, according to the department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Vicki Allen)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Satellite TV provider Dish Network Corp has been sued by Walt Disney and Starz Entertainment for giving away popular movies, including "Disney's "Toy Story 3" and "Alice in Wonderland."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney filed a copyright suit against Dish, while Starz is suing Dish -- the second largest U.S. satellite TV provider with more than 14 million subscribers -- for breach of contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney distributes many of its top movies to cable and satellite providers under an agreement with Starz Entertainment's premium cable network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The giant media company and theme park operator says it only gave Starz permission to air the movies with the understanding Starz would be on a premium tier with distributors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney claims in the suit that, in February, Dish began providing millions of subscribers free access to Starz through to January 2012 in violation of its agreements with both Disney and Starz.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc posted disappointing revenue for Lipitor and other medicines, exposing the risks the world's biggest drugmaker faces if it sells better-performing units like its nutritional products business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is widely expected to divest one or more of its four non-core units, allowing it to focus on growth from promising new medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that may take time. New Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview that Pfizer will provide rough outlines by year's end on what it might sell  or spin off, and could take until early 2012 to develop full-fledged plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There will be no "Big Bang" this year, he said, noting that other units that could be gradually divested include Pfizer's consumer health business and animal health unit. He said the best use of proceeds would likely be to buy back company shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to focus on the fact that we're an innovative pharmaceutical company and that is 85 percent of our revenue base today. And we need to get that right," Read told Reuters. "I don't think diversification for diversification's sake gives you a premium" in your stock price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many investors fear Pfizer will be far too big to deliver strong profit growth once Lipitor and other top drugs lose their exclusive marketing status in the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer is most likely to sell its nutritionals business and could get as much as $7 billion for it, which could be used to buy back more company shares," said Morningstar analyst Damien Conover. He said a sale of the consumer products business was somewhat less likely, but could fetch $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it may not be simple to give up the non-core businesses, which have helped offset anemic drug sales, especially since Pfizer laboratories have not produced a new best-seller since introducing Viagra more than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is pinning its hopes on new medicines for rheumatoid arthritis, lung cancer and stroke now in advanced clinical trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares closed down 2.8 percent at $20.44 after gaining more than 10 percent since early February, when Read announced plans to streamline Pfizer. The company turned over the reins to him in December after the abrupt departure of Jeffrey Kindler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A GAMBLE ON DRUGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol fighter Lipitor, Pfizer's biggest product, led drug sales lower in the first quarter. Its revenue tumbled 13 percent to $2.39 billion due to generic competition in overseas markets, foreshadowing the drug's even worse plight once it loses U.S. patent protection in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all, the company earned $2.22 billion, or 28 cents per share, in the first quarter. That compared with $2.03 billion, or 25 cents per share, a year earlier, when Pfizer took charges for its late 2009 purchase of U.S. rival Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings were 60 cents per share, excluding special items and the Capsugel business that is being sold. Analysts on average expected 59 cents, according to Thomson Reuters    I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results benefited from a weaker dollar that boosted the value of sales abroad, new products obtained by the purchase of King Pharmaceuticals and a sharply lower tax rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large U.S. rivals also topped first-quarter forecasts, helped by a weaker dollar and cost cuts, with Merck  Co Inc and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co posting the biggest profit beats.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer revenue of $16.5 billion was a bit lower than a year earlier and trailed Wall Street expectations of $16.63 billion. Prescription drug sales fell 2 percent to $14.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of animal-health products -- mainly for livestock and pets -- jumped 16 percent to $982 million. Sales of consumer products, including Centrum vitamins and painkiller Advil, rose 12 percent to $745 million. Nutritional product sales rose 3 percent to $470 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which has bought three of the largest U.S. drugmakers over the past decade, has already slimmed down its operations considerably. Three months ago, Read vowed to slash the company's research budget by up to $2 billion, to between $6.5 billion and $7 billion, eliminating thousands of jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move pleased investors by allowing Pfizer to stick to its 2012 profit forecast, which calls for earnings similar to what it reported for 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In early April, Pfizer announced plans to sell Capsugel, the world's largest maker of hard capsules, to private equity firm KKR  Co for $2.38 billion.

Network Corp has been sued by Walt Disney Co and Liberty Media
Corp's Starz Entertainment for giving away popular movies,
including "Disney's "Toy Story 3" and "Alice in Wonderland."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney (DIS.N) filed a copyright suit against Dish (DISH.O)
while Starz is suing Dish for breach of contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney distributes many of its top movies to cable and
satellite providers under an agreement with Starz
Entertainment's LSTZA.OLINTA.O, premium cable network,  
which is similar to Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) HBO or CBS Corp's
(CBS.N) Showtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The giant media company and theme park operator says it
only gave Starz permission to air the movies with the
understanding Starz would be on a premium tier with
distributors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney claims in the suit that, in February, Dish began
providing millions of subscribers free access to Starz through

Disney and Sony Corp's (6758.T) Sony Pictures. Sony is

suit was filed at the District Court, Douglas County,
Colorado.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dish is the second largest U.S. satellite TV provider with
more than 14 million subscribers. On Monday, it settled a
six-year long patent legal battle with TiVo Inc (TIVO.O).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An appeals court on Tuesday denied a bid for bail by a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc programer sentenced to eight years in prison for stealing part of the bank's high-frequency trading code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Sergey Aleynikov, 41, said in oral arguments earlier in the day that his client should never have been charged and requested his release on bail pending appeal before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York. The lawyer, Kevin Marino, declined to comment on the panel's one-sentence ruling. The appeal brief is due on June 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, arrested by the FBI in July 2009 and convicted by a jury in December 2010 of trade secrets theft under the Economic Espionage Act and transporting stolen property across state lines, began his sentence on March 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the oral arguments, a prosecutor, Joseph Facciponti, said a trial judge's rulings showed previous motions by Aleynikov to dismiss the charges were meritless "and not even close calls."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The government also argued that Aleynikov, a U.S. citizen who was born in Russia, is a risk of flight and should not be released pending the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's case increased attention on speed-trading platforms that financial firms spend hundreds of millions of dollars to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marino told the panel the economic espionage statute specifically covers "goods, wares and merchandise" and that "every circuit has held that intellectual property such as computer source code is not goods, wares or merchandise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was accused and convicted of copying and removing trading code from Goldman, Wall Street's most influential bank, in 2009 before taking a new job at Teza Technologies LLC, a high-frequency trading start-up firm in Chicago. Teza and its employees were not accused of any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High-frequency, computer-driven trading has become an important and competitive business. The software codes that trade shares in milliseconds are closely guarded secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, who is a father of three and onetime collegiate-level competitive ballroom dancer, was convicted at a two-week long trial in Manhattan federal court before U.S. District Judge Denise Cote.

 (Updates with appeal brief due by June 3)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Grant McCool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 3 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Tuesday
denied a bid for bail by a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) programmer sentenced to eight years in prison for
stealing part of the bank's high-frequency trading code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lawyer for Sergey Aleynikov, 41, said in oral arguments
earlier in the day that his client should never have been
charged and requested his release on bail pending appeal before
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York. The
lawyer, Kevin Marino, declined to comment on the panel's
one-sentence ruling. The appeal brief is due on June 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov, arrested by the FBI in July 2009 and convicted
by a jury in December 2010 of trade secrets theft under the
Economic Espionage Act and transporting stolen property across
state lines, began his sentence on March 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the oral arguments, a prosecutor, Joseph Facciponti,
said a trial judge's rulings showed previous motions by
Aleynikov to dismiss the charges were meritless "and not even
close calls."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government also argued that Aleynikov, a U.S. citizen
who was born in Russia, is a risk of flight and should not be
released pending the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov's case increased attention on speed-trading
platforms that financial firms spend hundreds of millions of
dollars to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marino told the panel the economic espionage statute
specifically covers "goods, wares and merchandise" and that
"every circuit has held that intellectual property such as
computer source code is not goods, wares or merchandise."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov was accused and convicted of copying and removing
trading code from Goldman, Wall Street's most influential bank,
in 2009 before taking a new job at Teza Technologies LLC, a
high-frequency trading start-up firm in Chicago. Teza and its
employees were not accused of any wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High-frequency, computer-driven trading has become an
important and competitive business. The software codes that
trade shares in milliseconds are closely guarded secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov, who is a father of three and onetime
collegiate-level competitive ballroom dancer, was convicted at
a two-week long trial in Manhattan federal court before U.S.
District Judge Denise Cote. She also imposed the sentence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cases are USA v Aleynikov, U.S. Court of Appeals for
the 2nd Circuit in New York, No. 11-744 and No. 11-1126.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co filed a copyright suit against satellite television operator Dish Network Corp for distributing popular movies including Disney's "Toy Story 3" and "Alice in Wonderland" on a free tier for Dish subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney distributes many of its top movies on cable and satellite providers through an agreement with Liberty Media Corp's Starz channel, a premium network similar to Time Warner Inc's HBO or CBS Corp's Showtime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The giant media company and theme park operator says it only granted Starz permission to air the movies with the understanding that Starz would be on a premium tier with distributors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney claims in the suit that in February Dish began providing millions of subscribers free access to Starz through to January 2012 in violation of its agreements with both Disney and Starz.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 3 (Reuters) - Global manufacturing activity grew
at its slowest pace in five months in April but firms continued
to take on new workers despite rising input costs, a survey
showed on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Global Manufacturing PMI, compiled by JP Morgan with
research and supply organisations, fell in April to 55.0 from
55.7 in March, but marked its 22nd month above the 50 mark that
separates growth from contraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The April PMI data signal that global manufacturing has
moved onto a lower growth plane, with rates of expansion in
output and new orders cooling further from the sky-high levels
seen around the turn of the year," JP Morgan's David Hensley
said.
The jobs index remained at a historically high level and
close to February's survey peak, but worryingly for
policymakers, input costs rose sharply again on high oil and
commodity prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pace of business growth at U.S. factories slowed in
April for a second straight month but in the euro zone,
manufacturers kept their foot firmly on the accelerator, data
released on Monday showed. [ID:nEAPA20DL0] [EUR/PMIM]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China also saw growth soften last month while in Britain the
manufacturing PMI hit a 7-month low. [ID:nL3E7G100E] [GB/PMIM]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The global indicator, produced by JP Morgan with research
and supply management organisations, combines survey data from
around 20 countries including the United States, Japan, Germany,
France, Britain, China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jonathan Cable; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)

			Executive Mel Martinez Takes on Added Role as Chairman of JPMorgan 
      Chase Foundation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mel Martinez, JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s senior executive in Florida and the 
      region,&#160;has taken on additional duties as Chairman of the company&#8217;s 
      foundation, which donates more than $150 million around the world each 
      year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Martinez, who served in the U.S. Senate and as Secretary of Housing and 
      Urban Development, joined JPMorgan Chase last year and will continue to 
      represent the firm at the most senior level as chairman of Florida, 
      Mexico, Central America and the Caribbean.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Mel has been a terrific leader both inside the company and with our 
      clients and our communities,&#8221; said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer of JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;He knows the important role our 
      firm plays locally, nationally and internationally, and his experience, 
      integrity, judgment and compassion will serve us all well.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Martinez will oversee the firm&#8217;s philanthropic organization, which gave 
      more than $150 million through grants and sponsorships to thousands of 
      not-for-profit organizations across 28 states and more than 25 countries 
      last year. He succeeds Bill Daley, who left the firm to become President 
      Obama&#8217;s Chief of Staff.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Martinez emigrated from Cuba in the early years of the Castro regime as 
      a teenager through Operation Peter Pan, a humanitarian program that 
      relocated 14,000 Cuban children. After living with his younger brother 
      in refugee camps and foster homes, Martinez worked his way through 
      school, earning undergraduate and law degrees from Florida State 
      University.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;My American Dream came true, thanks to the generosity of Americans who 
      wanted to help young people like my brother and me,&#8221; said Martinez. &#8220;I 
      feel personally that we all have a tremendous responsibility to help 
      others and I am pleased to work with my Foundation colleagues who have 
      done an outstanding job of representing the best that corporate 
      philanthropy can be.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      He worked as an attorney in Orlando for 25 years while serving in 
      leadership roles on a Who's Who of youth, civic and business 
      organizations. He was first elected to public office in 1998 as Mayor of 
      Orange County, representing the greater Orlando area.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At President Bush's request, he became HUD Secretary in 2001 and was 
      elected as the first Cuban-American to the U.S. Senate in 2004.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase has more than 15,000 employees working in Florida and 
      serves consumers and businesses through more than 280 Chase bank 
      branches and 1,200 ATMs across the state. The firm announced last week

feature is used. Hard to locate and notoriously unstable, PST maintenance
and recovery incurs high costs that are rarely covered by company
compliance policies or included in security and backup processes.

    The following PST elimination tips from C2C, a leading provider of email,
file and messaging management solutions, are intended to help IT managers
take steps to eliminate PST files.

    Discovering PSTs
 After seeking out PSTs on local and remote servers,
desktops and laptops with one of the C2C management tools available, the
size and scope of the problem can be identified. How many PST files
exist? Where are they? Who owns them? What content do they contain? How
large are they? These factors will help determine the appropriate next
step. There are two possible courses of action to take in advance of
removing PSTs: move them back into the Exchange server, or archive them.
Migrating PST data into Exchange is the simplest option but will result
in a considerable increase in storage usage. If the key driver for
creating PST files in the first place is to avoid IT-imposed quotas, this
is clearly not the best approach.

    Archiving PSTs
 A typical PST archiving solution first collects PSTs into
a known location and then ingests them into an archive. This process can
be time and resource consuming if there are a great deal of files to
move, so larger organizations will require more comprehensive and
advanced email archiving solutions. In this case, PSTs can be migrated
directly to an archive, which ensures minimal effort, no manual moving of
files and no risk of human error. Select the PST files for priority
action, schedule remaining data for migration, and move stubs back to
Exchange once the migration is complete. When data is removed, PST files
can be compacted to free up the white-space, as the PST will only contain
messages with stub files. The risks of potential corruption are reduced
and company information is incorporated into a secure store.

    Eliminating PSTs
 To remove the dependence on PST files entirely, import
the remaining data (the messages with stub files) back into the user's
mailbox. This process can also be automated and centrally managed. The
original folder hierarchy as found within the original PST will be
retained for the user's benefit. Once completed, the empty PST file can
be automatically removed from the user's Outlook profile. The final step
in getting PSTs under control is to set policies for retention and ensure
they are enforced. 

    "There are many valid reasons to eliminate PSTs, from capacity management
to complying with company or regulatory policy, but the process is not
without its pitfalls," said Dave Hunt, CEO of C2C. "When used to
eliminate PSTs, C2C ArchiveOne(R) PST management solutions reduce
corporate risk and improve efficiency in terms of both time and storage
demand."

    ArchiveOne PST Manager gives administrators the control they need over
PST files, whether they are on a laptop, desktop, remote computer or
server, loaded in Outlook or not. A free copy of C2C's PST Manager can be
downloaded at http://www.c2c.com/Products/PSTManager.aspx.

&lt;p&gt;  WOBURN, MA, May 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Axceler, the leader in Microsoft SharePoint administration and migration
software, today introduced FileLoader for SharePoint 2010, a new
SharePoint product that enables IT managers to quickly and easily move
files originally stored in Windows file shares into SharePoint 2010.
Using FileLoader for SharePoint 2010 brings many of the benefits of
SharePoint to Windows file shares, including: one standard platform for
sharing files, improved version control, workflow capabilities, document
retention abilities, improved search results, tighter security, and
better access control. When used with the leading SharePoint
administration product, ControlPoint, to analyze and manage SharePoint
usage and security, FileLoader for SharePoint 2010 can help bring rogue
data files into a broader SharePoint governance initiative. FileLoader
for SharePoint 2010 will be demonstrated for the first time at an
upcoming webinar, Thursday, May 5, 2011 at 2 PM and is available
immediately from Axceler.com. 

    "Many enterprises are seeking the benefits of SharePoint 2010 but have
large amounts of content stored in Windows file shares without any sense
of organization or structure," said Michael Alden, President and CEO,
Axceler. "One of the most common reasons companies delay a migration to
SharePoint 2010 is because of the need to move key content from file
shares that may have been around a long time. Enterprises also ask for
the ability to analyze and structure this content to work with the new
Managed Metadata Service capabilities of SharePoint 2010, and we are
excited to expedite the migration to SharePoint 2010 with this product." 

    FileLoader for SharePoint 2010 finally gives organizations control over
their vast number of shared documents and files. Unique to FileLoader is
its ability to create Microsoft Excel 'control files' that represent the
file shares, allowing administrators and users to work together to clean
up their file shares and apply metadata. The benefit is that managers can
reorganize folder structures and distribute responsibility of content to
stakeholders who know the content best.

    Axceler FileLoader for SharePoint 2010 has the flexibility to support all
three common approaches to moving file share data to SP 2010. They
include: 1) moving file shares to SharePoint as-is and maintaining the
file structure; 2) reorganizing the content manually and pushing it to a
new SharePoint layout; or 3) migrating iteratively, which allows the
clean up, sorting, and transformation of the data to be performed on a
user-defined schedule. 

    Among the many benefits of FileLoader for SharePoint 2010 are:


--  Faster, fewer errors when migrating file shares to SharePoint 2010
--  Map to content types
--  Make your content more "findable" by maintaining or adding metadata
    "tags" during or after migration
--  Ability to schedule file share migrations
--  Maintain historic and source information, and folder structures, or
    completely transform data during migration
--  Put content migration decisions into the hands of data owners, online
    or offline, using MS Excel
--  Discover content to be migrated based on date ranges, file size, or
    file extension
--  Integrates with SharePoint 2010 Managed Metadata Service

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Open Virtualization Advances into the Enterprise with Red Hat And IBM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Joint customers, Cortal Consors, a division of BNP Paribas, and the 
      Brazilian Federal Highway Police already seeing success with open 
      virtualization
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Red Hat, Inc. (NYSE: RHT) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that they 
      are working together to make products and solutions based on KVM 
      (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) technology the open virtualization choice 
      for the enterprise. Together, the companies are driving adoption of the 
      open source virtualization technology through joint development projects 
      and enablement of the KVM ecosystem.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KVM open source virtualization technology allows a business to create 
      multiple virtual versions of Linux and Windows environments on the same 
      server. KVM-based products and solutions, incorporating comprehensive 
      management capabilities and scaling from local servers to large public 
      clouds, help businesses save money by consolidating and sharing IT 
      resources without the expense and limitations of a proprietary solution. 
      Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, designed to enable pervasive 
      datacenter virtualization, combines a centralized virtualization 
      management system with advanced features as well as a KVM-based 
      hypervisor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As more organizations turn to virtualization to consolidate IT resources 
      and reduce expenses, the open approach to virtualization is proving 
      beneficial. Large enterprise clients are already seeing the benefits of 
      solutions that combine IBM hardware and software with Red Hat Enterprise 
      Virtualization, using KVM technology. Two joint customers, the Brazilian 
      Federal Highway Police (DPRF) and Cortal Consors, a division of BNP 
      Paribas, have both experienced significant benefits by deploying Red Hat 
      Enterprise Virtualization on IBM System x servers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;After trying four different solutions available in the market, Red Hat 
      offered us just what we needed to build our virtualized system,&#8221; said 
      Lourival Filho at the Brazilian Federal Highway Police (DPRF). &#8220;In the 
      final results, it offered us energy saving, easier management of assets 
      and more availability for services. Compared to proprietary solutions, 
      we saved more than 80% in the overall cost. Additionally, the Red Hat 
      support team was very proactive, giving us support related to the 
      general system situation, including minor details not related directly 
      to Red Hat&#8217;s solution.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "After deploying Red Hat Enterprise Linux, we expanded our Red Hat 
      deployment even further with the adoption of Red Hat Enterprise 
      Virtualization on IBM X3850. Since deploying Red Hat Enterprise 
      Virtualization and IBM for our Banking Applications, we've achieved high 
      levels of scalability, performance and reliability. We believe that 
      Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) is a truly high-performance 
      virtualization technology, which fully exceeds our needs,&#8221; said Anja 
      Schaffer at Cortal Consors, a division of BNP Paribas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recent technology advances led by IBM and Red Hat have lowered the 
      barrier to virtualization adoption in the enterprise through:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Improved Performance: Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 
        delivers 45% better consolidation capacity than its competitors 
        according to a recent virtualization benchmark test submitted to Spec1. 
        This will allow businesses to consolidate servers and virtualize more 
        of their critical applications without compromising on performance.
      
			
				Scalability: KVM-based products such as Red Hat Enterprise 
        Virtualization automatically inherit the scalability of Linux, which 
        is proven in the largest scale, mission-critical datacenters. This 
        includes support for today&#8217;s modern server systems, with architectural 
        support up to 4,096 processor cores and up to 64TB of memory in the 
        host and 32 vCPUs in the guest and 1 TB of RAM, and exceeds the 
        abilities of other proprietary hypervisors for Linux and Windows. This 
        enables clients to fully exploit today&#8217;s biggest x86-based servers for 
        virtualization while allowing for future growth.
      
			
				Advanced security: In products such as Red Hat Enterprise 
        Virtualization, KVM is coupled with the well-proven SELinux security 
        infrastructure, which was developed in conjunction with the US 
        National Security Agency. SELinux, a kernel-based security policy 
        enforcement infrastructure, supports Mandatory Access Control and 
        provides an additional level of virtual server security over and above 
        that of competing products. This two-layer security is a vital 
        advantage in both private clouds and in public, multi-tenant 
        environments where the prospect of hostile tenants must be considered. 
        In addition, IBM and Red Hat are working together to achieve Common 
        Criteria for Information Technology Security Evaluation at EAL 4+ 
        level, a security assurance defined by the US National Security Agency.
      
			
				Reduced Costs: For businesses already using the Red Hat 
        Enterprise Linux 5.4 and later operating system, KVM is included. That 
        coupled with a centralized management system like Red Hat Enterprise 
        Virtualization Manager can help enterprises save up to 80% relative to 
        comparable proprietary virtualization solutions in the first year 
        (initial acquisition cost) and up to 66% over a course of three years. 
        To easily calculate expected savings for using the Red Hat Enterprise 
        Virtualization platform, visit Red Hat&#8217;s TCO calculator: https://roianalyst.alinean.com/redhat/rhev/.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			An Evolutionary Path to Cloud Computing
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recent advances in the security, performance and scalability of products 
      and solutions based on KVM technology have made it a natural choice for 
      cloud providers. The security capabilities support multi-tenant safety 
      in the cloud, the scalability advantages of KVM enables even the largest 
      application to be virtualized, and the performance allows higher 
      densities of virtual machines per physical server. Coupled with lower 
      costs, cloud providers are able to offer their services with a higher 
      quality of service, at a more attractive price point to their clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Building The Ecosystem
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM and Red Hat are working to develop the KVM systems management 
      ecosystem, to further encourage the adoption of open virtualization. 
      Planned areas of collaboration include increasing the scope and adoption 
      of the Red Hat Virtualization Management APIs, and building a community 
      to encourage the use of the Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization Manager 
      APIs by third-party virtualization products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Joint Development
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Together, the companies will also drive adoption of the open source 
      virtualization technology through jointly developing key virtualization 
      and cloud management interfaces and using the APIs in their respective 
      management products, including Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization 
      Manager, IBM Director and Tivoli software. The APIs will address cloud, 
      datacenter automation, virtual storage and networking, virtualization 
      security and virtual appliance management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Red Hat and IBM have worked together for over a decade with a 
      reputation for offering our customers high-value choices for their 
      infrastructures. We believe that open source virtualization solutions 
      give our partners freedom from lock in and the ability to take advantage 
      of the rapid innovation that the open source model enables,&#8221; said Scott 
      Crenshaw, vice president and general manager, Cloud Business Unit at Red 
      Hat. &#8220;Through KVM, Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization offers compelling 
      benefits, such as performance and scalability, to customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The recent enhancements to the security, reliability and performance of 
      KVM have made it a compelling choice for enterprises looking for the 
      flexibility of an open standards-based virtualization option,&#8221; said Jean 
      Staten, director of Linux at IBM. &#8220;Together with Red Hat we will 
      continue to drive KVM enterprise adoption enabling businesses of all 
      sizes to benefit from open virtualization.&#8221;

      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for 
      first-quarter 2011. As a result of Pfizer&#8217;s decision to sell the Capsugel(3) 
      business, Capsugel(3) is presented as a discontinued 
      operation in the consolidated statements of income for first-quarter 
      2011 and first-quarter 2010. Therefore, all revenues and expenses 
      related to Capsugel(3) in both periods are presented in a 
      single line, Discontinued operations - net of tax. Additionally, 
      due to the acquisition of King Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (King), legacy King 
      operations are reflected in first-quarter 2011 results beginning January 
      31, 2011 in accordance with Pfizer&#8217;s domestic and international 
      reporting periods(16), but are not reflected in first-quarter 
      2010 results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First-quarter 2011 revenues were $16.5 billion, consistent with the 
      year-ago quarter. Revenues for first-quarter 2011 compared with the 
      year-ago quarter were favorably impacted by $97 million, or 1%, due to 
      foreign exchange, and $224 million, or 1%, due to the addition of legacy 
      King products. First-quarter 2011 revenues were reduced by $166 million, 
      or 1%, due to U.S. healthcare reform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For first-quarter 2011, U.S. revenues were $7.0 billion, a decrease of 
      3% compared with the year-ago quarter. International revenues were $9.5 
      billion, an increase of 2% compared with the prior-year quarter, which 
      reflected 1% operational growth and a 1% favorable impact of foreign 
      exchange. U.S. revenues represented 43% of total revenues in 
      first-quarter 2011 compared with 44% in the year-ago quarter, while 
      international revenues represented 57% of total revenues in 
      first-quarter 2011 compared with 56% in the year-ago quarter.

      Primary Care(4) unit revenues in first-quarter 2011 were 
      driven by growth from certain patent-protected products, including 
      Lyrica, Spiriva, Pristiq and Celebrex, among others, in key 
      international markets, as well as the addition of legacy King products, 
      and negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Lipitor in Canada 
      and Spain in May and July 2010, respectively, as well as the loss of 
      exclusivity of Aricept in the U.S. in November 2010. Taken together, the 
      loss of exclusivity for these products in those markets reduced Primary 
      Care(4) revenues by approximately $590 million, or 10%, in 
      comparison with first-quarter 2010. Specialty Care(5) unit 
      revenues were positively impacted by strong growth in the 
      Prevnar/Prevenar franchise, Enbrel and Zyvox, notably in the U.S. and 
      Japan. Established Products(6) unit revenues were mainly 
      impacted by the loss of exclusivity and resulting increased competition 
      with respect to Effexor, Protonix and Zosyn/Tazocin, partially offset by 
      the addition of legacy King products. Emerging Markets(7) 
      unit revenues were positively impacted by growth in both innovative 
      brands, such as Enbrel, Lyrica, Sutent and Vfend, as well as established 
      products. Total revenues from established products in both the 
      Established Products(6) and Emerging Markets(7) 
      units were $3.3 billion, with $915 million generated in emerging 
      markets. Animal Health(9) unit revenues were favorably 
      impacted by approximately $50 million, or 6%, due to the addition of 
      legacy King products.

      Adjusted total costs(13) were $9.6 billion in first-quarter 
      2011, an increase of 3% compared with $9.4 billion in first-quarter 
      2010. Excluding the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of $101 
      million, or 1%, the increase in adjusted total costs(13) was 
      attributable primarily to a shift in product mix and business mix, the 
      addition of the legacy King operations and the inclusion of the annual 
      fee provided for under the 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation 
      beginning this year, partially offset by savings from cost-reduction 
      initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was 
      approximately 28% in first-quarter 2011 compared with approximately 30% 
      in first-quarter 2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate on 
      adjusted income(1) was primarily due to the extension of the 
      U.S. research and development credit that was signed into law in 
      December 2010 as well as the change in the jurisdictional mix of 
      earnings during first-quarter 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of the aforementioned factors, first-quarter 2011 adjusted 
      income(1) was $4.8 billion, a decrease of 1% compared with 
      $4.9 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(1) 
      was $0.60, comparable with the year-ago quarter.

			Highlights
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the aforementioned factors, first-quarter 2011 reported 
      earnings were favorably impacted by lower purchase accounting 
      adjustments and acquisition-related costs associated with the Wyeth 
      acquisition, and unfavorably impacted primarily by a charge related to 
      hormone-replacement therapy litigation and costs incurred to improve 
      innovation and overall productivity in the research and development 
      function.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The effective tax rate on reported results was approximately 29% in 
      first-quarter 2011 compared with approximately 36% in first-quarter 
      2010. The decrease in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the 
      aforementioned extension of the U.S. research and development credit, 
      the change in the jurisdictional mix of earnings and the tax impact of 
      the legal charge previously mentioned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of all these factors, first-quarter 2011 reported net income(2) 
      was $2.2 billion, an increase of 10% compared with $2.0 billion in the 
      prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS(2) was $0.28, an 
      increase of 12% compared with $0.25 in the prior-year quarter.

			Executive Commentary
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ian Read, President and Chief Executive Officer, stated, &#8220;I am pleased 
      not only with our solid financial performance during the first quarter 
      despite the loss of exclusivity of several products in the U.S. and 
      other geographies, but also with our ability to enhance shareholder 
      value through various initiatives, including our increased share 
      repurchase activity so far this year. Many of our products, notably the 
      Prevnar/Prevenar franchise and Lyrica, continued to perform well. In 
      addition, our Emerging Markets unit delivered 8% operational growth, 
      driven by many of our priority countries, notably China, and continued 
      to benefit from our ongoing targeted investment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With our strong base of people, platforms and in-line and pipeline 
      compounds combined with our continuing focus on improving returns on 
      investment, I believe we are well positioned to succeed in fixing our 
      innovative core, which, if successful, can lead to greater value in both 
      the near and longer-term. I am pleased to report that during this year 
      we expect to present phase 3 clinical data for tofacitinib in rheumatoid 
      arthritis, axitinib for renal cell carcinoma, Prevnar/Prevenar 13 for 
      the prevention of pneumococcal disease in adults, and Eliquis for stroke 
      prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation, as well as phase 2 
      clinical data for crizotinib for non-small cell lung cancer, among 
      others. For crizotinib, we remain on-track with our rolling U.S. 
      submission, which began in January. Additionally, we continue to 
      anticipate filings in the U.S. and EU by the end of 2011 for certain 
      other oncology compounds as well as for tofacitinib and Eliquis. 
      Further, we expect to receive actions later this year on our U.S. and EU 
      filings of Prevnar/Prevenar 13 for the prevention of pneumococcal 
      disease in adults.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Lastly, we remain focused on continuing the evaluation of our business 
      portfolio to determine the optimal mix of businesses to maximize our 
      return. We expect to complete this evaluation during the second half of 
      2011,&#8221; Mr. Read concluded.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Frank D&#8217;Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, &#8220;Given our performance 
      during the first quarter as well as our continued confidence in the 
      business, we are reaffirming our 2011 financial guidance and 2012 
      financial targets. Additionally, reflecting the continued confidence in 
      our business, the strength of our balance sheet and our view that our 
      shares represent a good investment for our stakeholders at the current 
      valuation, we repurchased approximately $1.4 billion, or 73.5 million 
      shares, of our common stock during the first quarter of 2011 and a total 
      of approximately $2.2 billion, or 110.5 million shares, through April 
      30, 2011. We now expect to repurchase between $5 billion and $7 billion 
      of our common stock this year as we plan to redeploy the after-tax 
      proceeds from the sale of Capsugel(3), once completed, into 
      share repurchases and/or opportunistic business development transactions 
      that are expected to meet or exceed the return on investment of share 
      repurchases. In the first quarter of this year, we returned 
      approximately $3.0 billion to our shareholders through dividends and 
      share repurchases, clearly demonstrating our commitment to provide 
      greater shareholder return.&#8221;

      As previously stated, given the longer-term nature of these targets,

            section of Pfizer's Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,

          months of King's U.S. operations and approximately one month of 
          King's international operations.

			1. Change in Reported Cost of Sales
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported cost of sales decreased 12% in first-quarter 2011, compared to 
      the same period in 2010. The decrease primarily reflects lower purchase 
      accounting adjustments in 2011, partially offset by a 2% unfavorable 
      impact of foreign exchange.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 2.9 
      percentage points to 22.4% in first-quarter 2011, compared to the same 
      period in 2010, reflecting the aforementioned factors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2. Change in Reported Selling, Informational  
      Administrative (SIA) Expenses and Reported Research  Development (RD) 
      Expenses
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported SIA expenses increased 2% in first-quarter 2011, compared to 
      the same period in 2010. SIA was negatively impacted by the annual fee 
      provided for under the 2010 U.S. healthcare reform legislation beginning 
      this year, the addition of legacy King operating costs, charges recorded 
      for certain litigation matters and a 1% unfavorable impact of foreign 
      exchange.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Reported RD expenses decreased 6% in first-quarter 2011, compared to 
      the same period in 2010, primarily due to savings from our 
      cost-reduction initiatives, partially offset by the addition of legacy 
      King operations. Foreign exchange had a minimal impact on reported RD 
      expenses in first-quarter 2011.

      Fitch Solutions: Breakup Rumors  Potential Losses Send Pfizer's CDS 13% 
      Wider
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Credit default swap (CDS) spreads on Pfizer are suggesting increased 
      uncertainty over the pharmaceutical giant's future credit prospects, 
      according to Fitch Solutions in its latest earnings commentary.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Spreads on Pfizer (releasing first quarter results today) have widened 
      13%, substantially underperforming the broader North America health care 
      sector. CDS liquidity increased slightly, moving to the 31st regional 
      percentile from the 33rd. 'Profit losses from its Lipitor patent 
      expiration and talks of a possible company breakup are contributing to 
      the increased uncertainty surrounding Pfizer,' said Author and Director 
      Diana Allmendinger.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Elsewhere, CDS on Tesoro Corporation (reporting tomorrow) have rallied 
      9.4%. Credit protection on Tesoro is currently pricing one notch above 
      recent historical trading levels. CDS liquidity for Tesoro fell to the 
      16th regional percentile from trading in the fifth three months ago. 
      'Recent CDS spread and liquidity performance points to a stronger 
      footing for Tesoro,' said Allmendinger.

&lt;p&gt;May 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Inc (GS.N) Chairman and
Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein may lead the Wall Street bank
for at least two more years, the New York Post reported, citing
sources. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Blankfein, who led the firm out of recent regulatory tussles
and whose future has been the subject of Wall Street
speculation, has told investors and board members that he is not
expected to quit office in the near term, one source told the
Post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman declined to comment to the paper. The
company was not immediately available for comment when contacted
by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think he is going anywhere, and the board has been
really supportive of what he is been through and how he
navigated the crisis," one insider told the Post.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG May 3 (Reuters) - Bank of America Merrill Lynch
 has hired former Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
executive Ryan Holsheimer as head of equity execution services
in Asia-Pacific, according to an internal memo seen by Reuters.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Merrill Lynch spokesman Mark Tsang confirmed
the contents of the memo to Reuters.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan would oversee sales trading across execution services
platforms including single shares, portfolios, futures and
electronic execution, the memo said. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan, who has spent about a decade at Goldman Sachs, was
head of pan-Asian execution services at the Wall Street bank.
Prior to that, he worked at BofA Merrill Lynch in Sydney, Hong
Kong and Tokyo between 1996 and 2001.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan joins former Goldman Sachs executives Joe Lee, Peter
MacDonald and Gene Reilly who have been hired by Bank of America
Merrill Lynch as part of a plan to strengthen its equity
platform in the region.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE May 3 (Reuters) - Southeast Asia's largest bank,
DBS Group , said on Tuesday it had appointed JPMorgan
Chase  Co banker Toby O'Connor as the head of its
sharia unit, The Islamic Bank of Asia (IBA).	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; DBS said in a statement that O'Connor was previously the
head of the Middle East and North Africa Sovereign Wealth Funds
and Financial Sponsor group for investment banking at JP Morgan.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "O'Connor will lead the growth of IBA by ramping up
investment banking, especially capital markets and private
equity, in line with the bank's renewed focus on fee-income
businesses," DBS said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The position at IBA has been vacant for more than a year
since previous CEO Vince Cook resigned for personal reasons in
December 2009.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBA was set up in 2007 by DBS and a group of Middle Eastern
investors to provide Islamic banking services to customers in
Asia and the Middle East. DBS owns 50 percent plus one share of
IBA.

			Keller Rohrback L.L.P. Announces Investigation of JPMorgan Chase Bank 
      and Other Lenders Regarding FHA Mortgage Insurance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Attorney Advertising. Keller Rohrback L.L.P. (www.krclassaction.com) 
      is currently investigating JPMorgan Chase Bank (NYSE:JPM), Washington 
      Mutual (NYSE:WAMUQ), Bear Stearns Residential Mortgage (NYSE:BSC), Bank 
      of America (NYSE:BAC), Countrywide, Citigroup (NYSE:C), and HSBC 
      (NYSE:HBC), among others, for alleged mortgage originator abuse of the 
      Federal Housing Administration (&#8220;FHA&#8221;) mortgage insurance offered 
      through the Direct Endorsement Lender program. In particular, the 
      investigation focuses on lax lender mortgage selection practices, 
      deficient appraisal practices, and inappropriate evaluation of borrower 
      income by lenders to make mortgages qualify for the government&#8217;s FHA 
      guarantee. These abusive practices allowed lenders to obtain FHA 
      mortgage insurance, thereby making the mortgages marketable in the 
      secondary mortgage market. When these borrowers defaulted, the FHA was 
      forced to pay millions of dollars in insurance claims inappropriately. 
      The U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York filed suit on 
      May 3, 2011, against Deutsche Bank AG and MortgageIT, Inc. for similar

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has just a few more months to put its stamp on the Volcker rule, and it is not wasting any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule, designed to limit banks from speculating with their own money, will cost Goldman at least $3.7 billion in annual revenue, by one estimate. And billions more could be at stake if regulations now being drawn up are extra-tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule was one of the main topics on the agenda when Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein met recently with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street chiefs do not often lobby top regulators directly, but this issue is unusually important to Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're totally freaked out about Volcker," said a Goldman lobbyist who declined to speak on the record for fear of losing the contract. "People are working on that a lot, with agency staff, with lawmakers, you name it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, lobbying disclosures show Goldman representatives have been working both sides of the political aisle and meeting with top officials in the White House and regulatory agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big area of concern for Goldman is that regulators who are interpreting the Volcker rule will severely limit the amount of time a bank can hold a security or derivative. Positions held long term can be backstairs bets on markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule is not the only element of financial reform that Goldman is resisting. Important issues on its lobbying docket also include derivatives reform, capital requirements and bonus restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other bank heads, including Morgan Stanley's James Gorman, have met Schapiro about the Volcker rule. But the provision is most important for Goldman, whose business is far more weighted toward trading, three lobbying sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALL STAR TEAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has hired an all-star team of lobbyists and former government officials, leveraging powerful connections to get its message across to regulatory and political leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before the crisis, Goldman was basically non-existent in Washington," said a former Congressional staffer who now works as a policy analyst at a Wall Street bank. "Post-crisis, Goldman is everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under last year's Dodd-Frank law, regulators have until July to come up with specific rules for implementing the Volcker provision, meaning banks have limited time to try to shape the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the complexity of lobbying efforts is the number of parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC and four other regulators are in the process of writing separate versions of the Volcker rule, which must then be reconciled and shaped into a single set of regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Volcker is the subject of a very quiet, closed-door battle right now, not just between us and Wall Street, but among the agencies as well," said Bart Naylor, who has lobbied regulators for consumer-rights coalition Americans for Financial Reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Stephen Cohen declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impending changes have already spurred Goldman to dismantle much of its "proprietary trading" operations, which trade for the bank's own account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These operations were some of the bank's most profitable, and their closure will erase about $3.7 billion in revenue and $1.5 billion in profit annually, according to an estimate by JPMorgan Cazenove analyst Kian Abouhossein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Abouhossein's reckoning, the bank gets another $17 billion of revenue from "market making," or linking up buyers and sellers across global markets. That revenue could also be squeezed, depending how stringent the regulations are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those figures represent about 65 percent of Goldman's annual revenue, according to Abouhossein's estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers say the Volcker rule will ensure that big banks are not gambling in markets, and that taxpayers will not be left on the hook when their bets backfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing the Volcker rule will be tricky, though. When a bank buys a security from a client, it is difficult for a regulator to determine whether the bank is serving the client or betting on the market itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting holding periods could be a simple way to ensure that banks are not making secret bets under the guise of helping clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOING LONG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman argues that holding on to securities for a long period of time can be a crucial part of trading on behalf of customers because assets trade infrequently in some markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A substantial amount of the securities that Goldman trades seems to fall into the longer-term category. In a February presentation, Goldman said it held about a third of the securities and listed derivatives on its trading books for three months or more, and 8 percent for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank did not disclose how long it holds unlisted derivatives positions, where it also has significant exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is also advocating that regulators exclude currency contracts from the Volcker rule, in addition to Treasury bills and interest-rate swaps, which were excluded in the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They definitely don't want their entire book to be micro-managed by the SEC," said a regulatory consultant who once worked at Goldman and is familiar with its lobbying efforts. "They want as much -- I wouldn't say self-policing -- but as much flexibility as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years following the crisis, Washington has been reshaping the financial industry in an effort to prevent another collapse. Goldman has in turn been trying to shape the legislative and regulatory process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intensity of its efforts is evident in at least one concrete way: the amount of money it is spending on lobbying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That figure totaled $1.32 million in the first quarter of 2011. That's 15 percent higher than the same period a year ago, putting the bank on course to break its annual record for lobbying expenditure of $4.61 million, set in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're a big and powerful company with a lot riding on financial reform," said Dave Levinthal, editor of OpenSecrets.org, which tracks lobbying and campaign spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When monumental legislation like Wall Street reform gets passed, it's not only about the legislation when it's coursing through Congress, but how it's being implemented."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Wall Street, where a bank can earn billions of dollars a year, a $5 million lobbying budget may seem paltry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Washington it's a lot of money. And relative to revenue, Goldman's spending is exponentially higher than that of its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has hired an all-star stable of Washington lobbying heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Paese, former deputy staff director for the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, heads its internal lobbying group. His team includes former staffers from the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, the White House and regulatory agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of its own payroll, Goldman also has several high-profile legislative veterans working on its behalf in Washington, hailing from both sides of the political aisle. Among them are former Republican lawmakers Trent Lott and John Breaux and former Democratic House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is common for large companies to seek influence in government, but old hands in Washington say Goldman stands out both in its wide network of high-level contacts and its ability to leverage those relationships to its advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The individuals at Goldman have been incredibly powerful over time," says Hillary Sale, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in Wall Street regulation. "When you're a consumer, it gives you the creeps thinking about that kind of influence over regulation. But from the bank's side, it's a perfectly smart strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dan Wilchins and Ted Kerr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Blankfein met with Schapiro to discuss Volcker rule&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Holding period limits of particular concern to Goldman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Goldman on track to break its 2010 lobbying spend record&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lauren Tara LaCapra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 4 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
has just a few more months to put its stamp on the Volcker
rule, and it is not wasting any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rule, designed to limit banks from speculating with
their own money, will cost Goldman at least $3.7 billion in
annual revenue, by one estimate. And billions more could be at
stake if regulations now being drawn up are extra-tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Volcker rule was one of the main topics on the agenda
when Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein met recently with U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street chiefs do not often lobby top regulators
directly, but this issue is unusually important to Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They're totally freaked out about Volcker," said a Goldman
lobbyist who declined to speak on the record for fear of losing
the contract. "People are working on that a lot, with agency
staff, with lawmakers, you name it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, lobbying disclosures show Goldman representatives
have been working both sides of the political aisle and meeting
with top officials in the White House and regulatory agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One big area of concern for Goldman is that regulators who
are interpreting the Volcker rule will severely limit the
amount of time a bank can hold a security or derivative.
Positions held long term can be backstairs bets on markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Volcker rule is not the only element of financial
reform that Goldman is resisting. Important issues on its
lobbying docket also include derivatives reform, capital
requirements and bonus restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other bank heads, including Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) James
Gorman, have met Schapiro about the Volcker rule. But the
provision is most important for Goldman, whose business is far
more weighted towards trading, three lobbying sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a graphic showing Goldman's spending on lobbying click&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; r.reuters.com/quk39r&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a graphic showing spending on lobbying by Wall Street&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; banks see r.reuters.com/ruk39r
 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ALL STAR TEAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has hired an all-star team of lobbyists and former
government officials, leveraging powerful connections to get
its message across to regulatory and political leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Before the crisis, Goldman was basically non-existent in
Washington," said a former Congressional staffer who now works
as a policy analyst at a Wall Street bank. "Post-crisis,
Goldman is everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under last year's Dodd-Frank law, regulators have until
July to come up with specific rules for implementing the
Volcker provision, meaning banks have limited time to try to
shape the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adding to the complexity of lobbying efforts is the number
of parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC and four other regulators are in the process of
writing separate versions of the Volcker rule, which must then
be reconciled and shaped into a single set of regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Volcker is the subject of a very quiet, closed-door battle
right now, not just between us and Wall Street, but among the
agencies as well," said Bart Naylor, who has lobbied regulators
for consumer-rights coalition Americans for Financial Reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs spokesman Stephen Cohen declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The impending changes have already spurred Goldman to
dismantle much of its "proprietary trading" operations, which
trade for the bank's own account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These operations were some of the bank's most profitable,
and their closure will erase about $3.7 billion in revenue and
$1.5 billion in profit annually, according to an estimate by
JPMorgan Cazenove analyst Kian Abouhossein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Abouhossein's reckoning, the bank gets another $17
billion of revenue from "market making," or linking up buyers
and sellers across global markets. That revenue could also be
squeezed, depending how stringent the regulations are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those figures represent about 65 percent of Goldman's
annual revenue, according to Abouhossein's estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawmakers say the Volcker rule will ensure that big banks
are not gambling in markets, and that taxpayers will not be
left on the hook when their bets backfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Implementing the Volcker rule will be tricky, though. When
a bank buys a security from a client, it is difficult for a
regulator to determine whether the bank is serving the client
or betting on the market itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Limiting holding periods could be a simple way to ensure
that banks are not making secret bets under the guise of
helping clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOING LONG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman argues that holding on to securities for a long
period of time can be a crucial part of trading on behalf of
customers because assets trade infrequently in some markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A substantial amount of the securities that Goldman trades
seems to fall into the longer-term category. In a February
presentation, Goldman said it held about a third of the
securities and listed derivatives on its trading books for
three months or more, and 8 percent for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank did not disclose how long it holds unlisted
derivatives positions, where it also has significant exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is also advocating that regulators exclude currency
contracts from the Volcker rule, in addition to Treasury bills
and interest-rate swaps, which were excluded in the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They definitely don't want their entire book to be
micro-managed by the SEC," said a regulatory consultant who
once worked at Goldman and is familiar with its lobbying
efforts. "They want as much -- I wouldn't say self-policing --
but as much flexibility as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the years following the crisis, Washington has been
reshaping the financial industry in an effort to prevent
another collapse. Goldman has in turn been trying to shape the
legislative and regulatory process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The intensity of its efforts is evident in at least one
concrete way: the amount of money it is spending on lobbying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That figure totaled $1.32 million in the first quarter of
2011. That's 15 percent higher than the same period a year ago,
putting the bank on course to break its annual record for
lobbying expenditure of $4.61 million, set in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They're a big and powerful company with a lot riding on
financial reform," said Dave Levinthal, editor of
OpenSecrets.org, which tracks lobbying and campaign spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When monumental legislation like Wall Street reform gets
passed, it's not only about the legislation when it's coursing
through Congress, but how it's being implemented."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Wall Street, where a bank can earn billions of dollars
a year, a $5 million lobbying budget may seem paltry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in Washington it's a lot of money. And relative to
revenue, Goldman's spending is exponentially higher than that
of its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank has hired an all-star stable of Washington
lobbying heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Michael Paese, former deputy staff director for the U.S.
House Financial Services Committee, heads its internal lobbying
group. His team includes former staffers from the U.S. Senate
Banking Committee, the White House and regulatory agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Outside of its own payroll, Goldman also has several
high-profile legislative veterans working on its behalf in
Washington, hailing from both sides of the political aisle.
Among them are former Republican lawmakers Trent Lott and John
Breaux and former Democratic House Majority Leader Dick
Gephardt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is common for large companies to seek influence in
government, but old hands in Washington say Goldman stands out
both in its wide network of high-level contacts and its ability
to leverage those relationships to its advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The individuals at Goldman have been incredibly powerful
over time," says Hillary Sale, a law professor at Washington
University in St. Louis who specializes in Wall Street
regulation. "When you're a consumer, it gives you the creeps
thinking about that kind of influence over regulation. But from
the bank's side, it's a perfectly smart strategy."

			Chevron Announces Agreement to Acquire Marcellus Shale Acreage
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has announced today that it has agreed to 
      acquire oil and gas assets, primarily 228,000 net leasehold acres, in 
      the Marcellus Shale from Chief Oil  Gas LLC and Tug Hill, Inc. Terms of 
      the transaction, which is expected to close before the end of the second 
      quarter, were not disclosed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      George Kirkland, vice chairman, Chevron Corporation, said, &#8220;This 
      opportunity is aligned with our strategy to acquire early-in-life assets 
      with long-term organic growth potential. Over the last year, Chevron has 
      acquired nearly five million net acres of shale gas assets in the United 
      States, Canada, Poland and Romania.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This expansion of our shale gas portfolio gives us additional 
      high-quality resources with strong growth potential, as well as 
      proximity to and synergy with existing operations,&#8221; said Gary Luquette, 
      president of Chevron North America Exploration and Production Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The acreage, which is principally located in southern Pennsylvania, will 
      give Chevron an estimated five trillion cubic feet of additional natural 
      gas resource in its Marcellus Shale operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is one of the world&#8217;s leading integrated energy companies, with 
      subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company is involved in 
      virtually every facet of the energy industry. Chevron explores for,

			BrightStar 
      Partners, Inc., an IBM Premier Business Partner and global Business 
      Analytics consulting and software firm, today announced Richard Manns 
      has joined the company as Vice President of Professional Services. In 
      this new role, Manns will leverage more than 15 years of experience in 
      advancing the utilization of Business Analytics practices across 
      numerous industries, to build upon the current success of the BrightStar 
      Partners organization. Manns&#8217; responsibilities will include providing 
      leadership to the BSP services organization, contributing to revenue 
      generation, project oversight and delivery, and practice expansion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Richard was an early adopter of business intelligence, and he has been 
      a long time user and advocate of the IBM Cognos suite of Business 
      Analytics tools&#8221;, said Neil Morgan, Partner at BrightStar Partners. 
      &#8220;Richard also served as a valued member of the Cognos Strategic Advisory 
      Board for several years, where his perspective, insight, participation, 
      and leadership were highly valued.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite his penchant for BI, Manns&#8217; background is not that of a 
      technologist, but rather as a business person. Most of his career was 
      spent within the Office of Finance with several companies, where he was 
      responsible for operational and financial analysis, and budgeting and 
      planning systems. In those roles, Richard helped to improve 
      organizational effectiveness through the delivery of BI and Performance 
      Management based solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Richard represents a new set of eyes and different thinking for BSP, 
      and we are looking forward to leveraging his business-centric 
      perspective in the delivery of business analytic solutions for our 
      customers", said Andrew Rachmiel, Partner at BrightStar Partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Net income $881 million&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Fiscal Q2 EPS $1.23 vs Street view $1.20&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Authorizes new $1 billion share repurchase program&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Visa CEO on regulatory outlook: 'We'll be just fine'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares down 1.3 percent after hours
 (Adds CEO comments on regulation and upcoming mobile
announcement; updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Maria Aspan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Visa Inc's (V.N) quarterly profit
rose more than expected as increasingly confident consumers spent
more, but doubts remain about the payments network's ability to
grow under looming regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares fell in after-hours trading, as Visa failed to beat
expectations by the wide margins investors were once used to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People get spoiled. There's nothing obvious not to like,"
said Eric Grover, a payments consultant at Intrepid Ventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's still some disquiet" about regulation, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like smaller rival MasterCard Inc (MA.N), Visa is benefiting
from a rebound in consumer confidence after the financial crisis.
But Visa, reporting two days after MasterCard cheered investors
with its upbeat report on U.S. consumer spending, has more to
prove. [ID:nN02251522]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest card processing network dominates the
U.S. debit processing market -- and is now much more vulnerable to
increasing U.S. regulation. A provision of the U.S. Dodd-Frank
financial reform law will restrict the fees merchants pay banks
and networks every time a customer buys something with a debit
card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Federal Reserve has proposed rules under the law that
would cut an estimated $13 billion of the banking industry's $23
billion in annual debit card processing fee revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some industry members are increasingly optimistic that a
last-ditch effort in Washington will blunt the law's impact -- or
even delay it for two years. [ID:nN03297066]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa Chief Executive Joseph Saunders told analysts during a
conference call that the company's efforts are "gaining increasing
traction" in Washington, and said Visa is "hopeful" that the
Senate will soon consider a bill that would delay the law by two
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I have a considerably high degree of confidence that we'll be
just fine," Saunders said in reply to one question about the law
and its potential effects on his company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he failed to fully reassure his listeners, who repeatedly
-- and mostly unsuccessfully -- asked Saunders to describe Visa's
strategies for making up its potential lost revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As Edward Jones analyst Shannon Stemm told Reuters, until the
law is delayed or fully implemented, "that's absolutely still a
cloud over these companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DIALING UP MOBILE PAYMENTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa said on Thursday revenue rose 15 percent to $2.25
billion, slightly above expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like MasterCard, Visa does not lend at all and was not
directly affected by the surge of credit losses during the
financial crisis. But it struggled to grow during the recession,
as consumers and companies cut back sharply on spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now people are increasingly willing to spend money using their
Visa cards, and are even spending on travel and other
discretionary items, instead of restricting themselves to
necessities as they did during the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cross-border volumes rose 13 percent during the quarter,
indicating that people are swiping their Visa cards abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa is also increasingly looking for growth from new
technology, including mobile phone and online payments, in the
face of a saturated U.S. market for credit and debit cards. Banks,
networks, technology companies and mobile phone carriers are all
increasingly competing to gain a foothold in mobile payments,
betting that consumers will increasingly want to buy things with
their smartphones instead of with traditional cards.
[ID:nN04288600]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saunders told analysts during the call to expect an
announcement next week about Visa's mobile and ecommerce
strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From our point of view, it's significant," he said, but he
would not elaborate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The San Francisco-based company on Thursday reported net
income of $881 million, or $1.23 per share for its fiscal second
quarter ended March 31. That compared to $713 million, or 96 cents
per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average had expected Visa to earn $1.20 per share,
according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also said its board had authorized a $1 billion
share buyback program, which will be in place through April 20,
2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Visa shares closed down 1.3 percent at $78.70 on Thursday and
fell about 1.3 percent in after-hours trading.

 (Adds details, background, Allstate litigation, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 5 (Reuters) - Massachusetts Mutual Life
Insurance Co accused four major banks in a lawsuit of hiding
the risks on $175.8 million of mortgage-related debt it bought,
which lost three-fourths of its value as homeowners defaulted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit filed on Thursday in the federal court in
Boston names Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), JPMorgan Chase 
Co (JPM.N), Barclays Plc (BARC.L), UBS AG (UBSN.VX) and several
bank officials as defendants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It accuses the banks of misleading MassMutual, one of the
nation's biggest insurers, about the risks on certificates they
underwrote between 2005 and 2007 that were backed by home loans
issued by American Home Mortgage Investment Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American Home lent to people who could not fully document
their income and assets. It had been the 10th largest U.S.
mortgage lender before its bankruptcy in August 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insurers, eager to improve their returns, had before the
nation's housing slump been drawn to seemingly safe mortgage
debt to boost yields, only to later see it turn toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They and other investors have filed tens of billions of
dollars of lawsuits against banks, lenders and others that
issues the mortgages or packaged them into securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MassMutual said the American Home certificates it bought
are now "junk," with 21.5 percent to 44.8 percent of the loans
in each of six securitizations being delinquent, in default or
foreclosed upon. It said this caused the market value of the
certificates to plunge 77 percent to just $41 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In a properly underwritten pool of loans, one would not
expect to see such a large spike of defaults occurring shortly
after origination," the complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representatives of Goldman, JPMorgan, Barclays and UBS
declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MassMutual had in February filed a lawsuit against Credit
Suisse Group AG (CSGN.VX) over alleged mortgage losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, home and auto insurer Allstate Corp (ALL.N) has
since late December sued several banks in a New York state
court to recover losses on about $2.1 billion of risky
mortgage-backed debt it said had been marketed as safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co v.
Goldman Sachs Mortgage Co et al, U.S. District Court, District
of Massachusetts, No. 11-30126.

    FEATURED PERFOMERS

    EMILY OSMENT
 Best-known for playing Lilly Truscott on Disney Channel's
Emmy-nominated "Hannah Montana," 18 year old Emily Osment has always had
a passion for music. An accomplished musician, whose mom taught her to
play guitar, Emily has actually been making music for as long as she's
been acting.

    Her debut album's title, "Fight or Flight," reflects Emily's ambitions to
fight through personal
 anxieties and achieve success in two very
competitive fields. "I don't want to write songs that are just
surface-deep," explains Emily, whose own favorites growing up included
Led Zeppelin, the Beatles, the Monkees, the Doors and Herman's Hermits,
as well as modern groups like The Pixies and Massive Attack. "I want
songs that, the more you listen, the more you figure out what I'm talking
about. I love putting secrets like that on the record."

    As for Osment herself, she is confident she can artfully balance -- and
maintain -- her growing careers in acting and music without sacrificing
quality in either, something she learned only too well from by observing
her good friend and colleague Miley Cyrus and her brother, actor Haley
Joel Osment. "Whether it's going to school and taking on film roles or
doing music and acting, I'm lucky to be pursuing both of my passions."

    CODY SIMPSON
 As a kid growing up on Australia's sun-drenched Gold Coast,
Cody Simpson used to watch his father play guitar and sing for friends
and family at parties and backyard barbecues. Seeing how music brought
people together, Cody asked for his own guitar and lessons at the age of
seven. By age 12, he began posting YouTube videos of himself performing
covers of songs by artists who inspired him, including Justin Timberlake,
Jason Mraz, and The Jacksons. Search for Cody on YouTube and there he is:
an appealing blonde 12-year-old accompanying himself on guitar while
knocking out stellar covers of "Cry Me A River," "I'm Yours," and "I Want
You Back." 

    In April 2010, Cody signed with Atlantic Records, which released his
irresistible rhythmic pop single "iYiYi" featuring Flo Rida. In December,
Cody released the "4U" EP which is highlighted by the track "All Day,"
currently a Top 10 smash at Radio Disney. Cody also had the chance to
perform at the 2010 Australian Kids' Choice Awards and is now
co-headlining tour with Greyson Chance. For more about this rising young
pop singer, songwriter and guitarist, please visit

    TIM URBAN
 During the 2010 season of American Idol, Tim Urban emerged on
the national music scene with a blend of his smooth vocals, all-American
charm and trademark smile. His talent, determination and upbeat attitude
won the hearts of fans all over the world and earned him the number seven
slot in the competition, as well as the chance to perform on the AI 2010
summer concert tour.

    Tim's journey towards a music career began when he picked up his dad's
guitar at age thirteen. His musical style was influenced by such
musicians as Jim Croce, John Denver, Michael Buble, and Coldplay. He
continued to develop his love for music throughout high school,
performing in musical theater productions and playing at local music
venues. Before American Idol, he was playing in his hometown,
Duncanville, Texas, and pursuing a career in entertainment through a
Christian talent organization, Actors, Models and Talent for Christ
(AMTC). Tim's Christian faith has had a profound impact on his life and
music. His song "Lullaby" was written for orphans he met while on a
humanitarian trip to South Africa in 2007. 

    Since finishing the American Idol 2010 concert tour, Tim continues to
write and record music. He released his new EP "Heart of Me" on November
8, 2010 through iTunes. He continues to write music, pursue acting
opportunities and perform concerts around the country.

    Fam Jams! is also sponsored by CBS 3 and The CW Philly. CBS 3 (KYW-TV)
and The CW Philly 57 (WPSG-TV) are part of CBS Television Stations, a
division of CBS Corporation.

    Public Programming at Penn's Landing would not be possible without the
continued support of corporate partners such as PECO, Verizon,
Pennsylvania Lottery, Live Nation, the Philadelphia Coca-Cola Bottling
Company and the Greater Philadelphia Tourism Marketing Corporation, all
of whom are committed to serving the Greater Philadelphia community. 

    The 2011 Summer Program of Free Events at Penn's Landing is funded and
produced by the Delaware River Waterfront Corporation (DRWC). All events
produced by DRWC are FREE to the public on the new RiverStage on the
Great Plaza, the heart of Penn's Landing, Philadelphia's premier Delaware
River waterfront entertainment destination.

fundamental purpose of DRWC is to design, develop and manage the central
Delaware River waterfront in Philadelphia. DRWC is transforming the

			125 Years Young! Coca-Cola Kicks Off a Summer-long Celebration of 
      Sharing Happiness
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A 125th anniversary comes along just once, so why not 
      commemorate it for an entire summer? For people in the U.S. who love 
      Coca-Cola, the celebration of the world&#8217;s favorite brand&#8217;s 125th 
      year will extend well past its May 8th anniversary as a 
      variety of activities will invite people to enjoy &#8220;125 Years of Summer 
      Fun.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Beginning in May, summer-long programs will spread the message of 125 
      years of sharing happiness with the millions of people whose love for 
      Coca-Cola make this anniversary possible. From packaging and advertising 
      to promotions and integration into key properties, Coca-Cola will 
      celebrate this milestone with people everywhere and thank them for their 
      devotion to their favorite brand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For 125 years, Coca-Cola has refreshed the world and celebrated with 
      people as they enjoy fun times with family and friends,&#8221; said Stuart 
      Kronauge, Vice President, Coca-Cola Trademark Brands, Coca-Cola North 
      America. &#8220;From Memorial Day through Labor Day, at the racetrack, the 
      movie theater, their favorite park or a backyard barbecue, Coca-Cola is 
      always where people gather to enjoy summer fun.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Special 8-ounce commemorative bottles will mark the 125th 
      anniversary and celebrate 125 Days of Summer Fun. During the summer, a 
      brand new package size, a 1.25 liter bottle for Coca-Cola, will hit 
      store shelves. Print and radio ads will draw the connection between 1.25 
      liters of refreshment and 125 Years of Coca-Cola. For the third summer 
      in a row, limited collector series Coca-Cola packaging will include new 
      iconic summer images meant to convey the fun of a &#8220;Day at the Beach,&#8221; 
      through sunglasses, surfboards and flip flops, and a &#8220;Day at the Park,&#8221; 
      through baseballs, kites, picnic baskets and stars and stripes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s because of the millions of people who enjoy the world&#8217;s number one 
      brand every day that Coca-Cola has reached this milestone in its 
      history,&#8221; continued Kronauge. &#8220;As part of the celebration we want to 
      thank everyone, everywhere, for drinking Coca-Cola, so we&#8217;ve created two 
      summer-long programs that offer 125 days of prizes. It&#8217;s one of the many 
      ways we&#8217;re showing our appreciation to the people who love Coca-Cola.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first, available through My Coke Rewards, is designed to help busy 
      moms create summer fun for their families by offering a variety of 
      rewards including concert ticket vouchers, theme park tickets and 
      experiences, trips to national parks and beach prize packs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the second program, which will help ramp up summer excitement for 
      teens, prizes can be instantly claimed with special text-to-win codes 
      found under the caps of Coca-Cola trademark brands. Featured items 
      include movie passes, concert cash, airline ticket vouchers and gift 
      cards for electronics. Over the course of 125 days, someone can win a 
      new prize every two minutes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      National advertising running on key programs such as American Idol and 
      the Coca-Cola 600 will be tagged with special &#8220;125
			Years of 
      Sharing Happiness&#8221; messaging. Moviegoers will also see in-cinema 
      advertising with special anniversary messaging.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Major events like the Coca-Cola 600, the Coke Zero 400, Essence Music 
      Festival will feature messaging about the 125th anniversary 
      of Coca-Cola, including a special Coca-Cola message during &#8211; what else &#8211; 
      the 125th lap of the Coca-Cola 600.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to commemorative packaging, shoppers will also see special 
      125th anniversary displays in their local retail outlets and 
      collectible cups in food service locations. The Coca-Cola Freestyle 
      fountain dispenser is even joining the celebration by upping its 
      offering of drink choices from 106 to 125.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola associates will also join the effort by taking part in a 
      special Day of Service. This system-wide, family-focused program will 
      give Coca-Cola associates a special way to celebrate their favorite 
      brand&#8217;s 125th year by saying thank you to the communities 
      where The Coca-Cola Company operates. Employees will be able to take a 
      day out of the office to Live Positively by joining their families to 
      volunteer in their local communities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On May 7, Coca-Cola will host a special festival at Pemberton Place in 
      Atlanta for employees and their families. The event includes a 125th 
      Anniversary Celebration Concert that will be streamed online as a live 
      &#8220;thank you&#8221; to people around the world at www.Coca-Cola.com/125, 
      with integration through social media including YouTube, Facebook and 
      Twitter. Viewers of the live stream will be able to use Facebook Places 
      and Foursquare to virtually check-in to the event, which will feature 
      musicians from Somalia, New Zealand, Britain and the United States, 
      including the Grammy award-winning singer and American Idol season one 
      winner Kelly Clarkson.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Chase Announces 100 Winners in Latest Round of Community Giving 
      Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Each Charity Receives $25,000 from Chase and Chance to Win 
      $500,000 in Round II, Part of Chase&#8217;s $25-Million Commitment to 
      Charities Over Next Two Years
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chase announced today the 100 charities that will each receive a $25,000 
      grant from Chase and will advance to Round 2 of the Chase Community 
      Giving Program. These 100 charities now have a chance to receive a 
      $500,000 grant from the bank.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The top 100 charities announced today span 27 states and Washington, 
      D.C., and promote a range of worthy causes from preventing domestic 
      violence and animal abuse to supporting youth arts education and youth 
      leadership programs. These grants will also be used for charities 
      helping the homeless, providing affordable housing for the economically 
      disadvantaged and funding research to cure and raise awareness about a 
      range of medical disorders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Facebook users have spoken and voted for some truly incredible and 
      deserving charities. We are delighted that Chase will make a 
      contribution to each of these worthy causes,&#8221; Kimberly Davis, president 
      of the JPMorgan Chase Foundation, said. &#8220;We continue to be inspired by 
      the number of outstanding charities that choose to participate in the 
      Chase program and the millions of fans who visit our Facebook page and 
      vote for them. The dedication and enthusiasm of the charities and their 
      supporters is one reason why Chase has committed $25 million for Chase 
      Community Giving to distribute to even more charities over the next two 
      years.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Round 2, these 100 organizations will have the option to submit a 
      &#8220;Big Idea&#8221; in 1,000 characters or less describing how they would use 
      $500,000 to further its cause. Charities can also submit a 30-second 
      video and five photos demonstrating their &#8220;Big Idea.&#8221; Beginning May 19, 
      Facebook users will vote again to select the best ideas among the top 
      100 charities. The 25 charities that receive the most votes will receive 
      between $20,000 and $500,000. The winners of Round 2 will be announced 
      on May 26. Here is the list of the top 100 charities from Round 1:

      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) achieved its safest year in company 
      history, reduced its total energy consumption by 33 percent compared 
      with 1992 levels, invested $197 million in communities around the world, 
      and spent more than $2 billion with small U.S. businesses, according to 
      the company's 2010 Corporate Responsibility Report issued today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Energy is essential to human progress &#8211; it creates jobs, fuels 
      innovation and powers virtually every element of the global economy,&#8221; 
      said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson. &#8220;Providing that 
      energy safely, reliably and economically is a great responsibility that 
      we take seriously.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s 2010 Corporate Responsibility Report highlights companywide 
      performance including safety, environmental stewardship, social 
      investments and human rights. Specific results in these categories 
      include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Chevron&#8217;s workforce had its safest year ever, reducing its Total 
        Recordable Incident Rate by 10 percent and Days Away From Work Rate by 
        40 percent when compared with 2009.
      
			
        Chevron reduced its total energy consumption by 33 percent compared 
        with 1992 levels. In addition, Chevron Energy Solutions&#8217; projects 
        reduced energy use by an average of nearly 30 percent for its 
        customers.
      
			
        Chevron contributed $197 million in social investments, mainly in 
        health, education and economic development in 2010. Examples of 
        significant investments include the following.

        
					
						Health: Chevron&#8217;s initial $30 million investment in the 
            Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria helped reach 
            as many as 3.4 million people through HIV/AIDS prevention programs 
            between 2008 and 2010. Chevron has extended its commitment to the 
            Global Fund with an additional $25 million.
          
					
						Education: Chevron&#8217;s California Partnership expanded 
            investments in science, technology, engineering and math 
            education, reaching more than 245,000 students and 3,900 teachers. 
            In addition, Chevron provided approximately $18 million in funding 
            through its University Partnership Program to help further develop 
            the professionals who will be needed in the energy industry.
          
					
						Economic Development: Chevron launched the Niger Delta 
            Partnership Initiative, with an initial investment of $50 million 
            for economic development, conflict resolution and capacity 
            building in the region.
          
				
			
			
        Chevron&#8217;s support of small businesses in regions where the company 
        operates is part of its economic development efforts. During 2010 in 
        the United States alone, Chevron spent $2 billion with small U.S. 
        businesses. Chevron spent $364 million on products and services with 
        women-owned businesses and $254 million with minority-owned businesses.
      
			
        Through ongoing stakeholder engagement, Chevron is promoting respect 
        for global human rights. To emphasize its own commitment, Chevron 
        developed plans and provided resources to implement its Human Rights 
        Policy. The Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index gave 
        Chevron a 100 percent rating for the sixth consecutive year.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We recognize that business success is deeply linked to society&#8217;s 
      progress,&#8221; added Watson. &#8220;Our investments in communities &#8211; developed in 
      partnership with those communities &#8211; also are investments in the 
      long-term success of our company.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s ninth annual Corporate Responsibility Report demonstrates 
      Chevron&#8217;s focus on creating mutual benefit and shared progress in seven 
      geographic areas where some of its most important projects are located.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Western Australia: Chevron&#8217;s
				strong environmental 
        performance has allowed the company to expand operations, resulting in 
        benefits to its business and the Australian economy. Through its 
        Gorgon Project, the company expects approximately 10,000 jobs to be 
        created at peak construction and an estimated $56 billion to flow into 
        Australia&#8217;s gross domestic product.
      
			
				Angola: Chevron&#8217;s partnerships in Angola focus on improving 
        livelihoods and fostering a stable operating environment. Chevron 
        supported a program to vaccinate approximately 624,000 people against 
        an outbreak of polio, provided technical assistance and microfinancing 
        to local businesses and helped launch an entrepreneurship curriculum 
        for students. Through Chevron&#8217;s partnership with Banco Africano de 
        Investimentos Micro Finan&#231;as, micro and small entrepreneurs received 
        $9.9 million.
      
			
				Richmond, California: Chevron and the community are continuing 
        to work together to overcome challenges. Chevron granted $3.7 million 
        to local nonprofits to meet needs in education, economic development 
        and job training. Chevron&#8217;s Richmond Refinery has reduced regulated 
        air emissions by 70 percent since the 1970s, which includes a decrease 
        in flaring by more than 97 percent since 2007. In addition, more than 
        60 percent of the water used daily at the Richmond Refinery is treated 
        or reclaimed.
      
			
				Kazakhstan: Supporting local suppliers and developing a skilled 
        workforce is fostering beneficial economic and social change. 
        Tengizchevroil, in which Chevron is a 50 percent partner, has spent 
        $645 million on social programs since 1993.
      
			
				U.S. Gulf of Mexico: Combining technological expertise with a 
        culture of safe, efficient and reliable operations has positioned 
        Chevron as a leader in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Following the BP 
        Macondo incident, Chevron demonstrated this leadership by leading the 
        joint-industry task force to raise industry standards to even higher 
        levels. It also responded to community needs by providing $10 million 
        to five Gulf Coast community organizations that participated in 
        environmental and economic relief.
      
			
				Nigeria: In addition to the Niger Delta Partnership Initiative, 
        Chevron contributed more than $10 million to eight new projects, whose 
        benefits now reach more than 400 communities and involve more than 
        600,000 people.
      
			
				Indonesia: Chevron continued to
				strengthen economic 
        opportunities that benefit local communities through microfinance, 
        training and support programs for farmers and continued sponsorship of 
        polytechnic universities in Aceh and Riau provinces. Chevron&#8217;s 
        Local Business Development Program has helped participants grow their 
        businesses from $1.3 million in 2001 to more than $123 million in 2010.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc has just a few more months to put its stamp on the Volcker rule, and it is not wasting any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rule, designed to limit banks from speculating with their own money, will cost Goldman at least $3.7 billion in annual revenue, by one estimate. And billions more could be at stake if regulations now being drawn up are extra-tough.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule was one of the main topics on the agenda when Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein met recently with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Mary Schapiro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street chiefs do not often lobby top regulators directly, but this issue is unusually important to Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're totally freaked out about Volcker," said a Goldman lobbyist who declined to speak on the record for fear of losing the contract. "People are working on that a lot, with agency staff, with lawmakers, you name it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, lobbying disclosures show Goldman representatives have been working both sides of the political aisle and meeting with top officials in the White House and regulatory agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One big area of concern for Goldman is that regulators who are interpreting the Volcker rule will severely limit the amount of time a bank can hold a security or derivative. Positions held long term can be backstairs bets on markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Volcker rule is not the only element of financial reform that Goldman is resisting. Important issues on its lobbying docket also include derivatives reform, capital requirements and bonus restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other bank heads, including Morgan Stanley's James Gorman, have met Schapiro about the Volcker rule. But the provision is most important for Goldman, whose business is far more weighted toward trading, three lobbying sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ALL STAR TEAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has hired an all-star team of lobbyists and former government officials, leveraging powerful connections to get its message across to regulatory and political leaders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before the crisis, Goldman was basically non-existent in Washington," said a former Congressional staffer who now works as a policy analyst at a Wall Street bank. "Post-crisis, Goldman is everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under last year's Dodd-Frank law, regulators have until July to come up with specific rules for implementing the Volcker provision, meaning banks have limited time to try to shape the regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adding to the complexity of lobbying efforts is the number of parties involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC and four other regulators are in the process of writing separate versions of the Volcker rule, which must then be reconciled and shaped into a single set of regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Volcker is the subject of a very quiet, closed-door battle right now, not just between us and Wall Street, but among the agencies as well," said Bart Naylor, who has lobbied regulators for consumer-rights coalition Americans for Financial Reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman Stephen Cohen declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The impending changes have already spurred Goldman to dismantle much of its "proprietary trading" operations, which trade for the bank's own account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These operations were some of the bank's most profitable, and their closure will erase about $3.7 billion in revenue and $1.5 billion in profit annually, according to an estimate by JPMorgan Cazenove analyst Kian Abouhossein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By Abouhossein's reckoning, the bank gets another $17 billion of revenue from "market making," or linking up buyers and sellers across global markets. That revenue could also be squeezed, depending how stringent the regulations are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those figures represent about 65 percent of Goldman's annual revenue, according to Abouhossein's estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawmakers say the Volcker rule will ensure that big banks are not gambling in markets, and that taxpayers will not be left on the hook when their bets backfire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Implementing the Volcker rule will be tricky, though. When a bank buys a security from a client, it is difficult for a regulator to determine whether the bank is serving the client or betting on the market itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Limiting holding periods could be a simple way to ensure that banks are not making secret bets under the guise of helping clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOING LONG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman argues that holding on to securities for a long period of time can be a crucial part of trading on behalf of customers because assets trade infrequently in some markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A substantial amount of the securities that Goldman trades seems to fall into the longer-term category. In a February presentation, Goldman said it held about a third of the securities and listed derivatives on its trading books for three months or more, and 8 percent for more than a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank did not disclose how long it holds unlisted derivatives positions, where it also has significant exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is also advocating that regulators exclude currency contracts from the Volcker rule, in addition to Treasury bills and interest-rate swaps, which were excluded in the law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They definitely don't want their entire book to be micro-managed by the SEC," said a regulatory consultant who once worked at Goldman and is familiar with its lobbying efforts. "They want as much -- I wouldn't say self-policing -- but as much flexibility as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the years following the crisis, Washington has been reshaping the financial industry in an effort to prevent another collapse. Goldman has in turn been trying to shape the legislative and regulatory process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The intensity of its efforts is evident in at least one concrete way: the amount of money it is spending on lobbying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That figure totaled $1.32 million in the first quarter of 2011. That's 15 percent higher than the same period a year ago, putting the bank on course to break its annual record for lobbying expenditure of $4.61 million, set in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're a big and powerful company with a lot riding on financial reform," said Dave Levinthal, editor of OpenSecrets.org, which tracks lobbying and campaign spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When monumental legislation like Wall Street reform gets passed, it's not only about the legislation when it's coursing through Congress, but how it's being implemented."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Wall Street, where a bank can earn billions of dollars a year, a $5 million lobbying budget may seem paltry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Washington it's a lot of money. And relative to revenue, Goldman's spending is exponentially higher than that of its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has hired an all-star stable of Washington lobbying heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Paese, former deputy staff director for the U.S. House Financial Services Committee, heads its internal lobbying group. His team includes former staffers from the U.S. Senate Banking Committee, the White House and regulatory agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of its own payroll, Goldman also has several high-profile legislative veterans working on its behalf in Washington, hailing from both sides of the political aisle. Among them are former Republican lawmaker Trent Lott, former Democratic lawmaker John Breaux and former Democratic House Majority Leader Dick Gephardt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is common for large companies to seek influence in government, but old hands in Washington say Goldman stands out both in its wide network of high-level contacts and its ability to leverage those relationships to its advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The individuals at Goldman have been incredibly powerful over time," says Hillary Sale, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis who specializes in Wall Street regulation. "When you're a consumer, it gives you the creeps thinking about that kind of influence over regulation. But from the bank's side, it's a perfectly smart strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story was corrected in paragraph 22 to correct John Breaux's party affiliation)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dan Wilchins and Ted Kerr)&lt;/p&gt;

writing separate versions of the Volcker rule, which must then
be reconciled and shaped into a single set of regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Volcker is the subject of a very quiet, closed-door battle

Democratic lawmaker John Breaux and former Democratic House
Majority Leader Dick Gephardt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is common for large companies to seek influence in
government, but old hands in Washington say Goldman stands out
both in its wide network of high-level contacts and its ability
to leverage those relationships to its advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The individuals at Goldman have been incredibly powerful
over time," says Hillary Sale, a law professor at Washington
University in St. Louis who specializes in Wall Street
regulation. "When you're a consumer, it gives you the creeps
thinking about that kind of influence over regulation. But from
the bank's side, it's a perfectly smart strategy."

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The European Commission Approves Pfizer&#8217;s Revatio&#174; 
      (sildenafil)
				for the Treatment of Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension 
      in Children
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Indication Specifically for use in Pediatric Patients Based on 
      Largest Placebo-Controlled Study Conducted in this Population
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced that Revatio&#174; (sildenafil citrate) has 
      been approved by the European Commission for the treatment of pediatric 
      patients aged 1 to 17 years old with pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
      Efficacy in terms of improvement of exercise capacity or pulmonary 
      hemodynamics has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and 
      pulmonary hypertension associated with congenital heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare, devastating disease that can 
      affect children," said Dr. Cara Cassino, vice president, Pfizer 
      Medicines Development Group. &#8220;With the approval of Revatio, these young 
      patients now have an important treatment option that may help manage 
      their condition. This approval is another example of our ongoing 
      commitment to rare diseases.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The approval was based on results of a dose-ranging phase 3 study that 
      evaluated the efficacy and safety of Revatio versus placebo in 234 
      pediatric patients with primary pulmonary hypertension or pulmonary 
      hypertension associated with congenital heart disease. The primary 
      endpoint was improvement from baseline in exercise capacity as assessed 
      by change in peak volume of oxygen consumption (peak VO2) 
      following 16 weeks of treatment. In children who were deemed 
      developmentally unable to perform the test due to young age or the 
      presence of other conditions, efficacy was assessed using secondary 
      endpoints, including hemodynamics and change in WHO functional class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Estimated change in peak VO2 in evaluable patients receiving 
      any dose of Revatio was 7.71 percent (95 percent confidence interval: 
      -0.19 percent to 15.60 percent, P=0.056). Dose-related 
      improvements in pulmonary vascular resistance index (PVRI) and mean 
      pulmonary arterial pressure (mPAP) were observed in patients treated 
      with Revatio, and improvements in cardiac index were observed with all 
      three Revatio groups over placebo. Of 120 patients who were WHO 
      functional class II, III or IV at baseline who received Revatio, 32 
      improved by one functional class, and one subject improved by two 
      functional classes. Four of the 35 patients in the placebo group 
      improved by one functional class.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The adverse reaction profile seen in this pediatric study was generally 
      consistent with that in adults with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
      taking Revatio. Most adverse events were of mild to moderate severity 
      and were consistent with the known pharmacology of phosphodiesterase-5 
      inhibitors, the class of medications to which Revatio belongs. The most 
      common adverse reactions observed in patients treated with Revatio were 
      vomiting, cough, pyrexia, nausea, lower abdominal pain, upper abdominal 
      pain and photophobia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pulmonary arterial hypertension is a rare, progressive disease 
      characterized by high blood pressure in the pulmonary arteries, leading 
      to heart failure and premature death. Pulmonary arterial hypertension 
      can occur with no known underlying cause, or it can be found in 
      association with other disorders such as connective tissue disease or 
      congenital heart disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For pediatric patients, Revatio will be available as an extemporaneously 
      prepared oral suspension compounded from Revatio 20 mg tablets and 
      recommended diluents. Revatio is also available in oral and I.V. 
      formulations for the treatment of adults with pulmonary arterial 
      hypertension.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Revatio was first approved by the European Commission in October 2005 
      for the treatment of adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension 
      classified as WHO functional class II and III, to improve exercise 
      capacity. Efficacy has been shown in primary pulmonary hypertension and 
      pulmonary hypertension associated with connective tissue disease. 
      Revatio is approved for the treatment of pediatric pulmonary arterial 
      hypertension only in the EU, with applications pending in other 
      countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since its initial regulatory approval in 2005, Revatio has been approved 
      and launched in more than 50 countries and has amassed more than 100,000 
      patient-years of experience.

&lt;p&gt; * Public sector, telecoms will also be key focus areas-exec&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * See growth from smaller cities-exec
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE May 5 (Reuters) - IBM will focus on
providing its services to the banking, infrastructure and public
sectors along with its key telecom sector in India, a
significant market for the world's largest technology services
firm, the chief of its Indian unit said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, IBM topped expectations for first-quarter profit
and revenue, partially driven by strong performance in the
red-hot markets of Brazil, Russia, India and China, where
revenue was up a combined 26 percent over a year earlier.
[ID:nN1959077]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company already has a strong presence in India's
telecommunications sector with clients including Bharti Airtel
 and Idea Cellular .	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are also now focusing on several other industries like
banking and public sector and in the infrastructure space,
particularly in the airports and energy utility area," IBM
India's Managing Director Shanker Annaswamy told a media
briefing on Thursday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has already won contracts from State Bank of India
 , the Indian Railways, the Delhi and Hyderabad
international airports among others, he added.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company will also look to build its presence in the
smaller cities of India, where it sees growth, he said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Another area where we see very big potential and is yet to
be tapped is outside of the metro towns," he said. "The next
level of towns are big enough for creating business
opportunities."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM provides strong competition to home-grown software
services exporters -- Tata Consultancy Services ,
Infosys Technologies Ltd and Wipro , who lead
India's near-$60 billion IT outsourcing sector.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Indian companies have planned wage hikes of up to 15
percent to keep employees from being poached by firms like IBM
and Accenture , even as they battle the technology giants
for contracts.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, IBM won a 10-year contract from Bharti to manage
the computing technology and services that run the Indian firm's
mobile networks in 16 African countries. Bharti acquired the
networks last year from Zain .	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM also manages Bharti's IT infrastructure in India in a
10-year deal, which began in 2004 and had an initial value of
about $750 million.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM's operations in India include providing hardware,
middleware and technology services, back-office services,
consulting and research and development.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Portland General Electric Reports First Quarter 2011 Financial 
      Results and Increases 2011 Guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Portland General Electric Company (NYSE: POR)
			today reported net 
      income of $69 million, or $0.92 per diluted share, for the first quarter 
      of 2011, compared to $27 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, for the 
      first quarter of 2010, an increase of $42 million. Improved operating 
      results were primarily driven by the combination of higher retail 
      revenues and lower power costs. PGE is increasing its 2011 earnings 
      guidance by $0.10 per diluted share to $1.90 to $2.05, primarily due to 
      improved power supply operations, including the effects of favorable 
      hydro conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Retail revenues increased $43 million, or 10%, in the first quarter of 
      2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to a 10% 
      increase in retail energy deliveries. Cooler weather and increased 
      production by certain customers in the paper and high technology sectors 
      were the primary factors contributing to the increase in retail energy 
      deliveries. Residential deliveries increased 12% and commercial and 
      industrial deliveries combined increased 8% in the first quarter of 2011 
      compared to the first quarter of 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Purchased power and fuel expense decreased $30 million, or 13%, in the 
      first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily 
      from a 19% decrease in average variable power cost. During the first 
      quarter of 2011, energy received from hydroelectric resources increased 
      40% from the first quarter of 2010, and was 16% above normal, compared 
      to 21% below normal in the first quarter of 2010. Favorable hydro 
      conditions resulted in an abundant supply of power from hydroelectric 
      plants in the region and contributed to lower wholesale power prices. 
      Lower-cost power purchased in the wholesale market and increased power 
      provided by the Company&#8217;s hydro resources economically displaced a 
      significant amount of PGE&#8217;s thermal generation. Thermal generation 
      represented 24% of PGE&#8217;s total system load in the first quarter of 2011, 
      compared to 50% in the first quarter of 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Strong operational performance and favorable weather drove results for 
      the quarter,&#8221; said Jim Piro, President and Chief Executive Officer. &#8220;We 
      are making progress with the implementation of our Integrated Resource 
      Plan which outlines strategies to meet our customers&#8217; electricity needs 
      over the next 20 years. This future portfolio of resources offers the 
      best combination of cost and risk, and will deliver on our obligation to 
      provide value to our shareholders, customers and the communities we 
      serve.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Integrated Resource Plan
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Public Utility Commission of Oregon has approved the selection of an 
      independent evaluator for the request for proposals (RFPs) to be issued 
      in 2011 pursuant to PGE&#8217;s Integrated Resource Plan. The RFPs expected to 
      be issued in 2011 include (1) year-round flexible and peaking resources 
      of approximately 200 megawatts, as well as approximately 200 megawatts 
      of bi-seasonal (winter and summer) peaking supply and approximately 150 
      megawatts of winter-only peaking supply, (2) new renewable resources of 
      approximately 120 average megawatts, and (3) baseload, high-efficiency 
      combined-cycle natural gas generation of approximately 300 to 500 
      megawatts. The Company plans to submit its own proposals for the 
      construction of these resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, PGE continues to work with other stakeholders in the 
      region on a double-circuit, 200-mile, 500&#160;kV transmission project, 
      Cascade Crossing. PGE has signed Memorandums of Understanding with 
      several parties concerning Cascade Crossing and is actively engaged in 
      the federal, state and tribal permitting process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			First Quarter Operating Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Revenues increased $35 million, or 8%, in the first quarter of 2011 
        compared to the first quarter of 2010, primarily due to:
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#9702; A $43 million, or 10%, increase in Retail revenues, largely resulting 
      from:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        A $41 million increase related to the volume of retail energy sold. 
        During the first quarter of 2011, energy deliveries to residential 
        customers increased 12% and energy deliveries to industrial and 
        commercial customers combined increased 8%. The increase in 
        residential deliveries was primarily due to cooler temperatures, while 
        the increase in commercial and industrial deliveries was due primarily 
        to production increases by certain customers in the paper and high 
        technology sectors.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a weather adjusted basis, retail energy deliveries increased 3.1% in 
      the first quarter of 2011, compared to the first quarter of 2010, and 
      are expected to be approximately 1% higher for the year 2011 compared to 
      the year 2010;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        A $14 million increase related to a 3% increase in average retail 
        prices, resulting primarily from the Company&#8217;s 2011 General Rate Case, 
        which became effective January 1, 2011; and
      
			
        A $15 million decrease related to the customer refund of certain tax 
        credits, the decoupling mechanism, and the Company&#8217;s power cost 
        adjustment mechanism.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#9702; An $8 million, or 38%, decrease in Wholesale revenues, consisting of 
      an 18% decrease in sales volume and a 32% decrease in average price.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Purchased power and fuel expense decreased $30 million, or 13%, in the 
        first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010, 
        consisting of a 19% decrease in average variable power cost, partially 
        offset by a 6% increase in total system load. The average variable 
        power cost decreased to $33.94 per MWh in the first quarter of 2011 
        from $41.65 per MWh in the first quarter of 2010. During the first 
        quarter of 2011, a significant amount of thermal generation was 
        economically displaced with purchased power and increased energy 
        received from hydro resources. Energy received from hydro resources 
        increased 40% from the first quarter of 2010 and was approximately 16% 
        above normal in the first quarter of 2011, compared to 21% below 
        normal in the first quarter of 2010.
      
			
        Administrative and other expense increased $7 million, or 16%, in the 
        first quarter of 2011 compared to the first quarter of 2010 largely 
        due to increased incentive compensation, pension expense and

        Income taxes increased $12 million in the first quarter of 2011 
        compared to the first quarter of 2010 primarily due to higher taxable

			2011 Earnings Guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PGE is increasing 2011 earnings guidance from the previously reported 
      range of $1.80 to $1.95 per diluted share to $1.90 to $2.05 per diluted 
      share. The guidance change primarily reflects favorable regional hydro 
      conditions and lower costs for purchased power.

&lt;p&gt;May 6 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan raised oil price forecasts
for the rest of 2011 and 2012, a day after prices plunged an
unprecedented $12 a barrel, as the bank expects tight supplies
to offset economic headwinds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank raised its Brent LCOc1 forecast for the third
quarter to $130 a barrel from $108, for the fourth quarter to
$120 a barrel from $108 and overall 2011 forecast to $120 a
barrel from $110.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan expects WTI CLc1 to average $109.5 per barrel
in 2011, up from its previous forecast of $99. It projects
Brent averaging $120 a barrel and WTI averaging $114 a barrel
in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said its current supply and demand projections
show a supply shortfall of 600,000 barrels per day (kbd) in the
third quarter, even assuming that OPEC increases output by 1.2
million barrels per day (mbd) in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the deficit could narrow to just 300 kbd by the
fourth quarter, that narrowing would depend heavily on
additional output increases by Saudi Arabia to 9.5 mbd, Angola
to 1.7 mbd, and Iraq to 3.0 mbd by the end of the year, the
bank said.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs, which in April predicted this week's major correction in oil prices, said on Friday that oil could surpass its recent highs by 2012 as global oil supplies continue to tighten.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank, seen as one of the most influential in commodity markets, said it did not rule out a further short-term fall after Thursday's near record drop, especially if economic data continued to disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank reaffirmed its traditional long-term bullish view of oil, helping crude to pare some of its earlier heavy losses on Friday. And it wasn't alone: JP Morgan took the bold step of raising its oil price forecasts for this year by $10, becoming the most bullish of 27 forecasts in a Reuters poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While financial bushfires or perhaps a rapid resolution to the Libyan civil war could radically alter market dynamics, the balance of both risks and fundamentals still points to a supply-constrained world," JP Morgan analysts, including Lawrence Eagles said in a note late on Friday. They said oil would rise to $130 in the third quarter to check demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, meanwhile, stuck largely to the same view it first aired three weeks ago -- a medium-term correction followed by a renewed ascent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is important to emphasize that even as oil prices are pulling back from their recent highs, we expect them to return to or surpass the recent highs by next year," Goldman Sachs' analysts said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to believe that the oil supply-demand fundamentals will tighten further over the course of this year, and likely reach critically tight levels by early next year should Libyan oil supplies remain off the market," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil prices remained extremely volatile on Friday, roiled by better than expected U.S. jobs data, which eased fears about global economic recovery that contributed to a 10-percent price crash on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it believed this week's correction in oil prices, which fell from above $125 per barrel of Brent crude to below $106 on Friday, was sparked by disappointing economic data releases and U.S. oil inventory data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The sell-off yesterday (May 5) has likely removed a large portion of the risk premium that we believe has been embedded in oil prices, which could suggest further downside may be limited from here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 12:30 p.m. EDT (1630 GMT), Brent crude oil was up $1.05 at $111.85 a barrel, having earlier hit a 2-1/2 month low of $105.15. U.S. crude was down 5 cents at $99.75 a barrel, having earlier dropped to $94.63 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROCKING MARKETS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman rocked markets in April by calling a nearly $20 fall in Brent, saying speculators had pushed prices ahead of fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was one of the first banks to predict $100 oil last decade, in 2005 when prices were closer to $50 a barrel, but it stayed bullish for some time after oil peaked at $147 in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In terms of timing, Goldman got it (the crash) right this time. Well done," said an oil trader with a major rival bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It (this week's fall) was a move driven by macro funds after U.S. and German data disappointed and (European Central Bank President Jean-Claude) Trichet did not deliver on yet another rate rise," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Asian funds having liquidated some of their position today I think we will now see prices stabilizing he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan, which last raised its forecasts in late March, is now predicting $120 a barrel for Brent in both 2011 and 2012. It has averaged about $110 a barrel so far this year, but fell by a record more than $16 this week, closing below $110 a barrel for only the second time since Libyan exports were cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOOD BUYING OPPORTUNITY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's short-term view was rejected by many of its banking rivals back in April, with both Barclays Capital and Morgan Stanley arguing there was little evidence higher prices were causing demand destruction in the United States, the world's largest oil consumer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Barclays Capital and Deutsche Bank said on Friday the current levels might be a good buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While further downside from potential weaker macro releases cannot be ruled out, the general trend from here should be higher, rather than lower, in our view," said Amrita Sen, an oil analyst at Barclays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added that worries about tight supplies and unrest in the Middle East will outweigh concerns about U.S. gasoline demand destruction or slower Asian demand due to inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank commented: "We believe composure will return to commodity markets as underlying fundamentals remain bullish in our view... We believe the collapse in oil prices this week is more a positioning event than a change underlying fundamentals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Andrew Moorfield, the head of oil division at Lloyds, said he saw oil at around $110 in 2011 and $100-$110 going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite this week, the demand curve for oil remains with an upward trajectory... Globally, this general fall in commodities prices will reduce the drag many were starting to think they were having on economic growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colin O'Shea, head of commodities at Hermes, who helps manage over $2 billion, also said the correction was a good opportunity for investors to get into the market if they missed out on the previous rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fundamentally, in the energy space and in crude oil, not a lot has actually changed. We have got diminishing spare capacity, globally demand is picking up, we have got some supply-side issues -- so the factors that caused the price rises right throughout 2010 are still there," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Dmitry Zhdannikov, additional reporting by Claire Milhench and Ratul Ray Chaudhuri in Bangalore, editing by Anthony Barker, Alden Bentley and Sofina Mirza-Reid)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JERSEY CITY, New Jersey (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein was in good spirits on Friday at his firm's annual meeting, despite battling some testy shareholders and what seemed to be a cold.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street chieftain sipped water and blew his nose through the two-hour proceedings, and declined to shake one investor's hand after the meeting for fear of spreading germs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But while Blankfein might have preferred chicken soup over the continental breakfast on display, his demeanor remained strong and, some might say, resilient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After weeks of questions in press reports about his future, the 56-year-old head of Wall Street's most powerful investment bank put to rest any speculation that he might soon be stepping down because he was tired after leading Goldman through the financial crisis and its aftermath.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein said any suggestion that he is about to leave Goldman Sachs is "all made up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged Goldman with civil fraud last year over a derivative deal at the height of the financial crisis. Goldman settled those charges for $550 million in July, but faced renewed scrutiny recently following a scathing report from a Senate committee. The Justice Department is now considering the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are very mindful of the stresses and strain that led to the financial crisis and have no desire to go back to that place," Blankfein said at Goldman's towering office building in Jersey City, New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's chief counsel, Gregory Palm, told shareholders the firm spent more than $700 million on legal costs last year. It has also hired more lawyers, with 286 working full time for Goldman now, versus 252 a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were a few tense moments during the meeting as shareholders criticized pay packages, political contributions and even Goldman's activities related to climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, for the most part, the atmosphere was cordial and Blankfein spent a good deal of the meeting engaged in light banter with a handful of somewhat eccentric shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those launching attacks at Blankfein were a nun, the head of a Jewish social activist group, renewable energy advocates and two gadflies, Evelyn Davis and Harry Korba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis, who has built a reputation for getting under executives' skin, spent the first portion of the meeting demanding Blankfein's resignation and comparing him unfavorably to his predecessor, Henry Paulson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, she assured Blankfein, "I really don't dislike you. You're not a bad-looking guy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein furrowed his brow and twisted his lips into a smirk as Davis said her piece. At one point, he corrected her to point out that Goldman's share price reached its height of above $250 under his tenure, not Paulson's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It happened after Hank left, but who is counting these things?" he scoffed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHAREHOLDER PROPOSALS DEFEATED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has taken some heat for awarding Blankfein a $5.4 million bonus for 2010 despite a share price decline of 38 percent. His overall compensation rose to $14.1 million from $1 million the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, proposals to restrict executives' ability to sell stock compensation and to issue a report examining compensation practices both failed, with 20.6 percent and 4.1 percent approval, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders approval of executives' 2011 compensation packages declined to 73 percent of the vote from 96 percent a year ago, but still had a significant majority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a preliminary vote count, each of Goldman's directors won re-election, with more than 90 percent of votes. None of the six shareholder proposals that made it onto the proxy gained enough support to pass.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The meeting was more sparsely attended than usual, with about 135 people in a large conference room. They munched on bagels, croissants and fruit from the breakfast spread, with some drinking coffee or water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Discussing the event briefly with reporters, Blankfein joked that if "aliens came down from outer space" and only got a chance to see the cast of characters at Goldman's annual meeting, they would have a distorted view of the human race.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein has spent 25 years at Goldman Sachs and been in his current role since mid-2006. Corporate governance experts and analysts have said that it would not be unusual for a CEO to move on after a five-year term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet some observers point out that Blankfein might want to make sure Goldman's reputation is more fully restored - and its share price more fully recovered - before he departs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock is more than three times above its crisis low, but is more than 2 percent below what it was when Blankfein took the reins. It closed down 0.20 percent at $150.10 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A reporter asked Blankfein why he wanted to remain in his position as chairman and CEO of a company that gets so much scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He quipped, "And give up all this?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Editing by John Wallace and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, N.C./WILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co is in advanced talks with U.S. regulators to resolve a probe into its role in selling subprime mortgage-backed bonds in 2007, a case that highlights a rare misstep by Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan disclosed in a regulatory filing on Friday that it was in talks with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to resolve the probe, which a source familiar with the situation said was about the bank's dealings with hedge fund Magnetar over the creation of collateralized debt obligations (CDOs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. bank by assets, and its chief executive, have avoided much of the mortgage controversy that has dogged competitors such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc, Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo  Co over the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mortgage backed securities and CDOs were at the heart of the crisis. Wall Street banks vacuumed up home loans, often subprime mortgages, and repackaged them into bonds and other securities that were sold with top-notch credit ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the U.S. housing market crashed, the securities plummeted in value, generating enormous losses for investors around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said a settlement with the SEC is unlikely to lead to long-term reputational damage for JPMorgan or Dimon, who has said all banks should not be put into the same basket when discussing the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every major player is going to go through this to some degree," said Matt McCormick, a portfolio manager with Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel.

JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is in advanced talks with U.S.
regulators to resolve a probe into its role in selling subprime
mortgage-backed bonds in 2007, a case that highlights a rare
misstep by Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan disclosed in a regulatory filing on Friday that it
was in talks with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
to resolve the probe, which a source familiar with the
situation said was about the bank's dealings with hedge fund
Magnetar over the creation of collateralized debt obligations
(CDOs).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. bank by assets, and its chief
executive, have avoided much of the mortgage controversy that
has dogged competitors such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N),
Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) over
the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mortgage backed securities and CDOs were at the heart of
the crisis. Wall Street banks vacuumed up home loans, often
subprime mortgages, and repackaged them into bonds and other
securities that were sold with top-notch credit ratings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the U.S. housing market crashed, the securities
plummeted in value, generating enormous losses for investors
around the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said a settlement with the SEC is unlikely to lead
to long-term reputational damage for JPMorgan or Dimon, who has

Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's disclosure comes a day after court documents
revealed the SEC had subpoenaed Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) for
documents related to home loan securitizations.
[ID:nN05244262]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC also subpoenaed JPMorgan this week for records
related to mortgage securitizations, according to Bloomberg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest subpoenas could indicate a further expansion of
the SEC probe into U.S. lenders' mortgage-related dealings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The SEC is taking a more active role in following up on
things that are happening in private litigation," said Thomas
Gorman, a partner at the law firm Dorsey  Whitney LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gorman said securities regulators' subpoenas may not be
part of a new investigation but an expansion of an on-going
probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MAGNETAR DEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan previously said it had received "a number of
subpoenas and informal requests" from federal and state
authorities over CDOs and mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recent government reports and lawsuits have accused traders
and bank executives of knowingly packaging dodgy loans into
bonds and other securities, at times even betting against the
bonds as they touted them to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC investigation centered around whether JPMorgan
adequately disclosed to investors that Magnetar helped to
select assets for the CDO deal while betting against parts of
it, The Financial Times reported in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan pulled back from the CDO market in 2005, but
re-entered the business and expanded in 2006, according to news
website ProPublica. JPMorgan and Magnetar agreed to a deal in
early 2007 to create and sell a $1.1 billion CDO, according to

&lt;p&gt;   * Coca-Cola had sued PepsiCo in trademark case&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Trop50, Simply juice packaging said to be too similar&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 6 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) and PepsiCo
Inc (PEP.N) have settled a trademark lawsuit over the latter's
packaging for its Trop50 line of fruit juices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. District Judge Sim Lake dismissed Coca-Cola's lawsuit
in an order issued Thursday, after both companies in court
papers said "all matters in dispute in this case have been
fully and finally resolved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an Oct. 28, 2010, complaint, Coca-Cola had accused
PepsiCo of copying the packaging for Trop50 from its Simply
line of fruit juices, which are sold in carafe-style bottles
that have tapered necks and oversized green caps.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola said the similarities would likely confuse
consumers, especially because the competing products are often
sold near each other on store shelves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terms of the settlement were not disclosed. A trial had
been set for June 13. Coca-Cola has said it introduced the
Simply line in 2001, and that annual sales top $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola is based in Atlanta and PepsiCo in Purchase, New
York. The lawsuit was filed in Houston because the Simply line
of juices was managed by Coca-Cola's Minute Maid unit, which
has offices in the Houston suburb of Sugar Land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Coca-Cola Co et al v. PepsiCo Inc et al, U.S.
District Court, Southern District of Texas, No. 10-04184.

&lt;p&gt;WARSAW May 6 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) has sold most of
its 4.2-percent stake in Poland's largest insurer PZU PZU.WA
via a number of small transactions since Feb.16, two independent
market sources said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's stake in PZU was worth about 1.35 billion zlotys
($496 million) according to market prices. Revenues from the
sale will, however, go to the Dutch insurer Eureko [EUREK.UL],
as stipulated by an agreement between the two entities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Since Feb.16, when the lock-up on PZU shares ended, JP
traded most of its shares on the market," one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan was not immediately available for comment, while
PZU, which debuted on the Warsaw bourse last year, declined to
comment.

 (Adds estimate of losses from legal proceedings, first-quarter
trading results)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 6 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is
in "advanced discussions" with the U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission to resolve a probe into its role in selling certain
collateralized debt obligations, the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second-largest U.S. bank made the statement in a
quarterly filing with the SEC on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan previously said it had received "a number of
subpoenas and informal requests" from federal and state
authorities over CDOs and mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the new filing, the bank estimated its maximum possible
losses from legal proceedings, in excess of established
reserves, at $4.5 billion as of March 31, unchanged from its
estimate for Dec. 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's litigation expense fell in the first quarter to
$1.1 billion from $2.9 billion a year earlier, largely due to
lower additions to its litigation reserve, according to the
filing. Litigation expenses in the fourth quarter were about
$2.2 billion, earlier company reports indicate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares were up 0.7 percent at $45.50 in late
morning trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said it made money trading every day of the first
quarter. Its average daily trading revenue was $112 million.

&lt;p&gt; * Says fall sparked by poor macroeconomic, inventories data&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman says oil may surpass recent highs by 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Barcap, Hermes say correction offers good chance to buy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds Deutsche Bank, Lloyds)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Dmitry Zhdannikov&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, May 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs, which in April
predicted this week's major correction in oil prices, said on
Friday that oil could surpass its recent highs by 2012 as global
oil supplies continue to tighten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street bank, seen as one of the most influential in
commodities business, said it did not rule out a further limited
short-term fall in oil prices if macro-economic data, which it
said had sparked this week's crash, continued to disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News of Goldman's mid-term outlook on Friday prompted a $1 a
barrel jump in oil prices, helping oil to pare some of its
earlier heavy losses. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices seesawed on Friday, turning positive on better
than expected U.S. jobs data, which eased fears about global
economic recovery that led to a 10-percent price crash on
Thursday [O/R].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is important to emphasize that even as oil prices are
pulling back from their recent highs, we expect them to
return to or surpass the recent highs by next year," Goldman
Sachs' analysts said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to believe that the oil supply-demand
fundamentals will tighten further over the course of this year,
and likely reach critically tight levels by early next year
should Libyan oil supplies remain off the market," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said it believed that this week's correction in oil
prices, which fell from above $125 per barrel of Brent crude to
below $106 LCOc1 on Friday, was sparked by disappointing
economic data releases and U.S. oil inventory data. [EIA/S]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The sell-off yesterday (May 5) has likely removed a large
portion of the risk premium that we believe has been embedded in
oil prices, which could suggest further downside may be limited
from here".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, we remain wary of potential further downside
should economic data releases in coming days continue to
disappoint, with the focus now turning to today's
(May 6) non-farm payroll report in the United States".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOOD BUYING OPPORTUNITY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman rocked markets in April by calling a nearly $20 fall
in Brent, saying speculators had pushed prices ahead of
fundamentals. [ID:nN12168871]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was one of the first banks to predict $100 oil last
decade, in 2005 when prices were closer to $50 a barrel, but it
stayed bullish for some time after oil peaked at $147 in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In terms of timing, Goldman got it (the crash) right this
time. Well done," said an oil trader with a major rival bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It (this week's fall) was a move driven by macro funds
after U.S. and German data disappointed and (European Central
Bank President Jean-Claude) Trichet did not deliver on yet
another rate rise," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With Asian funds having liquidated some of their position
today I think we will now see prices stabilising and even if
U.S. jobs data is poor this afternoon, I don't think it will
turn as horrible as yesterday," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other major commodity players among banks, Barclays Capital
and Deutsche Bank, said on Friday the current levels might be a
good buying opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While further downside from potential weaker macro releases
cannot be ruled out, the general trend from here should be
higher, rather than lower, in our view," said Amrita Sen, an oil
analyst at Barclays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She added that worries about tight supplies and unrest in
the Middle East will outweigh concerns about U.S. gasoline
demand destruction or slower Asian demand due to inflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank commented: "We believe composure will return
to commodity markets as underlying fundamentals remain bullish
in our view... We believe the collapse in oil prices this week
is more a positioning event than a change underlying
fundamentals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Andrew Moorfield, the head of oil division at Lloyds, said
he saw oil at around $110 in 2011 and $100-$110 going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Despite this week, the demand curve for oil remains with an
upward trajectory... Globally, this general fall in commodities
prices will reduce the drag many were starting to think they
were having on economic growth".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colin O'Shea, head of commodities at Hermes, who helps
manage over $2 billion, also said the correction was a good
opportunity for investors to get into the market if they missed
out on the previous rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Fundamentally, in the energy space and in crude oil, not a
lot has actually changed. We have got diminishing spare
capacity, globally demand is picking up, we have got some
supply-side issues -- so the factors that caused the price rises
right throughout 2010 are still there," he said.

			GTSO: Goldman Sachs Analyst Predicts &#8216;Severe&#8217; Rare Earths Deficit
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			GTSO Working to Help Supply Explosion in Global Rare Earth Demand
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Even as Green Technology Solutions, Inc. (OTCQB:GTSO) and others work 
      feverishly to develop new sources of rare earth elements around the 
      globe, Goldman Sachs predict higher prices and &#8220;severe&#8221; market deficits 
      for the valuable minerals this year and the next.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In a research note published Thursday, Goldman Sachs  Partners 
      Australia Pty analyst Malcolm Southwood said that the global rare earths 
      market likely faces a 18,734 metric-ton deficit of the rare metals this 
      year, equivalent to 13.2 percent of worldwide demand. This estimate 
      hinges on Goldman&#8217;s prediction that China, the world&#8217;s dominant producer 
      of rare earths, may reduce its export quotas for the elements yet again, 
      pushing prices higher still.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We envisage that the market for rare earths will remain in severe 
      deficit in 2011 and 2012, and that prices will trend higher over the 
      next 18 months,&#8221; Southwood said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      China holds approximately 30 percent of the world&#8217;s rare earths 
      deposits, but accounts for 95 percent of global output. Demand has risen 
      sharply for the rare elements recently due to their use in emerging 
      green technologies such as hybrid cars, wind turbines and solar panels. 
      In the past two years, China has curbed domestic rare earth output 
      growth and exports, opting instead to conserve its resources and protect 
      the environment. China set its rare earth export quota for the first 
      half of the year at 14,446 metric tons, down from 22,282 tons in 2010. 
      Further cuts appear likely.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We suspect that (Chinese) export quotas will shrink further,&#8221; Southwood 
      said. &#8220;We are of the view that rare earth prices have not yet peaked.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With global demand for rare earths at an all-time high and climbing, 
      companies such as GTSO have begun the development of new rare earth 
      mines outside of China in order to help keep supplies flowing. In the 
      past few months, GTSO has signed deals to help develop rare earth 
      deposits in Mongolia and the Republic of Congo in order to secure 
      critical supplies for technology manufacturers in South Korea, Japan and 
      the U.S. Additionally, earlier this week the company announced the 
      formation of a global strategic profit alliance with the Beijing Bullion 
      Transfer Group (BBTG), signaling an expansion in the company&#8217;s mining 
      strategy to include gold and other precious metals.

 (Follows alerts)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 6 (Reuters) - Rigel Pharmaceuticals Inc said
Pfizer Inc has returned the rights to Rigel's inhaled
asthma therapy, following the world's biggest drugmaker's
decision to exit research and development in the allergy and
respiratory therapeutic area.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2005, Rigel had licensed its portfolio of inhaled
inhibitors to Pfizer. A year later, Pfizer identified R343 as
the lead product candidate for treatment of allergic asthma.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rigel said it will assume the development of R343 and
expects to design a mid-stage clinical trial later this year.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is rare in our business that one has the opportunity to
develop an asset which is both promising and on which the
research and development has been as well done as the package
that Pfizer is transferring to us," Rigel Chief Executive James
Gower said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; R343 will now become Rigel's most advanced in-house project,
he added.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2007, Pfizer began the first in a series of early-stage
clinical trials of R343 in normal healthy adults, and then later
in mildly asthmatic adults.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rigel said initial results from these trials showed R343 to
be well tolerated and with beneficial improvement in both the
early- and late-phase asthmatic responses.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rigel shares closed at $8.09 on Thursday on Nasdaq.

notice filed with the U.S. National Response Center showed.

 The refinery said sulfur dioxide was sent to its safety

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN (Reuters) - Billionaire playboy Guenter Sachs, the German-born former husband of Brigitte Bardot, shot himself to death at his home in the Swiss resort of Gstaad at the age of 78, German television network ARD said Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a suicide note from Sachs distributed to Swiss and German media outlets by his family, Sachs said he had been suffering from a "hopeless illness" and that he felt he was losing his memory, ability to think and communicate clearly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That menace was for me always the lone criteria for putting an end to my life," Sachs said in the note. His family said it had been Sachs' "expressed wish" to have the note published after his death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family did not provide details on his death. But German media quoted Swiss police saying he shot himself to death on Saturday at his chalet in Switzerland. Sachs became a Swiss citizen in 1976.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sachs was the great-grandson of Adam Opel, the founder of the Opel car company. Thanks to his great wealth, Sachs was a high-profile member of the "jet set" in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sachs was romantically linked in the early 1960s with Iranian queen Soraya Esfandiary. He married Bardot in 1966, just weeks after they met. After their divorce three years later, Sachs married a former Swedish model, Mirja Larsson, in 1969.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sachs, who was born in the southern German town of Schweinfurt in 1932, was also known around the world as a photoGrapher, art collector and maker of documentary films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Erik Kirschbaum; editing by Ralph Boulton)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) are set to rebound even though the company is due to lose its exclusive hold on Lipitor, the world's best-selling drug, Barron's newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares fell 3 percent last week after the company reported lower first-quarter revenue, creating a prime buying opportunity, Barron's said in its May 8 edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's rheumatoid arthritis drug Tofacitinib, hit its pre-trial goals in two recent studies, which means it may be submitted for regulatory approval later this year and potentially be approved by 2012, said Barron's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would be key to offset the loss from the patent-expiration of Lipitor later this year, Barron's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares trade at more than nine times expected earnings and have a 4 percent dividend yield. One analyst told Barron's she had a $23 price target for the stock, which closed at $20.55 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Helen Kearney, editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

potentially be approved by 2012, said Barron's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This would be key to offset the loss from the
patent-expiration of Lipitor later this year, Barron's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares trade at more than nine times expected
earnings and have a 4 percent dividend yield. One analyst told
Barron's she had a $23 price target for the stock, which closed
at $20.55 on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;May 10 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is close to a
deal to buy Internet phone company Skype Technologies for $8.5
billion including debt, a source familiar with the situation
said on Monday.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A deal is expected to be announced as early as Tuesday
morning, the source said. The source declined to be named
because the talks are not public.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan are advising
Skype, the source said. Microsoft is not using advisers, the
source said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier, the Wall Street Journal reported news of the
potential deal.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft declined comment. Skype could not immediately be
reached for comment.

&lt;p&gt; * Judge says his rulings grounded in law, evidence&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Judge had blocked $18 billion judgment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chevron shares close 1.2 percent higher
 (Adds details from ruling, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. judge who has
temporarily blocked enforcement of an $18 billion judgment in
Ecuador against Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has rejected calls by
plaintiffs in that case to recuse himself for bias.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in Manhattan rejected
claims by two of the plaintiffs that he had prejudged the case,
which concerns pollution of the Amazon rain forest and has
spawned an 18-year worldwide legal battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judge said there was no objective reason to believe he
had been "anything less than entirely impartial," according to
his written ruling issued on Monday. He called his remarks and
rulings in the litigation "perfectly banal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaplan on March 7 issued a preliminary injunction to stop
the Ecuadorean plaintiffs from enforcing the judgment
[ID:nN07237039], and set a Nov. 14 trial date to decide whether
to make the injunction permanent. [ID:nN25225194]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Ecuadorean court had on Feb. 14 imposed the $18 billion
judgment as a result of environmental contamination from 1964
to 1992 by Texaco, which Chevron bought in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Julio Gomez, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, declined to
comment.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This was a meritless motion," said Randy Mastro, a partner
at Gibson, Dunn  Crutcher LLP in New York representing
Chevron. "Now we can get on with the important litigation ahead
to determine the enforceability or lack of enforceability of
the Ecuadorean judgment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KAPLAN SAYS RULINGS WELL-GROUNDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plaintiffs in the Ecuador case, known as the Lago Agrio
plaintiffs, said Texaco sickened residents, ruined their land,
and damaged forestry and rivers through the discharge of some
18 billion gallons of toxic water into the rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron had argued that Ecuador should handle further
cleanup, saying Texaco was released in 1998. The litigation is
the subject of a 2009 documentary, "Crude."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, San Ramon, California-based Chevron filed a
racketeering lawsuit in February against the two Lago Agrio
plaintiffs and dozens of other individuals. Among these was a
lead lawyer for the Lago Agrio plaintiffs, Steven Donziger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In seeking Kaplan's recusal, lawyers said Kaplan showed
bias including through such statements as "I know the game
here" in discussing one motion. They said Kaplan viewed the
litigation as "a scheme fabricated by the Ecuadorean
plaintiffs' counsel to hit Chevron as big as they can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kaplan said there was no basis for the contentions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Informed persons, knowing and understanding all of the
myriad and complex facts of these extensive proceedings, and
putting aside the rhetoric and other devices employed here by
the Lago Agrio plaintiffs' representatives, readily would see
that the court's rulings have been firmly grounded in the law
and the evidence," Kaplan wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares closed Monday up $1.21, or 1.2 percent, at
$104.09 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Chevron Corp v. Donziger et al, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-00691.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 9 (Reuters) - Indonesian state energy company
Pertamina is in talks to buy Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) 25
percent stake in an Angolan offshore oil block, the Wall Street
Journal said on Monday, citing a person familiar with the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; According to the Journal, Pertamina has bid around $3.5
billion for Exxon's share in Block 31, outbidding China's China
Petroleum  Chemical Corp (Sinopec Corp) (0386.HK) (600028.SS)
and India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp. (ONGC.BO)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Angolan official confirmed Pertamina is in talks with
Exxon Mobil to buy the stake, the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Production from the block is expected to start in 2012 and
top out at around 150,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BP Plc (BP.L) owns 26.7 percent and operates the block,
while Angola's national oil company Sonangol owns 20 percent of
the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil and Pertamina could not be immediately reached
for comment.

&lt;p&gt;  FORT WALTON BEACH, FL, May 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ResortQuest(R) by Wyndham Vacation Rentals, a leading provider of
full-service vacation condominiums and home rentals in the U.S.,
announced today the Billy Bowlegs Pirate Festival special, a generous
lodging discount that offers festival-goers up to 25 percent off select
accommodations.

    The first full weekend of each June, the Billy Bowlegs Pirate Festival
brings music and dance performances, interactive games for the kids,
living history demonstrations, a torchlight parade, and even a skirmish
between Billy Bowlegs' invading Pirate Krewe and the Mayor's Militia on
the shores of Fort Walton Beach, Fla. The family-friendly event will kick
off on Thursday, June 2 and run through Monday, June 6, 2011, at The
Landing Park.

    As a proud supporter of the Billy Bowlegs Pirate Festival, ResortQuest
Fort Walton Beach is offering up to 25 percent off stays of three nights
or more for festival attendees at eligible vacation rentals on Okaloosa

Wednesday, June 1 through Tuesday, June 7, 2011.

    "Located just across the water from Landing Park, ResortQuest's rental
properties on Okaloosa Island are convenient to all the swashbuckling
events, yet provide a restful escape when you're ready to wind down,"

Vacation Rentals, Northwest Florida. "Plus, you can't beat Okaloosa's
beachfront accommodations for watching the festival fireworks over the
Santa Rosa Sound." 

    Fort Walton Beach is an authentic beach town, with languid Southern charm
and down-home hospitality. Attractions such as an aquarium and a science
center appeal to families. Meanwhile, the boardwalk and public esplanade
lure couples and singles with cocktails and live music overlooking the
water.

    From humble beginnings as a water-skiing celebration organized by the
United States Junior Chamber (Jaycees) in 1953, the Billy Bowlegs Pirate
Festival has grown into a highly anticipated yearly event hosted by the
Greater Fort Walton Beach Chamber of Commerce. Admission is free for all
ages.

Park, with various related events happening in and around the Downtown
Fort Walton Beach area. The Mardi Gras-style Torchlight Parade takes

&lt;p&gt;  TAMPA, FL, May 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT) (TSX: WLT), the world's leading, publicly
traded "pure play" producer of metallurgical coal for the global steel
industry, announced today the execution of mineral leases for
approximately 75 million tons of recoverable Blue Creek coking coal
reserves in Tuscaloosa County, Ala. from a subsidiary of Chevron
Corporation (NYSE: CVX) ("Chevron"). Terms of the leases include royalty
rates consistent with existing coal lease agreements.

    "We are happy with the opportunities these leases present to grow our
reserve base and expand our footprint in Alabama," said Keith Calder,
chief executive officer of Walter Energy. "These reserves are an integral
portion of the last remaining block of Blue Creek coal reserves and pave
the way for a strategic opportunity to assemble approximately 170 million
tons of high quality coking coal reserves for the development of a new
underground longwall coking coal mine."

    The Company also announced the completion of Jim Walter Resources'
acquisition of Chevron's North River steam coal mine in Fayette County
and Tuscaloosa County, Ala. Total consideration for the purchase of the
North River mine included a small cash payment and the assumption of
certain liabilities, not material to the Company. The transaction is
expected to be neutral to slightly accretive to earnings in the first
year. 

    "The North River steam coal mine has approximately three years of
production remaining, all of which is under contract to local utilities,"
Calder added. "Importantly, the operation has approximately 350 skilled
and experienced miners, whom we'll be very happy to welcome into the
Walter Energy Alabama team."

			Pfizer&#8217;s Prevnar 13&#174; Meets All Study 
      Endpoints In Two Pivotal Phase 3 Trials In Adults Aged 50 And Older 
      Presented Today
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced that the data from its two 
      pivotal Phase 3 immunogenicity and safety trials of Prevnar 13&#174;*
				(Pneumococcal 
      13-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 Protein]) in 
      adults aged 50 years and older met all study endpoints. These studies 
      provide the clinical foundation for the regulatory filings that have 
      been submitted in the United States, the European Union and more than a 
      dozen other countries. The results are being presented today at the 21st 
      European Congress of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases and 
      the 27th International Congress of Chemotherapy (ECCMID/ICC) 
      in Milan, Italy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlighting the results, the data from both studies showed that Prevnar 
      13 was at least as immunogenic as the currently licensed nonconjugated 
      pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV) for the 12 serotypes common 
      to both vaccines in the age groups studied who were either pneumococcal 
      vaccine-na&#239;ve or previously immunized with PPSV. Furthermore, the 
      secondary endpoint data from both studies showed that Prevnar 13 
      elicited a statistically significantly higher functional antibody 
      response than PPSV against a majority of serotypes common to both 
      vaccines and serotype 6A, a serotype not contained in PPSV.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Both pivotal studies met their primary objectives and demonstrated that 
      Prevnar 13 was at least as immunogenic to PPSV for the 12 
      disease-causing serotypes common to both vaccines,&#8221; says Lisa A. 
      Jackson, MD, MPH, principal investigator, Group Health Research 
      Institute, Seattle, Washington. &#8220;The data also showed that Prevnar 13 
      induced significantly higher levels of functional antibodies than PPSV 
      in the adults studied for the majority of the common serotypes.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prevnar 13, which is based on the scientific foundation of Prevnar&#174; 
      (Pneumococcal 7-valent Conjugate Vaccine [Diphtheria CRM197 
      Protein]), was first introduced in December 2009 in Europe and is now 
      approved for use in infants and young children in more than 90 countries 
      worldwide. Prevnar 13, like Prevnar, uses company-pioneered conjugation 
      technology that has been shown to confer a high antibody response in 
      infants and toddlers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Prevnar 13 represents an important scientific achievement and we are 
      excited about the potential to further define its clinical utility with 
      the aim of broadening pneumococcal disease prevention efforts,&#8221; says 
      Emilio Emini, PhD, chief scientific officer, Vaccine Research, Pfizer 
      Inc. &#8220;Adults 50 years and older are a population at heightened risk for 
      pneumococcal disease, which imposes a significant public health and 
      economic burden worldwide.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pivotal Data:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The data being presented at ECCMID/ICC are from two pivotal studies in 
      the Prevnar 13 adult Phase 3 clinical trial program, which is comprised 
      of a total of six studies involving approximately 6,000 adults aged 50 
      years and older.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Study 004
			(Abstract #426) is a randomized, double-blind, 
      Phase 3 trial comparing the immunogenicity of a single dose of Prevnar 
      13 to that of a single dose of PPSV in 835 pneumococcal vaccine-na&#239;ve 
      adults aged 60 to 64 years. The study also included an additional group 
      of 404 adults aged 50 to 59 years who received open-label Prevnar 13. 
      For all subjects, serotype specific anti-pneumococcal opsonophagocytic 
      antibody (OPA) titers, also called functional antibodies, were measured 
      prior to vaccination, as well as at one month following vaccination. The 
      results showed that:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13 was at least as immunogenic as PPSV for all serotypes 
        common to both vaccines in the 60 to 64 year age group.

        
					
            In addition, one dose of Prevnar 13 in this age group induced a 
            functional antibody response that was statistically significantly 
            higher than that elicited by PPSV for the majority (8 of 12) of 
            serotypes common to both vaccines, as well as for serotype 6A, a 
            serotype included only in Prevnar 13.
          
				
			
			
        In the open-label phase of the study comparing the functional antibody 
        response following administration of Prevnar 13 in adults aged 50 to 
        59 years to adults aged 60 to 64 years, Prevnar 13 in the younger age 
        group was as immunogenic as Prevnar 13 in the older age group for all 
        vaccine serotypes contained in the vaccine. In addition, the antibody 
        response was statistically significantly higher for 9 of the 13 
        serotypes in adults aged 50 to 59 years compared to those aged 60 to 
        64 years.
      
			
        The tolerability and safety profile of Prevnar 13 was comparable to 
        PPSV for all age groups studied. Among subjects 60 to 64 years of age, 
        local reactions (e.g., swelling, redness, etc.) were reported by 82 
        percent of subjects in the Prevnar 13 group and by 76 percent of 
        subjects in the PPSV group (P=0.05).
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Study 3005 (Abstract #425) is a randomized, double-blind, 
      Phase 3 trial comparing the immunogenicity of Prevnar 13 to that of PPSV 
      in 938 adults 70 years of age and older who had previously been 
      vaccinated with PPSV at least five years earlier. At enrollment, 
      subjects were vaccinated with either Prevnar 13 or PPSV. One year later, 
      all subjects received a follow-on administration of Prevnar 13. For all 
      subjects, serotype specific anti-pneumococcal OPA titers were measured 
      prior to vaccination, as well as one month following each vaccination. 
      The results showed that:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The initial administration of Prevnar 13 was at least as immunogenic 
        as PPSV for all serotypes common to both vaccines.
      
			
        The functional antibody response elicited by Prevnar 13 was 
        statistically significantly higher than that elicited by PPSV for the 
        majority (10 of 12) of serotypes common to both vaccines, as well as 
        for serotype 6A, a serotype included only in Prevnar 13.
      
			
        A follow-on dose of Prevnar 13 administered one year later to subjects 
        who had received a first dose of Prevnar 13 was at least as 
        immunogenic as the initial dose of Prevnar 13 for all 13 serotypes; 
        however, when Prevnar 13 was administered one year after the study 
        dose of PPSV, the functional antibody response for the majority of 
        serotypes was less robust compared to a single dose of Prevnar 13.
      
			
        The functional antibody response after the follow-on administration of 
        Prevnar 13 in subjects who received an initial dose of Prevnar 13 
        compared with the Prevnar 13 response in subjects who had received an 
        initial study dose of PPSV was statistically significantly higher for 
        the majority (12 of 13) of serotypes.
      
			
        The tolerability and safety profiles of the two vaccine groups were 
        comparable. After the enrollment vaccination, local reactions were 
        reported by 57 percent of subjects in the Prevnar 13 group and by 64 
        percent of subjects in the PPSV group (P=0.03). After the Prevnar 13 
        dose given at one year, the frequency and severity of local reactions 
        were similar between the Prevnar 13/Prevnar 13 and the PPSV/Prevnar 13 
        sequence groups.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has submitted supplemental applications seeking regulatory 
      approval to expand the use of Prevnar 13 to adults aged 50 years and 
      older in more than 40 countries around the world with additional 
      submissions planned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pneumococcal Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pneumococcal disease is a group of illnesses caused by the bacterium Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae (S. pneumoniae), also known as pneumococcus.1 
      It includes invasive infections such as bacteremia, sepsis, and 
      meningitis, as well as non-invasive infections, such as pneumonia and 
      otitis media. Pneumococcal disease is a major cause of illness and death 
      in adults worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Indication for Prevnar 13 for Pediatric Use in 
      the United States
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the United States, Prevnar 13 is a vaccine approved for use in 
      children 6 weeks through 5 years of age (prior to the 6th 
      birthday). Prevnar 13 is indicated for active immunization for the 
      prevention of invasive disease caused by 13 strains of Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F). 
      Prevnar 13 is also indicated for the prevention of otitis media (ear 
      infection) caused by 7 strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae (4, 
      6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, and 23F). No efficacy data for ear infections are 
      available for strains 1, 3, 5, 6A, 7F, and 19A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information for Prevnar 13 for 
      Pediatric Use in the United States
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13 should not be given to anyone with a severe allergic 
        reaction to any component of Prevnar 13, Prevnar, or any diphtheria 
        toxoid&#8211;containing vaccine.
      
			
        Prevnar 13 may not protect all individuals receiving the vaccine. 
        Protection against ear infections is expected to be less than that for 
        invasive disease.
      
			
        Children with weakened immune systems may have a reduced immune 
        response to Prevnar 13.
      
			
        A temporary pause of breathing following vaccination has been observed 
        in some infants born prematurely.
      
			
        The most commonly reported serious adverse events include 
        bronchiolitis (an infection of the lungs) (0.9%, 1.1%), 
        gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and small intestine) 
        (0.9%, 0.9%), and pneumonia (0.9%, 0.5%) for Prevnar 13 and Prevnar, 
        respectively.
      
			
        The most common side effects are redness, swelling and tenderness at 
        the injection site, fever, decreased appetite, irritability, increased 
        sleep, and decreased sleep. Any side effects associated with the 
        vaccination should be reported to your child's health care provider.
      
			
        Ask your child's health care provider about the risks and benefits of 
        Prevnar 13. Only a health care provider can decide if Prevnar 13 is 
        right for your child.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co reported a rare results miss after "Mars Needs Moms" capped a disappointing quarter at the U.S. box office, sending its shares down 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Strong advertising growth at sports network ESPN and a rise in theme park sales and attendance -- despite a closure at its Tokyo resort after Japan's earthquake -- could not make up for a 13 percent plummet in studio entertainment revenue in the fiscal second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's popular parks and resorts like Disneyland also took a hit due to the timing of Easter holidays, which a year ago fell in its fiscal second quarter, but this year falls in the fiscal third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also recorded accounting charges from its acquisition of social gaming developer Playdom for $563 million last July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts say the largest U.S. media conglomerate, smarting from the disappointment of the heavily promoted but poorly attended animated film "Mars Needs Moms," can look forward to a strong summer with the fourth "Pirates of the Caribbean" installment and "Captain America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While I expect the stock to take somewhat of a hit, I would buy on the dip since they will have a strong summer with these blockbuster movies and the TV networks are still experiencing good advertising demand," said Miller Tabak analyst David Joyce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Executives also dismissed fears that a National Football League walk-out -- killing the 2011 season -- would drive viewers and advertisers away from ESPN, saying any impact would be "negligible".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Bob Iger said the coming 'upfronts' negotiation season, during which media networks and corporate sponsors hammer out ad prices for the months ahead, promised to be strong with a rebound in both pricing and demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. media firms are riding a rebound in TV advertising as corporate budgets recover from the recession.

 (Adds analyst, executive comments and NFL remarks)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Yinka Adegoke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N)
reported a rare results miss after "Mars Needs Moms" capped a
disappointing quarter at the U.S. box office, sending its
shares down 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Strong advertising growth at sports network ESPN and a rise
in theme park sales and attendance -- despite a closure at its
Tokyo resort after Japan's earthquake -- could not make up for
a 13 percent plummet in studio entertainment revenue in the
fiscal second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's popular parks and resorts like Disneyland also
took a hit due to the timing of Easter holidays, which a year
ago fell in its fiscal second quarter, but this year falls in
the fiscal third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also recorded accounting charges from its
acquisition of social gaming developer Playdom for $563 million
last July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But analysts say the largest U.S. media conglomerate,
smarting from the disappointment of the heavily promoted but
poorly attended animated film "Mars Needs Moms," can look
forward to a strong summer with the fourth "Pirates of the
Caribbean" installment and "Captain America."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While I expect the stock to take somewhat of a hit, I
would buy on the dip since they will have a strong summer with
these blockbuster movies and the TV networks are still
experiencing good advertising demand," said Miller Tabak
analyst David Joyce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Executives also dismissed fears that a National Football
League walk-out -- killing the 2011 season -- would drive
viewers and advertisers away from ESPN, saying any impact would
be "negligible".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Bob Iger said the coming 'upfronts'

-- saw revenue climb 7 percent to $2.6 billion as attendance
jumped at the Paris and Hong Kong parks and guests spent more

with domestic room rates at its resorts double digits
percentage wise ahead of a year ago although actual
reservations were down by around 2.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that division's operating income slipped 3 percent to
$145 million with its Tokyo park closed for weeks in the
aftermath of Japan's worst earthquake on record, and after it
spent heavily to launch its signature "Disney Dream" liner in
January 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "My bottom-line conclusion is that even though the EPS was
less than what we were expecting, that was mostly one-off
issues," said Evercore Partners analyst Alan Gould.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Lawyers for Ecuadorean villagers who sued Chevron Corp over pollution in the Amazon rain forest asked an appeals panel on Tuesday to modify a court order that halted enforcement of an $8.6 billion award against the oil company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawyers told the Court of Appeals for the 2nd Circuit in New York that under the terms of the order, they were unable to meet with their clients or raise funds to fight Chevron in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The order, issued in March by U.S. District Judge Lewis Kaplan in New York, was just one development in a 17-year legal battle in which rain forest residents say Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, is responsible for hazardous oil-drilling waste dumped on their land in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron says Texaco cleaned up all waste pits for which it was responsible before turning the sites over to state-owned oil company Petroecuador, which still operates in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plaintiff lawyer James Tyrrell asked the panel to narrow the order to allow "legal advice and funding" pending a separate hearing on the merits of the order itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Chevron asked the judges not to modify the order, which prevents the plaintiffs from trying to collect on the judgment outside Ecuador, arguing that the plaintiffs' lawyers were planning to violate it by seeking enforcement in countries hostile to Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know what their goal is; the strategy is to take that Ecuadorean judgment and use it," attorney Randy Mastro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the hearing, the appeals court judges said they would likely issue a ruling later on Tuesday, but it had not been posted by then end of the court's work day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Ecuadorean court in February ruled against Chevron, but enforcement of the damage claim was stopped by Kaplan, who issued a preliminary injunction preventing the plaintiffs from trying to collect on the judgment outside Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his March 7 ruling, Kaplan noted that the damages had more than doubled from $8.6 billion originally to about $18 billion because Chevron failed to make a public apology and when a payment to the Amazon Defense Front is included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Questions surround the enforcement of the Ecuadorean court ruling because Chevron has no assets in the country, but the second-largest U.S. oil company worries that the plaintiffs will try to collect on the judgment in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So in anticipation of a judgment in Ecuador in favor of the Ecuadorean farmers, Chevron asked Kaplan to step in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Chevron Corp v.

villagers who sued Chevron Corp (CVX.N) over pollution in the
Amazon rain forest asked a U.S. appeals panel on Tuesday to
modify a court order that halted enforcement of an $8.6 billion
award against the oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawyers told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 2nd

were unable to meet with their clients or raise funds to fight
Chevron in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The order, issued in March by U.S. District Judge Lewis
Kaplan in New York, was just one development in a 17-year legal
battle in which rain forest residents say Texaco, bought by
Chevron in 2001, is responsible for hazardous oil-drilling
waste dumped on their land in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron says Texaco cleaned up all waste pits for which it
was responsible before turning the sites over to state-owned
oil company Petroecuador, which still operates in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plaintiff lawyer James Tyrrell asked the panel to narrow
the order to allow "legal advice and funding" pending a
separate hearing on the merits of the order itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lawyer for Chevron asked the judges not to modify the
order, which prevents the plaintiffs from trying to collect on
the judgment outside Ecuador, arguing that the plaintiffs'
lawyers were planning to violate it by seeking enforcement in
countries hostile to Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We know what their goal is; the strategy is to take that
Ecuadorean judgment and use it," attorney Randy Mastro said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the hearing, the appeals court judges said they would
likely issue a ruling later on Tuesday, but it had not been
posted by then end of the court's work day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Ecuadorean court in February ruled against Chevron, but
enforcement of the damage claim was stopped by Kaplan, who
issued a preliminary injunction preventing the plaintiffs from
trying to collect on the judgment outside Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his March 7 ruling, Kaplan noted that the damages had
more than doubled from $8.6 billion originally to about $18
billion  because Chevron failed to make a public apology and
when a payment to the Amazon Defense Front is included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Questions surround the enforcement of the Ecuadorean court
ruling because Chevron has no assets in the country, but the
second-largest U.S. oil company worries that the plaintiffs
will try to collect on the judgment in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So in anticipation of a judgment in Ecuador in favor of the
Ecuadorean farmers, Chevron asked Kaplan to step in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Chevron Corp v. Steven Donziger et al, U.S.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp plans to buy Internet phone service Skype for $8.5 billion in its biggest-ever acquisition, placing a rich bet on mobile and the Internet to try to best rivals such as Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a deal that took a month from offer to signing, the software company outbid Google and Facebook, which sources said offered to partner or buy Skype for $3 billion to $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's interest in the money-losing, but popular service highlights a need to gain new customers for its Windows and Office software. Skype has 145 million users on average each month and has gained favor among small business users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But investors expressed skepticism over the deal, sending Microsoft shares down 0.62 percent to $25.67. If those losses hold, the software giant's market value -- already exceeded by Apple Inc last year -- will slip behind General Electric Co's and begin to approach IBM's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Led by private equity firm Silver Lake, eBay Inc and other investors including the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Andreessen Horowitz, would make $5 billion, or three times their investment, a source familiar with the deal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is putting more energy and resources into mobile and the Internet as the personal computer business underpinning its Windows and Office franchise appears to be under threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Luxembourg-based company, which allows people to make calls at no charge, but has also developed premium services, would give Microsoft a foothold in the video-conferencing market as businesses shift to cheaper ways of communicating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype delayed plans for an IPO that was expected to value the company at more than $3 billion. It looked tie-ups with Facebook and Google. Such a deal was expected to value Skype at $3 billion to $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't make sense at all as a financial investment," said Forrester Research analyst Andrew Bartels. "There's no way Microsoft is going to generate enough revenue and profit from Skype to compensate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A MOBILE PRESENCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype could be combined with Microsoft software such as Outlook to appeal to corporate users, while the voice and video communications could link to Microsoft's Xbox live gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype also would offer Microsoft another route to develop its mobile presence, an area it has already put more energy and resources into as PC usage comes under threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype would become a new business division within Microsoft with Skype CEO Tony Bates in charge and reporting to Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tony didn't look for it. The ownership group, led by Silver Lake, didn't look for it. We just decided (it was) something that we thought made sense for us," a jubilant Ballmer told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sum would not stretch Microsoft. It would bankroll the deal with cash sitting overseas, which would be taxed if Microsoft brought it home. But others said the price was high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this atmosphere of Internet Bubble 2.0, picking up an unprofitable online company for roughly 10 times sales probably seems downright cheap," said Shanghai-based Michael Clendenin, managing director of consulting firm RedTech Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But if you consider (it) was just valued at about $2.5 billion 18 months ago when a chunk was sold off, then $8.5 billion seems generous and means Microsoft has a high wall to climb to prove to investors that Skype is a necessary linchpin for the company's online and mobile strategy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype, which was formed in 2003. EBay Inc bought it in 2005 for $3.1 billion. Last year, it lost $7 million, according to data in its initial public offering filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, eBay sold a majority stake in Skype for $1.9 billion in cash and a $125 million note. EBay retained about a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said his company did not use Wall Street advisers on the deal, approaching the owners directly. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan advised Skype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, the biggest in technology so far in 2011, capped the strongest start to deal-making since 2000, according to Thomson Reuters data. (For a graphic on technology deals, click here: r.reuters.com/vev49r)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wish they had not done it," said Whitney Tilson, founder and a managing partner of T2 Partners LLC, which owns Microsoft shares. "Everybody I know uses it and I am glad Microsoft owns it. They just probably paid too much for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We aren't big enough to have a big say. But I am sure that everybody else -- the bigger shareholders -- are going to be asking Microsoft, 'why did you this?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Poornima Gupta in San Francisco; Jennifer Ablan, Megan Davies and Sinead Carew in New York; Sakthi Prasad in Bangalore; Clare Jim in Taipei; Melanie Lee in Singapore; Tarmo Virki in Helsinki; and Nicola Leske in Frankfurt.

 NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plans
to buy Internet phone service Skype for $8.5 billion in its
biggest-ever acquisition, placing a rich bet on mobile and the
Internet to try to best rivals such as Google Inc (GOOG.O).

 In a deal that took a month from offer to signing, the
software company outbid Google and Facebook, which sources said
offered to partner or buy Skype for $3 billion to $4 billion.

 Microsoft's interest in the money-losing, but popular
service highlights a need to gain new customers for its Windows
and Office software. Skype has 145 million users on average
each month and has gained favor among small business users.

 But investors expressed skepticism over the deal, sending
Microsoft shares down 0.62 percent to $25.67. If those losses
hold, the software giant's market value -- already exceeded by
Apple Inc (AAPL.O) last year -- will slip behind General
Electric Co's (GE.N) and begin to approach IBM's (IBM.N).

 Led by private equity firm Silver Lake, eBay Inc (EBAY.O)
and other investors including the Canada Pension Plan
Investment Board and Andreessen Horowitz, would make $5
billion, or three times their investment, a source familiar
with the deal said [ID:nN10105729]

 Microsoft is putting more energy and resources into mobile
and the Internet as the personal computer business underpinning
its Windows and Office franchise appears to be under threat.

 The Luxembourg-based company, which allows people to make
calls at no charge, but has also developed premium services,
would give Microsoft a foothold in the video-conferencing
market as businesses shift to cheaper ways of communicating.

 Skype delayed plans for an IPO that was expected to value
the company at more than $3 billion. It looked tie-ups with
Facebook and Google. Such a deal was expected to value Skype at
$3 billion to $4 billion. [ID:nN04117305].

"It doesn't make sense at all as a financial investment,"
said Forrester Research analyst Andrew Bartels. "There's no way
Microsoft is going to generate enough revenue and profit from
Skype to compensate."

 A MOBILE PRESENCE

 Skype could be combined with Microsoft software such as
Outlook to appeal to corporate users, while the voice and video
communications could link to Microsoft's Xbox live gaming.

 Skype also would offer Microsoft another route to develop
its mobile presence, an area it has already put more energy and
resources into as PC usage comes under threat.

 Skype would become a new business division within Microsoft
with Skype CEO Tony Bates in charge and reporting to Ballmer.

 "Tony didn't look for it. The ownership group, led by
Silver Lake, didn't look for it. We just decided (it was)
something that we thought made sense for us," a jubilant
Ballmer told reporters.

 The sum would not stretch Microsoft. It would bankroll the
deal with cash sitting overseas, which would be taxed if
Microsoft brought it home. But others said the price was high.

 "In this atmosphere of Internet Bubble 2.0, picking up an
unprofitable online company for roughly 10 times sales probably
seems downright cheap," said Shanghai-based Michael Clendenin,
managing director of consulting firm RedTech Advisors.

 "But if you consider (it) was just valued at about $2.5
billion 18 months ago when a chunk was sold off, then $8.5
billion seems generous and means Microsoft has a high wall to
climb to prove to investors that Skype is a necessary linchpin
for the company's online and mobile strategy," he said.

 Skype, which was formed in 2003. EBay Inc (EBAY.O) bought
it in 2005 for $3.1 billion. Last year, it lost $7 million,
according to data in its initial public offering filing.

 In 2009, eBay sold a majority stake in Skype for $1.9
billion in cash and a $125 million note. EBay retained about a
third. [ID:nN04117305]

 Ballmer said his company did not use Wall Street advisers
on the deal, approaching the owners directly. Goldman Sachs and
JPMorgan advised Skype. [ID:nN10101025]

 The deal, the biggest in technology so far in 2011, capped
the strongest start to deal-making since 2000, according to
Thomson Reuters data. (For a graphic on technology deals, click

 "I wish they had not done it," said Whitney Tilson,
founder and a managing partner of T2 Partners LLC, which owns
Microsoft shares. "Everybody I know uses it and I am glad
Microsoft owns it. They just probably paid too much for it."

 "We aren't big enough to have a big say. But I am sure that
everybody else -- the bigger shareholders -- are going to be
asking Microsoft, 'why did you this?'"

			Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated Reports First Quarter 2011 Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated (NASDAQ: COKE) today announced it 
      earned $5.9 million, or basic net income per share of $.64, on net sales 
      of $359.6 million for the first quarter of 2011, compared to net income 
      of $4.7 million, or basic net income per share of $.51, on net sales of 
      $347.5 million for the first quarter of 2010. The results for the first 
      quarter of 2011 included $0.4 million of after-tax losses ($0.7 million 
      on a pre-tax basis) due to mark-to-market adjustments on fuel and 
      aluminum hedges. The results for the first quarter of 2010 included $0.1 
      million of after-tax gains ($0.2 million on a pre-tax basis) due to 
      mark-to-market adjustments on fuel and aluminum hedges and a $0.5 
      million increase in income tax expense due to the change in tax law 
      eliminating the tax deduction once available for Medicare Part D 
      subsidies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a comparable basis, the Company earned $6.4 million in the first 
      quarter of 2011, or comparable basic net income per share of $.69, 
      versus $4.9 million in the first quarter of 2010, or comparable basic 
      net income per share of $.54.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The following table reconciles reported GAAP net income and basic net 
      income per share to comparable net income and basic net income per share 
      for the first quarter of 2011 and 2010:

      J. Frank Harrison, III, Chairman and CEO, said, &#8220;We are pleased with our 
      first quarter results. We continued to grow our revenue and effectively 
      control costs which resulted in a strong start to 2011. Our first 
      quarter results reflect strong execution across our entire business. We 
      continue to face many challenges including the potential for significant 
      increases in commodity costs and persistently high unemployment in the 
      areas we serve. &#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      William B. Elmore, President and COO, added, &#8220;Our strong first quarter 
      results are a great start for the year. However, we believe that our 
      greatest challenges in 2011 lie in the months ahead. As we look to the 
      remainder of 2011, the challenges are expected to get tougher as higher 
      commodity prices will have greater impact on costs. We are also starting 
      to see lower sales trends in our convenience store business as consumers 
      react to higher fuel prices. As we have been doing over the past several 
      years, we will continue to look for ways to improve our supply chain and 
      minimize our operating costs. We will also review our pricing and make 
      adjustments as necessary to maintain our profitability.&#8221;

			These statements include, among others, 
      statements regarding the challenges that lie ahead in 2011, including 
      the impact of higher commodity prices and lower sales trends in our

      fuel prices; our continued focus on improving our supply chain and 
      minimizing operating costs; and our intention to make pricing 
      adjustments as necessary to maintain profitability.

      companies&#8217; levels of advertising, marketing and spending on brand

      higher raw material costs with higher selling prices, increased 
      bottle/can sales volume or reduced expenses; sustained increases in fuel 
      costs or our inability to secure adequate supplies of fuel; sustained 
      increases in workers&#8217; compensation, employment practices and vehicle 
      accident claims costs; sustained increases in the cost of employee 
      benefits; product liability claims or product recalls; technology 
      failures; changes in interest rates; the impact of debt levels on 
      operating flexibility and access to capital and credit markets; adverse 
      changes in our credit rating (whether as a result of our operations or 
      prospects or as a result of those of The Coca-Cola Company or other 
      bottlers in the Coca-Cola system); changes in legal contingencies; 
      legislative changes effecting our distribution and packaging; adoption 
      of significant product labeling or warning requirements; additional

			Cable Networks
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Cable Networks increased $174 million to $1.4 
      billion for the quarter due to growth at ESPN, ABC Family and the Disney 
      Channels, partially offset by lower equity income. The increase at ESPN 
      reflected higher advertising and affiliate revenue, partially offset by 
      higher programming costs. Advertising revenue growth was primarily due 
      to higher rates and sold inventory while higher affiliate revenue was 
      due to contractual rate increases. Higher programming and production 
      costs were driven by the addition of college football Bowl Championship 
      Series games. Higher operating income at ABC Family was driven by lower 
      programming and marketing costs due to the timing of airing of original 
      programming, while increased operating income at the Disney Channels was 
      due to increased affiliate revenue, partially offset by higher 
      programming costs. Affiliate revenue growth at the Disney Channels 
      reflected contractual rate increases domestically and subscriber growth 
      internationally. Decreased equity income reflected the impact of 
      programming costs for the Cricket World Cup at our ESPN Star Sports 
      joint venture.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Broadcasting
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income at Broadcasting increased $44 million to $167 million 
      driven by higher advertising revenue at the ABC Television Network and 
      at the owned television stations, higher affiliate fees, increased sales 
      of ABC Studios productions and lower programming and production costs at 
      the ABC Television Network. Higher advertising revenues at the ABC 
      Television Network were driven by increases in primetime and news, 
      partially offset by a decrease in sports due to the shift of the BCS 
      National Championship game to ESPN. Increased primetime and news 
      advertising revenues reflected higher rates, partially offset by lower 
      ratings. Higher sales of ABC Studios productions were driven by Criminal 
      Minds, Army Wives and Castle, partially offset by the 
      absence of Lost. Decreased programming and production costs 
      reflected the benefit of cost saving initiatives at news and the shift 
      of the BCS National Championship game to ESPN, partially offset by a 
      higher cost mix of programming in primetime.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These increases were partially offset by the absence of recoveries of 
      previously reserved receivables which occurred in the prior-year quarter 
      and timing of marketing costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Parks and Resorts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter increased 7% to $2.6 billion 
      and segment operating income decreased 3% to $145 million. Results for 
      the quarter were driven by decreases at Disney Cruise Line and Tokyo 
      Disney Resort, partially offset by increases at our domestic and 
      consolidated international parks and resorts. The decrease at Tokyo 
      Disney Resort was driven by the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in 
      Japan which resulted in a temporary suspension of operations at the 
      resort. Results at both our domestic and international parks and resorts 
      reflected an unfavorable impact due a shift in the timing of the Easter 
      holiday relative to our fiscal periods. As a result, the current quarter 
      did not include any of the two week Easter holiday while the prior-year 
      quarter included one week of the Easter holiday.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lower operating income at Disney Cruise Line was primarily due to 
      increased operating and promotional costs driven by the launch of our 
      new cruise ship, the Disney Dream, in January 2011
			and 
      higher fuel and other operating costs for the existing fleet, partially 
      offset by higher passenger cruise days from the Disney Dream.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Increased operating income at our domestic parks and resorts was driven 
      by higher guest spending and hotel occupancy, partially offset by 
      increased costs. Higher guest spending reflected increased average 
      ticket prices and daily hotel room rates. Increased costs reflected 
      labor cost inflation, higher pension and healthcare costs and expansion 
      costs for Disney California Adventure at Disneyland Resort.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Improved results at the consolidated international parks and resorts 
      reflected higher attendance and hotel occupancy at Disneyland Paris and 
      Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and higher guest spending at Hong Kong 
      Disneyland Resort, partially offset by labor cost inflation at 
      Disneyland Paris.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Studio Entertainment
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Studio Entertainment revenues for the quarter decreased 13% to $1.3 
      billion and segment operating income decreased 65% to $77 million. Lower 
      operating income was primarily due to decreases in worldwide home 
      entertainment and worldwide theatrical distribution and higher film cost 
      write-downs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The decrease in worldwide home entertainment was primarily due to lower 
      unit sales reflecting the strong prior-year performance of Toy Story 
      1 and 2 and the animated version of Alice in Wonderland in 
      the domestic market and Up in international markets. These 
      decreases were partially offset by higher net effective pricing due to 
      increased Blu-ray format sales. Lower results in worldwide theatrical 
      distribution reflected the performance of Mars Needs Moms in the 
      current quarter which also drove higher film cost write-downs. 
      Current quarter theatrical distribution results also included Tangled and 
      Tron: Legacy, primarily internationally,
			while the prior-year 
      quarter included the worldwide release of Alice in Wonderland.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Consumer Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumer Products revenues for the quarter increased 5% to $626 million 
      and segment operating income increased 7% to $142 million as 
      improvements at the Disney Store North America and Merchandise Licensing 
      were offset by a decrease at Publishing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase at the Disney Store North America was primarily due to 
      comparable store sales growth and improved margins reflecting the 
      strength of Tangled and Toy Story merchandise. Improved 
      Merchandise Licensing results reflected the strong performance of Cars 
      and Tangled merchandise. The decrease at Publishing was 
      driven by minimum guarantee shortfall recognition in the prior-year 
      quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Interactive Media
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interactive Media revenues for the quarter increased 3% to $159 million 
      and segment operating income decreased by $60 million to a loss of $115 
      million. Decreased operating results were driven by the acquisition of 
      Playdom, including the impact of acquisition accounting, and higher 
      mobile and virtual world product development costs.

      The decrease in interest expense for the quarter was primarily due to 
      lower effective interest rates and lower average debt balances.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The increase in interest and investment income for the quarter was 
      primarily due to gains on sales of investments.

			Income Taxes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The effective income tax rate for the current quarter was 35.6% compared 
      to 35.0% in the prior-year quarter. The prior-year quarter included a 
      benefit from the favorable resolution of certain prior-year tax matters 
      which was largely offset by a charge to reflect the loss of a tax 
      benefit related to Medicare Part D subsidies as a result of the 
      healthcare reform legislation.

			Noncontrolling Interests

		&lt;p&gt;
      Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests increased from $45

      Cash provided by operations increased 23% to $3.1 billion for the 
      current six month period compared to the prior-year six month period. 
      The increase was primarily due to higher operating cash receipts driven 
      by higher revenues at our Media Networks, Parks and Resorts, Consumer 
      Products and Interactive Media businesses and the timing of receivable 
      collections at our Media Networks, Consumer Products and Studio 
      Entertainment businesses. These increases were partially offset by 
      higher cash payments at Corporate and our Parks and Resorts, Interactive 
      Media and Consumer Products businesses. The increase in cash payments at 
      Corporate was driven by higher income tax payments and the timing of 
      contributions to our pension plans. The increase in cash payments at 
      Parks and Resorts was driven by labor cost inflation, higher operating 
      and promotional costs from the January launch of our new cruise ship, 
      the Disney Dream, and expansion costs for Disney California 
      Adventure at Disneyland Resort, while the increase in cash payments at 
      Interactive Media reflects the inclusion of Playdom, which was acquired 
      subsequent to the prior-year six month period. The increase in cash 
      payments at Consumer Products was primarily due to the inclusion of The 
      Disney Store Japan and Marvel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The increase in capital expenditures was primarily due to the final 
      payment for the Disney Dream, and spending on theme park and 
      resort expansions and new guest offerings.

      This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding the impact 
      of certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment 
      operating income, all of which are important financial measures for the 
      Company but are not financial measures defined by GAAP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant GAAP 
      financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures of 
      earnings per share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as determined in 
      accordance with GAAP. Net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate 
      segment operating income as we have calculated them may not be 
      comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

			Earnings per share excluding certain items 
      &#8211; The Company uses earnings per share excluding certain items to 
      evaluate the performance of the Company&#8217;s operations exclusive of 
      certain items that impact the comparability of results from period to 
      period. The Company believes that information about earnings per share 
      exclusive of these impacts is useful to investors, particularly where 
      the impact of the excluded items is significant in relation to reported 
      earnings, because the measure allows for comparability between periods 
      of the operating performance of the Company&#8217;s business and allows 
      investors to evaluate the impact of these items separately from the 
      impact of the operations of the business. The following table reconciles 
      reported earnings per share to earnings per share excluding certain 
      items:

          Restructuring and impairment charges for the current six months 
          totaled $12 million and consist of a $9 million impairment charge 
          related to the sale of assets and severance and other costs. The

          in excess of the book value, resulting in a $31 million tax benefit 
          on the restructuring and impairment charges. Restructuring and 
          impairment charges for the prior-year six months totaled $176 
          million and were related to organizational and cost structure 
          initiatives primarily at our Studio Entertainment and Media Networks 
          segments. Impairment charges were $96 million and consisted of 
          write-offs of capitalized costs primarily related to abandoned film 
          projects and the closure of a studio production facility. 
          Restructuring charges were $80 million and reflected primarily 
          severance and related costs.

			Net borrowings &#8211; The Company believes that 
      information about net borrowings provides investors with a useful 
      perspective on our financial condition. Net borrowings reflect the 
      subtraction of cash and cash equivalents from total borrowings. Since we 
      earn interest income on our cash balances that offsets a portion of the 
      interest expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be used as 
      a measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our 
      cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding indebtedness 
      when the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances arise. 
      However, we may not immediately apply cash and cash equivalents to the 
      reduction of debt, nor do we expect that we would use all of our 
      available cash and cash equivalents to repay debt in the ordinary course 
      of business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Free cash flow &#8211; The Company uses free cash 
      flow (cash provided by operations less investments in parks, resorts and 
      other property), among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its 
      operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than 
      capital expenditures. Management believes that information about free 
      cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash 
      available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments 
      and pay dividends or repurchase shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Aggregate segment operating income &#8211; The 
      Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on 
      segment operating income, and management uses aggregate segment 
      operating income as a measure of the performance of operating businesses 
      separate from non-operating factors. The Company believes that 
      information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors 
      by allowing them to evaluate changes in the operating results of the 
      Company&#8217;s portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors 
      that affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both 
      operations and the other factors that affect reported results.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co urged a bankruptcy court on Tuesday to throw out Lehman Brothers Holdings' claim demanding that it hand over $8.6 billion in cash taken as collateral in the weeks before Lehman imploded in September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for JPMorgan denied that the bank had engaged in misconduct, and portrayed the lawsuit brought by the failed investment bank and its unsecured creditors as undeserved punishment for the bank's good deeds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Other creditors joined the run on the bank, unlike JPMorgan," Paul Vizcarrondo, a lawyer for the bank, argued before Judge James Peck in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vizcarrondo, of law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen  Katz, argued that JPMorgan had helped to mitigate the 2008 financial crisis by continuing to provide financial services to Lehman even after the fourth biggest U.S. investment bank filed for bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman sued JPMorgan in May 2010, saying the second-largest U.S. bank illegally took billions of dollars of assets from Lehman ahead of its record bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was Lehman's main clearing bank, acting as a go-between in its dealings with other parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan filed a countersuit, accusing Lehman of sticking it with piles of loans that might never be repaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank accuses Lehman of providing it with deficient collateral in the form of securities that Lehman's own employees wrote off as "goat poo" and "toxic waste."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both parties agreed at the outset of Tuesday's arguments that they would not address a related proceeding to strike JPMorgan's counter-claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIFE AND DEATH POWER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peck was mostly silent during JPMorgan's nearly three hours of arguments. When Lehman got its turn, however, the judge questioned lawyer John Quinn on the company's argument that the $8.6 billion at issue is not protected by so-called "safe harbor" laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such laws can shield some financial transactions from being included in the pool of assets divided among creditors when a company files for Chapter 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan needed agreements ahead of clearing billions of dollars for Lehman, the judge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That seems to be in the sweet spot of safe harbors," Peck told Quinn, of law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan. "How can you say it is not?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman argues that JPMorgan used "its life and death power" over the firm to unfairly extract Lehman's remaining cash piles after learning from meetings with government officials and other inside sources that Lehman was about to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan asked for the collateral in August and September 2008 as part of an arrangement to continue acting as a clearing house for Lehman's valuable brokerage business, much of which was based on repurchase agreements, or "repos," that involve loans of securities for short periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan argued to the judge that broad safe harbor laws for financial firms are vital to the national interest and showed slides from a report by the Federal Reserve aimed at supporting its position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc et al v.

urged a bankruptcy court on Tuesday to throw out Lehman
Brothers Holdings' LEHMQ.PK claim demanding that it hand over
$8.6 billion in cash taken as collateral in the weeks before
Lehman imploded in September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawyers for JPMorgan denied that the bank had engaged in

U.S. bank illegally took billions of dollars of assets from
Lehman ahead of its record bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan was Lehman's main clearing bank, acting as a
go-between in its dealings with other parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan filed a countersuit, accusing Lehman of sticking
it with piles of loans that might never be repaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank accuses Lehman of providing it with deficient
collateral in the form of securities that Lehman's own
employees wrote off as "goat poo" and "toxic waste."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both parties agreed at the outset of Tuesday's arguments
that they would not address a related proceeding to strike
JPMorgan's counter-claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LIFE AND DEATH POWER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peck was mostly silent during JPMorgan's nearly three hours
of arguments. When Lehman got its turn, however, the judge
questioned lawyer John Quinn on the company's argument that the
$8.6 billion at issue is not protected by so-called "safe
harbor" laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such laws can shield some financial transactions from being
included in the pool of assets divided among creditors when a
company files for Chapter 11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan needed agreements ahead of clearing billions of
dollars for Lehman, the judge said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That seems to be in the sweet spot of safe harbors," Peck
told Quinn, of law firm Quinn Emanuel Urquhart  Sullivan. "How

over the firm to unfairly extract Lehman's remaining cash piles
after learning from meetings with government officials and
other inside sources that Lehman was about to collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan asked for the collateral in August and September
2008 as part of an arrangement to continue acting as a clearing
house for Lehman's valuable brokerage business, much of which
was based on repurchase agreements, or "repos," that involve
loans of securities for short periods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan argued to the judge that broad safe harbor laws
for financial firms are vital to the national interest and
showed slides from a report by the Federal Reserve aimed at
supporting its position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is: Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc et al v. JPMorgan
Chase, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New
York, Adversary Proceeding No. 10-03266.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Massachusetts securities regulators may charge Goldman Sachs Group Inc with improperly passing along analysts' tips to top clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Massachusetts Securities Division is weighing administrative proceedings against the bank over communications among its analysts, sales staff and clients, according to Goldman's quarterly filing with U.S. regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority and others are investigating similar matters, Goldman said. The investment bank said it is cooperating with the probes but did not provide more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and its Wall Street peers are dealing with myriad regulatory probes in the wake of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin, the state's top financial regulator, said in the past that he was investigating Goldman and had subpoenaed information about how the bank might have passed along short-term trading tips of its analysts to top clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Galvin said he was concerned the analysts might pass along their best ideas improperly during weekly meetings called "huddles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Galvin's office declined to comment on Tuesday, except to confirm the accuracy of Goldman's statements in its filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2003 Galvin was among a group of regulators who negotiated a $1.4 billion settlement over research practices of big Wall Street firms, including Goldman. Banks were accused of issuing overly optimistic research on companies to win their investment banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A question now is whether Goldman is meeting the terms and spirit of that settlement. As part of the settlement, 10 Wall Street banks agreed to separate their research and banking businesses with a so-called "Chinese wall" to avoid conflicts of interest. Also, research analysts were prohibited from soliciting investment banking business, and their compensation was not to be based on performance of that division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also said in its Tuesday filing that Commodity Futures Trading Commission staff had told the bank's execution and clearing unit that they will recommend the CFTC bring charges against the unit. The charges would be linked to Goldman's clearing trades for a broker-dealer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CFTC said it does not confirm or deny the existence of investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Goldman paid the SEC $550 million to settle civil fraud charges related to a derivatives deal in 2007. The agency had accused Goldman of misleading clients to earn profits and failing to disclose pertinent information. The bank conducted a comprehensive review of its business practices as a result of that investigation and implemented changes to its reporting processes and interactions with clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spent $700 million on legal costs in 2010 and now has 286 lawyers working full-time, compared with 252 a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said on Tuesday that its worst-case estimate for legal costs had declined to $2.7 billion as of March 31 from $3.4 billion at the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; Additional reporting by Joe Rauch in Charlotte, North Carolina, Christopher Doering in Washington, and Ross Kerber in Boston; Editing by Derek Caney, Steve Orlofsky and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

Goldman's quarterly filing with U.S. regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Financial
Industry Regulatory Authority and others are investigating
similar matters, Goldman said. The investment bank said it is
cooperating with the probes but did not provide more detail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and its Wall Street peers are dealing with myriad
regulatory probes in the wake of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Massachusetts Secretary of State William Galvin, the
state's top financial regulator, said in the past that he was
investigating Goldman and had subpoenaed information about how
the bank might have passed along short-term trading tips of its
analysts to top clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2009, Galvin said he was concerned the analysts might
pass along their best ideas improperly during weekly meetings
called "huddles."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Galvin's office declined to comment on Tuesday, except to
confirm the accuracy of Goldman's statements in its filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2003 Galvin was among a group of regulators who
negotiated a $1.4 billion settlement over research practices
of big Wall Street firms, including Goldman. Banks were accused
of issuing overly optimistic research on companies to win their
investment banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A question now is whether Goldman is meeting the terms and
spirit of that settlement. As part of the settlement, 10 Wall
Street banks agreed to separate their research and banking
businesses with a so-called "Chinese wall" to avoid conflicts
of interest. Also, research analysts were prohibited from
soliciting investment banking business, and their compensation
was not to be based on performance of that division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also said in its Tuesday filing that Commodity
Futures Trading Commission staff had told the bank's execution
and clearing unit that they will recommend the CFTC bring
charges against the unit. The charges would be linked to
Goldman's clearing trades for a broker-dealer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CFTC said it does not confirm or deny the existence of
investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year Goldman paid the SEC $550 million to settle civil
fraud charges related to a derivatives deal in 2007. The agency
had accused Goldman of misleading clients to earn profits and
failing to disclose pertinent information. The bank conducted a
comprehensive review of its business practices as a result of
that investigation and implemented changes to its reporting
processes and interactions with clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman spent $700 million on legal costs in 2010 and now
has 286 lawyers working full-time, compared with 252 a year
ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said on Tuesday that its worst-case estimate
for legal costs had declined to $2.7 billion as of March 31
from $3.4 billion at the end of 2010.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's move to buy money-losing Internet phone service Skype for $8.5 billion was immediately skewered by critics and investors, who questioned the logic of the deal and suggested the software giant is paying far too much.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price is about double the expected value of Skype if it had gone ahead with its planned initial public offering, leaving investors puzzled over how Microsoft will make the deal pay for itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wish they had not done it," said Whitney Tilson, founder and a managing partner of T2 Partners LLC, which owns Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Initially when I first read about it, I hated the deal. Now, I don't like it," said Tilson, who is a long-term buyer of Microsoft shares and still sees them as a great cash-generating business and an undervalued stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everybody I know uses it and I am glad Microsoft owns it. They just probably paid too much for it," said Tilson, who did not buy or sell Microsoft stock on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the world's largest software company fell 1.4 percent, anchored at the same level they have been for 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest deal was a fresh reminder that Microsoft has no record of making acquisitions pay off. Its 2007 deal to buy online ad firm aQuantive for $6 billion was a flat-out failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They really have to do some explaining as to how this company merited that price and how they'll return the value to shareholders," said Kim Caughey Forrest, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which holds Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have to see the path to profitability. It smacks of that 1999, 2000 time period when valuations were granted on eyeballs, not revenue and earnings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype made a net loss of $7 million last year on revenue of $860 million, even as its user base grew nearly 40 percent to 145 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said the deal would add to the company's profits from the first year, preferring to focus on the $264 million Skype made last year, excluding interest, tax, depreciation and amortization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He stressed that Skype, which will be a separate unit within Microsoft, will help sales of its other products such as Xbox game console and Kinect motion-sensing system, and add luster to its Office suite of applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Will we sell a few more Kinects when we get these things hooked up? Yeah, I think so. Skype can help where we are in the enterprise by getting those customer bases to work well together," said Ballmer in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think there's a lot of value in here that we can drive -- we've just got to go get it done when we get through the regulatory (approval)," he added. Microsoft aims to complete the deal this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LACK OF SPECIFICS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is hoping that more business users would be willing to pay for Skype if it is integrated with Outlook e-mail, which hundreds of millions of people already use, or that more gamers will pay to join the Xbox Live network if real-time video and voice services are added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should also allow its new Windows Phones to compete directly with Apple Inc and Google Inc smartphones, which already feature video chat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some investors carped that Microsoft already had the technology to do this, or should have developed it itself, and may soon be overtaken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They paid a headscratcher of a valuation," said Patrick Becker Jr., a principal at Becker Capital Management, which owns 1.5 million Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of my big fears is that by the time they design this into Outlook, Xbox and their phone software it's going to be overtaken by Google and Apple from a capability standpoint," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Becker said buying a software company should cost more like a multiple of five times revenue, which would imply a valuation closer to $4.3 billion based on the company's 2010 revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It points to them playing follow the leader, which is a very difficult game to play," said Becker. "My disappointment is that I thought this was an area (in which) they had a fair amount of expertise. To go out and spend $8.5 billion makes me wonder about internal execution. They obviously felt they didn't have the product in house to compete with Skype, Google and Apple."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One factor in favor of Microsoft: it is using cash from overseas to buy Luxembourg-based Skype, which means it won't have to pay U.S. tax on that money, as it would if it had repatriated the money to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The majority of Microsoft's $50 billion cash and short-term investments are held overseas, where most of its revenue is generated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can't return their offshore cash to shareholders so this might be reasonable use of that," acknowledged Tilson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even that could not persuade investors that the deal was a bargain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It does strike me that by almost any dimension Microsoft is overpaying," said Andrew Bartels, an analyst at Forrester Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's some strategic benefits but I have a hard time seeing them being anywhere close to what they're paying," he said. "I'm sure shareholders are saying that Microsoft should have given a dividend to shareholders rather than spend it on this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan and Sinead Carew; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
			Patton SmartNode Announces Microsoft OCS Certification
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			For organizations implementing OCS unified 
      communications,&#160;SmartNode&#8482; preserves investment in existing PBX phone 
      systems, adding a rich set of IP-telephony features
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Patton&#8212;the leader in business and carrier-class network access, 
      connectivity, VoIP and mobile video-surveillance equipment&#8212;announces 
      mutual certification for Microsoft Office Communication Server (OCS) and&#160;SmartNode&#8482;&#160;VoIP 
      gateways.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft certified SmartNode&#8482; media gateways (R5.6 and newer) in 
      its&#160;Unified 
      Communications Open Interoperability Program for Office Communications 
      Server&#160;while&#160;Patton lists Microsoft as a&#160;Certified 
      IP-PBX Partner.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Having&#160;announced 
      IBM Lotus Sametime certification&#160;in March, Patton 
      anticipates completing Microsoft Lync certification in Q3.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Microsoft-Patton certification enables enterprises and 
      integrators to select, specify and implement SmartNode-enhanced OCS 
      solutions with utmost confidence. Patton&#8217;s&#160;SmartNode-OCS 
      configuration guide&#160;facilitates 
      trouble-free system turn-up.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Most Microsoft-certified VoIP gateways are less scalable for 
      interface types, port counts, and number of concurrent calls, yet Swiss 
      engineered, US-manufactured SmartNode&#8482;&#160;VoIP equipment typically costs 
      less than any reliable alternative.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;How do you fix a price on peace of mind?&#8221; said Burton A. Patton, 
      Executive Vice President. &#8221;Award-wining SmartNode VoIP equipment is 
      industry-renowned for high quality and set-it-forget-it stability. Once 
      you configure one you won&#8217;t touch it again. SmartNode&#8482; just keeps on 
      working.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Featured in an interview entitled &#8220;Patton Rocks the VoIP World 
      with SmartNode,&#8221; Mr. Patton appears on the cover of April&#8217;s&#160;InfoTECH 
      Spotlight magazine.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			According to Wainhouse Research (Implementing 
      Microsoft&#8217;s OCS 2007 in Real-World Telephony Environments),&#160;few 
      organizations rip and replace their existing voice networks when 
      implementing unified communications. Most companies prefer less 
      radical&#8212;and less costly&#8212;gradual migration to IP telephony.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Enabling the smooth transition, SmartNode&#8482; offers a&#160;Unified 
      Communications Agent&#160;(UCA) that integrates existing PBX 
      phone systems and/or PSTN connections with such unified communications 
      systems as Microsoft OCS and IBM Lotus Sametime.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Providing any-to-any multi-path switching, Patton&#8217;s&#160;UCA supports 
      simultaneous SIP, H.323, ISDN, and POTS calling&#8212;plus T.38 and SuperG3 
      FAX&#8212;with routing and conversion for TDM/PSTN and IP/Ethernet traffic. 
      The UCA includes&#160;SIP 
      Registrar&#160;for presence/reachability; dial-backup and 
      IP-link redundancy for&#160;VoIP-and-data 
      survivability, and&#160;VoIP-over-VPN&#160;for 
      secure IPsec-encrypted 
      voice&#160;and data with Internet Key Exchange (IKE).
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SmartNode further enriches unified communications solutions with 
      intelligent least-cost call-routing, QoS, traffic management, voice 
      prioritization, and protection for critical data with call limiter and 
      PSTN overflow.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Patton recently&#160;expanded 
      the SmartNode&#8482; T1/E1/PRI Series, adding the&#160;SN4940&#160;VoIP 
      Gateway and&#160;SN4950&#160;VoIP&#160;Gateway-Router 
      to the&#160;SN4960&#160;Enterprise 
      Session Border Router.

			Vu TelePresence on Microsoft/Skype Acquisition
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CEO Devita Saraf of Vu TelePresence issued the following statement today 
      regarding Microsoft&#8217;s acquisition of Skype for 8.5 billion dollars.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today&#8217;s announcement that Microsoft will acquire Skype is a ringing 
      endorsement of the communications services market, specifically in the 
      area of telepresence/videoconferencing. This acquisition as well as 
      Cisco&#8217;s recent shift towards the SMB category, reinforces our long held 
      view that there is significant opportunity in the small business space.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While video conferencing is not a new technology, small business options 
      have been limited. Previous market options have been either very 
      expensive or free of cost and unreliable. Rather than listening to the 
      needs of this category, many technology companies applied a one-size 
      fits all approach to their solutions rather than treating small 
      businesses as individual companies. With more than 500 small business 
      clients, Vu recognizes this category is unique and needs flexible 
      solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On the eve of Small Business Week, we believe it is important to 
      recognize the impact small businesses have on job creation and the ways 
      they make a difference in their communities. Despite reports of waning 
      optimism, recent studies have shown that small businesses are bullish on 
      the prospects afforded by U.S. economic growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today&#8217;s announcement shines a light on the businesses benefit of 
      telepresence. At Vu, our commitment is to ensure that as the category 
      evolves small businesses have the tools and solutions needed to drive 
      rapid, broad-based and sustained economic growth and competitiveness.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Shareholders urged to vote down exec pay&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * ISS says Exxon shareholder returns lag peers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Anna Driver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, May 10 (Reuters) - Investors and proxy firm ISS
are criticizing Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) compensation
practices ahead of the the company's annual meeting, arguing
the oil company's shareholder returns do not justify executives
' pay packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ISS and the American Federation of State, County and
Municipal Employees (AFSCME) and RAM Trust are urging
shareholders to vote against ratification of Exxon's executive
compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil continues to be well managed, but also
continues to benefit from oil price run-ups that are not
reflective of company or individual performance," ISS said in a
report issued last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson's total pay rose 6.6
percent in 2010 to $29 million. [ID:nN13251253]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's 3-year total shareholder return was a
negative 5.8 percent and lagged peers, the ISS report said,
adding that a $100 investment in Exxon at the end of 2006 was
worth only $104 at the end of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon defended its compensation practices in a regulatory
filing arguing, among other factors, that ISS' recommendation
is "fundamentally flawed" because it relies too heavily on the
short term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "ExxonMobil's business depends on investment lead times
ranging from a minimum of five to 10 years, to decades," Exxon
said in a letter sent to shareholders on Friday. "Our
compensation program is tied to the long-term nature of our
business, as it should be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to a vote against ratification of Exxon's
compensation, ISS and AFSCME are both recommending that the
company's shareholders vote for a proposal requiring an
independent board chairman. Tillerson is both CEO and chairman
of the board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's shareholder meeting will be held in Dallas on May
25.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips, the third largest U.S. oil company, also
faces opposition from ISS on compensation. In a report issued
in April, the influential proxy advisory firm took issue with
the compensation awarded to two new executives.
[ID:nN21164239]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips holds its annual meeting in Houston on
Wednesday.

      of Skype Global S.&#224;.r.l., the leading Internet communications company, 
      for $8.5 billion in cash.

      billion minutes of voice and video conversations in 2010.

      Microsoft. Skype will support a wide array of Microsoft devices such as

      Lync, Outlook, Xbox Live, and other communities.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plans to buy Internet phone service Skype for $8.5 billion in its biggest-ever acquisition, placing a rich bet on mobile and the Internet to try to best rivals such as Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a deal that took about a month from offer to signing, the software company outbid Google and Facebook, which sources said offered to partner or buy Skype for $3 billion to $4 billion. They planned to use the provider of Internet telephone services to keep users glued to their online communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's interest in the money-losing, but popular service highlights a need to gain new customers for its Windows and Office software. Skype has 145 million users on average each month and has gained favour among small business users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But investors expressed scepticism over the deal, sending Microsoft shares down 1.4 percent to $25.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't make sense at all as a financial investment," said Forrester Research analyst Andrew Bartels. "There's no way Microsoft is going to generate enough revenue and profit from Skype to compensate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would be a big payday for Skype's owners, online auction site eBay Inc (EBAY.O) and investors including Silver Lake, the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Andreessen Horowitz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are a super-ambitious company," Ballmer told reporters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is putting more energy and resources into mobile and the Internet as the personal computer business underpinning its Windows and Office franchise appears to be under threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype delayed plans for an initial public offering that was expected to value the company at more than $3 billion. It looked at other options, including tie-ups with Facebook and Google. Such a deal was expected to value Skype at $3 billion to $4 billion..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Luxembourg-based company, which allows people to make calls at no charge, but has also developed premium services, would give Microsoft a foothold in the video-conferencing market as businesses shift to cheaper ways of communicating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype could be combined with Microsoft software such as Outlook to appeal to corporate users, while the voice and video communications could link to Microsoft's Xbox live gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't wait to hear the logic behind this," said Fort Pitt Capital's Kim Caughey Forrest. "They really have to do some explaining on the call as to how this company merited that price and how they'll return the value to shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A MOBILE PRESENCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Longer-term, Skype would offer Microsoft another route to develop its mobile presence, an area it has already put more energy and resources into as PC usage comes under threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype is set to become a new business division within Microsoft with Skype CEO Tony Bates in charge and reporting directly to Ballmer, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Skype deal is the biggest in the 36-year history of the world's largest software company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $8.5 billion price tag was a surprise. Although the sum would not stretch cash-rich Microsoft, some said it was high for a company whose ownership has changed several times during its relatively short life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this atmosphere of Internet Bubble 2.0, picking up an unprofitable online company for roughly 10 times sales probably seems downright cheap," said Shanghai-based Michael Clendenin, managing director of consulting firm RedTech Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But if you consider (it) was just valued at about $2.5 billion 18 months ago when a chunk was sold off, then $8.5 billion seems generous and means Microsoft has a high wall to climb to prove to investors that Skype is a necessary linchpin for the company's online and mobile strategy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype, which was formed in 2003, was bought by eBay Inc (EBAY.O) in 2005 for $3.1 billion. Last year it had $860 million in revenue, and a net loss of $7 million, according to data in its initial public offering filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2009, eBay sold a majority stake in Skype to the investor group for $1.9 billion in cash and a $125 million note. EBay retained about a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said his company did not use Wall Street advisers on the deal, approaching the investor group that owns Skype directly. Skype was advised by Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and JPMorgan (JPM.N).

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft this morning confirmed that it has acquired internet video chat company Skype for $8.5 billion in cash.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And just like that, Microsoft has become a key player in the world of video chat. The deal is also Microsoft&#8217;s biggest acquisition yet, which tells us the company is finally looking closely at the possibilities of video chat after seemingly ignoring the technology for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early reports of the deal surfaced last night following on the heals of word that Skype has been in deal talks with Facebook and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says that Skype will support the Xbox 360 and Kinect; Windows Phone (which doesn&#8217;t support front-facing cameras yet) and other devices; as well as software like Outlook. The company will also continue support for Skype on other platforms like Mac and Linux.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype will be transformed into a new division in Microsoft, and Skype CEO Tony Bates will be president of that division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While many are already calling this acquisition the end of Skype, there&#8217;s no doubt that the video chat company has a lot to gain from Microsoft. For one, it won&#8217;t have to worry much about its revenue problems anymore. Plus, Skype will finally be able to bring on more developers to polish its software &#8212; recent updates have added some cool features like group video chat, but the software has also gotten slower and more difficult to use in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is some reason for concern. Microsoft hasn&#8217;t yet proven it can deftly integrate an acquired company into its fold. And Skype already went through a failed acquisition by eBay in 2005, so the company must be worried about being mismanaged once again. But overall, it seems like both Microsoft and Skype may be able to benefit from this union.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: acquisitions, Kinect, video chat, Windows Phone 7, xbox 360&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies: Microsoft, Skype&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People: Tony Bates&lt;/p&gt;

Groupe SA (PUBP.PA) of France for $530 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skype's banks may have missed out on a bigger payday --
Goldman and JPMorgan, alongside Morgan Stanley, had been
working on a delayed initial public offering (IPO) that had
been expected to raise $1 billion. U.S. IPOs typically pay fees
of 5 to 7 percent, or $50 million to $70 million on a $1
billion flotation.

&lt;p&gt;  PISCATAWAY, NJ, May 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Kantara Initiative sponsored the test event for the purpose of testing
the interoperability of implementations in accordance with the SAML 2.0
specifications. The event was conducted by the Drummond Group Inc. (DGI)
with oversight from the Kantara Interoperability Review Board (IRB). The
Web-based full-matrix testing allows vendors to participate from anywhere
in the world and features rigorous processes for ensuring products meet
SAML 2.0 interoperability requirements for open, secure and
privacy-respecting federated identity management. The testing itself was
conducted from January 10 to March 1, 2011.

    "SAML 2.0 has proven to be critical to how cross-domain security is
enabled both between enterprises and between enterprises and cloud
service providers," said Matthew Gardiner, director at CA Technologies
and president of Kantara Initiative. "Organizations can count on the
Kantara Initiative testing process to certify products that have proven
to meet rigorous interoperability requirements. This certification
process should serve as a key business enabler as more and more sensitive
applications cross Web domains."

    This is the first SAML full-matrix interoperability test event sponsored
by the Kantara Initiative, continuing the program it inherited from the
Liberty Alliance. Full-matrix testing is the best means to verify product
group interoperability as it verifies that every product can successfully
interact and interoperate with the other products in the test group using
the test criteria. This test marked the second time the SAML 2.0
eGovernment (eGov) Profile, Version 1.5, was included in the event. The
eGov profile was produced as a result of a multi-government effort to
create a SAML conformance profile for government-centric identity
management.

    "CA Technologies is especially pleased to receive the Kantara
Initiative's SAML 2.0 certification for CA Federation Manager. CA
Technologies supports the important role that the SAML standard has in
providing enhanced security for organizations as they take advantage of
the rapidly growing market for Cloud services and other identity-centric
services on the Internet," said Ellen Newlands, CA Technologies Product
Manager and Kantara Interoperability Review Board Co-Chair.

    "The SAML 2.0 interoperability certification is beneficial for vendors to
test and validate standards based implementation of federation
capabilities and help support customer's heterogeneous IT environment and
business needs," said Ravi Srinivasan, Program Director, IBM Security
Solutions.

    "Support of identity federation and SAML 2.0 are critical to many SAP
customers," stated Michael Friedrich, Vice President for Security and
Identity Management at SAP AG, "and it is a crucial step to execute on
SAP's strategy to offer on demand applications and allow for secure
access and Single Sign-On between on premise and on demand offerings in
heterogeneous landscapes. With the SAML support in SAP NetWeaver
Application Server ABAP 7.02 and with that also in the highest SAP
Business Suite 7i2010 release, as well as with the latest version of SAP
NetWeaver Identity Management, SAP has done a major step in enhancing its
products to allow customers to implement standards-based, interoperable
and cross domain Single Sign-On and reduce administrative effort and TCO."

    "For UNINETT, complying with open standards is very important, and we've
been working for open standards on the Internet ever since we were
founded," said CEO Petter Kongshaug, UNINETT. "UNINETT operates the
national identity infrastructure for education and research, and for our
customers it's reassuring to know that our common infrastructure is based
upon state-of-the-art software. The Kantara testing program has been very
useful to us."

			JPMorgan Chase and NY Giants&#8217; Justin Tuck Donate $275,000 to Help 
      Alabama Residents Impacted by Devastating Tornadoes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Chase also Launches Initiatives to Help its Credit Card, Home, 
      Student and Auto Lending Customers in Affected Areas
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase today announced that it is teaming up with New York 
      Giants&#8217; Justin Tuck to donate $275,000 to assist Alabama residents 
      affected by the recent devastating tornadoes. The firm will give 
      $150,000 to World Vision, a longtime disaster-response partner that will 
      focus on families and schools, and $100,000 to The West Chamber Alabama 
      Foundation in support of its Tuscaloosa Disaster Relief Fund, which is 
      assisting with basic human services and recovery efforts in the 
      Tuscaloosa area. Tuck, who grew up in Central Alabama, is donating 
      $25,000 to World Vision through his organization, Tuck&#8217;s R.U.S.H. for 
      Literacy
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Chase has implemented several temporary initiatives to help 
      its customers in the areas most affected. Customers may be eligible for 
      a deferral of payments without late fees or negative credit reporting 
      and credit card line flexibility. The firm also has halted all 
      collection and repossession efforts in 37 zip codes across Alabama, as 
      well as in two zip codes in Georgia and Mississippi. Chase also is 
      working closely with insurance companies to help get customers&#8217; homes 
      repaired.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      More than 5,000 residences and businesses in Tuscaloosa County have been 
      destroyed or seriously damaged and 40 residents were killed and 12 are 
      still missing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our heart goes out to the people throughout the region, particularly 
      those in Alabama, which was the most severely impacted,&#8221; said Mel 
      Martinez, Chairman of the JPMorgan Chase Foundation and former U.S. 
      Senator representing Florida. &#8220;This donation and the additional steps we 
      are taking to ease our customers&#8217; financial concerns will help 
      Tuscaloosa County and other communities as they begin the healing and 
      rebuilding process.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am so grateful that the people of Alabama have always supported me 
      and I know they have the strength to overcome this tragedy,&#8221; Tuck said. 
      &#8220;Education and literacy have always been a passion of mine, so I am 
      partnering with JPMorgan Chase and World Vision to ensure local students 
      get the support they need during this recovery period.&#8221; In 2008, Tuck 
      founded Tuck&#8217;s R.U.S.H. for Literacy to encourage children from New York 
      City and Central Alabama to READ, UNDERSTAND, SUCCEED and HOPE.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;World Vision is deeply grateful for JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s generous 
      partnership with us to reach the most vulnerable survivors of this 
      disaster,&#8221; said Chris Glynn, the humanitarian agency&#8217;s senior vice 
      president of corporate development and U.S. programs. &#8220;JPMorgan Chase 
      has assisted in many World Vision responses where children have urgent 
      needs, whether for school supplies, for relief in U.S. disasters, or 
      assistance in quake ravaged Haiti and Japan.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The JPMorgan Chase Foundation has donated more than $500 million to 
      non-profit organizations over the last five years, with a particular 
      focus on communities around the world devastated by catastrophic events.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Customers in Alabama and other areas who have been impacted by the 
      recent tornadoes should contact Chase at the following numbers:

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp plans to buy Internet phone and video service Skype for $8.5 billion as it seeks to regain ground from fast-moving rivals such as Google Inc. Below are analyst comments on the deal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COLIN GILLIS, ANALYST, BGC FINANCIAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a strategic asset and a defensive move. If (Microsoft) can put it on Windows 8, it gives them an advantage. It helps them in the tablet market," he said referring to Windows 8 software for tablets which he expects to hit the market in 2012. "It's sizable but it's less than they'd pay for Groupon or Twitter or Facebook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANDREW BARTELS, ANALYST, FORRESTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't make sense at all as a financial investment. There's no way Microsoft is going to generate enough revenue and profit from Skype to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's so many other alternatives for connectivity. What makes Skype attractive is it's got a lot of users. It's widely used especially by the more technologically sophisticated consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm sure shareholders are saying that Microsoft should have given a dividend to shareholders rather than spend it on this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regarding relationship with wireless carriers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Helping a competitor like Skype reduces the need for a cellphone plan. I'm not sure how much it's going to hurt. It certainly doesn't help (carrier relations).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the heaviest usage of Skype is in fact for video chat. One of the possibilities is Microsoft might expand the usability more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think you can make an argument Skype gets better under Microsoft than eBay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM CAUGHEY FORREST, SENIOR ANALYST, FORT PITT CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't wait to hear the logic behind this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They really have to do some explaining on the call as to how this company merited that price and how they'll return the value to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (Skype) have a lot of customers but it doesn't seem like they get enough money from those customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is less than two quarters of their cash flow to buy the company. They'll be able to pay for it very quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On integration into Xbox Live:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Xbox Live seemed to be doing pretty good without that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more interesting they're thinking of incorporating it into Outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Software companies think consumers want this but the question is will they pay for it," she said referring to friends who have 18-hour Skype sessions with each other without paying a penny to Skype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On wireless carriers:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could help them if it's integrated (into cellphones)" as it could be easier than the Apple iPhone app.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This would drive a lot of data and a lot of bandwidth. it would be carrier neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It smacks of that 1999, 2000 time period when valuations were granted on eyeballs not revenue and earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's been a lot of talk as to whether Microsoft should be broken up and stop investing in money losing nascent businesses, stop trying to chase the hot areas and become a slower growing higher cash yielding business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sinead Carew)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Update: Microsoft has confirmed that it will buy Skype for $8.5 billion. Original story below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &#8212;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is close to a deal with Skype to buy the internet phone company for $7 &#8211; $8 billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If it&#8217;s true, it would be an aggressive move by Microsoft to become a big player in the convergence of communication, information and entertainment. The deal could be announced as early as Tuesday, according to sources cited by the Journal. Microsoft and Skype declined comment to the Journal. The rumor of the deal was first reported by GigaOm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal could still fall part. Including Skype&#8217;s long-term debt, the value could be about $8.5 billion. Skype allows users to make calls for free to each other over the internet. The service makes money when those users want to connect to someone with a land line or hold a video phone call with multiple parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could use Skype&#8217;s name value to build out a bigger consumer business and integrate the popular service with its Xbox Live online gaming service. The deal could be one of the biggest that Microsoft has ever undertaken in hits 36-year history. In 2007, Microsoft bought aQuantive, an online ad firm, for $6 billion. And it almost bought Yahoo for $48 billion nearly three years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Microsoft has successfully moved into video games, most of its profit still comes from its Windows and Office franchises. Microsoft has a a communications platform called Linc, which ties together email, instant messaging, and voice communications into a single application. Skype could help enhance that. But for the most part, Skype would be a major diversification for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps the biggest benefit of buying Skype will be to help out Microsoft&#8217;s Windows Phone 7 platform, which could use a free calling technology to compete against Apple&#8217;s FaceTime on the iPhone and Google Voice on Android.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, Skype has been part of a failed diversification in the past. The company was founded in 2003 by Niklas Zennstrom and Janus Friis, the creators of the Kazaa file-sharing technology that was associated with music piracy. Skype was disruptive, offering free phone calls when most carriers still charged for such service. Then eBay bought Skype for $2.6 billion in 2005, presumably so buyers and sellers could communicate in eBay auctions. That didn&#8217;t work out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;eBay sold a 70 percent stake to Silver Lake Partners, Index Ventures, Canada Pension Plan Investment Board and Andreessen Horowitz. Skype hasn&#8217;t had the best of luck making a profit. The company posted revenue of $860 million in 2010 and a net loss of $7 million. It has debt of $686 million. Skype had been planning to go public since last August, seeking to raise $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: acquisition&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies: Microsoft, Skype&lt;/p&gt;

Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Massachusetts Securities Division is weighing

Goldman's execution and clearing unit that they will recommend
the CFTC bring charges against the unit. The charges would be
linked to Goldman's clearing trades for a broker-dealer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CFTC alleges that the bank should have known a
broker-dealer's sub-accounts belonged to the dealer's
customers, and not the dealer itself.

&lt;p&gt; * Deal is software company's biggest purchase&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Price is twice recent valuation talk&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Purchase could plug a hole in its mobile offerings
 (Rewrites with deal announcement, Microsoft CEO comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Nadia Damouni and Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 10 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plans
to buy Internet phone service Skype for $8.5 billion, a rich
price as it seeks to regain ground on growing rivals such as
Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's interest in the money-losing but popular
service highlights a need to gain new customers for its Windows
and Office software. Skype has 145 million users on average
each month and has gained favor among small business users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skype delayed plans for an initial public offering expected
to raise $1 billion. It has been looking at other options,
including tie-ups with Facebook and Google. Such a deal was
seen as valuing Skype at $3 billion to $4 billion.
[ID:nN04117305].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Luxembourg-based company, which allows people to make
calls at no charge but has also developed premium services,
would give Microsoft a foothold in the potentially lucrative
video-conferencing market as businesses shift to lower-cost
ways of communicating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skype could be combined with Microsoft software such as
Outlook to appeal to corporate users, while the voice and video
communications could link to Microsoft's Xbox live gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Longer-term, Skype would offer Microsoft another route to
develop its mobile presence, an area it has already put more
energy and resources into as PC usage comes under threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skype is set to become a new business division within
Microsoft with Skype Chief Executive Tony Bates in charge and
reporting directly to Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, Microsoft
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a strategic asset and a defensive move," said BGC
Financial analyst Colin Gillis. "If they can put it on Windows
8, it gives them an advantage. It helps them in the tablet
market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Skype deal is the biggest in the 36-year history of the
world's largest software company. It was first reported late on
Monday by tech blog GigaOM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $8.5 billion price tag was a surprise. Although the sum
would not stretch cash-rich Microsoft, some said it was high
for a company whose ownership has changed several times during
its relatively short life.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In this atmosphere of Internet Bubble 2.0, picking up an
unprofitable online company for roughly 10 times sales probably
seems downright cheap,"" Shanghai-based Michael Clendenin,
managing director of consulting firm RedTech Advisors, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But if you consider (it) was just valued at about $2.5
billion 18 months ago when a chunk was sold off, then $8.5
billion seems generous and means Microsoft has a high wall to
climb to prove to investors that Skype is a necessary linchpin
for the company's online and mobile strategy," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skype, which was formed in 2003, was bought by ebay Inc
(EBAY.O) in 2005 for $3.1 billion. Last year it had in $860
million in revenue but posted a net loss of $7 million,
according to data in its initial public offering filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2009, eBay sold a majority stake in Skype to an investor
group including Silver Lake, the Canada Pension Plan Investment
Board and Andreessen Horowitz for $1.9 billion in cash and a
$125 million note. EBay retained about a third.

      Management Suite, a comprehensive solution that improves compliance and 
      risk management with the ability to isolate, control and record

      Privileged Session Manager&#174; for Virtualization. Specifically, the 
      Privileged Session Manager for Servers enables organizations to control 
      and monitor privileged access to sensitive servers including Windows, 
      Unix/Linux, Mainframes (zOS), iSeries and network devices. It provides 
      full privileged session recording with DVR playback, as well as secure 
      remote access to sensitive systems using privileged single sign-on 
      without having to expose credentials to end-users, including external 
      vendors.

			A Prevnar 13&#174; da Pfizer atende a todos os 
      objetivos de estudo em dois estudos cl&#237;nicos b&#225;sicos de Fase III em 
      adultos na faixa et&#225;ria de 50 anos e maiores de 50 anos, apresentados 
      hoje

      A Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) anunciou hoje que os dados de seus dois estudos 
      cl&#237;nicos b&#225;sicos de seguran&#231;a e imunogenicidade de Fase III da Prevnar 13&#174;*
				(vacina pneumoc&#243;cica conjugada 13-valente [prote&#237;na dift&#233;rica 
      CRM197]) em adultos com 50 anos e com mais de 50 anos 
      atenderam todos os objetivos do estudo. Estes estudos fornecem a base 
      cl&#237;nica para os pedidos normativos que foram entregues nos Estados 
      Unidos, Uni&#227;o Europeia e mais de uma d&#250;zia de outros pa&#237;ses. Os 
      resultados est&#227;o sendo apresentados hoje no 21&#186; Congresso 
      Europeu de Microbiologia Cl&#237;nica e Doen&#231;as Infecciosas e o 27&#186; 
      Congresso Internacional de Quimioterapia (ECCMID/ICC) em Mil&#227;o, It&#225;lia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Destacando os resultados, os dados de ambos os estudos demonstraram que 
      a Prevnar 13 foi pelo menos t&#227;o imunog&#234;nica quanto a vacina 
      polissacar&#237;dica pneumoc&#243;cica n&#227;o-conjugada (PPSV) licenciada atualmente 
      para os doze sorotipos comuns a ambas as vacinas nos grupos de faixas 
      et&#225;rias estudadas, que ainda n&#227;o haviam tomado a vacina pneumoc&#243;cica ou 
      que haviam sido imunizados anteriormente com a PPSV. Al&#233;m disso, os 
      dados dos objetivos secund&#225;rios de ambos os estudos demonstraram que a 
      Prevnar 13 induziu uma resposta de anticorpos funcionais 
      consideravelmente superior do que a PPSV contra uma maioria de sorotipos 
      comuns a ambas as vacinas e o sorotipo 6A, um sorotipo n&#227;o existente na 
      PPSV.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Ambos os estudos b&#225;sicos atenderam os objetivos prim&#225;rios e 
      demonstraram que a Prevnar 13 foi t&#227;o imunog&#234;nica quanto a PPSV com os 
      doze sorotipos que causam doen&#231;as comuns a ambas as vacinas&#8221;, disse Lisa 
      A. Jackson, MD, MPH, investigadora principal do Group Health Research 
      Institute, Seattle, Washington. &#8220;Os dados tamb&#233;m demonstraram que a 
      Prevnar 13 induziu n&#237;veis consideravelmente maiores de anticorpos 
      funcionais do que a PPSV nos adultos estudados, com rela&#231;&#227;o &#224; maioria 
      dos sorotipos comuns&#8221;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A Prevnar 13, baseada na funda&#231;&#227;o cient&#237;fica da Prevnar&#174; 
      (vacina pneumoc&#243;cica conjugada 7-valente [prote&#237;na dift&#233;rica CRM197]), 
      foi apresentada pela primeira vez em dezembro de 2009 na Europa e agora 
      est&#225; aprovada para utiliza&#231;&#227;o em crian&#231;as em mais de 90 pa&#237;ses em todo o 
      mundo. A Prevnar 13, como a Prevnar, utiliza tecnologia de conjuga&#231;&#227;o 
      revolucion&#225;ria da empresa, que tem demonstrado conceder uma alta 
      resposta de anticorpos em crian&#231;as e beb&#234;s.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;A Prevnar 13 representa uma importante realiza&#231;&#227;o cient&#237;fica e estamos 
      entusiasmados com o potencial de definir ainda mais sua utilidade 
      cl&#237;nica com a meta de ampliar os esfor&#231;os de preven&#231;&#227;o de doen&#231;as 
      pneumoc&#243;cicas&#8221;, diz Emilio Emini, PhD, diretor cient&#237;fico executivo, 
      pesquisa de vacinas da Pfizer Inc. &#8220;Os adultos com 50 anos e maiores de 
      50 anos fazem parte de uma popula&#231;&#227;o de alto risco de contrair doen&#231;as 
      pneumoc&#243;cicas, o que imp&#245;e um consider&#225;vel encargo econ&#244;mico e de sa&#250;de

        anos a adultos de 60 a 64 anos, no grupo mais jovem Prevnar 13 foi t&#227;o 
        imunog&#234;nico quanto Prevnar 13 no grupo mais velho, em todos os 
        sorotipos da vacina existentes na vacina. Al&#233;m disso, a resposta de

        O perfil de tolerabilidade e seguran&#231;a da Prevnar 13 foi compar&#225;vel ao 
        da PPSV com todas as faixas et&#225;rias estudadas. Entre participantes de 
        60 a 64 anos de idade, rea&#231;&#245;es locais (por exemplo, incha&#231;o, 
        vermelhid&#227;o, etc.) foram informadas por 82% dos participantes no grupo

      dift&#233;rica CRM197 ]) en adultos de 50 a&#241;os o m&#225;s satisficieron 
      todas las valoraciones finales del estudio. Estos estudios ofrecen el 
      fundamento cl&#237;nico para las presentaciones regulatorias que se han 
      realizado en los Estados Unidos, la Uni&#243;n Europea y m&#225;s de una docena de

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lo m&#225;s interesante de los resultados es que los datos de ambos estudios 
      mostraron que Prevnar 13 fue por lo menos tan inmunog&#233;nica como la 
      vacuna antineumoc&#243;cica de polisac&#225;ridos no conjugada (PPSV) autorizada

      antineumoc&#243;cica o que hab&#237;an sido inmunizados con la PPSV anteriormente. 
      Asimismo, los datos de las valoraciones finales secundarias de ambos 
      estudios mostraron que Prevnar 13 provoc&#243; una respuesta de anticuerpos 
      funcionales estad&#237;stica y significativamente superior a la PPSV contra 
      la mayor&#237;a de los serotipos comunes a ambas vacunas y el serotipo 6A, 
      que no est&#225; contenido en la PPSV.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Los dos estudios centrales cumplieron sus objetivos primarios y 
      demostraron que Prevnar 13 fue por lo menos tan inmunog&#233;nica como la 
      PPSV para los 12 serotipos causantes de enfermedades comunes a ambas 
      vacunas,&#8221; comenta la Dra. Lisa A. Jackson, MPH, investigadora principal, 
      Group Health Research Institute, Seattle, Washington. "Los datos tambi&#233;n 
      mostraron que Prevnar 13 indujo niveles significativamente m&#225;s altos de 
      anticuerpos funcionales que la PPSV en los adultos estudiados para la 
      mayor&#237;a de los serotipos comunes.&#8221;

      innovadora tecnolog&#237;a de conjugaci&#243;n de la empresa que ha demostrado 
      conferir una alta respuesta de anticuerpos en beb&#233;s y ni&#241;os peque&#241;os.

      En los Estados Unidos, Prevnar 13 es una vacuna aprobada para uso en 
      ni&#241;os de 6 semanas de vida hasta 5 a&#241;os de edad (antes del 6to 
      cumplea&#241;os). Prevnar 13 est&#225; indicado para la inmunizaci&#243;n activa para 
      la prevenci&#243;n de la enfermedad invasiva causada por 13 cepas de Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, y 23F). 
      Prevnar 13 tambi&#233;n est&#225; indicado para la prevenci&#243;n de la otitis media 
      (infecci&#243;n del o&#237;do) causada por 7 cepas de Streptococcus pneumoniae 
      (4, 6B, 9V, 14, 18C, 19F, y 23F). No hay datos de eficacia disponibles

			Informaci&#243;n importante de seguridad para 
      Prevnar 13 para uso pedi&#225;trico en los Estados Unidos
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Prevnar 13 no debe administrarse a personas con reacciones al&#233;rgicas 
        severas a cualquier componente de Prevnar 13, Prevnar o a cualquier 
        vacuna que contenga el toxoide difteria.
      
			
        Es posible que Prevnar 13 no proteja a todas las personas que reciban

        sea menor que aquella para la enfermedad invasiva.
      
			
        Los ni&#241;os con un sistema inmunol&#243;gico debilitado pueden presentar una 
        menor respuesta inmunol&#243;gica a Prevnar 13.
      
			
        Se ha observado una pausa temporal de la respiraci&#243;n luego de la 
        vacunaci&#243;n en algunos beb&#233;s prematuros.
      
			
        Los eventos adversos graves informados m&#225;s com&#250;nmente incluyen 
        bronquiolitis (una infecci&#243;n de los pulmones) (0,9%; 1,1%),

        (0,9%; 0,9%) y neumon&#237;a (0,9%; 0,5%) para Prevnar 13 y Prevnar, 
        respectivamente.
      
			
        Los efectos secundarios m&#225;s comunes son enrojecimiento, hinchaz&#243;n y 
        sensibilidad en el lugar de la inyecci&#243;n, fiebre, disminuci&#243;n del 
        apetito, irritabilidad, m&#225;s sue&#241;o y menos sue&#241;o. Debe informar

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY/TOKYO May 10 (Reuters) - Global oil and gas major
Chevron has signed an agreement with JX Nippon Oil and
Energy Corp, an oil refining unit of Japan's JX Holdings
 , for the sale of liquefied natural gas from its Gorgon
Project in Australia.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JX Nippon would receive 0.3 million tonnes per annum of LNG
from the Gorgon Project for 15 years, the two companies said in
separate statements on Tuesday, in line with a basic agreement
reached in December 2009. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $37 billion Gordon project on Barrow Island off Western
Australia, in which Chevron has a 47.3 percent stake, is
expected to produce 15 million tonnes a year, with first gas
scheduled for production in 2014.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JX Nippon, Japan's No.1 oil refiner, has recently started
construction of its first terminal for LNG imports in Hachinohe,
northern Japan, a company spokesman said, aiming to distribute
the Gorgon LNG to corporate customers in the region.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hachinohe import terminal, set to start operation in
April 2015, will have storage capacity of 280,000 kilolitres, or
a little less than 130,000 tonnes. JX Nippon also plans to build
a 10,000 kl inland LNG terminal in Kushiro, on the northern
island of Hokkaido, also due to start operation in April 2015.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JX Nippon currently has a 4,500 kl inland LNG terminal in
Hachinohe, near the northern tip of Japan's main Honshu island,
from which it ships fuel bought in the spot market throughout
northern Japan.

			Chevron and JX Nippon Oil and Energy Corporation Sign LNG Agreement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Agreement for delivery of LNG from Gorgon Project for 15 years
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that its Australian 
      subsidiary has signed a Sales and Purchase Agreement (SPA) with JX 
      Nippon Oil and Energy Corporation for a portion of Chevron's offtake of 
      liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Gorgon Project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the binding agreement, JX Nippon Oil and Energy will receive 0.3 
      million tons per annum (MTPA) of LNG from the Gorgon Project for 15 
      years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      John Gass, president, Chevron Gas and Midstream, welcomed JX Nippon Oil 
      and Energy Corporation as a customer of the Gorgon Project. &#8220;We are 
      pleased to have JX Nippon Oil and Energy as a customer of the Gorgon 
      Project. Chevron has a long-standing relationship with JX Nippon Oil and 
      Energy, and we look forward to continuing to grow our relationship.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Roy Krzywosinski, managing director, Chevron Australia, said, &#8220;The 
      agreement is another step towards commercializing our equity natural gas 
      in Australia, further demonstrating Chevron&#8217;s leading ability to meet 
      long-term demand growth in Asia-Pacific. Construction of the Gorgon 
      Project is progressing well with first gas expected in 2014.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is the operator of the Gorgon Project and holds an approximate 
      47 percent interest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The initial Gorgon Project development, situated in northwestern 
      Australia, will include a three-train, 15 MTPA LNG facility and a 
      domestic gas plant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Laptop computers using Google's Chrome operating system will go on sale in June, as the world's No. 1 Internet search engine challenges Microsoft Corp and Apple on their home turf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Web-centric PCs, made by Samsung and Acer Inc, are Google's latest attempt to change how consumers and companies use their computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bare-bones operating system is essentially a web browser that steers users to use applications like email and spreadsheets directly on the web, instead of storing software such as Outlook or Word directly on PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving day-to-day functions onto the Internet removes the burden of time-consuming tasks associated with traditional PCs, like installing software and updates, backing up files and running antivirus checks, executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The complexity of managing your computer is torturing users," Google cofounder Sergey Brin told reporters.

&lt;p&gt;   * Management will not endorse high-teen ROE target -analyst&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * No new target provided&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Regulatory reform, trading downturn may crimp earnings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lauren Tara LaCapra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc
(GS.N) management appears to be backing down from earlier
return-on-equity targets, citing regulatory uncertainty and
trading volume declines, Barclays Capital analyst Roger Freeman
wrote on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After meeting with senior Goldman executives, Freeman said
the bank is not "endorsing" any return on equity number,
including management's earlier target. The executives would not
provide Freeman with an updated target, nor did they lower
their estimates, saying the outlook is too clouded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not believe that management backing off the prior
20% return on tangible equity target is a surprise to the
market," said Freeman. "At the same time, management declined
to provide a new target due to the widely variable inputs still
outstanding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Return on equity is a measure of how effectively the bank
wrings profit out of its equity capital. Before the financial
crisis struck, Goldman had posted returns on equity above 30
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freeman's comments are the latest signal that it will be
more difficult for Goldman and its Wall Street peers to meet
targets that were set in a more optimistic atmosphere just
after the credit crisis abated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At a conference in November, Chief Executive Lloyd
Blankfein hinted that he was less certain about the outlook for
Goldman's return-on-equity, citing market factors and the need
to hold more capital. Ultimately, he stuck by management's
earlier targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freeman thinks it will take another six to 12 months for
management to provide additional details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs spokesman Stephen Cohen said the bank does
not comment on analyst reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last quarter, Goldman posted an annualized ROE of 14.5
percent, excluding the impact of a one-time charge to
repurchase preferred stock from Berkshire Hathaway Inc

&lt;p&gt; * Billions of dollars more to pay -Bernstein's McDonald&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Analyst cuts 2011 EPS estimate by $0.20, 2012 by $0.10
 (Rewrites throughout; adds detail on JPMorgan's legal
expenses, adds dateline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - Lawsuits stemming from bad
mortgage loans will cost JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) billions
of dollars over coming quarters, a veteran Wall Street analyst
said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank had $7.4 billion of legal expenses last year, and
JPMorgan's chief financial officer believes it could face
similar expenses in the future, wrote John McDonald of
Bernstein Research in a report to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report shows how banks are still suffering from the
financial crisis, as homeowners, bond investors, lenders and
other parties argue over who should bear the losses from bad
mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McDonald reduced his 2011 and 2012 earnings estimates for
JPMorgan, citing legal costs as well as the bank's investments
in its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's legal expenses have been rising in the wake of
the financial crisis. The bank reported $161 million in
expenses for litigation in 2009, and for 2008, when it reduced
reserves, a $781 million benefit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first quarter of this year, the bank recorded $1.1
billion for lawsuit costs, down from $2.9 billion in the same
quarter a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McDonald met Thursday with JPMorgan CFO Doug Braunstein.
The CFO expects the bank's expense base to remain at what
McDonald called "cyclically elevated levels for the foreseeable
future."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Braunstein declined to comment on McDonald's report, said
bank spokesman Howard Opinsky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Braunstein said in an April 13 conference call with
analysts that he did not view first quarter costs for mortgage
foreclosures and litigation "as run-rate expense, but, to be
clear, there could be further costs around this matter before
we are finished."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All big banks are dealing with multiple lawsuits,
government investigations and demands for refunds by investors
in mortgage-related securities in the aftermath of housing
market collapse. JPMorgan disclosed last week that it is in
"advanced discussions" with the staff of the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission to resolve some of those cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said in an April 4
letter to shareholders that the bank will be dealing with legal
issues from the credit market storm "for years to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McDonald cut his estimate for JPMorgan's 2011 earnings per
share by 20 cents to $4.70 and his 2012 estimate by 10 cents to
$5.65. The bank earned $3.96 in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In afternoon trading, JPMorgan shares were down 90 cents or
2 percent to $44.26.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Visa Inc, the world's largest credit and debit card processing network, is building a digital wallet that people can use to pay for things online or with their phones instead of with traditional cards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The network said on Wednesday it is working with several large U.S. and international banks to develop the wallet. Its partners include US Bancorp, PNC Financial Services, Regions Financial, BBT Corp, Toronto Dominion's TD Bank and the U.S. arm of Barclays PLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "digital wallet" will store the banks' customers' credit and debit card account information, both for Visa cards and other cards. People can use the wallet to pay for things online or in stores, Visa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The network will also have to convince merchants to put a new "one-click" button on their websites, so that potential customers can use their Visa digital wallets to buy things by clicking the button instead of by manually entering all of their account information every time they want to make an online purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks, mobile phone operators and networks like Visa are all trying to gain a foothold in the small but high-potential market for U.S. mobile payments. Last week Isis, a separate mobile payments venture run by three of the top four U.S. carriers, said it had modified its initial goals and was now open to working with Visa and MasterCard as it introduces its own mobile wallet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim McCarthy, Visa's head of global products, told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday that mobile payments in the United States "will more easily take off" from people using their smartphones' browsers to buy things online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Visa and its rivals, including MasterCard Inc, American Express Co and Discover Financial Services, are also trying to figure out ways for people to buy things with their phones in physical stores. McCarthy said that a previous, separate Visa pilot to test smartphone payments with Bank of America Corp and other large U.S. banks will be commercially available this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa will roll out the digital wallet in the United States and Canada in fall of 2011. McCarthy would not discuss revenue projections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Francisco-based company is increasingly looking to new technology for growth, in the face of an increasing saturated U.S. credit and debit card market and tightening regulations of that market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa shares were down 1.4 percent at $79.22 on Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Maria Aspan, editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

  (Updates to late morning trade, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks faltered on
Wednesday after a three-day rally as falling crude prices hurt
energy stocks and disappointing Disney earnings dragged down
the Dow industrials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market's decline was broad, with five stocks falling
for every one rising on the New York Stock Exchange. Of the 10
SP 500 sectors, only two defensive sectors -- health care and
consumer staples -- were trading higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy and materials, sectors that have been laggards of
late, led the decline as U.S. crude futures dropped. Concerns
about slowed growth in China hit the cyclical sectors, which
have teetered on worries about global demand. For details. see
[O/R&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Oil prices are down and that is affecting energy stocks
today," said Giri Cherukuri, head trader at OakBrook
Investments in Lisle, Illinois.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP energy sector .GSPE dropped 2.2 percent and was
the worst performing SP sector. Chevron Corp (CVX.N) was off
1.8 percent to $102.45, and Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) lost 1.5
percent to $81.61.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slid 73.87 points,
or 0.58 percent, to 12,686.49. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX fell 6.69 points, or 0.49 percent, to 1,350.47. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC shed 6.92 points, or 0.24
percent, to 2,864.97.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before Wednesday's declines, the benchmark SP had risen
1.7 percent during the three-day run-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow component Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) tumbled 3.8 percent to
$42.26 a day after its quarterly revenues missed expectations.
[ID:nN10126729]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today, I don't think it's any big surprise (the market is
down) with Disney reporting not such good numbers. Boy, they
really missed it," said Terry Morris, senior equity manager for
National Penn Investors Trust Company in Reading,
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the bright spots, Macy's Inc (M.N) jumped 8.3 percent
to $28.51 after its profit topped estimates. The department
store chain also offered an optimistic outlook for the rest of
2011. [ID:nN09240623]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through Wednesday, 450 of the SP 500 companies had
reported, with 69 percent posting results above analysts'
expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; American International Group Inc (AIG.N) gained 4.2 percent
to $30.85 after the insurer and the U.S. Treasury said they
will sell nearly $9 billion in AIG stock. [ID:nN11182986]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest economic report from China showed industrial
output growth eased in April, suggesting the world's
second-biggest economy was cooling, reducing the need for more
monetary policy tightening. But Chinese inflation remained
high. [ID:nL3E7GB0H2]

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa to Offer New Program to Directly Connect Value Added Resellers, 
      Acquirers to Visa&#8217;s Global Network
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New API network connections designed to remove barriers to 
      innovation, enable merchants to take advantage of next generation in 
      payments and value-added services
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced plans to offer merchants a more 
      streamlined connection to Visa&#8217;s global network, allowing them to more 
      easily accept the next generation of payment products, offer real-time 
      rewards, redemptions and discounts and other value-added services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new program is designed to allow Value Added Resellers (VARs), 
      Acquirers and other payment gateway providers serving merchants with 
      payment solutions to directly connect to VisaNet, Visa&#8217;s global 
      processing network, via a flexible XML-based API that is currently in 
      development and expected to be available by summer 2011. This is 
      intended to expedite the delivery of new services and offer merchants a 
      more streamlined payment processing solution, as well as provide direct 
      access to Visa&#8217;s secure, reliable, and information-rich processing 
      services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;More and more merchants are relying on the comprehensive solutions 
      offered by value added resellers and acquirers for their payments 
      processing needs,&#8221; said Darren Parslow, Global Head of Processing, Visa 
      Inc. &#8220;By directly connecting these entities to Visa we can positively 
      impact not only VARs and acquirers but also merchants and consumers. The 
      bottom line is that Visa is working to simplify commerce across a broad 
      range of transaction environments, including ecommerce, mobile, social 
      commerce and point-of-sale.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			How It Works
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa&#8217;s new program, which is expected to be available to qualified 
      partners in the third quarter of 2011, is designed to allow VARs, 
      Acquirers and service providers to directly connect to VisaNet through a 
      robust,&#160;flexible, information-based API using XML. This will enable them 
      to manage and certify to one connection for all payment types, and 
      establish a direct communications access channel for payments and 
      information passing through the processing hub of Visa. This can benefit 
      VARs, acquirers and other payment providers by enabling them to offer 
      merchants access to advanced, real-time processing services and 
      information-based products offered by Visa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new program is intended to benefit VARs, acquirers and merchants in 
      four major areas:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Simplified Processing: By reducing the number of touch points, 
        simplifying communications between the point of sale and VisaNet, and 
        using the latest technology standards for secure data delivery, 
        payments and information can be processed with speed and reliability 
        while also allowing merchants to implement new payment products and 
        services quickly and efficiently.
      
			
				Innovation: The program is designed to remove barriers to 
        innovation and help merchants accept a new generation of payments 
        solutions that will replicate the ease, reliability and security of 
        Visa point-of-sale payments within traditional and digital ecommerce, 
        mobile commerce and burgeoning social networking commerce 
        environments. For example, merchants working with VARs participating 
        in the program will be better able to easily implement support for 
        Visa&#8217;s secure cross-channel digital wallet, which was announced 
        earlier today, and is expected to offer a range of customized mobile 
        payment services that address the specific requirements of geographic 
        markets around the world.
      
			
				Business Growth: For VARs the program can enhance their 
        existing merchant relationships and enable the creation of new 
        relationships through new value-added services made possible by the 
        program. Visa&#8217;s new API network connections will allow merchant to 
        integrate data into the payments process and over time offer new 
        solutions for loyalty, discounts, rewards, recognition that may help 
        them attract and retain customers. Acquirers can take advantage of 
        technology investments being made by Visa and help merchant enhance 
        relationships with their customers.
      
			
				Enhanced Security: Visa is also developing an end-to-end 
        encryption solution to support PCI compliance and help protect 
        customer data in new and emerging payment channels, such as ecommerce 
        and mobile.

after a three-day rally as Disney results weighed on the Dow
industrials and a slide in crude prices hurt energy stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow component Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) tumbled 4.1 percent to

 (Adds detail from interview, background, shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Maria Aspan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 11 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world's
largest credit and debit card processing network, is building a
digital wallet that people can use to pay for things online or
with their phones instead of with traditional cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The network said on Wednesday it is working with several
large U.S. and international banks to develop the wallet. Its
partners include US Bancorp (USB.N), PNC Financial Services
(PNC.N), Regions Financial (RF.N), BBT Corp (BBT.N), Toronto
Dominion's (TD.TO) TD Bank and the U.S. arm of Barclays PLC
(BARC.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "digital wallet" will store the banks' customers'
credit and debit card account information, both for Visa cards
and other cards. People can use the wallet to pay for things
online or in stores, Visa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The network will also have to convince merchants to put a
new "one-click" button on their websites, so that potential
customers can use their Visa digital wallets to buy things by
clicking the button instead of by manually entering all of
their account information every time they want to make an
online purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks, mobile phone operators and networks like Visa are
all trying to gain a foothold in the small but high-potential
market for U.S. mobile payments. Last week Isis, a separate
mobile payments venture run by three of the top four U.S.
carriers, said it had modified its initial goals and was now
open to working with Visa and MasterCard as it introduces its
own mobile wallet. [ID:nN04288600]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jim McCarthy, Visa's head of global products, told Reuters
in an interview on Wednesday that mobile payments in the United
States "will more easily take off" from people using their
smartphones' browsers to buy things online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Visa and its rivals, including MasterCard Inc (MA.N),
American Express Co (AXP.N) and Discover Financial Services
(DFS.N), are also trying to figure out ways for people to buy
things with their phones in physical stores. McCarthy said that
a previous, separate Visa pilot to test smartphone payments
with Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) and other large U.S. banks
will be commercially available this summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa will roll out the digital wallet in the United States
and Canada in fall of 2011. McCarthy would not discuss revenue
projections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The San Francisco-based company is increasingly looking to
new technology for growth, in the face of an increasing
saturated U.S. credit and debit card market and tightening
regulations of that market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa shares were down 1.4 percent at $79.22 on Wednesday
morning.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, May 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SafeList Ventures, Inc., parent company of San Diego-based online
classifieds website, www.SafeList.com, announces the appointment of
former Microsoft Corp. Vice President of Corporate Communications,
Rowland Hanson, to its Advisory Board.

    Hanson is recognized for convincing Bill Gates to launch Microsoft's
flagship product, originally called Interface Manager, under the name of
Windows(TM). The Windows(TM) software went on to dominate the computer
industry and became the graphical user interface of more than 90% of all
personal computers sold worldwide. 

    "I'm thrilled to welcome a marketing legend of Rowland's pedigree to our
company's Advisory Board," said Karim Pirani, founder and CEO of
SafeList. "As we start to rollout SafeList.com outside our San Diego home
base and on to other cities nationwide, Rowland's marketing insights and
acumen will be of tremendous help to us." 

    "I'm delighted to join SafeList.com's Advisory Board," said Hanson, who
is the President and CEO of The HMC Company, a business strategy and
consulting firm. "For a number of years, I have been concerned about the
inherent dangers plaguing the Internet and am especially passionate about
working to secure the safety and security of our young children as they
navigate the web. Precisely for this reason, I'm passionate about helping
SafeList.com provide the solution(s) that should keep our children and
their families safe from online predators." 

    Hanson will collaborate with SafeList.com's management team on branding
and marketing strategies. Also, Hanson's consulting firm will assist the
company in building partnerships with other technology companies and
quickly bring to market the solutions that SafeList.com offers. 

    "Unlike commerce facilitated by websites like eBay and Amazon where the
chance of a physical meeting between the buyer and the seller is almost
zero, transactions facilitated by a classifieds marketplace makes it
almost mandatory for the two parties to meet face-to-face," said Pirani.
"Therefore the need for due diligence is more critical, not less."

		&lt;p&gt;
      Today&#8217;s corporate environment demands that every department adopt the 
      &#8220;Do More with Less&#8221; mantra. In enterprise legal operations that means 
      General Counsel need to effectively balance a growing portfolio of 
      litigation, strict regulatory enforcement, growing risks and heavy 
      penalties while being held to the same operating standards and 
      performance metrics as any other core business unit. Chief Compliance 
      Officers are similarly affected. A new array of regulations has been 
      complicated by hiring freezes, layoffs, and budget cuts. The result has 
      been predictable: more work for compliance officers and their staff with 
      fewer available resources.

			Pfizer Animal Health And American Humane Association Partner To 
      Conduct Research On The Power Of The Human-Animal Bond In Pediatric 
      Cancer Patients
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Multi-site Research Study Will Examine the Outcomes of 
      Animal-Assisted Therapy for Pediatric Cancer Patients and Their Families
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Animal Health and American Humane Association today announced a 
      partnership to conduct a study on the impact of animal-assisted therapy 
      on pediatric oncology patients, as well as on their parents, caregivers, 
      siblings, and other close family members.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The partnership &#8212; which includes a $282,000 grant from Pfizer and the 
      Pfizer Foundation &#8212; exemplifies the strategic goal of both organizations 
      to better quantify in clinical terms what many in health care already 
      realize as the extraordinary power of the human-animal bond.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This important research will measure the impact of animal-assisted 
      therapy on pediatric oncology patients and their families, thus 
      furthering the fields of research on human-animal interaction and 
      integrated therapies for conditions such as cancer in children,&#8221; said J. 
      Michael McFarland, DVM, Diplomate ABVP and Group Director of Veterinary 
      Medical Services  Corporate Citizenship for Pfizer Animal Health. &#8220;We 
      are proud to be part of the work that American Humane Association is 
      doing &#8212; showing the far-reaching benefits of pets to our society.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This partnership with American Humane Association&#8217;s Child Protection 
      Research Center and Animal-Assisted Therapy Program is an example of the 
      Pfizer Animal Health Commitment to Veterinarians platform &#8212; which 
      addresses the many challenges facing the veterinary profession through 
      training and education, research and development, investing in the 
      future, philanthropic efforts and the development of understanding 
      around the human-animal bond.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Over the next three years, American Humane Association and Pfizer Animal 
      Health will work with a total of 150 children at up to five hospitals or 
      clinical settings throughout the United States that treat children with 
      cancer. Researchers will examine the medical, behavioral and mental 
      health benefits of animal-assisted therapy to quantify the effect on the 
      family as a whole.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Anyone who has ever seen a child turn to her pet for solace during a 
      difficult time knows that a beneficial interaction is taking place 
      there,&#8221; said Robin R. Ganzert, Ph.D., president and chief executive 
      officer of American Humane Association. &#8220;Our goal is to fully 
      understand, from a scientific perspective, what is happening in these 
      types of interactions with children undergoing cancer treatment. The 
      question we are looking to answer is: In what ways can animal-assisted 
      therapy improve the health and well-being of children &#8212; and their 
      families &#8212; in their fight against cancer?&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Animal Health also has recently become a Founding Partner in 
      HABRI (Human Animal Bond Research Initiative) Foundation, which will 
      deliver data, a central hub of research, awareness and evidence-based 
      education about the impact of the human-animal bond. And, in 2009, 
      Pfizer Animal Health funded a study to be completed this year that will 
      formally measure clinical outcomes from therapy dog interactions with 
      adult patients in inpatient oncology treatment and outpatient 
      chemotherapy infusion settings. The study is being led by the Good Dog 
      Foundation at the Continuum Cancer Centers of New York at Beth Israel 
      Medical Center.

      a secure cross-channel digital wallet and a range of customized mobile 
      payments services that address the specific requirements of geographic 
      markets around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our new solutions deliver greater consumer choice, convenience and 
      control while helping our clients grow their businesses. By helping to 
      reduce abandoned online shopping carts and bringing new account holders 
      into the Visa network, we create a win-win-win for merchants, consumers 
      and financial institutions,&#8221; noted Joseph W. Saunders, Chairman and 
      Chief Executive Officer of Visa Inc. &#8220;In addition, we believe Visa&#8217;s new 
      payments products and services will help expand financial inclusion to 
      the billions of mobile subscribers today who currently lack access to 
      traditional financial services.&#8221;

			Simplifying Commerce in Complex Economies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In certain countries with established electronic payments 
      infrastructures, expansive Internet usage and broad mobile network 
      penetration, Visa will be introducing a digital wallet and services 
      platform. The digital wallet will store Visa and non-Visa payments 
      accounts, support NFC payments through the innovative Visa payWave 
      application and deliver a wide range of transaction services to 
      accommodate multiple commerce scenarios&#8212;including eCommerce, mobile 
      commerce, micropayments, social networks and person-to-person payments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa is working with leading payments card issuers, community banks, 
      credit unions, acquirers, payments processors and merchants to launch 
      the digital wallet. Among the financial institutions and organizations 
      supporting Visa&#8217;s wallet strategy are:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Barclaycard US

		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa expects to launch the digital wallet in the U.S. and Canada in fall 
      2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key features of the wallet are expected to include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Click-to-buy: Shop conveniently and securely by simply entering 
        an email address, alias or online ID and password, instead of a 
        billing address, account number and expiration date. In addition, Visa 
        is exploring dynamic authentication technologies that will bring added 
        layers of security to online purchases.
      
			
				Cross-channel payments solution: The wallet consolidates 
        multiple Visa and non-Visa payments accounts and can be used in 
        mobile, eCommerce, social network and retail point-of-sale 
        environments.
      
			
				Preference management: A menu that enables consumers to set 
        preferences for how their wallet will work, allowing them to customize 
        and control the features of their personal wallet from privacy 
        settings to designating which account will be accessed based on 
        merchant type or purchase amount.
      
			
				Merchant offers: A service that allows consumers to personalize 
        their shopping experience by opting-in to receive money-saving 
        discounts or promotions from participating merchants.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The widespread adoption of Internet and mobile technology is changing 
      the way people connect and transact across the globe, so we&#8217;re focused 
      on delivering locally-tailored payments products and services,&#8221; said 
      Saunders. &#8220;We are introducing new solutions for eCommerce and mobile 
      devices that provide the same &#8216;Visa-quality&#8217; experience&#8212;convenience, 
      reliability and security&#8212;people enjoy when using their Visa cards at a 
      retail location. In doing so, we are accelerating the global shift to 
      digital payments by harnessing our brand, products, network and 50-plus 
      years of payments experience.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mobilizing Payments in Emerging Economies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In certain emerging geographic markets with significant mobile 
      penetration, Visa will work with financial institutions and 
      mobile-network operators to provide consumers with a secure, reliable 
      and globally accepted form of payment and the ability to transfer and 
      receive funds, manage financial accounts or top-up wireless air time 
      using their mobile handset. The wide range of features and functions 
      being developed for the digital wallet will allow Visa to pursue a 
      number of strategies to tailor or bundle services to local needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        In countries like India and Russia, where card issuance and mobile 
        subscriptions are high, but card usage is relatively low, Visa will 
        help drive account activation and usage by working with financial 
        institutions and mobile operators to link existing card portfolios 
        with mobile devices to give handsets payments functionality.
      
			
        In countries within Africa and the Middle East where mobile device 
        usage is high and traditional electronic payments infrastructure is 
        less developed, Visa will work with mobile network operators to link 
        new virtual mobile prepaid Visa accounts to mobile phone numbers to 
        enable cash-in, cash-out, personal payments and mobile payments 
        &#8212;including bill payments and wireless airtime top-up. Visa also 
        intends to connect existing &#8220;closed loop&#8221; mobile money services that 
        today provide basic mobile banking and payments services to unbanked 
        and under-banked consumers to its global, open loop network&#8212;VisaNet. 
        The integration will open closed loop systems, and provide consumers 
        and merchants with unprecedented scale, functionality and acceptance 
        beyond their existing local geographic footprints.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Across all emerging geographic markets, Visa&#8217;s sophisticated payments 
      technology and significant work in establishing global payments 
      standards will aid in navigating the complexity of the myriad of network 
      operators, handset models and operating systems in use globally, helping 
      to enable millions of new and existing Visa account holders to simply 
      use mobile technology for payments services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Innovation, Acquisitions and Partnerships 
      Expand Capabilities of Visa Network
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa is developing its next generation services by integrating VisaNet, 
      its global processing network, leading credit, debit, prepaid and 
      commercial product platforms, new capabilities it has acquired through 
      its subsidiaries CyberSource, Authorize.net and PlaySpan, and the unique 
      expertise and services of key commercial partners. In deploying flexible 
      solutions that are locally relevant and globally interoperable, Visa 
      aims to attract more participants to its network and better enable them 
      to connect and transact.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our build, buy and partner approach puts Visa in a unique position to 
      deliver the speed-to-market and scalable solutions needed to stay ahead 
      of new demands created by the convergence of Internet, mobile and 
      electronic payments technologies,&#8221; said Saunders. &#8220;Visa and our 
      subsidiaries are working with financial institutions, merchants, mobile 
      network operators, and innovative technology providers to bring new ways 
      to pay and be paid to more consumers and merchants around the globe.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Former Senior Execs from eBay, Oracle and Visa Unveil Latest Venture: 
      FreeMonee, World&#8217;s First National Gift Network
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Silicon Valley E-commerce and Banking Veterans Have Raised $11 
      Million From Opus Capital Ventures, Redpoint Ventures, Sutter Hill 
      Ventures and Others
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A team of veterans from some of the biggest companies in banking, retail 
      and e-commerce &#8211; including former eBay 
      and Best 
      Buy CMO Mike Linton, former Visa 
      executive Jim Taschetta and ClairMail 
      founder Joe Salesky &#8211; today announced at FinovateSpring 
      2011, the launch of FreeMonee, 
      the first-of-its-kind national cash-gift network.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Led by CEO and Silicon Valley entrepreneur Gadi Maier, FreeMonee has 
      raised $11 million in initial funding from Opus 
      Capital Ventures, Redpoint 
      Ventures, Sutter 
      Hill Ventures, Pinnacle Ventures and Contrarian 
      Group, the fund directed by Peter Ueberroth. Ueberroth also serves 
      on FreeMonee&#8217;s Board of Directors with former Levi 
      Strauss CEO Phil Marineau.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			What is FreeMonee?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FreeMonee enables merchants to give &#8220;gifts&#8221; directly to individual 
      credit and debit cardholders through participating financial 
      institutions. FreeMonee gifts are cash incentives that function like a 
      gift card on an individual&#8217;s debit or credit card. With FreeMonee gifts, 
      consumers can purchase anything they choose at the designated merchant 
      -- no strings attached -- by simply using their debit or credit card.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FreeMonee is unique because it delivers high value gifts to the right 
      consumers at scale. FreeMonee&#8217;s proprietary and patent-pending Adaptive 
      Matching Technology (AMT) makes this possible. The AMT analyzes the 
      transaction data of hundreds of millions of debit and credit card 
      holders &#8211; while protecting privacy &#8211; and precisely matches merchant 
      gifts with profitable consumer prospects that are likely to redeem based 
      on previous purchasing patterns and predictive analytics. The AMT system 
      is optimized to maximize consumer satisfaction, merchant ROI and network 
      profitability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The financial institutions deliver the FreeMonee gift notifications to 
      their customers via their normal communication channels. Banks receive a 
      success fee for each gift redeemed, creating a significant, new 
      consumer-friendly revenue stream to help replace lost income. FreeMonee 
      gifts also provide banks the opportunity to strengthen consumer 
      engagement and satisfaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The last major banking innovation that truly benefited financial 
      institutions, merchants and consumers alike was the credit card, 
      introduced in the 1970s,&#8221; said Gadi Maier, CEO and President of 
      FreeMonee. &#8220;FreeMonee, and the technology that powers it, is 
      revolutionizing the bank-merchant-consumer dynamic, enabling each to 
      benefit the other. Our AMT gives banks and retailers the ability to give 
      customers exactly what they want &#8211; gifts they will use with no strings 
      attached &#8211; while minimizing the risk that had previously made such 
      powerful purchasing incentives impossible. Merchants get net, new 
      profitable visits and banks receive a significant new source of 
      consumer-friendly revenue.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FreeMonee has agreements in place with two of the top six card issuers 
      and is working closely with several others. The first program launch is 
      expected in summer 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Banks have been waking up to the opportunity to leverage their 
      transaction data to meet, on the one hand, privacy-conscious consumers&#8217; 
      appetite for highly relevant offers, and on the other hand, brands and 
      retailers&#8217; quest for spending their marketing dollars more effectively,&#8221; 
      explains Gwenn B&#233;zard, research director at Aite Group. &#8220;FreeMonee is 
      squarely positioned to help banks compete for marketing dollars along 
      with Google and Groupon. While not the first vendor to enter the 
      merchant-funded incentives space, FreeMonee is bringing to market a very 
      unique solution, differentiating, for instance, by its focus on true, 
      no-catch, cash gifts. FreeMonee is breaking the ground for a new 
      category of its own within the merchant funded incentives space.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      industries, with decades of experience leading some of the world&#8217;s most 
      successful companies.

			ABOUT FREEMONEE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FreeMonee is the world&#8217;s first national gift network &#8211; we connect 
      millions of credit and debit cardholders from the world&#8217;s largest 
      financial institutions with national and local merchants. The merchants 
      offer FreeMonee gifts &#8211; cash incentives &#8211; to individual cardholders 
      through their financial institutions. FreeMonee gifts function like a 
      gift card on an individual&#8217;s debit or credit card, allowing consumers to 
      purchase anything they want with the designated merchant, with no 
      strings attached. FreeMonee anonymously matches consumers to the gifts 
      using their proprietary Adaptive Matching Technology that analyzes card 
      transaction data to identify the highest value consumers for merchants. 
      FreeMonee&#8217;s AMT engine lives within the firewall of the financial 
      institution, which means neither FreeMonee nor the merchants ever have 
      access to a cardholder&#8217;s personal information. Consumer privacy is 
      maintained at all times.

&lt;p&gt;DHAKA May 11 (Reuters) - Bangladesh has asked U.S-based oil
company Chevron (CVX.N) to raise gas production in the country
by 500 million cubic feet (mmcft) a day to offset acute
shortages, a government adviser said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  "We have asked Chevron to increase production by at least
500 mmcft a day by the end of 2012 to ease ever growing energy
demand and boost our economy," said Tawfiq-e-Elahi Chowdhury, an
energy adviser to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Shortages have forced state-run Bangladesh Oil, Gas and
Mineral Corporation, or Petrobangla, to stop making new gas
connections to industrial and manufacturing firms since July
2009, ultimately affecting the growth of the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Natural gas connections to households have been suspended
since July 2010. Gas rationing has been rampant, and compressed
natural gas (CNG) filling stations are kept closed four hours a
day to cope with the supply shortfall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Chevron said it supported Bangladesh's goal of maximizing
its energy supply by investing in projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "We are using leading-edge technology to explore for and
develop resources, and we are developing economically important
energy projects to support production growth," said Gareth
Johnstone, media adviser for Asia Pacific of Chevron
International Pte. Ltd, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Bangladesh produces about 2,000 mmcft gas a day, compared
with demand of more than 2,500 mmcft a day, Chowdury said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  He said Chevron would increase output from three of its
producing gas fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Johnstone said Chevron was constructing a new pipeline
compressor station at Muchai, which was about 75 percent
complete and was planned for an early 2012 start-up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The Muchai Compressor project will increase the capacity of
the national pipeline system to transport gas from existing
Chevron wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  He refused to disclose the cost of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "We are working very closely with the government to help
solve the energy crisis in Bangladesh," he said in the
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Petrobangla plans to build a 100 kilometre pipeline at a
cost of $250 million to facilitate gas distribution, a senior
official of the state company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Reporting by Serajul Islam Quadir; Editing by Anis Ahmed

			Parallels Server for Mac 4.0 Mac mini Edition Launch Lets Businesses 
      Run Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and Linux Environments Side-by-Side on 
      an Apple Mac mini
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Parallels today announced the launch of Parallels Server for Mac 4.0 Mac 
      mini Edition (www.parallels.com/macmini), 
      a new edition of its one-of-a-kind Mac server virtualization solution 
      optimized for Mac minis running Mac OS X server software. Parallels 
      Server for Mac 4.0 Mac mini Edition lets businesses turn an Apple Mac 
      mini server running Mac OS X Server into a multi-purpose platform 
      capable of running Mac OS X, Microsoft Windows and Linux operating 
      systems and their applications side by side. Tailored specifically for 
      small businesses that need to consolidate a few servers, Parallels makes 
      it simple to provide mission-critical software on a cost-effective Mac 
      mini.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Businesses are increasingly taking advantage of the Mac mini as an 
      affordable alternative to traditional servers. Smart organizations can 
      get even more performance and savings from their Mac mini server by 
      using Parallels Server for Mac 4.0 Mac mini Edition to run multiple 
      operating systems and applications on the same box,&#8221; said Kim Johnston, 
      Vice President of Marketing at Parallels. &#8220;Businesses can reduce their 
      need for different hardware platforms, saving space, power and 
      administration time, while easily adding new services without the need 
      to increase the budget for additional hardware purchases.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our business has used a Mac mini as a primary server for a few years, 
      but we also had to run a separate Windows server for applications such 
      as Microsoft Exchange and SharePoint. Thanks to Parallels Server for Mac 
      4.0 Mac mini Edition, we consolidated everything onto our Mac mini and 
      saved money, space and time. One of our favorite features is remote 
      administration of the Parallels Management Console for easy deployment 
      and backing up of virtual machines,&#8221; said Bruce Rubin, owner and 
      developer of Radical Design Software and Oribus.
    &lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Parallels Server 4.0 Mac mini Edition is the only server virtualization 
      solution optimized for Apple server hardware. Its features, capabilities 
      and benefits include:

        Consolidate Microsoft Exchange, SharePoint, SQL Server and other 
        Windows Server applications directly on your Mac mini

      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), weltweit f&#252;hrend bei elektronischen Zahlungen, hat 
      heute eine neue Generation von Zahlungsm&#246;glichkeiten angek&#252;ndigt, mit 
      denen das Bezahlen im traditionellen und digitalen E-Commerce, Mobile 
      Commerce und dem aufkommenden Handel in sozialen Netzwerken so einfach,

		&lt;p&gt;
      Die voraussichtlichen wichtigsten Merkmale dieser Technik:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Click-to-buy: Komfortabel und sicher einkaufen durch Eingabe 
        einer E-Mail-Adresse, eines Online-Nicks oder eines Benutzernamens und 
        eines Passworts anstelle von Rechnungsadresse, Kontonummer und 
        G&#252;ltigkeitsdatum. Au&#223;erdem untersucht Visa Technologien zur 
        dynamischen Authentifizierung, die f&#252;r noch mehr Sicherheit bei 
        Online-Eink&#228;ufen sorgen werden.
      
			
				Kanal&#252;bergreifende Zahlungsm&#246;glichkeiten: Das E-Wallet vereint 
        mehrere Visa- und Fremdzahlungskonten und kann f&#252;r Mobile Commerce, 
        E-Commerce, soziale Netzwerke und im Handel verwendet werden.
      
			
				Einstellungsverwaltung: Kunden k&#246;nnen in einem Men&#252; einstellen, 
        wie ihr E-Wallet funktionieren soll, wodurch es m&#246;glich wird, die 
        Funktionen ihres pers&#246;nlichen E-Wallets anzupassen &#8211; von 
        Datenschutzeinstellungen bis hin zur Einstellung, welches Konto f&#252;r 
        welchen Handelstyp oder Kaufbetrag verwendet werden soll.
      
			
				Angebote f&#252;r H&#228;ndler: Ein Dienst, der es Verbrauchern 
        erm&#246;glicht, ihre Einkaufserfahrung zu individualisieren, indem sie 
        Rabatte und Sonderangebote von teilnehmenden H&#228;ndlern erhalten.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Die breite Akzeptanz von Internet und Mobiltechnologie ver&#228;ndert die 
      Art und Weise, wie Menschen weltweit miteinander in Kontakt kommen und 
      Gesch&#228;fte abwickeln, also konzentrieren wir uns darauf, Zahlungsprodukte

      so Saunders. &#8222;Wir f&#252;hren neue L&#246;sungen f&#252;r E-Commerce und mobile 
      Endger&#228;te mit der bekannten Visa-Qualit&#228;t &#8211; Komfort, Zuverl&#228;ssigkeit und 
      Sicherheit &#8211; ein, die unsere Kunden beim Einkaufen im Gesch&#228;ft so 
      sch&#228;tzen. Mit unserer Marke, unseren Produkten, unserem Netzwerk und 
      unseren mehr als 50 Jahren Erfahrung bei Zahlungen beschleunigen wir den 
      weltweiten Wechsel zu digitalen Zahlungsmethoden.&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In Schwellenl&#228;ndern Zahlungen mobilisieren
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In bestimmten Schwellenl&#228;ndern mit starker Verbreitung von 
      Mobilfunktechnologien wird Visa mit Finanzinstituten und Netzbetreibern 
      zusammenarbeiten, um den Verbrauchern eine sichere, zuverl&#228;ssige und 
      weltweit akzeptierte Zahlungsmethode sowie die M&#246;glichkeit zu bieten, 
      Geld zu senden und zu empfangen, Finanzkonten zu verwalten oder Guthaben 
      mit dem Mobilfunkger&#228;t aufzuladen. Die Vielzahl der Funktionen, die f&#252;r 
      das Cyberwallet entwickelt werden, erlauben es Visa, verschiedene 
      Strategien zu verfolgen, um die angebotenen Dienste auf die lokalen 
      Bed&#252;rfnisse abzustimmen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        In L&#228;ndern wie Indien oder Russland, in denen viele Karten ausgegeben 
        werden und Handys weit verbreitet sind, aber Karten relativ wenig 
        genutzt werden, wird Visa in Zusammenarbeit mit Finanzinstituten und 
        Netzbetreibern daran arbeiten, die Kontenaktivierungsrate und -nutzung 
        durch die Verkn&#252;pfung bestehender Kartenportfolios mit mobilen 
        Endger&#228;ten zu erh&#246;hen, indem diese mit einer Bezahlfunktion 
        ausger&#252;stet werden.
      
			
        In L&#228;ndern des Nahen Ostens und Afrikas sind mobile Endger&#228;te weit 
        verbreitet, aber die Infrastruktur f&#252;r herk&#246;mmliche elektronische 
        Zahlungen ist unterentwickelt. Deshalb wird Visa mit 
        Mobilfunknetzbetreibern zusammenarbeiten, um neue virtuelle mobile 
        Visa-Prepaid-Konten mit Mobiltelefonnummern zu verkn&#252;pfen und so 
        Zahlungseingang, Zahlungsausgang, pers&#246;nliche Zahlungen und mobile 
        Zahlungen (auch Rechnungszahlungen und Aufladen des Guthabens) zu 
        erm&#246;glichen. Visa will au&#223;erdem bereits existierende &#8222;geschlossene&#8220; 
        mobile Gelddienste, die ihren Kunden ohne oder nur mit ungen&#252;gendem 
        Zugang zu Banken heute nur einfaches mobiles Banking und Bezahldienste 
        erm&#246;glichen, mit dem weltweiten offenen Netzwerk VisaNet verkn&#252;pfen. 
        Diese Integration &#246;ffnet geschlossene Systeme und bietet Verbrauchern 
        und H&#228;ndlern v&#246;llig neue Funktionen, einen gr&#246;&#223;eren Umfang und 
        Akzeptanz &#252;ber ihre lokale Pr&#228;senz hinaus.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      In allen Schwellenl&#228;ndern werden die fortschrittliche Bezahltechnologie 
      von Visa und der bedeutende Beitrag zur Etablierung weltweiter 
      Zahlungsstandards dabei helfen, die Komplexit&#228;t der unz&#228;hligen 
      Netzbetreiber, Handymodelle und Betriebssysteme weltweit zu reduzieren 
      und f&#252;r Millionen von neuen und bestehenden Visa-Kontoinhabern eine 
      einfache Nutzung von Mobilfunktechnologien f&#252;r Bezahldienste zu 
      erm&#246;glichen.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Innovation, Akquisitionen und Partnerschaften 
      machen das Visa-Netzwerk leistungsf&#228;higer

      Visa entwickelt zurzeit eine neue Generation von Dienstleistungen, indem 
      VisaNet, das globale Abwicklungsnetzwerk, die f&#252;hrenden Plattformen f&#252;r 
      Kredit-, Debit-, Prepaidkarten und kommerzielle Produkte, durch die 
      Tochterunternehmen CyberSource, Authorize.net und PlaySpan akquirierte 
      neue Ressourcen und die einzigartigen Kenntnisse und Dienste der 
      wichtigsten Handelspartner vereint werden. Durch die Bereitstellung 
      flexibler L&#246;sungen, die lokal wirksam und global kompatibel sind, will

&lt;p&gt; * Bulls see upside once regulatory, market challenges pass&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Bears say Goldman's litigation risk is too high
 (Adds details on SEC, DOJ comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lauren Tara LaCapra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc's
(GS.N) shares traded near a nine-month low on Thursday as
investors were spooked by the bank's potential legal
liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares dropped as much as 4.9 percent, before
regaining some lost ground and closing down 3.5 percent at
$142.75. The stock was last at such levels in August 2010 and
traded at about $160 in the beginning of April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The recent sell-off began ahead of Goldman's first-quarter
earnings report in April, which failed to please investors. The
decline accelerated in recent weeks on investor concerns about
the threat of prosecution for Goldman's actions during the
financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Bloomberg poll released on Thursday indicated that 54
percent of traders, investors and analysts have a negative view
of the company. But some contrarians see the recent sell-off as
a buying opportunity. Here is a look at both perspectives:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steve Shafer, chief investment officer for the Oklahoma
City-based hedge fund Covenant Investors, said he was actively
buying Goldman shares on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shafer argues that Goldman has unmatched talent in trading
and banking on Wall Street. He thinks buying the stock today
will seem prescient once the regulatory and economic landscape
becomes clearer, and the negative headlines about Goldman Sachs
have dissipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is volatile, it's short-term, it's highly
psychologically influenced," said Shafer. "For us, this is a
buying opportunity. We will be adding to positions today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Covenant manages $270 million in assets and had initially
bought Goldman shares for one long-term value fund out of the
six it manages. But Shafer said Covenant was buying Goldman
shares for its other funds on Thursday as well, because of
attractive prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shafer expects the bulk of Covenant's Goldman position to
be held for a period of three to five years. He thinks the
stock is cheap based on several metrics, including
price-to-book ratio, price-to-earnings and cash flow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We look at Goldman as a long-term investment, as opposed
to a trade," he said, adding that Covenant is seeking returns
of 15 percent to 20 percent in the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SELL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jason Ware, who keeps track of Goldman's stock for mutual
fund firm Albion Financial Group, says a combination of
business challenges, regulatory pressures and high litigation
costs make Goldman shares too risky to buy right now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ware points out that Goldman's first-quarter report showed
that the company has been struggling to boost revenue. Subdued
market activity and hefty competition have put pressure on
Goldman's trading and banking businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst is also wary of intense scrutiny on Goldman
Sachs from lawmakers and regulatory agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is currently being investigated by the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory
Authority and Massachusetts state regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange
Commission are reviewing a Senate subcommittee report to see
whether they want to investigate further or pursue charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company settled civil fraud charges with the SEC last
year for $550 million related to a crisis-era derivatives deal.
A critical report from the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations last month brought similar issues to the fore
once again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a stock that we don't have any interest in taking a
position in because of the ongoing legal action around the
firm," said Ware. "It's just not a good time, in our view, to
be involved in the shares."

 (Adds background, permit approvals, Saudi rig contracts)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAN FRANCISCO, May 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
plans to move a deepwater rig to the U.S. Gulf of Mexico next
year, owner Transocean Ltd (RIGN.VX) (RIG.N)
 said, marking a planned
addition to the region's fleet after months of departures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newly built Deepwater Champion, which will spend the
next year and a half in the Black Sea working for Exxon at a
record rate of $703,000 per day, is then set to move to the
U.S. Gulf in December 2012, according to the Transocean
fleet update out on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ultra-deepwater rig is set to earn $640,000 per day for
three years once it gets to the Gulf of Mexico to work for
Exxon, Transocean added. Both rates were agreed last year, but
Exxon had held out the possibility of moving the Champion to
Brazil instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seven of the 30-plus deepwater rigs working in the Gulf of
Mexico moved away, some temporarily, due to the U.S. deepwater
drilling moratorium that followed the BP (BP.L) well blow-out
that destroyed a Transocean rig in April 2010. [ID:nN27265554]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fears of a steady rig exodus may be subsiding now that the
U.S. regulator has started issuing deepwater permits for the
Gulf, including this week's approval of a plan for five
exploratory wells and three previously approved wells to be
drilled by Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L). [ID:nN1297651]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late on Thursday, Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said it received
approval for its Buckskin well, which it had planned to start
drilling last year. [ID:nN30166184]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also in Transocean's fleet update on Thursday, the company
said Saudi Aramco agreed to contracts for four shallow-water
rigs at $73,000 per day, down from their previous $164,000 day
rates, for periods running at more than three years each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saudi Aramco indicated a few months before that it planned
to quickly boost its oil-drilling rig count by 30 percent to
give it additional spare production capacity. [ID:nN28213196]

&lt;p&gt; * Ecuadoreans can meet with their lawyers -Appeals court&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chevron fights to prevent enforcement&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Basil Katz&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on
Thursday modified a lower court order that barred Ecuadorean
villagers from collecting an $8.6 billion award against Chevron
Corp (CVX.N) for polluting the Amazon rain forest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
2nd Circuit in New York, in a terse ruling, relaxed rules in
the order to allow plaintiffs' lawyers to meet with their
clients and raise funds to fight Chevron in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The order, issued in March by U.S. District Judge Lewis
Kaplan in New York, was just one development in a 17-year legal
battle in which rain forest residents say Texaco, bought by
Chevron in 2001, is responsible for hazardous oil-drilling
waste dumped on their land in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron says Texaco cleaned up all waste pits for which it
was responsible before turning the sites over to state-owned
oil company Petroecuador, which still operates in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Plaintiff lawyer James Tyrrell had asked the judges to
narrow the order to allow "legal advice and funding."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the appeals court panel on Thursday denied a request
to immediately freeze Kaplan's order, it did approve the
Ecuadorean's request to fast-track the appeals process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We were very pleased with the ruling today," Tyrrell
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The appeals court ruling added that the Ecuadoreans and
their lawyers were still barred from seeking to enforce the
damages award or obtain any proceeds from seizing assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron attorney Randy Mastro said that aspect of the
appeals court ruling was a victory for the oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're very gratified that we'll have the chance to expose
the travesty of justice that occurred in Ecuador at trial in
the Southern District of New York later this year," Mastro
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Ecuadorean court in February ruled against Chevron, but
enforcement of the damage claim was stopped by Kaplan, who
issued a preliminary injunction preventing the plaintiffs from
trying to collect on the judgment outside Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his March 7 ruling, Kaplan noted that the damages had
more than doubled from $8.6 billion originally to about $18
billion  because Chevron failed to make a public apology and
when a payment to the Amazon Defense Front is included.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has no assets in Ecuador, but the second-largest
U.S. oil company worries that the plaintiffs will try to
collect on the judgment in other countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So in anticipation of a judgment in Ecuador in favor of the
Ecuadorean farmers, Chevron asked Kaplan to step in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Chevron Corp v. Steven Donziger et al, U.S.
District Court for the Southern District of New York, No.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The National Retail Federation is calling for comprehensive reform to 
      the antiquated visa process that has cost the U.S. economy billions of 
      dollars. To help advance these measures, NRF has joined the Discover 
      America Partnership, a broad coalition to advance visa and reentry 
      reforms for international travel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The visa process is broken and is in desperate need of reform,&#8221; said 
      NRF President and CEO Matthew Shay. &#8220;We need a visa policy that will 
      bring visitors from the fastest growing countries to the U.S. to help 
      generate jobs and bolster economic growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A new report issued by the U.S. Travel Association outlines how 
      common-sense reforms that are relatively easy to implement could create 
      1.3 million more U.S. jobs and add $859 billion to the U.S. economy by 
      2020 &#8211; all with little or no cost to taxpayers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's civilian government issued visas to more than 400 Americans without army security clearances starting in early 2010, possibly enabling the CIA to boost its presence, in a move that angered the country's powerful military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details of the visa decision emerged after Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in his compound in the garrison town of Abbottabad on May 2, straining already uneasy ties between strategic allies Islamabad and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The granting of the visas has also fueled tension between the military and the unstable nuclear-armed country's civilian leaders, whose relations are uneasy at the best of times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistani cooperation is crucial for U.S. efforts to combat Islamist militants and bring stability to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the United States has had doubts about Islamabad's commitment and, given the contacts that Pakistan's spy agency has had with Islamist militants in the past, almost certainly uses its own operatives to collect intelligence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistani diplomatic missions in Washington, the United Arab Emirates and London issued the visas after the government came under intense U.S. pressure, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the end of 2009, a special presidential order was issued to give 7,000 visas and the same order was passed through the prime minister's office to Mr. Haqqani," a senior Pakistani security official told Reuters, referring to Pakistan's ambassador in the United States, Husain Haqqani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the basis of these orders, the visas which were valid for three to six months were issued without the scrutiny or routine security clearance of the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISI is the military's main spy agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 450 of those visas were issued to the CIA, the security official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A senior official at the Pakistani Embassy in Washington said the embassy had received no complaint from any branch of the Pakistani government regarding the government's official visa policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for President Asif Ali Zardari declined to comment on details of the visa decision, saying only that security clearance was not always needed from the army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The army did not respond to a request for information on the visas, but a senior security official said, "We lost control of CIA operatives in Pakistan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Army generals, who have ruled Pakistan for more than half of its history, largely direct security and foreign policy even when civilian administrations are in power, as is the case now, and they do not like to be challenged on those agendas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MILITARY 'HOPPING MAD'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ties between the United States and Pakistan reached a low point this year after Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor and former U.S. special forces member, shot dead two Pakistanis in the city of Lahore in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis, who said he acted in self-defense, was freed in March after "blood money" -- compensation to the families of those killed -- was paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayesha Siddiqa, author of "Military Inc," a book on the military's economic might, said it was clear why army chief Ashfaq Kayani and the head of the ISI were "hopping mad" over the Davis case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because somebody in the Pakistani political government had allowed X number of CIA operatives to come into Pakistan and set up parallel operations to sneak into what was going on," she told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second security official said the military was angered by the move and as a result the number of Americans in the country who had received the visas had been reduced by 50 percent. But those who remained were cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will affect the already tense relations between the two countries. This indicates the lack of trust and mutual understanding, which will ultimately benefit the militants and extremist elements inside Pakistan," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (the security establishment) lost track of most of the people who came in. Their missions were not clearly stated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former Interior Ministry official said it had been bypassed as well when the visas were issued. Haqqani said the issue had been blown out of proportion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, the 7000 figure is incorrect  official records prove hype on subject is totally fabricated. All procedures followed," he said on his Twitter page on May 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Embassy declined comment on suggestions the visas may have enabled the CIA to expand its presence in Pakistan, which receives billions of dollars in U.S. military aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We submit full and complete visa applications to the government of Pakistan. We comply in providing the information requested," said an embassy spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials have complained in the past about hundreds of Pakistani visa delays, saying this could hamper aid intended to stabilize the Islamabad government and help Pakistanis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Islamabad has cut by more than half a visa backlog affecting U.S. officials and contractors needed to run American aid programs aimed at combating extremism there, a State Department official said in March of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Finance Ministry adviser Sakib Sherani said U.S. officials made visa requests for people needed to audit requests made under a Coalition Support Fund that was established after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States to reimburse Pakistan for help in fighting militancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That account was confirmed by the second senior security official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We resisted and said, 'You don't need 450 (to audit the fund requests).' Then they said they needed other technical people," said Sherani, who said he took part in some of the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An intelligence official in Lahore said Pakistani authorities began to get suspicious after they noticed a large number of people who appeared to be Americans driving bullet-proof sport utility vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kamran Haider, John Chalmers, Chris Allbritton and Mark Hosenball and Missy Ryan in Washington; Editing by Robert Birsel and Peter Cooney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Two analysts downgrade shares&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * A Bloomberg poll finds negative sentiment on Goldman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * "Vampire squid" author: probe found "shocking" practices&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Goldman share trading volume is double daily average&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares close 3.5 pct lower
 (Updates share price, adds Goldman response)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lauren Tara LaCapra and Brenton Cordeiro&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK/BANGALORE, May 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) shares fell 3.5 percent on Thursday on concerns that
the company may face prosecution over its crisis-era mortgage
trades, which left some clients with big losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A report in Rolling Stone published late Wednesday
described findings from a recent Senate investigation, and said
that prosecutions could follow. Earlier this week, Goldman said
in a filing that the Justice Department is investigating issues
raised in the report from the Senate's permanent subcommittee
on investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Veteran bank analyst Richard Bove downgraded Goldman's
shares to "sell" from "neutral" on Thursday. In a note, the
analyst said that "it now appears that the pressure on the
Justice Department to bring a criminal lawsuit against Goldman
is building to a high pitch." A Standard   Poor's analyst also
downgraded the company's shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's shares fell to as low as $140.66 in intraday
trading before recouping some of their losses to close down 3.5
percent, at $142.75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They can't get out of the crosshairs," said Jason Ware, a
senior research analyst with Albion Financial Group, a fund
manager that does not own Goldman and has a negative view of
the stock. "There are some pretty large uncertainties, given
the potential for civil action, for criminal action, for the
brand itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report from the subcommittee, chaired by Senator Carl
Levin, criticized Goldman for profiting at the expense of
clients at the height of the credit crisis. It also offered new
details about executives' actions that were first highlighted
in a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the Rolling Stone article, journalist Matt Taibbi
focused on Levin's findings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Levin report catalogs dozens of instances of business
practices that are objectively shocking, no matter how any
high-priced lawyer chooses to interpret them," Taibbi wrote,
saying that the firm bet against its clients and kept customers
"trapped in bad investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taibbi has written extensively about Goldman Sachs, and
famously described the bank as a "vampire squid wrapped around
the face of humanity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to Bove's downgrading the stock, Standard 
Poor's equity analyst Chris Maimone lowered his rating on the
stock, to "hold" from "buy." He reduced his target price to
$156 from $176.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of the 26 analysts who cover Goldman's shares that are
tracked by Thomson Reuters, 19 recommend buying the stock. As
of Wednesday, none recommended selling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs spokesman Stephen Cohen declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A RAFT OF INQUIRIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beyond the Levin report, Goldman disclosed multiple
investigations and regulatory issues, which many banks deal
with continually. Goldman said it may face separate charges
from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which is
examining Goldman's clearing business, as well as Massachusetts
state regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is clear to outsiders that there must be a major
restructuring of the company at the Board and executive suite
levels or Congress will not be satisfied," said Rochdale
Securities analyst Richard Bove, who downgraded Goldman shares
to "sell" with a $120 price target. "The company continues to
fight such a change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following the downgrades, Goldman shares were selling off
in heavy volume. Just under 19.5 million shares traded hands on
Thursday, more than four times the average daily volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Bloomberg poll released just after midnight on Wednesday
showed that 54 percent of 1,263 traders, investors and analysts
now hold a negative opinion of the company, although 78 percent
said the accusations will have no impact on the bank's customer
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Fifty-four percent of the world wants to tar and feather
Goldman Sachs," says Peter Sorrentino, portfolio manager at
Huntington Funds, which has $14.8 billion under management and
owns $19.5 million worth of Goldman stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Huntington exited some of its Goldman position last year
for two reasons, Sorrentino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank not only faced business challenges, but had a
perception and reputation issue too. Until Goldman can overcome
that negative sentiment, Huntington is not going to be an
active buyer of the shares, Sorrentino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We kept feeling like we're probably one headline away from
a disaster on the name," said Sorrentino. "There is this
built-up animosity that somehow they played everybody in the
room and walked away with all the chips. As a shareholder, you
have to be cognizant of the fact that there are some people out
there who would like to even the score up."

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft was a giant fending off tiny rivals in 1998 when the U.S. Justice Department accused it of breaking antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 13 years since, Apple has gone from having a sliver of the personal computer market to dominating the world of mobile media with its iPhone and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, Google barely existed. It now rules the search advertising market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is still a technology titan with its Windows operating system and Office productivity software, but is no longer a feared monopoly or leading edge innovator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now that it is schooled in antitrust law, Microsoft wants Google Inc to be regulators' next focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's legal battle, once a distraction to its top executives when they could have been at their most creative, ended on Thursday as court oversight of Microsoft expired with little or no fanfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to allow the judgment to expire was made last month by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BAD BOYS TO TAME BOYS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was already competing with upstart rivals in the early 1990s when the Justice Department accused it of insisting that all personal computers shipped with its Windows operating system be loaded with its web browser Internet Explorer rather than Netscape's Navigator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal judge originally ordered Microsoft to be broken up in June 2000, but an appellate court reversed the decision a year later. The Justice Department ultimately settled with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a consent decree it was required to end retaliation against computer makers who use non-Microsoft software and comply with other antitrust law. The consent decree was originally slated to run five years but was extended repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows and its Outlook email system remain popular but its Bing search engine and other efforts to move into new markets failed to catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It (the legal battle) had an inhibiting affect on it (Microsoft)," said Evan Stewart, an antitrust expert at Zuckerman Spaeder LLP. "They're not competing effectively with Facebook. They're not competing effectively with (Apple). They're not competing effectively with Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Andrew Gavil, a Microsoft watcher who teaches antitrust at Howard University School of Law, argues that Microsoft was spurred to try to illegally crush rivals precisely because it had slipped behind the innovation curve after underestimating the importance of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Its strategy for catching up was to use its leverage on desktop to hinder its rivals," said Gavil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, Gavil and other antitrust experts argue that a weak consent decree did little to curtail Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most obvious bad behavior was stopped. It didn't restore lost competition. It didn't do anything to revive the competitors that had been hobbled," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Microsoft's efforts to paint Google as the next logical target for regulators, Bert Foer, head of the American Antitrust Institute think tank, and others argue that no one company today stands out today like Microsoft stood out as an antitrust violator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has publicly called into question the fairness of Google's website ranking system and has urged website owners to complain to regulators. It has itself made a formal complaint to antitrust regulators in Europe, where Google is already under investigation by the European Commission. Sources say U.S. regulators are considering an investigation of Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As far as who the successor will be, that will largely be determined by how they behave. I'm talking about Google and Apple and maybe Facebook in the high-tech area. You still have market power by IBM in its field and you still have Microsoft," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps antitrust regulators made out better than anyone in the Microsoft suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was extremely welcome to see the Justice Department go after Microsoft and frame an ambitious case against it," said Jeff Schinder of law firm Constantine Cannon. "It resurrected its finest tradition of going after dominant firms that were squelching competition."&lt;/p&gt;

			Beyond Mobile POS: Starmount President to Present at IBM Retail User 
      Group Conference on Mobile Solutions for Customer Engagement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rise of mobile-enabled shoppers has re-arranged the retail 
      landscape. As consumers use their mobile devices for product research, 
      price comparison and purchases, store associates now serve customers 
      that may know more about the particular products offered inside the 
      store than they do.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, mobile technologies also open up new opportunities for 
      retailers &#8211; a topic that Starmount president and CTO Jerry Rightmer will 
      explore in a session on May 16 at the 2011 IBM 
      Retail User Group Conference in Orlando. Rightmer's session, "Moving 
      Beyond Transactions to Interactions with Mobile Solutions," will focus 
      on how retailers can move beyond mobile POS to empower stores associates 
      with richer information and deliver a more personal shopping experience 
      inside the store.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Mobile solutions can extend the reach of a retailer's selling tools 
      beyond the cash wrap, or the web, freeing sales associates to interact 
      with the shopper where purchase decisions are being made &#8211; on the sales 
      floor," said Rightmer. "Retailers can use mobile technologies to level 
      the playing field with consumers, enabling store associates to check 
      inventory, look up product reviews, offer alternatives to out-of-stock 
      items, and interact with customers in new and relevant ways. I look 
      forward to exploring this in detail at next week's IBM Retail User Group 
      Conference."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Starmount's mobile selling assistant, Engage&#8482;, 
      is helping transform the way retailers interact with customers, from 
      point-of-interest to point-of-sale. Engage provides store associates 
      with full transaction capabilities to assist customers without leaving 
      their side. The Starmount solution enables store associates to do more 
      through richer customer interactions and service, targeted cross-sell 
      and up-sell of products, and efficient store operations to reduce long 
      wait times and lines.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * U.S. behind Europe as destination for overseas tourists&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Brazil, China, India tourists key to travel growth&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Deborah Charles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, May 12 (Reuters) - The complicated U.S. visa
system hurts tourism and must be reformed if the United States
wants to attract lucrative tourism from countries like China,
India and Brazil, travel industry officials said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Travel Association announced a plan to help reform
the visa process which it said could create 1.3 million U.S.
jobs and add $859 billion to the U.S. economy by 2020 through
increased overseas tourism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The challenge we have is the unnecessary, burdensome U.S.
visa system," said USTA president Roger Dow. "It's really
self-imposed barriers that we put on ourselves as a country
that have caused us to lose international travel and that have
stymied international growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Travelers have criticized the United States for long waits
to get a visa and for a lack of access in some countries to
U.S. consular offices. Some potential tourists have to travel
across their country just for an interview for a visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Figures released by USTA show that while travel is the
largest U.S. industry export sector, the United States has
failed to keep pace with other parts of the world -- such as
Western Europe -- as a travel destination in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Looking specifically at growing economies like China, India
and Brazil, global long-haul travel grew 140 percent from 2000
to 2010 and is projected to double again over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But only a fraction of that travel -- and the billions of
dollars in revenue it creates -- went to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2010 more than half the Brazilians traveling overseas
went to Europe while 29 percent went to the United States.
Nearly three times as many Chinese -- who spend the most on
average while overseas -- chose Europe over the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top reasons for not visiting the United States were the
visa process and strict security measures, the association
said, referring to 2010 travelers' surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. visa process from beginning to end can take as
long as 145 days in Brazil and 120 days in China, a USTA report
said. In contrast, Britain takes an average of 12 days to
process visas in Brazil and 11 days in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. 'DREAM DESTINATION'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the United States is the most frequently cited "dream
destination" for Chinese tourists, France had 18 percent more
Chinese visitors last year, a USTA report said. It said
France's visa application process is more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These are some of the fastest growing economies in the
world," said Dow. "Shouldn't we be getting those people coming
to the United States?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs a
subcommittee focused on export promotion and competitiveness,
said the travel industry was important to help President Barack
Obama meet his stated goal of doubling exports by 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see it as part of our economic recovery. I see this as
a way to get jobs in our country," Klobuchar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Since 9/11 we have lost 20 percent of the international
tourism market," she said. "Obviously after 9/11 there were
changes that had to be made to our security measures. Now we've
made those changes and we have to look at how can we make this
more efficient, still keeping the security in place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Klobuchar supported the recommendations of the U.S. Travel
Association report which urged the State Department to hire
more consular officers and reduce visa interview wait times to
10 days or less. It also proposed expanding the number of
countries in the the visa waiver program, which allows citizens
of 36 nations to travel for up to 90 days without a visa.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) shares were down 3.2 percent on Thursday afternoon after two analysts downgraded the stock and press reports questioned whether a Senate investigation will threaten the bank's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Bloomberg poll of 1,263 traders, investors and analysts released on Thursday showed that 54 percent now hold a negative opinion of the company, which is facing regulatory probes, lawsuits and negative public scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fifty-four percent of the world wants to tar and feather Goldman Sachs," says Peter Sorrentino, portfolio manager at Huntington Funds, which has $14.8 billion under management and owns $19.5 million worth of Goldman stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veteran bank analyst Richard Bove downgraded Goldman Sachs on Thursday to "sell" from "neutral," citing factors including the bank's potential legal pressure, and a negative piece in Rolling Stone magazine by Matt Taibbi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taibbi famously called Goldman a "vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity" in an earlier article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his latest article, Taibbi focused on findings from the Senate's permanent subcommittee on investigations, chaired by Michigan Democrat Carl Levin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Levin report catalogs dozens of instances of business practices that are objectively shocking, no matter how any high-priced lawyer chooses to interpret them," Taibbi wrote, saying that the firm bet against its clients and kept customers "trapped in bad investments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By early afternoon, Goldman's shares were down $4.76 to $143.12 on more than twice the average daily volume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Goldman disclosed in a quarterly regulatory filing that Commodity Futures Trading Commission staff recommended that the agency file charges against the bank following a probe of its clearing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also confirmed that the Justice Department is investigating its actions in the derivatives market in 2007. Those matters were first targeted by the Securities and Exchange Commission in a civil fraud lawsuit last year and brought up again in Levin's report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can't get out of the crosshairs," said Jason Ware, a senior research analyst with Albion Financial Group, a fund manager that does not own Goldman and has a negative view of the stock. "There are some pretty large uncertainties, given the potential for civil action, for criminal action, for the brand itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to Bove's downgrading the stock, Standard  Poor's equity analyst Chris Maimone lowered his rating on the stock, to "hold" from "buy." He reduced his target price to $156 from $176.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bove said public pressure could force Goldman to change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is clear to outsiders that there must be a major restructuring of the company at the Board and executive suite levels or Congress will not be satisfied," said Bove. "The company continues to fight such a change."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Huntington exited some of its Goldman position last year for two reasons, Sorrentino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank not only faced business challenges, but had a perception and reputation issue too. Until Goldman can overcome that negative sentiment, Huntington is not going to be an active buyer of the shares, Sorrentino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We kept feeling like we're probably one headline away from a disaster on the name," said Sorrentino. "There is this built-up animosity that somehow they played everybody in the room and walked away with all the chips. As a shareholder, you have to be cognizant of the fact that there are some people out there who would like to even the score up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Robert MacMillan)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Updates to midday, changes byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 12 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks recovered from
initial declines on Thursday in a choppy session as commodity
prices kept the market in flux while a downgrade of Goldman
Sachs dragged down financial shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commodities rebounded after U.S. data showed a decline in
jobless benefit claims last week and a revision to retail sales
data suggested consumer spending in the first quarter might
have been stronger than initially thought. For reactions to
data see [ID:nN12292551].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude CLc1 futures advanced 0.5 percent after a drop
of more than 1 percent and the SP energy sector .GSPE rose
0.1 percent after falling more than 1 percent. The sector has
tumbled 7.9 percent this month after it gained 16.3 percent in
the first quarter to propel the benchmark SP 500 to a 5.4
percent gain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Commodities have had a great run-in here. We are just
going to get some volatility going forward, both in the up
direction and down direction," said Wayne Schmidt, chief
investment officer at Gradient Investments in St. Paul,
Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial shares fell after banking analyst Dick Bove of
Rochdale Securities put a "sell" rating on Goldman Sachs Group
(GS.N) and reduced the price target on the stock to $120 from
$163, citing litigation worries. [ID:nL3E7GC3CO]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares slumped 4.5 percent to $141.17 as volume
topped the 50-day moving average. Both the KBW bank index
.BKX and the SP financial sector .GSPF shed 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) warned on Wednesday it would
fare worse this quarter than Wall Street had forecast. The tech
company laid out plans for global job cuts as it struggles to
revive growth. Its shares fell 4.5 percent at $16.99.
[ID:nN11260314]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 16.04
points, or 0.13 percent, to 12,613.99. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX shed 0.04 point to 1,342.04. The Nasdaq
Composite Index .IXIC gained 4.01 points, or 0.14 percent, to
2,849.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The recent spate of profit-taking in commodities pulled
copper prices to their lowest since Dec. 1, while spot silver
lost more than 5 percent after tumbling about 9 percent
Wednesday. The iShares Silver Trust (SLV.P) dropped 2.3 percent
to $33.55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Reuters/Jefferies CRB index .CRB, a broad measure of
commodity performance, slipped 0.3 percent on Thursday and has
lost 8.7 percent so far in May.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft was a giant fending off tiny rivals in 1998 when the U.S. Justice Department accused it of breaking antitrust law.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the 13 years since, Apple has gone from having a sliver of the personal computer market to dominating the world of mobile media with its iPhone and iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back then, Google barely existed. It now rules the search advertising market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is still a technology titan with its Windows operating system and Office productivity software, but is no longer a feared monopoly or leading edge innovator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And now that it is schooled in antitrust law, Microsoft wants Google Inc to be regulators' next focus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's legal battle, once a distraction to its top executives when they could have been at their most creative, ended on Thursday as court oversight of Microsoft expired with little or no fanfare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to allow the judgment to expire was made last month by Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the District Court for the District of Columbia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BAD BOYS TO TAME BOYS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft was already competing with upstart rivals in the early 1990s when the Justice Department accused it of insisting that all personal computers shipped with its Windows operating system be loaded with its web browser Internet Explorer rather than Netscape's Navigator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A federal judge originally ordered Microsoft to be broken up in June 2000, but an appellate court reversed the decision a year later. The Justice Department ultimately settled with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a consent decree it was required to end retaliation against computer makers who use non-Microsoft software and comply with other antitrust law. The consent decree was originally slated to run five years but was extended repeatedly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows and its Outlook email system remain popular but its Bing search engine and other efforts to move into new markets failed to catch fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It (the legal battle) had an inhibiting affect on it (Microsoft)," said Evan Stewart, an antitrust expert at Zuckerman Spaeder LLP. "They're not competing effectively with Facebook. They're not competing effectively with (Apple). They're not competing effectively with Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Andrew Gavil, a Microsoft watcher who teaches antitrust at Howard University School of Law, argues that Microsoft was spurred to try to illegally crush rivals precisely because it had slipped behind the innovation curve after underestimating the importance of the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Its strategy for catching up was to use its leverage on desktop to hinder its rivals," said Gavil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Further, Gavil and other antitrust experts argue that a weak consent decree did little to curtail Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The most obvious bad behavior was stopped. It didn't restore lost competition. It didn't do anything to revive the competitors that had been hobbled," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Microsoft's efforts to paint Google as the next logical target for regulators, Bert Foer, head of the American Antitrust Institute think tank, and others argue that no one company today stands out today like Microsoft stood out as an antitrust violator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has publicly called into question the fairness of Google's website ranking system and has urged website owners to complain to regulators. It has itself made a formal complaint to antitrust regulators in Europe, where Google is already under investigation by the European Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As far as who the successor will be, that will largely be determined by how they behave. I'm talking about Google and Apple and maybe Facebook in the high-tech area. You still have market power by IBM in its field and you still have Microsoft," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perhaps antitrust regulators made out better than anyone in the Microsoft suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was extremely welcome to see the Justice Department go after Microsoft and frame an ambitious case against it," said Jeff Schinder of law firm Constantine Cannon. "It resurrected its finest tradition of going after dominant firms that were squelching competition."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) stopped short of blaming speculators for the run-up in oil prices, but he told Congress on Thursday that based only on the fundamentals of supply and demand, the price of oil should be in the range of $60 to $70 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"When we look at it, it's going to be somewhere in the $60 to $70 range if you said: 'If I had access to the next marketable barrel, what would it cost?"

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON May 12 (Reuters) - The head of Exxon Mobil
(XOM.N) stopped short of blaming speculators for the run-up in
oil prices, but he told Congress on Thursday that based only on
the fundamentals of supply and demand, the price of oil should
be in the range of $60 to $70 a barrel.   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "When we look at it, it's going to be somewhere in the $60
to $70 range if you said: 'If I had access to the next
marketable barrel, what would it cost?" Exxon's CEO and
Chairman Rex Tillerson  told the Senate Finance Committee in
response to a question about the influence of speculators on
high oil prices.

&lt;p&gt;ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistan's civilian government issued visas to more than 400 Americans without army security clearances starting in early 2010, possibly enabling the CIA to boost its presence, in a move that angered the powerful military.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Details of the visa decision emerged after U.S. Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in his compound in the garrison town of Abbottabad on May 2, straining already uneasy ties between strategic allies Islamabad and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The granting of the visas has also fueled tension between the military and the unstable nuclear-armed country's civilian leaders, whose relations are uneasy at the best of times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistani cooperation is crucial for U.S. efforts to combat Islamist militants and bring stability to Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the United States has had doubts about Islamabad's commitment and, given the contacts that Pakistan's spy agency has had with Islamist militants in the past, almost certainly uses its own operatives to collect intelligence in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pakistani diplomatic missions in Washington, the United Arab Emirates and London issued the visas after the government came under intense pressure from the United States, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At the end of 2009, a special presidential order was issued to give 7,000 visas and the same order was passed through the prime minister's office to Mr. Haqqani," a senior Pakistani security official told Reuters, referring to Pakistan's ambassador in the United States, Husain Haqqani.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the basis of these orders, the visas which were valid for three to six months were issued without the scrutiny or routine security clearance of the ISI (Inter-Services Intelligence)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ISI is the military's main spy agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 450 of those visas were issued to the CIA, the security official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for President Asif Ali Zardari declined to comment on details of the visa decision, saying only that security clearance was not always needed from the army.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The army did not respond to a request for information on the visas, but a senior security official said "We lost control of CIA operatives in Pakistan."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Army generals, who have ruled Pakistan for more than half of its history, largely direct security and foreign policy even when civilian administrations are in power, as is the case now, and they do not like to be challenged on those agendas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MILITARY "HOPPING MAD"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ties between the United States and Pakistan reached a low point this year after Raymond Davis, a CIA contractor and former U.S. special forces member, shot dead two Pakistanis in the city of Lahore in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis, who said he acted in self defense, was freed in March after "blood money" -- compensation to the families of those killed -- was paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ayesha Siddiqa, author of "Military Inc," a book on the military's economic might, said it was clear why army chief Ashfaq Kayani and the head of the ISI were "hopping mad" over the Davis case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because somebody in the Pakistani political government had allowed X number of CIA operatives to come into Pakistan and set up parallel operations to sneak into what was going on," she told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second security official said the military was angered by the move and as a result the number of Americans in the country that had received the visas has been reduced by 50 percent. But those who remained were cause for concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will affect the already tense relations between the two countries. This indicates the lack of trust and mutual understanding, which will ultimately benefit the militants and extremist elements inside Pakistan," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (the security establishment) lost track of most of the people who came in. Their missions were not clearly stated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A former Interior Ministry official said it had been bypassed as well when the visas were issued. Haqqani said the issue had been blown out of proportion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Also, the 7000 figure is incorrect  official records prove hype on subject is totally fabricated. All procedures followed," he said on his Twitter page on May 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. embassy declined comment on suggestions the visas may have enabled the CIA to expand its presence in Pakistan, which receives billions of dollars in U.S. military aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We submit full and complete visa applications to the government of Pakistan. We comply in providing the information requested," said an embassy spokeswoman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials have complained in the past about hundreds of Pakistani visa delays, saying this could hamper aid intended to stabilize the Islamabad government and help Pakistan's people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Islamabad has cut by more than half a visa backlog affecting U.S. officials and contractors needed to run American aid programs aimed at combating extremism there, a State Department official said in March of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Finance Ministry advisor Sakib Sherani said U.S. officials made visa requests for people needed to audit requests made under a Coalition Support Fund that was established after the September 11, 2001, attacks on the United States to reimburse Pakistan for help in fighting militancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That account was confirmed by the second senior security official.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We resisted and said 'you don't need 450 (to audit the fund requests)'. Then they said they needed other technical people," said Sherani, who said he took part in some of the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An intelligence official in Lahore said Pakistani authorities began to get suspicious after they noticed a large number of people who appeared to be Americans driving bullet-proof sports utility vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kamran Haider, John Chalmers, Chris Allbritton and Mark Hosenball in Washington; Editing by Robert Birsel)&lt;/p&gt;

			CJPS Medical Systems and Independence 
      Technology, a Johnson  Johnson Company, Execute Worldwide Exclusive 
      License Agreement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CJPS Medical Systems (www.CJPS-MedicalSystems.com) 
      announces today that it has entered into an exclusive worldwide 
      technology license agreement with Independence Technology, LLC, a 
      Johnson  Johnson Company, to manufacture and distribute a novel 
      Power-Assist Technology to enhance manual wheelchairs. This technology 
      was previously integrated with a wheelchair frame, and sold by 
      Independence Technology under the INDEPENDENCE&#174; iGLIDE&#174; brand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CJPS Medical Systems will manufacture the products at its world 
      headquarters in Auburn Hills, Michigan and distribute them on a global 
      basis both on an OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) basis as well as 
      an aftermarket add-on.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This power-assist technology is comprised of a sophisticated and 
      patented mini computer system which allows wheelchair users to move in 
      an effortless and resistant-free manner. Not only does this technology 
      allow the user to move much more easily on rough terrain such as grass 
      or inclines, but it also automatically slows the wheelchair down to a 
      stop when going downhill without having to use hands as the braking 
      system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On the products that CJPS Medical Systems will use this technology, the 
      controller and battery are cleverly concealed under the wheelchair seat, 
      giving the appearance of a standard manual wheelchair, and only adding a 
      minimal amount of load, making this powered wheelchair a fraction of the 
      weight of powered wheelchairs. The battery provides up to 9 miles of 
      sustainable travel on a 3.5 hour charge.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This technology has been the subject of significant clinical studies by 
      world renowned clinicians, such as Physical and Rehabilitation 
      Therapists, resulting in undisputable clinical benefits to the 
      wheelchair user of this power-assist technology, by greatly reducing the 
      force, effort and wear and tear to the shoulders, arms and hands of 
      full-time wheelchair users.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Nuvilex, Inc. Announces Buy Recommendation by Goldman Research 
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nuvilex, Inc. (OTCQB: NVLX), announced today that Goldman Research 
      issued a report Tuesday, May 10, 2011, stating in the title, &#8220;Nuvilex, 
      Inc., Natural Products Leader Is An Undiscovered Gem.&#8221; Goldman also 
      clearly recognized Nuvilex as being currently &#8220;valued for its current 
      portfolio only, so Investors get the rest of the Company for free&#8221; and 
      &#8220;does not reflect the expected launch of new products or the value of 
      the pre-clinical development portfolio.&#8221; The report rates Nuvilex a 
      Speculative Buy adding &#8220;we believe that the shares could reach $0.50 by 
      year end.&#8221; By the end of Tuesday when the report was issued, 2.41 
      Million shares had traded, stimulating one of the largest and most 
      active days of trading since the management was changed in January. Dr. 
      Robert Ryan, President and CEO commented, &#8220;We were extremely pleased to 
      receive such a glowing report on Nuvilex and the recognition of both the 
      importance of stabilization and expansion as we are striving to move the 
      Company forward.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The research report highlighted &#8220;Nuvilex&#8217;s research and development 
      portfolio, containing 14 issued patents, provides the Company with a 
      major competitive advantage.&#8221; The report also looked to the future 
      pointing out, &#8220;Nuvilex is monetizing this advantage through the release 
      of 2 potentially eco-friendly blockbusters slated for release in the 
      next 18 months that should immediately capture share of a combined 
      multi-billion market opportunity.&#8221; Dr. Ryan, also stated &#8220;I am very 
      excited that the report suggested the type of change expected for 
      Nuvilex, namely, &#8216;Investors should expect to witness major hockey 
      stick-type growth in 2011; this is what we have been, and will continue, 
      striving hard to accomplish.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman discussed the recent milestones met by the management team as 
      contributing to overall shareholder value, stating, &#8220;Since Dr. Ryan 
      joined roughly three months ago, he has brought on Dr. Gerald Crabtree 
      as COO, and overseen near term milestones which set the stage for 
      Nuvilex to increase its shareholder value. These initiatives include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        New trading on the OTC QB, which has resulted in an increase in daily 
        volume
      
			
        Overhaul of online distribution capabilities, including the addition 
        of new personnel to ensure sales growth
      
			
        Introduction of new distribution relationships, operational oversight
      
			
        Introduction of new packaging sizes in response to customer requests
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Most importantly, Nuvilex has embarked on what we view as an innovative 
      three-pronged approach. This strategy properly leverages the underlying 
      assets of the Company (which includes 14 patents), and leads to 
      monetization in such a fashion that Nuvilex should emerge as a leader in 
      key segments of the natural products space and as a proprietary, 
      biotechnology products developer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As an overall assessment, valuation and conclusion, the Goldman Research 
      Report believes &#8220;Nuvilex, Inc. is poised to become a major player in 
      multiple segments of the multi-billion dollar and natural products 
      space. The Company is taking advantage of favorable &#8220;green energy and 
      green products&#8221; industry drivers, its experience, innovation and 
      scalability to build its existing lines and enter new verticals.&#8221; After 
      recognizing Nuvilex should experience benefit from increased sales and 
      distribution of Cinnergen, Cinnechol and Talsyn, Goldman pointed out the 
      critical future potential, &#8220;The Company&#8217;s most recent research and 
      development on natural anticancer agents, Alterna&#8482;, has interesting 
      potential and may warrant a future update. Additionally, the expected 
      2H11 potential marketing of Citroxin&#8482;, an innovative eco-friendly, 
      antimicrobial, sterilizer and cleanser offers huge direct and private 
      label sales potential. Thus, unlike most firms in the sector, Nuvilex 
      investors benefit from multiple shots on goal.&#8221;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BTIG, LLC, a global financial services firm specializing in 
      institutional trading and related brokerage services, today announced 
      the addition of J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp. (J.P. Morgan) as a clearing

      better custodial providers in the market. Both J.P. Morgan and GSEC have 
      a long history in prime brokerage and both support the introducing 
      broker market.&#8221; Press went on to say, &#8220;Clients are often looking to add 
      a second prime brokerage relationship, and having two premier custodians 
      opens up new opportunities for BTIG and our clients. The addition of 
      J.P. Morgan puts BTIG in a stronger position to be a long term resource 
      for our clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Brian Petitt, Co-Head of Prime Brokerage at BTIG, added that "BTIG&#8217;s 
      Prime Brokerage business offers &#8216;best in class&#8217; services and options to 
      clients who appreciate resources like state of the art technology and 
      reporting, and customized capital introduction." Brian Petitt went on to 
      say "Being able to offer J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp. and Goldman Sachs 
      Execution  Clearing as clearing and custodian options helps us stay 
      ahead of our competition and provide the best possible solutions for our 
      clients.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TX, May 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Idera, a leading provider of Microsoft SQL Server management and

mark when it comes to meeting the needs of SQL Server DBAs," said Heather

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman CEO signs agreement with Beijing mayor-source&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Morgan Stanley also plans to launch yuan fund
 (Adds detail about Goldman's private equity fund holdings)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Stephen Aldred and Samuel Shen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, May 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) plans to
raise up to 5 billion yuan ($770 million) for a private equity
fund in China, a source familiar with the matter said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source added that the Wall Street bank had signed an
agreement with the Beijing municipal government, which will be
the first investor in the domestic fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street bank's CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, and global
head of merchant banking, Richard Friedman, signed an agreement
in Beijing on Thursday with the city's mayor, Guo Jinlong, the
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News of the fund, a joint venture between Goldman and
state-owned Capital Opportunities and Management Centre of
Beijing, a unit of Beijing's municipal government, came on the
same day that Morgan Stanley issued an invitation to the launch
next week of a yuan private equity fund venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Hangzhou Industrial  Commercial
Trust Co plan to hold an opening ceremony next week for their
private-equity venture in Hangzhou, according to an e-mailed
invitation for the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China is encouraging foreign private equity firms to set up
and launch yuan funds, hoping to use their international
expertise to improve local corporate governance and channel
money into the private sector to aid the domestic economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since 2009, international firms including Blackstone Group
L.P. (BX.N), TPG TPG.UL and Carlyle Group CYL.UL have
announced plans to launch yuan funds in China through
partnerships with local governments or Chinese companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Launching yuan funds allows foreign private equity firms to
access deals more easily and face less regulatory scrutiny. At
the same time, they can raise money from an increasing number
of wealthy Chinese seeking high returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previously, institutions such as Goldman and Carlyle
invested in Chinese companies through offshore
dollar-denominated funds. But investing and exits were often
complicated by China's strict capital controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For example, Carlyle's planned acquisition of Xugong Group
Construction Machinery Co, one of China's biggest machinery
makers, was shot down by the government on concerns about
foreign monopolies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The route to regulatory approval for all transactions is
much simpler and faster," the source said, discussing the
advantage of yuan funds over dollar funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of March 31, the bank held $10.5 billion worth of
private-equity investments on its balance sheet and managed
$151 billion worth of alternative investments that included
private-equity funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source declined to be named because the matter has not
been disclosed publicly.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Laptop computers using Google's (GOOG.O) Chrome operating system will go on sale in June, as the world's No. 1 Internet search engine challenges Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Apple (AAPL.O) on their home turf.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The new Web-centric PCs, made by Samsung (005930.KS) and Acer Inc (2353.TW), are Google's latest attempt to change how consumers and companies use their computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bare-bones operating system is essentially a web browser that steers users to use applications like email and spreadsheets directly on the web, instead of storing software such as Outlook or Word directly on PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving day-to-day functions onto the Internet removes the burden of time-consuming tasks associated with traditional PCs, like installing software and updates, backing up files and running antivirus checks, executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The complexity of managing your computer is torturing users," Google cofounder Sergey Brin told reporters. "It's a flawed model fundamentally. Chromebooks are a new model that doesn't put the burden of managing your computer on yourself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another move encouraging people to move their computing off their PCs and onto "the cloud", Google on Tuesday launched an online music locker service letting users store and listen to their songs wherever they are.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For nearly two years Google has touted Chrome as an alternative to Microsoft Windows, which is used on more than 90 percent of the world's PCs, but faced delays launching laptops designed to use the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the exploding market for smartphones and tablets using Google's Android operating system has quickly taken centre stage for the Internet heavyweight, and some observers say Google should reconcile or merge the two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our goal is to focus on the users and bring the best forward. Wherever we can share (technology with Android) we will share," said Sundar Pichai, Senior Vice President of Chrome. "But the final expressions are two different visions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DRIVING ADS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with Android, Chrome software will be free, but is expected to spur people to use the Internet more often and search for more things, potentially boosting Google's Internet ads business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The operating system and "Chromebook" PCs expand on Google's web browser, also called Chrome, that competes against Microsoft's Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The laptops, using processors made by Intel (INTC.O), will be available for order on Amazon.com (AMZN.O) and Best Buy's (BBY.N) online store on June 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Mountain View, California company will also offer businesses its Chromebooks, along with technical support, as a hassle-free solution for $28 a month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is competing fiercely against Apple to win consumers in the mobile market, with sales of Android-based phones recently overtaking iPhones but with its own tablets far behind Apple's iPad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google kicked off its annual developers forum on Tuesday with an image of its Android robot eating an apple, a shot at its Cupertino, California rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Tuesday, Microsoft said it would buy popular Internet phone service Skype for $8.5 billion, beating out bids by Google and Facebook and highlighting its need to gain new customers for Windows as more consumers turn from PCs to mobile gadgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Google were down 1.57 percent at $534.12.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) plans to raise up to 5 billion yuan ($770 million) for a private equity fund in China, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

 (Updates with comments, background)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Stephen Aldred and Samuel Shen	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, May 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs plans to
raise up to 5 billion yuan ($770 million) for a private equity
fund in China, a source familiar with the matter said on
Thursday.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source added that the Wall Street bank had signed an
agreement with the Beijing municipal government, which will be
its first investor in the domestic fund. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street bank's CEO, Lloyd Blankfein, and global head
of merchant banking, Richard Friedman, signed an agreement in
Beijing on Thursday with the city's mayor, Guo Jinlong, the
source said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News of the fund, a joint venture between Goldman and
state-owned Capital Opportunities and Management Centre of
Beijing, a unit of Beijing's municipal government, came on the
same day that Morgan Stanley issued an invitation to the launch
next week of a yuan private equity fund venture.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley and Hangzhou Industrial  Commercial
Trust Co. plan to hold an opening ceremony next week for their
private-equity venture in Hangzhou, according to an e-mailed
invitation for the event.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China is encouraging foreign private equity firms to set up
and launch yuan funds, hoping to use their international
expertise to improve local corporate governance and channel
money into the private sector to aid the domestic economy.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since 2009, international firms including Blackstone Group
L.P. , TPG and Carlyle Group have
announced plans to launch yuan funds in China through
partnerships with local governments or Chinese companies.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Launching yuan funds allows foreign private equity firms to
access deals more easily and face less regulatory scrutiny. At
the same time, they can raise money from an increasing number of
wealthy Chinese seeking high returns.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previously, institutions such as Goldman and Carlyle
invested in Chinese companies through offshore
dollar-denominated funds. But investing and exits were often
complicated by China's strict capital controls.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For example, Carlyle's planned acquisition of Xugong Group
Construction Machinery Co, one of China's biggest machinery
makers, was shot down by the government on concerns about
foreign monopolies. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The route to regulatory approval for all transactions is
much simpler and faster," said the source, discussing the
advantage of yuan funds over dollar funds. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to comment.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source declined to be named because the matter has not
been disclosed publicly.

&lt;p&gt; * New CEO brings mega-project development skills&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Takes job amid persistent talk Shell may sell 24 pct stake&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Faces rising costs, skills shortage on big projects&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Coleman has right credentials, analysts say

 (Adds analyst, shareholder comments, share price)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By James Regan and Sonali Paul	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SYDNEY/MELBOURNE, May 12 (Reuters) - Australian energy firm
Woodside Petroleum has snared a top ExxonMobil executive
to replace its retiring chief, who leaves as the company faces
challenges on three projects and with its top shareholder
looking to exit.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter Coleman, an Australian who has overseen
multi-billion-dollar projects during a 27-year career at
ExxonMobil, takes over from Don Voelte effective May 30.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 51-year-old was most recently vice president of
ExxonMobil Development Co unit based in Houston, responsible for
worldwide oil and gas developments, including a $16 billion LNG 
project under construction in Papua New Guinea.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts were impressed with the Coleman's background, given
ExxonMobil's strong record in delivering projects and his
experience overseeing the Arun LNG operation in Indonesia.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think he'll be well received. His pedigree looks good,"
said Xavier Grunauer, an analyst at Nomura.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Woodside shares fell 2.5 percent to A$45.03, lagging the
wider market after oil prices tumbled.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The appointment comes at a crucial time for Woodside which
has been the subject of persistent speculation it could be a
takeover target for BHP Billiton  . BHP last month
said there was no basis to the speculation.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think that's likely. The rhetoric that we hear is
that at a premium take-out price it wouldn't fit BHP's
criteria," said Paul Xiradis, chief executive of Ausbil Dexia, a
top 10 shareholder in Woodside and a shareholder in BHP.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talk of a bid picked up steam last November when Woodside's
top shareholder, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), sold a third of its
stake and said it would be willing to divest the remaining 24
percent.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Woodside, Australia's largest independent energy company,
this year cuts its investment expenditure budget to $3.4 billion
from $3.9 billion in 2010.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It faces challenges on three liquefied natural gas projects
key to its growth -- securing gas for its Pluto expansion,
securing agreement from its partners on its Browse project, both
in Western Australia, and securing agreement from East Timor for
its Sunrise LNG plans.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It recently made progress on lining up gas for a second
train at Pluto and last week resolved a dispute with traditional
landowners, which would allow it to build a gas processing plant
at its chosen location, James Price Point, but its partners are
still not on board.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Woodside has an impressive portfolio of Australian oil and
gas assets right across the development time frame and I look
forward to growing the company as successfully as my
predecessors and in a manner which continues to provide superior
returns to shareholders," Coleman said in a statement.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts declined to comment on a key blemish in Coleman's
career.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coleman was operations manager for Esso Australia in 1998,
when an explosion at an Esso-operated gas processing plant in
Victoria killed two workers and cut off natural gas supplies to
the state for two weeks.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company was fined A$2 million for breaching workplace
safety rules and paid A$32.5 million to businesses that suffered
property damage.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's economic growth could slow to 8 percent, Goldman Sach's Jim O'Neill said on Thursday, as economic data and a drop in commodity prices point to Beijing ending its monetary tightening policy sometime this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slowdown to around 8 percent would likely occur in the second half of this year, adding that given the data out this week, it could occur as early as the second-quarter, O'Neill, Chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management told a small media gathering in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is my judgment that the Chinese economy is probably slowing down more than people realize," he said, adding that as a result, he was not surprised that commodity prices are coming under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As evidence, he cited the Goldman Sachs China Activity Index, the firm's propriperary indicator of GDP, which shows that the momentum of Chinese growth has slowed, and that slowdown was supported by economic data reported this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And I suspect that China is going to slow down to around 8 pct GDP growth. If I'm right, that means sometime in the 2nd half this year, Chinese inflation will not be a problem, and will come back down to around 4 percent," he said. "And the PBOC will be able to stop tightening monetary policy and we can all live happily ever after."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's industrial output growth eased much more than expected in April to suggest the world's second-biggest economy is cooling, even as the inflation rate came in a shade lower than the 32-month-high reached in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not surprising at all that commodities prices are coming under pressure," he said. "The surprise is that they rose so much earlier in the year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A stop to tightening, he suspected would result in a China stock rally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRIIC? BRICK??&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As he has done before, O'Neill outlined a set of slides that shows how it is no longer appropriate label BRIC nations as "emerging markets." Those economies are what he calls "growth economies" now, while setting aside 11 nations he refers to as proper "emerging economies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lot of speculation has gone into what country could be added to the now famous BRIC acronym, an acronym O'Neill says he dreamed up and ever since it "has literally changed my life."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Several times during the roundtable, O'Neill, wearing a gray suit and drinking a Diet Coke to fight jet lag, referred to himself jokingly as "Mr. Bric."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To be a BRIC, you've got to be at least 3 percent of (world) GDP, with potential of being 5 percent. It's very hard to see any country in that category, Indonesia and Mexico would have to do some spectacular things to get there. Indonesia would have to grow by idiotic amounts to get even close."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill added that being bigger than Turkey does not qualify Indonesia as a BRIC, and that Russia is still three times the size of the Southeast Asian nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Why on earth do people call Korea an emerging market?" he asked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill closed the session with his thoughts on Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I get an email every day on how I should drop Russia from the BRICs. And it's like a reverse indicator. Russia is cheap," he said. "Tactically, I find Russia to be the most interesting of the growth markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Flaherty; Editing by Ramya Venugopal)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG May 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs plans to raise
up to 5 billion yuan ($770 million) for a private equity fund in
China, a source familiar with the matter said on Thursday.  	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The source added that the Wall Street bank had signed an
agreement with the Beijing Municipal Government, which will be
its first investor in the domestic fund. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to comment.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source declined to be named because as the matter was

      Research and Markets: ROAM Insight Issue #14 Data DVD Provides the User 
      with a Suite of Microsoft Excel-Based Analytical Spreadsheets for those 
      Operating inside the Energy Sector
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/f3f8e9/roam_insight_issue) 
      has announced the addition of the "ROAM 
      Insight Issue #14 Data DVD" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the discerning user ROAM Consulting recommends the Data Analysis 
      Tools DVD, the perfect companion to your ROAM Insight printed report. 
      The DVD provides the user with a suite of Microsoft Excel-based 
      analytical spreadsheets, providing the capability to burrow into the 
      underlying half hourly dispatch data of each simulation case in order to 
      focus on results specific to the user's needs. The user can then make 
      further conclusions from this data, supplementing those which are 
      published in the report.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since its first year of publication in 2000, ROAM Insight has become an 
      invaluable reference for a wide range of participants in the Australian 
      National Electricity Market. Avid consumers of our Insight publication 
      will be well aware that Issue #13 for 2009 never came to market. The end 
      of 2009 was a turbulent time for greenhouse policy in the Federal 
      parliament, with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme voted down in the 
      Senate in August. Amendments were made and on 24 November, the 
      Government secured in-principle support for the bill from the 
      Opposition. However, agreement was short-lived. On 1 December, Malcolm 
      Turnbull lost the Liberal party leadership to Tony Abbott, who staunchly 
      opposed the bill. The subsequent Senate vote on 2 December saw the CPRS 
      defeated for a second time, creating a double dissolution election 
      trigger. The uncertainty surrounding the outcomes of the UNFCCC 
      Copenhagen conference on 6-18 December also dominated the policy 
      discussion. In such a rapidly changing environment, any report published 
      would have been out of date within days. Moreover, ROAM was heavily 
      engaged in assisting the AEMO and Department of Resources, Energy and 
      Tourism with modelling for the National Transmission Network Development 
      Plan and Energy White Paper.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We took the executive decision to postpone publication until there was 
      greater policy clarity. With the result of the Federal election known 
      and carbon pricing back on the table, we are pleased to present ROAM 
      Insight Issue #14.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Insight into the future:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The hot topics are still the emissions reduction policies; in 
      particular, the Expanded Renewable Energy Target, its division into the 
      Large-scale Renewable Energy Target and Small-scale Renewable Energy 
      Scheme, and the possible introduction of a price on carbon emissions in 
      the near future. Several State and Territory governments have also 
      introduced policies aimed at curbing emissions, some of which pertain 
      specifically to the electricity sector. The emerging east coast LNG 
      industry is another game changer with major implications for both supply 
      and demand of electricity. All such developments will affect:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        market pool prices
      
			
        generator production volumes and revenues
      
			
        transmission utilisation and congestion
      
			
        estimated quantities of expected unserved energy by region, and much 
        more.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      ROAM Insight #14 presents ROAM's insight into the future (2010-11 to 
      2015-16) based on the broad and deep knowledge gained by our consultants 
      through completing a wide range of assignments over the past two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key assignments include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Early planning for the National Transmission Network Development Plan 
        and modelling for the Energy White Paper with AEMO and DRET
      
			
        Developing Minimum Reserve Levels for the NEM for the next two years 
        with AEMO
      
			
        The Reliability Standard Settings Review with the AEMC
      
			
        The capability of transmission networks to cope with renewable 
        generation to meet the eRET with the Clean Energy Council

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades 12 Classes of JPMCC 2005-CIBC13; Affirms Super Senior 
      and Mezzanine AAA Classes
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded 12 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2005-CIBC13 (JPMCC 2005-CIBC13) 
      commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, due to further 
      performance deterioration, which includes an increase in expected losses 
      on the specially serviced loans as well as other loans in the pool. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades reflect an increase in Fitch expected losses across the 
      pool. Fitch modeled losses of 12.4% for the remaining pool (expected 
      losses of the original pool are at 13.2% and includes losses realized to 
      date). Fitch has designated 54 loans (39.7%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, 
      which includes 24 specially serviced loans (23.6%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the April 2011 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has decreased by 8.1% to $2.5 billion from $2.7 billion at 
      issuance. Realized losses incurred to date total $48.4 million. No loans 
      are currently defeased. Cumulative interest shortfalls in the amount of 
      $18.4 million are currently affecting classes C and below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to Fitch modeled losses is a portfolio of 16 
      office properties located in various markets. Eleven of the properties 
      are Real Estate Owned (REO) and the remaining five properties are in 
      foreclosure. Fitch expects a significant loss upon liquidation based on 
      a December 2010 appraised value well below the outstanding loan balance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The next largest contributor to Fitch modeled losses is a defaulted loan 
      secured by a 322-room luxury hotel property located in the South Beach 
      area of Miami, FL. The special servicer is currently pursuing 
      foreclosure. Fitch expects a significant loss upon liquidation based on 
      a December 2010 appraised value well below the outstanding loan balance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to Fitch modeled losses is secured by a 
      700,000 square foot (sf) office property located in downtown Los 
      Angeles. Between year end (YE) 2009 and YE 2010, occupancy dropped 16% 
      resulting in a YE 2010 Servicer reported DSCR of 0.98x. Further, the 
      third largest tenant (15% of NRA) expires in December 2011 and it is 
      unknown if they will renew or vacate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades and assigns Recovery Ratings to the following classes, 
      as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon prepared to cut production further&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Rising river levels cut tanker traffic
 (Adds details, comment on Morganza)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 13 (Reuters) - Production at Exxon Mobil
Corp's 504,500 barrel-per-day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
refinery has been cut to 450,000 bpd due to tightened crude
supplies because of high Mississippi River levels, sources
familiar with refinery operations said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokesman declined to discuss production levels at
the refinery, which is the nation's second largest, but said it
continues to operate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon was prepared to reduce production down to 400,000 bpd
if necessary, the sources said, as it was becoming difficult
for tankers to reach the refinery's docks on the Mississippi
due to rising river levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery also receives crude oil through pipelines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon was watching for a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers'
decision on opening the Morganza Spillway north of Baton Rouge,
which would divert down the Atchafalaya River west of Baton
Rouge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If they don't open it, it would be a disaster for the
refinery," one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A St. Charles Parish official said earlier this week that
keeping the Morganza closed would lead to flooding of two
refineries in that parish on the Mississippi west of New
Orleans.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 13 (Reuters) - Production at Exxon Mobil
Corp's 504,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana,
refinery has been cut to 450,000 bpd due to tightened
crude supplies because of high Mississippi River levels,
sources familiar with refinery operations said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokesman declined to discuss production levels at
the refinery, which is the nation's second largest, but said it

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - The end of quantitative easing (QE) will have a negative impact on gold, but demand for oil and industrial metals should be supported if there is real economic growth, said Jeff Currie of Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Gold should directly reflect what has happened with QE, and we should see a substantial pullback," said Currie, who heads commodity research at the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at a Platts oil conference on Friday, Currie said precious metals had run up on the back of quantitative easing, which had debased paper money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and industrial metals, on the other hand, have risen due to fears of supply shortages. If real, sustainable economic growth has been generated off the back of QE, there may be some slowing of this growth, but it should still support demand for industrial commodities, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think we are at least 12 months away before we see some of these physical issues beginning to resurface, which is why we argue for a correction in the near term," said Currie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But if the economy holds together, we'd argue that oil will start to look like agriculture, with real physical shortages and much higher prices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currie said agricultural commodities are already at critical shortages, but oil won't get to this stage until 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The emerging markets have already crowded out the developed market demand for copper, and you will see the same dynamic play out in oil over the next decade," he argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The end game has to be a policy response, because we're dealing with a situation in which there are political constraints on the free flow of investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jane Baird)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Economic growth should support demand for oil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sees critical shortage of oil by 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Claire Milhench&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, May 13 (Reuters) - The end of quantitative easing
(QE) will have a negative impact on gold, but demand for oil and
industrial metals should be supported if there is real economic
growth, said Jeff Currie of Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Gold should directly reflect what has happened with QE, and
we should see a substantial pullback," said Currie, who heads
commodity research at the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at a Platts oil conference on Friday, Currie said

to fears of supply shortages. If real, sustainable economic
growth has been generated off the back of QE, there may be some
slowing of this growth, but it should still support demand for
industrial commodities, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think we are at least 12 months away before we see some
of these physical issues beginning to resurface, which is why we
argue for a correction in the near term," said Currie. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But if the economy holds together, we'd argue that oil will
start to look like agriculture, with real physical shortages and
much higher prices." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currie said agricultural commodities are already at critical
shortages, but oil won't get to this stage until 2012. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The emerging markets have already crowded out the developed
market demand for copper, and you will see the same dynamic play
out in oil over the next decade," he argued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The end game has to be a policy response, because we're
dealing with a situation in which there are political
constraints on the free flow of investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Jane Baird)

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - More than 22,000 people were erroneously told they were eligible for a special U.S. visa program because of a computer error in an annual lottery and the drawing must be redone, a U.S. official said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

			Genocide and JPMorgan Chase -- Ad Campaign Launched by Investors 
      Against Genocide
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Advertisements Highlight the Connection Between Investments and 
      Genocide
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A week before JPMorgan Chase shareholders vote at their annual meeting 
      on a genocide-free investing proposal, Investors Against Genocide (IAG) 
      has launched a communications campaign featuring a dramatic print 
      advertisement that was printed May 11 in The Wall Street Journal 
      (WSJ). The aim of the campaign is to draw much-needed attention to the 
      connection between investments and genocide in Darfur, Sudan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The full-page 
      ad asks readers:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Are Your Investments Tied to Genocide?
			Many financial 
      institutions invest in PetroChina, a company which, through its parent, 
      CNPC, provides Sudan's government with revenue that has been helping 
      fund the Darfur genocide for years.
			The conflict has claimed 
      300,000 lives and left millions homeless.
			With a billion-dollar 
      stake in PetroChina as of January 2011, JPMorgan Chase is one of its 
      largest investors. On May 17, JPMorgan Chase shareholders have the 
      opportunity to vote for genocide-free investing.
			How would you 
      vote?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investors Against Genocide placed the ad in support of &#8220;Proposal 10 &#8211; 
      Genocide-free investing&#8221; on the JPMorgan Chase proxy ballot as part of 
      IAG&#8217;s initiative to convince mutual funds and other investment firms to 
      make an ongoing commitment to genocide-free investing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IAG&#8217;s communications campaign also includes Facebook ads asking JPMorgan 
      Chase credit card and banking customers, "Genocide in your wallet?" The 
      ads link to an online petition which generates an email message to 
      JPMorgan Chase's CEO, Jamie Dimon, urging him to avoid investments in 
      companies tied to genocide. Through their credit and banking operations, 
      JPMorgan Chase has millions of retail customers. IAG believes that, 
      while they may not all be shareholders, the opinions of these consumers 
      matter to JPMorgan Chase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Overwhelmingly, Americans, once they become aware, do not want their 
      pensions and family savings connected to genocide,&#8221; states Eric Cohen, 
      Chairperson of Investors Against Genocide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cohen said, &#8220;JPMorgan Chase plays a large role in guiding the investment 
      choices of its customers. Without a genocide-free investing policy, 
      ordinary individuals, through their investments with JPMorgan, 
      inadvertently invest in companies such as PetroChina that help to fund 
      genocide.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase asked the Securities and Exchange Commission to allow the 
      company to exclude the genocide-free investing proposal from the proxy 
      ballot. The SEC denied their request, clearing the way for the 
      shareholder proposal to appear on the proxy ballot.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The genocide-free investing shareholder proposals that IAG is 
      coordinating at JPMorgan Chase and other financial firms are simple and 
      reasonable. The text of Proposal 10 on the JPMorgan Chase ballot states, 
      &#8220;Shareholders request that the Board institute transparent procedures to 
      prevent holding investments in companies that, in management's judgment, 
      substantially contribute to genocide or crimes against humanity, the 
      most egregious violations of human rights. Management should encourage 
      JPMorgan funds with separate boards to institute similar procedures.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Similar proposals coordinated by IAG and submitted in previous years to 
      a variety of mutual fund companies have earned as much as 31% of the 
      votes despite strong opposition from management and voting rules that 
      significantly favor management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IAG withdrew its shareholder proposal at TIAA-CREF when the firm adopted 
      a public policy against investments connected to genocide. TIAA-CREF 
      subsequently divested holdings in oil companies that are helping to 
      support the genocide in Darfur, Sudan. Likewise, American Funds divested 
      its holdings in PetroChina (NYSE: PTR) following a well-publicized 
      shareholder vote on genocide-free investing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Eight years after the genocide in Darfur began, it&#8217;s time for financial 
      institutions to implement policies to avoid investments with ties to 
      genocide,&#8221; Cohen commented. &#8220;If thirty states, sixty colleges, 
      TIAA-CREF, and American Funds can avoid PetroChina, why can&#8217;t JPMorgan 
      Chase?&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IAG&#8217;s JPMorgan Chase shareholder proposal is the first one the group has 
      submitted to a corporation, rather than to individual mutual funds. 
      &#8220;Since JPMorgan Chase holds a shareholder meeting every year, unlike 
      most mutual funds, we&#8217;ll now have an annual opportunity to raise 
      awareness of the problem of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s large holdings in 
      PetroChina and the absence of a policy at JPMorgan Chase to avoid 
      investments tied to genocide,&#8221; said Cohen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important information for JPMorgan Chase securities holders:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase securities holders should read the proxy statement in 
      full because it contains important information. The definitive proxy 
      statement filed on April 7, 2011, and any other related documents, is 
      available at no charge from the Securities and Exchange Commission's 
      website: www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/19617/000119312511091290/ddef14a.htm

			About Investors Against Genocide
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investors Against Genocide is a citizen-led initiative, dedicated to 
      convincing mutual funds and other investment firms to make an ongoing 
      commitment to genocide-free investing. We ask investment firms to change 
      their investing strategy to avoid investments in companies which 
      substantially contribute to genocide or crimes against humanity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investors Against Genocide is staffed by volunteers and is a project of 
      the Massachusetts Coalition to Save Darfur Inc., a 501(c)(3) non-profit 
      charitable organization, incorporated in the state of Massachusetts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The Massachusetts Coalition to Save Darfur, Inc., its officers and 
        directors, their family members, and affiliates, taken together, own 
        less than 3,000 shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM).
      
			
        The Massachusetts Coalition to Save Darfur, Inc. and its project, 
        Investors Against Genocide, are supporting the proponent of the 
        'genocide-free investing' shareholder proposal in the 2011 JPMorgan 
        Chase proxy statement.
      
			
        The Massachusetts Coalition to Save Darfur, Inc. has provided and paid 
        for the May 11, 2011, advertisement in The Wall Street Journal and is 
        solely responsible for its content. That advertisement was made 
        possible through the generosity of a donor to the Massachusetts 
        Coalition to Save Darfur, Inc.

&lt;p&gt;  COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, May 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Xiotech Corporation, the ISE Company, today announced that Hybrid ISE was
named as a Finalist in the Hardware and Storage category of the Best of
Tech*Ed 2011 awards program. Xiotech will be showcasing Hybrid ISE in
Booth #1615 at the Microsoft Tech*Ed North America 2011 conference taking
place May 16-19 in Atlanta, Georgia.

    Hybrid ISE is a storage blade purpose built to eliminate the capacity and
performance trade-off inherent in traditional storage solutions. By
intelligently integrating HDDs and SSDs into a single "logical drive,"
Hybrid ISE delivers high performance in random I/O workloads like
virtualization, data warehousing and messaging. 

    The first enterprise hybrid approach to combine HDDs and SSDs in an
"Active-Active" storage pool, Hybrid ISE serves all volumes and improves
overall application performance. Through Xiotech's Continuous Adaptive
Data Placement (CADP) technology -- providing continuous monitoring,
statistics collection, ROI calculations, bi-directional dynamic data
movement and utilities that predict potential performance gains -- all
applications' data hot spots are automatically migrated to and from SSDs
offering "best-in-class" capacity and performance.

    "We received a record number of nominations this year -- more than 300 --
and determining an array of finalists from that large, diverse field was
difficult," said Jason Bovberg, Senior Editor at Windows IT Pro. "The mix
of products and services from year to year is ever-changing and exciting.
We look forward to our show-floor interviews, which will lead to the
determination of winners. For all categories, as always, our judging
process involves three criteria: strategic importance to the market,
competitive advantage and value to customers. Our winners will be
particularly strong in those areas."

    "Acquiring storage is no longer an either-or proposition. Hybrid ISE
fulfills organizations' performance and capacity demands -- at an
extremely attractive price," said Steve Sicola, CTO at Xiotech.
"Delivering unmatched reliability, performance, scalability and value --
the hallmarks of Xiotech's ISE storage blades -- Hybrid ISE is a
compelling solution that supports the business applications -- Exchange,
SQL Server, Hyper-V -- that drive today's enterprises."

    Produced by Penton Media's Windows IT Pro, SQL Server Magazine,
DevProConnections and SharePointPro, the Best of Tech*Ed 2011 awards
recognize companies that offer innovative products for the industry.
Winners will be announced at an invite-only evening reception at the
Georgia Aquarium in Atlanta, May 18.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS May 13 (Reuters) - Total (TOTF.PA) and Exxon Mobil
(XOM.N) plan to work together to assess the potential for shale
gas in the Lublin Basin of southeastern Poland, Total said in a
statement on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon will have 51 percent of the partnership, with Total
having a 49 percent interest, Total said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chelm and Werbkowice exploration concessions covered by
the deal relate to areas of 1,162 square kilometres and 995

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The complicated U.S. visa system hurts tourism and must be reformed if the United States wants to attract lucrative tourism from countries like China, India and Brazil, travel industry officials said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Travel Association announced a plan to help reform the visa process which it said could create 1.3 million U.S. jobs and add $859 billion to the U.S. economy by 2020 through increased overseas tourism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The challenge we have is the unnecessary, burdensome U.S. visa system," said USTA president Roger Dow. "It's really self-imposed barriers that we put on ourselves as a country that have caused us to lose international travel and that have stymied international growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Travellers have criticized the United States for long waits to get a visa and for a lack of access in some countries to U.S. consular offices. Some potential tourists have to travel across their country just for an interview for a visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Figures released by USTA show that while travel is the largest U.S. industry export sector, the United States has failed to keep pace with other parts of the world -- such as Western Europe -- as a travel destination in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking specifically at growing economies like China, India and Brazil, global long-haul travel grew 140 percent from 2000 to 2010 and is projected to double again over the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But only a fraction of that travel -- and the billions of dollars in revenue it creates -- went to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010 more than half the Brazilians travelling overseas went to Europe while 29 percent went to the United States. Nearly three times as many Chinese -- who spend the most on average while overseas -- chose Europe over the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top reasons for not visiting the United States were the visa process and strict security measures, the association said, referring to 2010 travellers' surveys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. visa process from beginning to end can take as long as 145 days in Brazil and 120 days in China, a USTA report said. In contrast, Britain takes an average of 12 days to process visas in Brazil and 11 days in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. 'DREAM DESTINATION'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the United States is the most frequently cited "dream destination" for Chinese tourists, France had 18 percent more Chinese visitors last year, a USTA report said. It said France's visa application process is more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are some of the fastest growing economies in the world," said Dow. "Shouldn't we be getting those people coming to the United States?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Democrat who chairs a subcommittee focused on export promotion and competitiveness, said the travel industry was important to help President Barack Obama meet his stated goal of doubling exports by 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see it as part of our economic recovery. I see this as a way to get jobs in our country," Klobuchar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Since 9/11 we have lost 20 percent of the international tourism market," she said. "Obviously after 9/11 there were changes that had to be made to our security measures. Now we've made those changes and we have to look at how can we make this more efficient, still keeping the security in place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Klobuchar supported the recommendations of the U.S. Travel Association report which urged the State Department to hire more consular officers and reduce visa interview wait times to 10 days or less. It also proposed expanding the number of countries in the  visa waiver program, which allows citizens of 36 nations to travel for up to 90 days without a visa.

&lt;p&gt;KHOBAR, Saudi Arabia May 15 (Reuters) - Saudi Basic
Industries Corp (SABIC) 2010.SE and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N)
Chemical signed engineering and licensing deals for their joint
synthetic rubber project in Saudi Arabia, SABIC said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; U.S. firm Jacobs Engineering (JEC.N) and Japan's Mitsui
Engineering  Shipbuilding (7003.T) will carry out front-end
engineering and design (FEED) work for the process units of the
Kemya project at Jubail on the Gulf coast, SABIC said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fluor Transworld Services Inc will execute the FEED for the
associated support facilities, the statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a separate statement, SABIC said it signed two deals with
Continental Carbon for a technology licence and marketing of the
carbon black produced at the planned plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SABIC did not give a value for the contracts nor provided a
cost figure for the project, although an executive from Exxon
Mobil Chemical has said it would cost $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The capacity of the project is more than 400,000 tonnes per
year of carbon black, rubber and synthetic polymers for domestic
and international sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SABIC did not say when the FEED work would be completed.

      Today&#8217;s corporate environment demands that every department adopt the 
      &#8220;Do More with Less&#8221; mantra. In enterprise legal operations that means 
      General Counsel need to effectively balance a growing portfolio of 
      litigation, strict regulatory enforcement, growing risks and heavy 
      penalties while being held to the same operating standards and 
      performance metrics as any other core business unit. Chief Compliance 
      Officers are similarly affected. A new array of regulations has been 
      complicated by hiring freezes, layoffs, and budget cuts. The result has 
      been predictable: more work for compliance officers and their staff with 
      fewer available resources.

matter said, a modest start in the first month of its launch.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By comparison, the Eurekahedge Asia Multi-Strategy index was
up 0.91 percent last month. The Eurekahedge Global
Multi-Strategy index was up 0.95 percent.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong-based Azentus Capital's fund, which started with
about $1 billion in assets on April 1, now manages in excess of
$1.3 billion and has commitments for an additional $1 billion,
two of the sources said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Started by former head of Goldman's Principal Strategies
group Sze, the hedge fund is one of the biggest to launch since
the onset of the credit crisis and one of the most high-profile
in Asia.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first month's return is a keenly watched number in the
$152 billion Asian hedge fund industry.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think it's a good result. It's not easy to put a billion
dollars without impacting the market," said Dan McNicholas, head
of Asia financing sales at Merrill Lynch. "All he needs to do is
put up safe numbers while he gets the operations established and
process built."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The fund has adopted a number of investment strategies
including equity long-short, risk arbitrage and special
situations investing. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the hedge fund could invest globally, the main
focus was on companies related to Asia, a source familiar with
the matter said. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Azentus Capital Chief Operating Officer Roger Denby-Jones
was not available for comment. The sources were not authorised
to speak to media.

has added a third co-head to its investment banking division,
as the company puts greater focus on overseas underwriting and
merger advisory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a memo to employees on Monday, Goldman said that Richard
Gnodde will join existing co-heads John Weinberg and David
Solomon in the new role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gnodde is based in London and has worked for Goldman in
Europe and Asia. He joined the bank in 1987.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, like other Wall Street banks, has placed a greater
focus on the investment banking business as trading operations
come under pressure from weak volumes and regulatory reform in
the wake of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But sales and trading is still the main source of Goldman's
revenue, generating nearly 56 percent of the bank's first
quarter revenue, compared with 11 percent for investment
banking businesses like merger advisory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also said Gordon Dyal will join Christopher Cole
as co-chairman of investment banking. Dyal had been global head
of MA, a role that will now be split between Yol Zaoui and
Gene T. Sykes, according to a separate memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The contents of the memos were confirmed by spokeswoman
Andrea Rachman, who declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In one of the memos, Goldman CEO Lloyd Blankfein said Zaoui
and Sykes bring "international experience, strong sector
knowledge and deep client relationships" for customers who
"increasingly operate as cross-border institutions, seeking
advice and execution expertise in every region."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News of the investment banking management changes were
first reported by the Wall Street Journal.

interest in three large oil-drilling licenses that the U.S.
energy firm says it has already been granted.

 Exxon says it signed agreements in 2009 with the Nigerian
government for the long-term renewal of licenses OML 67, 68 and
70, which it operates as part of a joint venture with state-run
Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC).

 The Nigerian government has said Exxon needs to express an
interest in acquiring licenses for these blocks.

 "The Nigerian government has given Exxon seven days to
express an interest in these licenses. Those seven days expire
on Thursday," an NNPC spokesman said.

 The disputed blocks are situated in the shallow water
creeks of the Niger Delta and are some of the largest
oil-producing assets in Africa's largest energy industry, with
a combined capacity of more than 500,000 barrels per day.

 "MPN (Exxon), as operator, strongly maintains that the
NNPC-MPN joint venture's long-term rights in those leases are
entirely valid and legally binding," Gloria Essien-Danner,
Exxon Nigeria executive director, said in a statement.

 "Accordingly, MPN will vigorously protect the rights that
it acquired in 2009," she said. Exxon said it would work with
the government to resolve any "confusion" over the leases.

 Delays to wide-ranging energy reforms mean several expired
drilling licenses dating back as far as 2008 have not been
renewed with foreign oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell
(RDSa.L) and Chevron (CVX.N).

 The Nigerian government has been reluctant to sign new
deals until the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which is likely
to increase royalties and taxes, has been passed into law.

 But the ambitious reforms have been subject to numerous
delays and amendments, making the details of the final draft
unclear. Oil executives have said billions of dollars of
investment are on hold until there is clarity.

 Nigeria's parliament is debating the bill, but the current
administration ends later this month. If the PIB is not passed
by then, new lawmakers may make amendments that could lead to
months of further delays.

 The government hopes the bill will tackle issues including
funding shortfalls at its joint ventures with foreign firms,
insecurity in the Niger Delta, increasing local involvement in
the industry and production of more gas for domestic power.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Takes Various Actions on JPMCC 2004-C1
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded six and upgraded three classes of J.P. 
      Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2004-C1 (JPMCC 
      2004-C1) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates. A detailed list 
      of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades reflect Fitch modeled losses of 4.3% of the remaining 
      pool; modeled losses of the original pool are at 3.14%, including losses 
      already incurred to date. Fitch has identified 29 loans (21.5%) as Fitch 
      Loans of Concern, which includes four specially-serviced loans (3.7%). 
      Of the four loans in special servicing, one loan (.23%) is real-estate 
      owned, two loans (1.8%) are 90 days or more delinquent, and one loan 
      (1.73%) is current.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upgrades are due to defeasance and 20.2% paydown since Fitch's last 
      rating action resulting in increased credit enhancement to the senior 
      classes. As of the April 2011 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has reduced by 36.9% to $657.4 million from $1.04 
      billion at issuance. In addition 15 loans (15.9%) have been fully 
      defeased. Interest shortfalls totaling $486,187 are currently affecting 
      class NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to modeled losses is a loan (1.5%) secured by a 
      157,711 square foot (sf) industrial complex located in Ontario, 
      California. Servicer reported occupancy has declined to 77% due to 
      vacancy and has resulted in a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of 0.69 
      times (x) as of year-end (YE) 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to modeled losses is a specially-serviced 
      loan (1%) secured by a 303 pad mobile home park located in Elyria, Ohio. 
      The loan was transferred to special servicing in April 2010 due to 
      monetary default and is now more than 90 days delinquent. The special 
      servicer continues to work with the borrower to cure the default and is 
      evaluating the borrower's proposal to return the property via a 
      deed-in-lieu.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to modeled losses is a loan (1.69%) 
      secured by a 170,791 sf retail center in Boise, Idaho. The largest 
      tenant is Edward's Cinema Boise owned by the Regal Entertainment Group 
      and occupies 62% of the space. Servicer reported DSCR has declined to 
      .93x as of June 2010. Performance of the property has declined due to 
      temporary rent reductions which have reduced rental income but helped 
      maintain occupancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has downgraded and assigned Recovery Ratings (RRs) to the 
      following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.5 million class J to 'BB/LS5' from 'BB+/LS5'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.2 million class K to 'B/LS5' from 'BB/LS5; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$3.9 million class L to 'B-/LS5' from 'BB-/LS5'; Outlook Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$5.2 million class M to 'CCC/RR1' from 'B/LS5';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.6 million class N to 'CCC/RR1' from 'B-/LS5';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.6 million class P to 'CCC/RR1' from 'B-/LS5'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has upgraded the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$22.1 million class D to 'AAA/LS5' from 'AA-/LS5'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$13 million class E to 'AA/LS5' from 'A/LS5'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11.7 million class F to 'A/LS5' from 'A-/LS5'; Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Also, Fitch has affirmed the following classes as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$46.5 million class A-2 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$303.2 million class A-3 at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$165.2 million class A-1A at 'AAA/LS1'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$27.4 million class B at 'AAA/LS4'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$11.7 million class C at 'AAA/LS5'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$9.1 million class G at 'BBB+/LS5'; Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$10.4 million class H at 'BBB-/LS5'; Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The $10.95 million class NR is not rated by Fitch. Class A-1 has paid in 
      full.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has withdrawn the rating on the interest-only class X-1. (For 
      additional information on the withdrawal of the rating on the 
      interest-only class, see 'Fitch Revises Practice for Rating IO

      Three top legislative leaders will be on hand for the nation&#8217;s largest 
      Memorial Day celebration as they serve as race officials for the 2011 
      Coca-Cola 600. Tennessee Speaker of the House Beth Harwell will be Grand 
      Marshal, South Carolina Speaker Bobby Harrell will be the Honorary 
      Starter and North Carolina Speaker Thom Tillis will host his colleagues 
      from neighboring states at the 52nd running of NASCAR&#8217;s only 
      600-mile race at the famed Charlotte Motor Speedway on Sunday, May 29.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Paying tribute to all veterans and active U.S. military servicemen and 
      women, the spectacular show preceding the Coca-Cola 600 includes a 
      military assault demonstration by Special Operations soldiers from Ft. 
      Bragg, N.C., on-stage recognition of Medal of Honor recipients, the 
      unfurling of a 11,250 square-foot American flag by family members of 
      active-duty soldiers, and an inspiring flyover by military aircraft.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are honored to have such distinguished public servants&#8212;and three 
      Speakers of the House&#8212;serve as race officials for the 2011 Coca-Cola 
      600,&#8221; said Lauren C. Steele, vice president, corporate affairs, 
      Coca-Cola Consolidated. &#8220;It is great that these top legislative leaders 
      will be on hand to pay tribute to America&#8217;s servicemen and women at the 
      largest Memorial Day celebration in the nation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As race officials, the three Speakers will be honored at a pre-race 
      event, attend the official drivers meeting, address the crowd of 140,000 
      fans, participate in the pre-race spectacular and present the trophy to 
      the winning driver in Victory Lane. As Grand Marshal, Tenn. Speaker 
      Harwell will ride in the official pace car, while S.C. Speaker Harrell 
      will wave the green flag over the 43-car field to start NASCAR&#8217;s most 
      challenging race. N.C. Speaker Tillis will direct the &#8216;Speaker Summit&#8217; 
      as host of the event.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Beth Harwell was elected as the first woman Speaker of the House in 
      Tenn. history earlier this year. She is currently serving in her 12th 
      term in the Tenn. House and represents part of Davidson County. She 
      received her bachelor of arts degree from David Lipscomb University, an 
      M.S. degree from George Peabody College, and a Ph.D. from Vanderbilt 
      University. She has been an assistant professor of political science at 
      Belmont University. She and her husband, Sam, have three children, 
      Allie, Sam, and Tucker.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I&#8217;m honored to be named Grand Marshal of the Coca-Cola 600, and it will 
      be a privilege to take part in the ceremonies honoring our men and women 
      in uniform at the largest Memorial Day celebration in our great nation,&#8221; 
      said Speaker Harwell.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bobby Harrell has served as S.C. Speaker of the House since 2005, and 
      has represented Charleston and Dorchester in the S.C. House since his 
      first election in 1992. He is a graduate of the University of South 
      Carolina and owner of several small businesses. He is currently serving 
      as Chairman of the National Speaker&#8217;s Conference. He and his wife, 
      Cathy, have two children, Trey and Charlotte.

      &#8220;Over our country&#8217;s history, great men and women have answered America&#8217;s

      &#8220;Hosting the nation&#8217;s largest Memorial Day celebration at the Coca-Cola 
      600 will be an honor. There are no citizens more worthy of recognition 
      than our nation&#8217;s military, and there is nothing more uniquely North 
      Carolinian than NASCAR,&#8221; Speaker Tillis said. &#8220;America is blessed with 
      the most exceptional military personnel in the world, and North Carolina 
      boasts a motorsports industry that serves as an economic engine 
      providing jobs and private sector capital for our state. It is also an

&lt;p&gt; * Twelve companies have agreed to buy back ARS debt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman, Wells Fargo did not admit wrongdoing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) bought back $26.9 million of
auction-rate securities from New Jersey clients to resolve
allegations they sold the debt without disclosing its risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state's division of consumer affairs on Monday said
Goldman bought back $25.5 million of the debt and paid a
$959,794 civil fine to the state, while Wells Fargo bought back
$1.37 million of the debt. Neither admitted wrongdoing in
agreeing to settle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twelve companies that marketed and sold auction-rate
securities have now agreed with the state to buy back $2.8
billion of the debt, New Jersey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the largest settlement, Swiss bank UBS AG (UBSN.VX) in
February agreed to buy back $1.5 billion of the debt and pay a
$3.79 million civil fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The $330 billion auction-rate securities market froze in
February 2008 when dealers stopped supporting it, leaving
investors stuck with illiquid debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators, including those joining a 12-state task force
examining the market, say the debt was marketed as being as
safe and as liquid as cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "State law requires disclosure of all material facts to
investors, particularly when their hard-earned money is on the
line," New Jersey Attorney General Paula Dow said in a
statement.

      Veeam Software, innovative provider of VMware

      recovery and VMware 
      management solutions for virtual datacenter environments, today 
      announced at Tech&#183;Ed North America that it is adding support for Windows

      Veeam Backup  Replication provides cost-effective, easy-to-use and

    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				2-in-1 backup and replication for Hyper-V: Veeam&#8217;s solution 
        includes replication, which provides near-continuous data protection 
        (near-CDP) and enables the best possible recovery time and recovery 
        point objectives (RTOs and RPOs).
      
			
				Changed block tracking for Hyper-V: Veeam&#8217;s new hypervisor 
        support includes technology for changed block tracking to enable fast, 
        frequent and efficient backup and replication of all VMs, including 
        those running on Cluster Shared Volumes (CSV).
      
			
				Built-in deduplication and compression: Included at no extra 
        charge, these capabilities minimize consumption of network bandwidth 
        and backup storage.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our customers and partners are increasingly asking about Hyper-V

      deduplication, Veeam will provide Hyper-V administrators with a complete 
      solution for virtualization-based data protection and disaster recovery 
      that is easy-to-use and cost-effective. Soon, organizations using

      &#8220;A multi-hypervisor environment is a reality for many organizations,&#8221; 
      said David Greschler, Director of Virtualization and Cloud Strategy for 
      Microsoft. &#8220;Veeam adds its backup and replication expertise to Microsoft 
      Hyper-V, enhancing the ability of organizations to manage their 
      multi-hypervisor environment in a consistent and cost-effective manner.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Recent ESG research found that more than 70% of virtualization survey 
      respondents cite the use of more than one hypervisor,&#8221; said Lauren 
      Whitehouse, Senior Analyst at Enterprise Strategy Group. &#8220;Having a 
      single solution that&#8217;s designed to back up, replicate and restore 
      multiple virtual environments increases reliability, speed and 
      management effectiveness.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Multi-hypervisor environments are quickly becoming the norm, not the 
      exception, and that poses serious management challenges to IT 
      organizations,&#8221; said Ashish Nadkarni, Senior Analyst and Consultant at 
      Taneja Group. &#8220;IT managers need to select virtualization management 
      solutions, including backup and replication solutions, that can work 
      with more than one hypervisor.&#8221;

				Technology selected and license agreements signed
			
			
				Educational partner selected for vocational training center in Yanbu
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (SABIC) and affiliates of ExxonMobil 
      Chemical announced that Front-End Engineering Design contracts were 
      awarded and that all components are in FEED phase for the proposed new 
      elastomers project at their Al-Jubail Petrochemical Company (KEMYA) 
      joint venture petrochemical plant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FEED contracts were awarded to Jacobs Engineering Inc. and Mitsui 
      Engineering  Shipbuilding for process units and to Fluor Transworld 
      Services Inc. for associated support facilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "This elastomers project will be the basis for the creation of a 
      world-class rubber value chain in Saudi Arabia and a valuable extension 
      of our offering of products and services to our customers in key 
      markets," said Koos van Haasteren, SABIC executive vice president, 
      Performance Chemicals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;In addition to supporting local industry, the expansion at the KEMYA 
      joint venture in Al-Jubail would provide additional new capacity of 
      butyl rubber and EPDM (ethylene propylene diene monomer)
			specialty 
      elastomers to meet the growing global demand for these products,&#8221; said 
      Neil Chapman, senior vice president, Polymers, ExxonMobil Chemical 
      Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The project is expected to establish a domestic supply of more than 
      400,000 metric tons of rubber [butyl, styrene butadiene rubber (SBR), 
      butadiene rubber and EPDM], thermoplastic specialty polymers and carbon 
      black to serve emerging local and international markets in Asia and the 
      Middle East.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The project also includes the establishment of a vocational training 
      center and product application development and support center aligned 
      with Saudi Arabia&#8217;s National Industrial Clusters Development Program to 
      grow and diversify the manufacturing sector in Saudi Arabia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third-party license agreements have been signed with Continental Carbon 
      Company for its carbon black production technology and with The Goodyear 
      Tire  Rubber Company for its SBR and polybutadiene rubber technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The University of Akron Research Foundation was selected to design, 
      train and support the vocational training center, The
			High 
      Institute for Elastomer Industries, in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia. The 
      training center will utilize the University's expertise in polymer 
      science and education to provide elastomers technology vocational 
      training for workers to support a planned downstream elastomers 
      conversion industry in Saudi Arabia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, a separate product application development and support 
      center will be part of the new SABIC facilities at the Riyadh Techno 
      Valley research complex at King Saud University.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The final decision to implement the elastomers project requires the 
      approval of KEMYA&#8217;s Board of Directors.

&lt;p&gt;  ATLANTA, GA, May 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Altova(R) (http://www.altova.com), creator of XMLSpy(R), the industry
leading XML editor, offers a host of features for users working with
Microsoft(R) technologies in the Altova MissionKit(R), the integrated
suite of XML, database, and UML tools for XML developers and software
architects. The latest release of the MissionKit -- Version 2011 Release
2 -- builds upon existing support for Microsoft Word and Office 2010 with
new functionality for comparing and merging Microsoft Word documents in
Altova DiffDog(R). Some other MissionKit features helpful for developers,
designers, and DBAs working with Microsoft technologies include powerful
functionality for SQL Server(R) database development and reporting,
integration with SharePoint(R) Server, seamless integration with Visual
Studio(R), and much more. 

    Please note: All the products described below are available for purchase
individually or as part of the specially-priced Altova MissionKit tool
suite.

    "With each new release we aim to provide our customers with support for
the latest Microsoft technologies, in the context of everything from
end-user content management and reporting, to application and database
development. By supporting these popular tools and technologies we are
giving developers, designers, and DBAs, unique, advanced functionality to
help enhance their development efforts," said Alexander Falk, President &amp;
CEO for Altova. 


--  SQL Server Support - The Altova MissionKit includes extensive support
    for SQL Server 2000, 2005, and 2008, as well as all other major
    relational database types. DatabaseSpy(R), Altova's multi-database
    tool, provides powerful support for SQL editing, database structure
    design, content editing, structure and content comparison, and
    database conversion.
    
    
    XMLSpy allows users to easily connect to a database, generate an XML
    Schema based on the database, import and export data based on database
    structures, and easily generate database structures from XML Schemas.
    XMLSpy's ability to convert and move seamlessly between databases and
    XML files helps to reduce interoperability issues.
    
    
    MapForce also provides support for mapping between SQL Server (and
    other databases) and XML, flat files, EDI, Excel, XBRL, and Web
    services, giving users an easy way to transform data between databases
    and other prevalent business data formats.
    
    
    Additionally, StyleVision generates eye-catching, multi-channel
    database reports in HTML, RTF, PDF, Word, and Authentic electronic
    forms that include powerful visualization features such as advanced
    data processing and formatting rules, charts, barcodes, and more.
    
    
    UModel(R), Altova's advanced UML tool, includes functionality for
    relational database modeling that helps users create and modify robust
    databases using Unified Modeling Language and automatic SQL script
    generation.
    
    
--  Office 2010 Support - Multiple MissionKit tools support OOXML, the
    default file format for Microsoft Office documents. In the recent
    release of Version 2011 Release 2, DiffDog added a powerful new
    feature for comparing Microsoft Word documents. The integration of
    Microsoft Word into the DiffDog user interface delivers greater
    flexibility as users can utilize familiar Word functions while
    comparing and editing documents within the diff/merge tool.
    
    
    Additionally, Altova XMLSpy can be used to access, edit, transform,
    and query XML data saved in Office formats and zipped files.
    MapForce(R), Altova's graphical data mapping tool, supports
    mapping, transforming, and instantly converting between any
    combination of Excel data and XML, databases, flat files, EDI, XBRL,
    and Web services. Also StyleVision(R), the visual stylesheet and
    report design tool, can be used to transform XML, XBRL, and database
    content into HTML, RTF, PDF, Word, and Authentic eForm formats.
    
    
--  SharePoint Server Support - The XMLSpy XML editor provides strong
    integration with SharePoint Server, including full file read/write
    capabilities using WebDAV, as well as check-in/check-out checkout
    versioning functionality to facilitate easy editing and debugging of
    XML, XSLT, XML Schema, and other XML-based files stored on
    SharePoint.
    
    
--  Visual StudioIntegration - Altova XMLSpy, MapForce, StyleVision, and
    UModel offer complete and seamless integration with the Visual Studio
    development platform. When users run any of these products inside
    Visual Studio, the Altova tool uses the native project management of
    Visual Studio, and at the same time users get all the specialized
    tools and advanced functionality that XMLSpy, MapForce, StyleVision,
    and UModel are known for -- directly inside the Visual Studio IDE.
    
    
--  Royalty-free Code Generation - The MissionKit also provides support
    for generating royalty free program code in C# and other languages.
    XMLSpy will autogenerate application code in C# based on a data model
    defined in an XML Schema, helping free developers from having to write
    low level infrastructure code. Additionally, to help automate the
    process of data integration, MapForce generates data transformation
    code in C# that can be used in the user's custom applications. UModel
    can also automatically generate C# and VB.NET source code based on a
    UML class or component diagram. Users can make revisions to the model
    and generate updated code without rewriting manually.

&lt;p&gt;The news dashes the hopes of those who believed they were eligible for the next step in obtaining one of the coveted "green card" lottery visas and gives a second, if remote, chance to the rest of the 19.6 million people who had applied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of a computer programing error, 90 percent of the winners were selected from the first two days of applications rather than from the entire 30-day registration period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We sincerely regret any inconvenience or disappointment this problem might have caused," David Donahue, the State Department official who oversees the program, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that the problem had been fixed and the results of the new drawing from among the same 19.6 million people who applied were expected to be available around July 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the Diversity Immigrant Visa Program, the U.S. government makes available some 50,000 visas each year drawn randomly to people who come from countries with low rates of immigration to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lottery gives the winners the opportunity to immigrate without having a family member or an employer sponsor them -- the typical route to a U.S. "green card" denoting permanent residency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Donahue said the U.S. government wrote the malfunctioning computer program. Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said no one will be disciplined for the error.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Arshad Mohammed; Editing by Paul Simao)&lt;/p&gt;

			Spectra Logic Extends Enterprise Tape Library Offering with New IBM 
      TS1140 Tape Drives
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Provides Customers with Increased Tape Drive Choice and Flexibility
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Spectra
				Logic, celebrating more than 30 years of data storage 
      innovation, today announced it is offering the IBM TS1140 Tape Drive 
      with its enterprise class T-Finity 
      tape library.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The addition of TS1140 drives extends Spectra Logic&#8217;s enterprise tape 
      library offering, which includes the TS1140 drives for high capacity, 
      high duty cycle environments, as well as high value, cost-effective IBM 
      LTO tape drives for all-purpose, open storage environments. Spectra 
      Logic is currently the only tape library vendor aside from IBM offering 
      the high performance, energy-efficient TS1140 Tape Drive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The IBM TS1140 Tape Drive provides 4.0 TB native storage capacity (8.0 
      TB with 2:1 compression) and native data transfer rates of 240 MB/s (480 
      MB/s compressed). The TS1140 drive can support connectivity to high 
      speed 8 Gb fibre channel environments. Offered exclusively with IBM and 
      Spectra Logic tape libraries, the higher capacity TS1140 Tape Drives 
      give organizations the ability to keep the same physical footprint while 
      keeping up with burgeoning data growth and data center space constraints.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Offering strong tape drive options for our enterprise tape libraries 
      exemplifies Spectra Logic&#8217;s leadership and continuing commitment to 
      provide data intensive organizations with the best technology options to 
      meet their storage and archive needs,&#8221; said Molly 
      Rector, vice president of product management and worldwide 
      marketing, Spectra Logic. &#8220;The small footprint and low power 
      requirements of Spectra&#8217;s T-Finity 
      tape library combined with IBM LTO and TS1140 Tape Drives provide 
      customers with exceptional storage density and energy efficiency. With 
      data growth continuing at a record pace, tape archive and storage is 
      emerging as an integral part of data center solutions across the globe.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Spectra 
      T-Finity provides an exceptional set of built-in Enterprise features 
      around data integrity verification, management, maintenance and 
      encryption. Using TS1140 drives, it provides up to 740.2 PBs of 
      compressed storage in a single library complex. Based on Spectra's 
      unique TeraPack media management system, T-Finity&#160;maximizes data center 
      space utilization and consumes up to 50 percent less power than 
      competing enterprise tape libraries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The high performance, energy efficient TS1140 employs fewer and more 
      efficient components developed with IBM Research to help clients improve 
      productivity at a lower cost,&#8221; said Sanjay Tripathi, director and 
      business line executive for IBM data protection and retention. &#8220;Spectra 
      Logic&#8217;s announcement demonstrates that IBM continues to lead in the 
      innovation of tape drive technology some 60 years after we invented it.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  IRVINE, CA, May 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Vision Solutions, Inc., a leading provider of information availability
software and services with over 25,000 customers running Windows, Linux,
IBM Power Systems and Cloud Computing environments, today announced the
release of the latest versions of its Double-Take Move, RecoverNow and
Availability products. The updates in version 5.3 expand support for
virtualized IT environments as well as providing faster and easier
installation of disaster recovery solutions for virtual machines.

    Highlights of the new product launches include:


--  Simplified management and protection of virtual environments --
    Double-Take Availability 5.3 allows configuration of virtual machine
    (VM) protection at the host level, avoiding the need to pre-install
    software on VM. The replication agent is automatically injected into
    each protected VM at the completion of the job configuration. The
    combination of host-level management and real-time byte-level
    replication of each VM results in efficient protection that is easy to
    manage.
--  Improved protection for virtual clusters -- For remote availability of
    workloads based on Microsoft Hyper-V, Double-Take Availability now
    supports protection of clustered Hyper-V hosts over wide area
    networks. The integration of Hyper-V clustering and Double-Take
    real-time replication of data provides unified local availability and
    remote availability for Hyper-V hosts. As part of this, administrators
    also have the choice to set the IP address to use on the target side,
    providing greater flexibility around fail-over.
--  Expanded Microsoft Exchange support -- Double-Take Availability 5.3
    now supports protection of Exchange 2010 in Database Availability
    Group (DAG) environments -- this is particularly valuable for
    organizations that want to implement disaster recovery for DAG
    installations across low-bandwidth environments. Double-Take
    RecoverNow 5.3 also enhances its protection of Exchange 2010 by now
    offering Exchange log file trimming capabilities. This ability to
    schedule trimming of log files on the production server is coordinated
    with application consistent recovery points on the repository server
    for the flexibility to recover from the most recent data or an earlier
    application-consistent snapshot.
--  Updated OS support -- Double-Take 5.3 now supports Microsoft Windows
    Server 2008 R2 SP1 across the Availability, RecoverNow and Move
    products.
--  Simplified, effective Failback operations -- Minimizing downtime with
    an effective availability plan is only half the battle. Getting back
    to "how things were," or failing back, can be just as stressful, as
    the process can incur its own downtime. Double-Take Availability 5.3
    adds additional capabilities to both full-server failover and VM
    failover to reduce the potential for downtime during a failback. New
    within Double-Take 5.3 is support for multi-job failback tasks and
    enterprise-wide monitoring capabilities.
--  Unified Console provides a single UI for all operations -- Vision
    Solutions has expanded its management console functionality and
    unified management of all protection modes under a single screen. For
    organizations involved in datacenter consolidations and migrations
    spanning multiple sites, version 5.3 has the ability to carve up and
    assign pools of licenses for each location, as well as Enterprise
    Installation and deeper bandwidth scheduling features. Alongside this,
    Full-Server Failover (FFO), file and folder job types added to the
    management console, while the administrator can also now select one or
    multiple jobs to act upon.

    

Quotes:

 Alan Arnold, executive vice president and chief technology
officer with Vision Solutions:
 "Double-Take version 5.3 makes it simpler
to protect critical workloads, wherever they happen to be within the
enterprise. It does not matter if the application is sitting on a
physical or virtual server, or the destination for that data is on a
local network, across a WAN or out in the cloud: Double-Take Availability
provides real time replication of information changes and to any target
machine. This ability to use one approach to data protection, regardless
of the underlying platform is proving very popular with customers as they
seek to improve and streamline their approach to business continuity and
disaster recovery."

    Scott VanDyke, product marketing manager with Vision Solutions:
 "The
latest version of Double-Take is designed to resolve some of the biggest
challenges that exist for managers of virtualized environments when it
comes to disaster recovery. By simplifying the processes around deploying
and managing DR solutions, customers can benefit from real-time
replication and protection for their virtual machines."

    Mark Di Ciano, director with MDCnet Computers:
 "Double-Take Availability
is a very easy to use and reliable disaster recovery solution for
replicating virtual machines across a LAN or WAN. The software is simple
to install and administer through the centralised console using wizards
and a logical user interface. The replication engine has minimal impact
on the performance of the hosts and our Hyper-V 5.3 virtual machines, and
it recovers well after unexpected failures on the cluster without any
loss of data or downtime to the production system."

    Double-Take Availability 5.3 allows configuration of virtual machine
    (VM) protection at the host level, avoiding the need to pre-install
    software on VM. The replication agent is automatically injected into
    each protected VM at the completion of the job configuration. The
    combination of host-level management and real-time byte-level
    replication of each VM results in efficient protection that is easy to
    manage.
--  Improved protection for virtual clusters -- For remote availability of
    workloads based on Microsoft Hyper-V, Double-Take Availability now
    supports protection of clustered Hyper-V hosts over wide area
    networks. The integration of Hyper-V clustering and Double-Take
    real-time replication of data provides unified local availability and
    remote availability for Hyper-V hosts. As part of this, administrators
    also have the choice to set the IP address to use on the target side,
    providing greater flexibility around fail-over.
--  Expanded Microsoft Exchange support -- Double-Take Availability 5.3
    now supports protection of Exchange 2010 in Database Availability
    Group (DAG) environments -- this is particularly valuable for
    organizations that want to implement disaster recovery for DAG
    installations across low-bandwidth environments. Double-Take
    RecoverNow 5.3 also enhances its protection of Exchange 2010 by now
    offering Exchange log file trimming capabilities. This ability to
    schedule trimming of log files on the production server is coordinated
    with application consistent recovery points on the repository server
    for the flexibility to recover from the most recent data or an earlier
    application-consistent snapshot.
--  Updated OS support -- Double-Take 5.3 now supports Microsoft Windows
    Server 2008 R2 SP1 across the Availability, RecoverNow and Move
    products.
--  Simplified, effective Failback operations -- Minimizing downtime with
    an effective availability plan is only half the battle. Getting back
    to "how things were," or failing back, can be just as stressful, as
    the process can incur its own downtime. Double-Take Availability 5.3
    adds additional capabilities to both full-server failover and VM
    failover to reduce the potential for downtime during a failback. New
    within Double-Take 5.3 is support for multi-job failback tasks and
    enterprise-wide monitoring capabilities.
--  Unified Console provides a single UI for all operations -- Vision
    Solutions has expanded its management console functionality and
    unified management of all protection modes under a single screen. For
    organizations involved in datacenter consolidations and migrations
    spanning multiple sites, version 5.3 has the ability to carve up and
    assign pools of licenses for each location, as well as Enterprise
    Installation and deeper bandwidth scheduling features. Alongside this,
    Full-Server Failover (FFO), file and folder job types added to the
    management console, while the administrator can also now select one or
    multiple jobs to act upon.

    

Quotes:

 Alan Arnold, executive vice president and chief technology
officer with Vision Solutions:
 "Double-Take version 5.3 makes it simpler
to protect critical workloads, wherever they happen to be within the
enterprise. It does not matter if the application is sitting on a
physical or virtual server, or the destination for that data is on a
local network, across a WAN or out in the cloud: Double-Take Availability
provides real time replication of information changes and to any target
machine. This ability to use one approach to data protection, regardless
of the underlying platform is proving very popular with customers as they
seek to improve and streamline their approach to business continuity and
disaster recovery."

    Scott VanDyke, product marketing manager with Vision Solutions:
 "The
latest version of Double-Take is designed to resolve some of the biggest
challenges that exist for managers of virtualized environments when it
comes to disaster recovery. By simplifying the processes around deploying
and managing DR solutions, customers can benefit from real-time
replication and protection for their virtual machines."

    Mark Di Ciano, director with MDCnet Computers:
 "Double-Take Availability
is a very easy to use and reliable disaster recovery solution for
replicating virtual machines across a LAN or WAN. The software is simple
to install and administer through the centralised console using wizards
and a logical user interface. The replication engine has minimal impact
on the performance of the hosts and our Hyper-V 5.3 virtual machines, and
it recovers well after unexpected failures on the cluster without any
loss of data or downtime to the production system."

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Retail Orphan Initiative  IBM Collaborate to Help Retailers Raise 
      Money for Charity
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IBM SurePOS ACE Auto RoundUp Feature Helps Shoppers Turn Small 
      Change into Big Change for Orphans
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Big changes are happening in communities across the country, inspired by 
      shoppers who just say, &#8220;keep the change.&#8221; The Retail Orphan Initiative RetailROI, 
      in collaboration with IBM, has launched a national campaign designed to 
      make it easy for retailers to raise money for charities at the point of 
      sale (POS).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Using an Auto RoundUp feature powered by IBM's SurePOS ACE retail 
      software, shoppers can choose to donate change from their transactions 
      to RetailROI's Round-up 
      for Orphans campaign or other charities supported by their local 
      retail establishments. Retailers simply "round up" transaction totals to 
      the next whole dollar automatically during checkout.&#160;IBM ACE software 
      with Auto RoundUp is installed at more than 90,000 checkout lanes 
      worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Small donations at the POS can add up to big contributions. Instead of 
      having a jar for donations, the donations are tracked through the 
      point-of-sale system. The retailer then makes a single check on behalf 
      of consumers. Retailers can then choose to match all, or a portion, of 
      the donations provided. Additional information can be found at http://www.ibm.com/products/retail/products/roundup.html.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RetailROI's Round-up for Orphans campaign provides funding for orphan 
      care (food, shelter and clothing), adoption, mentoring, and child rescue 
      from human trafficking. According to UNICEF, somewhere in the world a 
      child dies every 5.2 seconds, and every 14 seconds, an orphaned child 
      ages out of a government protective system (if there is one).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A recent 
      study from analyst firm IHL Group, "Why Charity in Retail is Good 
      Business," indicated that 65 percent of consumers say they are 
      influenced to shop at stores that support community charity initiatives. 
      Yet, only 28 percent of shoppers know if their community stores are 
      actively involved in charitable giving.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "RetailROI applauds IBM's commitment and leadership with this POS 
      platform feature," said RetailROI Donor Trustee Vicki Cantrell, COO/CIO, 
      Tory Burch. "Working together, retailers and customers can make a huge 
      difference by helping either vulnerable children through contributions 
      to the orphan program, or by contributing spare change to other worthy 
      causes."
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About RetailROI
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RetailROI is a charitable foundation under the umbrella of the Giving 
      Back Fund, established to help the 400 million orphaned and vulnerable 
      children worldwide; RetailROI provides grants to charities that provide

			DataCore Showcases Use Cases and Next-Generation Storage 
      Virtualization Software, SANsymphony-V at Microsoft Tech&#8226;Ed
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Delivers the critical &#8220;third dimension&#8221; to virtualization: software 
      to cost-effectively shape the shared storage infrastructure required by 
      virtual IT environments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DataCore Software, the industry&#8217;s premier provider of storage 
      virtualization software, today announced that it is showcasing its SANsymphony&#8482;-V 
      solution at this week&#8217;s Microsoft 
      Tech&#8226;Ed North America 2011 conference. SANsymphony-V is DataCore&#8217;s 
      next-generation storage virtualization software solution that enables IT 
      organizations to eliminate storage-related barriers preventing them from 
      realizing the financial and operational goals of their virtualization 
      initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tech&#8226;Ed 2011 takes place at the Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta 
      from Monday, May 16 until Thursday, May 19, 2011. DataCore is a Silver 
      Sponsor and is exhibiting in Booth 1629. To read more about DataCore&#8217;s 
      solutions and use cases in Microsoft environments, download the Taneja 
      Group profile, &#8220;Building 
      the Virtual Infrastructure with DataCore SANsymphony-V.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DataCore&#8482; SANsymphony-V enables data centers to use existing equipment 
      and conventional storage devices to satisfy shared storage requirements 
      introduced by highly dynamic, virtual IT environments. It provides a 
      Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V SP1 based set of advanced storage 
      virtualization functions to provision, share, reconfigure, migrate, 
      replicate, expand, and upgrade storage. This cost-effectively speeds up 
      applications, delivers uninterrupted data access, and extends the useful 
      life of storage devices, contrasting sharply with the expensive &#8220;rip and 
      replace&#8221; approaches being proposed to support desktop and server 
      virtualization projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s full range of virtualization solutions provide partners and 
      customers with an effective way to save costs, increase availability, 
      and improve agility within their business infrastructure,&#8221; said Mike 
      Schutz, senior director of product management for the Server and Cloud 
      division at Microsoft Corp. &#8220;By using Microsoft Windows Server 2008 R2 
      Hyper-V SP1 and Microsoft System Center, customers can also take 
      advantage of DataCore SANsymphony-V and explore ways to reduce
			the 
      cost of storage while delivering improved performance and availability.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Enterprise-class Solution Purpose-Built for Windows Server 2008 R2
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Two years in development, DataCore designed SANsymphony-V to meet the 
      needs of midmarket end-users and solution-providers, especially those 
      familiar with Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V SP1 administration eager to 
      adapt their IT operations to accommodate the many variables that server 
      and desktop virtualization introduce. It is interoperable with 
      Microsoft&#8217;s virtualization infrastructure, including Windows Server 2008 
      R2 Hyper-V SP1, System Center, and Failover Clustering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While some vendors in the virtualization field recommend that customers 
      lock themselves into specific storage hardware configurations and exotic 
      purpose-built appliances, SANsymphony-V frees customers from hardware 
      lock-in by decoupling the virtual infrastructure from the underlying 
      disks. It also optimizes the I/O response obtained from standard storage 
      devices that would have otherwise needed to be replaced. Then when 
      customers need to expand capacity, they can simply choose the best deal 
      at the time from a number of suppliers rather than be limited to one 
      specific vendor&#8217;s hardware.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Shared storage is often the &#8216;weak link&#8217; in server and desktop 
      virtualization initiatives; first as a performance bottleneck and then 
      as a single point-of-failure. Many times, virtualization projects 
      intended to reduce server or desktop costs hit the storage wall,&#8221; said 
      George Teixeira, president and CEO of DataCore Software. &#8220;We employ 
      sophisticated software portable and scalable across Windows Server 2008 
      R2 Hyper-V SP1 to overcome the storage-related roadblocks standing 
      between IT organizations and their virtualization objectives.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Real-world Successes Built on Virtualization Software
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At Tech&#8226;Ed 2011, DataCore is also highlighting a number of customers 
      that deploy Microsoft solutions in conjunction with a virtualized 
      storage infrastructure powered by DataCore Software.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloud services provider AcXess, 
      for example, is using DataCore&#8217;s SANsymphony&#8482; software to create a 
      dynamic, resilient virtual storage infrastructure that cost-effectively 
      supports the company&#8217;s Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V virtualization 
      environment and its business model.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AcXess has built its business around flexible virtualization 
      technologies designed to meet the needs of key customers who rely on 
      AcXess to provide reasonably priced services such as on-demand sales 
      demos, proof-of-concept (POC) labs, and training sessions in virtualized 
      environments to thousands of employees, partners, and customers. Using 
      Windows Server 2008 R2 Hyper-V and DataCore, AcXess has doubled the 
      number of users year over year and has grown its business 300 percent, 
      while saving $5 million in hardware costs. A full case study is 
      available on Microsoft&#8217;s 
      website.

			On Display at Microsoft TechEd 2011, ScriptLogic&#8217;s Security Explorer 
      Brings Wide Range of Security Information to IT Admin&#8217;s Fingertips
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Product Version Spotlights ScriptLogic&#8217;s Ongoing Commitment to 
      Simplifying and Streamlining Strategic IT Tasks
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ScriptLogic&#174; Corporation (www.scriptlogic.com), 
      a leading provider of systems lifecycle management solutions for 
      Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174;-based networks, today unveiled Security 
      Explorer&#174; 8.0 at Microsoft TechEd North America 2011. Already 
      selected as a finalist for the TechEd Best of Show awards, Security 
      Explorer streamlines access control and IT 
      security management across entire Windows networks, and among many 
      enhancements, the new version adds new views and interface panes to 
      easily access and execute the product&#8217;s most powerful functions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Security Explorer 8.0 is part of the full line of ScriptLogic products 
      that will be demonstrated in its booth (#503) at Microsoft TechEd, which 
      is held May 16-19 in Atlanta. ScriptLogic&#8217;s products make lives easier 
      for IT pros while contributing to strategic security and compliance 
      initiatives. IT administrators deploy Security Explorer to back up, 
      recover, manage, search, migrate, and report on permissions for Windows 
      Server, Exchange Server, SharePoint&#174; Server, and SQL Server&#174;, all from 
      within a common, simplified graphical user interface. Security Explorer 
      is the only server management tool that provides administrators with a 
      single view of permissions across multiple server platforms, important 
      as companies look to expand and enhance their IT networks to meet 
      business needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our customers tell us that Security Explorer offers extremely powerful 
      functionality, and they ask us for easier ways to view critical 
      information to more quickly capitalize on the product&#8217;s services,&#8221; said 
      Andy Langsam, president of ScriptLogic. &#8220;With version 8.0, we are 
      bringing common Security Explorer functions, as well as specific user 
      and resource information, much closer to IT pros, allowing them to more 
      quickly execute common tasks. Certain IT operations, such as resetting 
      services passwords across a network, are now done in dramatically less 
      time than before.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Security Explorer enhancements benefit IT administrators by streamlining 
      day-to-day tasks:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				New Tasks View: A simple wizard makes common Security Explorer 
        permissions management-related functions available, presented as 
        tasks. With a few simple clicks, IT admins can grant, remove or clone 
        permissions, find unknown or disabled users, and generate reports. 
        Frequent IT admin tasks are much easier to complete, saving time and 
        hassle.
      
			
				Control Pane: A control pane has been added to the classic 
        Security Explorer Browse View, which provides an instant view of 
        permission information when browsing the network. IT admins can now 
        quickly execute a wide variety of tasks in the context of a resource 
        selected within the browse view. The enhancement brings powerful 
        Security Explorer functionality closer to the IT admin and allows them 
        to more easily run tasks.
      
			
				Pre-Defined Reporting: The new version adds numerous 
        pre-defined formatted reports that allow users to report on 
        permissions, users and group membership information and other security 
        related details on file servers, SharePoint, SQL Server and Exchange. 
        In most modules, IT admins can choose to create either an export-type 
        report or a search-type report.
      
			
				Disabled Account Management: New functionality searches for, 
        reports on and manages access granted to disabled accounts on file 
        servers, SharePoint, SQL Server and Exchange. IT admins can now 
        quickly remove security permissions for disabled accounts, a critical 
        step to ensure overall security as these accounts present a potential 
        path to crucial enterprise data.
      
			
        A variety of other features simplify functions for IT pros, including 
        comparing permissions after a data migration, cloning of group 
        membership settings to simplify creation of new accounts, managing 
        multiple group membership settings at once, expanded PowerShell 
        functionality and the ability to remove SharePoint permissions 
        represented by accounts deleted from Active Directory.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pricing and Availability
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

			Pfizer To Present New Research From Fifteen Compounds Highlighting 
      Multiple Approaches To Targeting Cancer At 2011 ASCO Annual Meeting
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pivotal Head-to-Head Phase 3 Data to be Presented for Axitinib Vs. 
      Sorafenib in Patients with Previously Treated Advanced Renal Cell 
      Carcinoma
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			First Time Overall Survival Data to be Presented for Crizotinib in 
      Patients with ALK-Positive Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. will present more than 30 abstracts, including data from 
      investigational compounds, axitinib,1 crizotinib,2 
      and bosutinib,3 as well as data evaluating Sutent&#174; (sunitinib 
      malate), across multiple tumor types,4,5 at the 47th 
      Annual Meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in 
      Chicago from June 3-7. The Company will also share analyses from early 
      stage compounds focused on the science behind tumor growth.6,7,8
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The research we are presenting at ASCO represents Pfizer&#8217;s continued 
      commitment to finding novel treatment solutions and improving the lives 
      of patients with cancer,&#8221; said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice 
      president of clinical development and medical affairs for Pfizer&#8217;s 
      Oncology Business Unit. &#8220;We are excited to present data demonstrating 
      the efficacy and tolerability of several of our late-stage compounds, 
      while also highlighting early phase clinical research exploring key 
      mechanisms and promising pathways which may help inspire new potential 
      therapeutic approaches for many difficult to treat cancers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Axitinib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer is presenting results from the Phase 3 AXIS 1032 trial, comparing 
      axitinib to sorafenib in patients with previously-treated advanced renal 
      cell carcinoma (RCC). These are the first pivotal head-to-head data 
      comparing active, targeted therapies in advanced RCC (Oral presentation, 
      Abstract #4503, June 6).1 In addition, two other axitinib RCC 
      abstracts will be presented.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Patient-reported outcomes (PRO) from the AXIS 1032 trial (Oral 
        presentation, Abstract #4504, June 6)9

        second-line treatment for patients with metastatic RCC (Poster 
        discussion, Abstract #4547, June 7)10
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Axitinib is an oral and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial 
      growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2 and 3,1 receptors that 
      can influence tumor growth, vascular angiogenesis and progression of 
      cancer (the spread of tumors).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Crizotinib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At ASCO, Pfizer will publicly present for the first time data from an 
      early stage study demonstrating the impact of crizotinib, an oral, 
      first-in-class compound that inhibits the anaplastic lymphoma kinase, or 
      ALK, compared to historical controls, on overall survival in patients 
      with advanced ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Oral 
      presentation, Abstract #7507, June 5).2

			Bosutinib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer continues to investigate the potential of targeting specific 
      pathways in hematologic malignancies, and will provide an update on 
      clinical trials of bosutinib as a single agent in both newly diagnosed3 
      and previously treated patients with Philadelphia chromosome positive 
      (Ph+) chronic phase (CP) chronic myeloid leukemia (CML).13

        18-month follow up data from the Bosutinib Efficacy and safety in 
        chronic myeloid LeukemiA [BELA] Phase 3 study evaluating bosutinib as 
        a first-line treatment in patients with CP CML (Poster discussion, 
        Abstract #6509, June 3)3
			
			
        Bosutinib as third-line therapy for CP CML patients following failure

		&lt;p&gt;
      Bosutinib is an investigational oral dual Src and Abl kinase inhibitor 
      with minimal inhibitory activity against c-kit and PDGFR.16 
      It is believed that by dual inhibition of the Src and Abl tyrosine 
      kinases, bosutinib may inhibit signaling in CML cells that allows the 
      cells to grow, survive and reproduce.17
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sutent
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since its approval in 2006, Sutent has changed the treatment landscape 
      for advanced RCC and imatinib-resistant or -intolerant gastrointestinal 
      stromal tumors (GIST) and remains a standard of care in these 
      indications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In November 2010, Sutent was approved in Europe for the treatment of 
      unresectable or metastatic, well-differentiated pancreatic 
      neuroendocrine tumors (NET) with disease progression in adults. 
      Experience with Sutent as first-line treatment is limited. Sutent is 
      currently under review by the U.S. FDA for the treatment of unresectable 
      pancreatic NET.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At ASCO, Pfizer will present new analyses from trials evaluating Sutent 
      in patients with advanced unresectable pancreatic NET4 and in 
      patients with metastatic RCC.5
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Updated overall survival and progression-free survival data by blinded 
        independent central review (BICR) of sunitinib versus placebo for

		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally at ASCO, results from Phase 3 studies of sunitinib in 
      metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)19 and 
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC)20 will be presented.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About Sutent(&#174;) (sunitinib malate)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that works by blocking multiple 
      molecular targets implicated in the growth, proliferation and spread of 
      cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular endothelial growth factor 
      receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are 
      expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to play a 
      crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood 
      vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits 
      other targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Sutent(&#174;) (sunitinib malate) Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hepatotoxicity has been observed in clinical trials and post-marketing 
      experience. This hepatotoxicity may be severe, and deaths have been 
      reported. It is recommended to monitor liver function tests before 
      initiation of treatment, during each cycle of treatment, and as 
      clinically indicated. Sutent should be interrupted for Grade 3 or 4 
      drug-related hepatic adverse events and discontinued if there is no 
      resolution. Sutent should not be restarted if patients subsequently 
      experience severe changes in liver function tests or have other signs 
      and symptoms of liver failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy 
      should be informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the 
      lower limit of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with 
      concomitant cardiac conditions should be carefully monitored for 
      clinical signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Patients should 
      be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with standard 
      antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet 
      count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each 
      treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common adverse reactions in GIST, RCC and pancreatic NET 
      clinical trials were diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, nausea, 
      mucositis/stomatitis, anorexia, vomiting, neutropenia, hypertension, 
      dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin 
      discoloration, hair color changes, altered taste and bleeding.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      for Sutent (sunitinib malate), please visit www.pfizer.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Torisel&#174; (temsirolimus)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Torisel is the only intravenous mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
      inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma 
      (RCC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on preclinical studies, Torisel inhibits the activity of mTOR, an 
      intracellular protein implicated in multiple growth-related cellular 
      functions including proliferation, growth and survival. The inhibition 
      of mTOR also reduces levels of certain growth factors, such as vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which are overexpressed in solid 
      tumors like kidney cancer and are thought to play a crucial role in 
      angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood vessels, 
      nutrients and oxygen needed for growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Torisel&#174; (temsirolimus) Safety 
      Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Torisel is contraindicated in patients with bilirubin 1.5 times the 
      upper limit of normal (ULN). If Torisel must be given to patients with 
      mild hepatic impairment, it should be used with caution and at a reduced 
      dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Torisel has been associated with serious and sometimes fatal side 
      effects including: hypersensitivity reactions, hyperglycemia/glucose 
      intolerance, infections, interstitial lung disease, hyperlipidemia, 
      bowel perforation, renal failure, wound healing complications, and 
      intracerebral hemorrhage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Live vaccines and close contact with those who received live vaccines 
      should be avoided. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of 
      the potential hazard to the fetus and avoid becoming pregnant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common adverse reactions (incidence &#8805; 30%) are rash, asthenia, 
      mucositis, nausea, edema, and anorexia. The most common laboratory 
      abnormalities (incidence &#8805; 30%) are anemia, hyperglycemia, 
      hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, 
      elevated serum creatinine, lymphopenia, hypophosphatemia, 
      thrombocytopenia, elevated AST, and leucopenia.
    &lt;/p&gt;

SUPPORTIVE QUOTES: 


--  Val Fontama, senior product manager, Business Platform Marketing Group
    at Microsoft Corp.
     "We developed the Microsoft Fast Track Data
    Warehouse program to help our customers accelerate their data
    warehouse road maps, lower costs, and reduce risk with reliable
    reference architectures and best practices for warehousing. Using the
    Cisco Unified Computing System with Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2

     "Predixion enables
    self-service predictive analytics, allowing customers to use and
    analyze large amounts of data to make actionable decisions. Our
    solutions rely on resilient backend data warehousing systems. If the
    systems are decentralized they can increase the number of potential
    'break points,' complicating the maintenance, management, and
    operation of dependent applications. The combination of the Cisco
    Unified Computing System server platform with SQL Server 2008 R2 and
    Predixion Insight provides balance and cohesiveness among computing,
    networking and storage access to help companies operate their
    applications efficiently."

    "Taking the risk out of deployment is a key priority to our customers.
    By working with Cisco to deliver pretested design architectures that
    support Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2, customers can gain the benefits
    of fast and easy deployments. EMC VNX unified storage systems are
    optimized for SQL Server because they are proven to deliver high
    performance, high capacity and the superior level of protection needed
    to meet demanding workload, reliability and scalability
    requirements."
    
    
--  Phil Brotherton,vice president and general manager of the Microsoft
    Business Unit at NetApp
     "Together, Cisco, Microsoft and NetApp
    continue to deliver on our commitment to helping our customers achieve
    greater flexibility and efficiencies at lower costs. Through these
    reference design offerings, Microsoft SQL Server 2008 customers see
    the power of a highly secure, integrated infrastructure. Optimized for

			SpectorSoft Computer and Mobile Monitoring Solutions Make Lives 
      Easier for Windows IT Pros at Microsoft TechEd 2011
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Company Shows How Comprehensive User and User Group Activity Monitoring 
      Solves IT Problems Not Easily Handled by Traditional Network, Device and 
      Endpoint Tools
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SpectorSoft&#174; 
      Corporation today announced that it will demonstrate at Microsoft 
      TechEd North America 2011 how its end-to-end user and user group 
      monitoring and analysis solutions help manage threats introduced by an 
      increasingly mobile workforce using more, and disparate devices. 
      SpectorSoft is exhibiting at booth 1940 during the show, scheduled for 
      May 16-19 in Atlanta.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SpectorSoft&#8217;s approach is unique in the industry by providing complete 
      monitoring, capture and analysis of user activity, regardless of where 
      the user is located and what device or machine they are using. IT pros 
      can analyze resource usage, and data changes and integrity, based on 
      user group or role, and they can monitor for activity against any Active 
      Directory parameter. During Microsoft TechEd, SpectorSoft solutions 
      experts will demonstrate SpectorSoft&#8217;s corporate solutions, both showing 
      product features and associated industry best practices around 
      monitoring.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The reality is that IT admins regularly find and address security 
      concerns, unsanctioned electronic use, and IT inefficiencies created by 
      users, contractors and partners, and SpectorSoft allows IT admins to 
      easily identify and manage these situations,&#8221; said Jason Judge, CEO of 
      SpectorSoft.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demonstrations during Microsoft TechEd will highlight how SpectorSoft 
      solutions allow IT pros to address a growing array of acceptable use, 
      compliance and security issues. In addition, SpectorSoft will 
      demonstrate its mobile offering, eBLASTER&#174; Mobile, which monitors 
      and analyzes communications, geo-location, and media usage on Android 
      and BlackBerry smartphones. During the show, booth visitors can receive 
      SpectorSoft t-shirts and can be entered in a contest to win daily prizes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SpectorSoft&#8217;s solutions help corporate IT staff in a variety of ways:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        IT pros can monitor use of critical applications and can gain an 
        umbrella view of how a company is faring against key compliance and 
        corporate mandates.
      
			
        Many companies evaluate how their top performers use IT resources to 
        teach other employees best practices.
      
			
        If a network or security incident occurs, SpectorSoft&#8217;s solutions 
        allow for a detailed incident review, marrying actual screen snapshots 
        with underlying data and workflows.
      
			
        From a security perspective, the products are truly invaluable, 
        identifying insider theft, unsanctioned use of applications and the 
        Internet, and detailed, time-stamped audit trails.

      Jane Terry, president and CEO of Ajax Boiler, Inc. in Santa Ana, Calif., 
      is a longtime and loyal SPECTOR 360&#174; user who stays current with 
      the popular company-wide monitoring and analysis software program. Based 
      on her company&#8217;s documented use benefits, Terry has been highlighted in 
      SpectorSoft Case Studies and also featured in The Wall Street Journal. 
      &#8220;I absolutely cannot see being in a senior management position without 
      it,&#8221; says Terry. &#8220;If you want to know what's going on ... if you want to

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Quest Software, Inc. (Nasdaq: QSFT) 
      today released three open beta tools that help simplify Microsoft Azure 
      infrastructure and account management: Spotlight&#174; on Azure, 
      Quest&#174; Cloud Storage Manager for Azure, and Quest&#174; 
      Cloud Subscription Manager for Azure. All three betas are 
      available for download at http://QuestCloudTools.com.

      As more organizations incorporate cloud solutions into their IT 
      infrastructures, they not only face the inherent complexities of dealing 
      with combinations of on-premise, virtual and cloud architectures, but 
      also the challenge of ensuring they get the most from their cloud 
      investments. Being able to monitor cost and resource utilization, cloud 
      storage, and application performance are critical to maximizing an 
      investment in cloud technology; but, unlike on-premise architectures, 
      these tasks currently are difficult to perform in Azure. Quest&#8217;s new 
      tools address these critical areas, making it easier to conduct Azure 
      cost analysis, and smoothing the overall transition from on-premise to 
      cloud-based applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We identified three of the biggest challenges users currently 
      experience working with Azure, and want to support our customers who are 
      making investments in the cloud by providing tools that address those 
      challenges quickly and easily,&#8221; said Douglas Chrystall, chief architect 
      at Quest Software. &#8220;Through our own research, we learned that over 90 
      percent of organizations are overspending on the cloud, and Azure 
      developers don&#8217;t have the visibility they need into things like storage 
      and performance to properly manage their cloud environments. With 
      Quest&#8217;s Azure management 
      offerings, users will gain that visibility into their Azure 
      infrastructure, be able to easily map their cloud resources, and 
      understand exactly where their dollars are being spent.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Specific capabilities offered by the beta releases include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Spotlight on Azure - provides in-depth monitoring and 
        performance diagnostics of Azure environments from the individual 
        resources level up to the application level
      
			
				Quest Cloud Storage Manager for Azure - provides file and 
        storage management that enables users to easily access multiple 
        storage accounts in Azure using a simple GUI interface
      
			
				Quest Cloud Subscription Manager for Azure - drills into Azure 
        subscription data, providing a detailed view of resource utilization

			Cyber-Ark&#174; 
      Software, the leading global information security provider for 
      protecting and managing critical applications, identities and sensitive 
      information, today announced details of its participation at the 
      Microsoft&#174; TechEd 2011 North America event. With cyber threats becoming 
      more targeted and sophisticated, Cyber-Ark (booth #1315) will 
      demonstrate the advantages of its new Privileged 
      Session Management Suite as well as the complementary benefits of 
      its Privileged 
      Identity Management Suite, a &#8220;Best of TechEd North America 2011&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
			What: Privileged accounts such as sysadmin, Oracle system, 
      Administrator in Hypervisor or Windows and many more are prevalent 
      throughout the datacenter. These privileged accounts allow access and 
      manipulation of all sensitive business information with potentially 
      devastating business impact. To address that challenge, at Microsoft 
      TechEd, Cyber-Ark will introduce attendees to its Privileged Session 
      Management Suite, a comprehensive solution that improves compliance and 
      risk management with the ability to isolate, control and record 
      privileged access to databases, virtual environments and servers using a 
      common platform for reduced total cost of ownership.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Privileged Session Management Suite includes Privileged Session 
      Manager&#174; for Servers, Privileged Session Manager&#174; for Databases and 
      Privileged Session Manager&#174; for Virtualization. Specifically, the 
      Privileged Session Manager for Servers enables organizations to control 
      and monitor privileged access to sensitive servers including Windows, 
      Unix/Linux, Mainframes (zOS), iSeries and network devices. It provides 
      full privileged session recording with DVR playback, as well as secure 
      remote access to sensitive systems using privileged single sign-on 
      without having to expose credentials to end-users, including external 
      vendors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			When: May 16-19, 2011
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Where: Microsoft TechEd North America 2011 will take place at the 
      Georgia World Congress Center in Atlanta, Georgia. Cyber-Ark&#8217;s booth is 
      #1315.

infrastructure for solutions in the cloud."

&lt;p&gt;COLUMBUS, Ohio (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co Chief Executive Jamie Dimon faced harsh questions about mortgage foreclosures at the bank's annual meeting, and he promised the company would fix what it could.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Community organizers from Brooklyn to Cincinnati to San Francisco complained about Chase losing paperwork, being unresponsive to borrowers in financial trouble and boarding up foreclosed houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A woman said she was in danger of losing her house after being laid off from 30 years of work for the state of Illinois. Dimon directed a bank officer to take up her case. He referred other people to the officer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are doing everything we can to keep people in their homes that should stay in their homes," Dimon said, reiterating past comments. The bank has "added a lot of people" and systems to work on mortgage modifications, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan was one of more than a dozen banks that in April agreed to fix their foreclosure practices as part of a settlement with U.S. bank regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said last month it was taking a $1.1 billion charge, in part because it expected to hire 2,000 to 3,000 people to comply with the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. banks have foreclosed on millions of homes since the start of the mortgage crisis, and many have been overwhelmed by the amount of paperwork involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday that the company is trying to help people at risk of losing their homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We understand what you are talking about," Dimon said after hearing Roger Davis, president of Communities United for Action in Cincinnati, describe growing blight in neighborhoods from boarded-up houses and delays in modifying mortgages to make them more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can you help us?" asked Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Maybe," said Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Davis later said that he was glad Dimon said anything at all, but added, "I don't have a lot of confidence any more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Tuesday's annual meeting, Dimon said nothing at all much of the time as shareholders challenged the bank's policies on a range of issues including political contributions, corporate governance and doing business with international companies accused of genocide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon offered hopeful comments early in the meeting, noting that the economy could be at the "beginning of a self-sustaining recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders gathered in an auditorium in Columbus at one of the bank's largest account service centers. JPMorgan, the second-biggest U.S. bank, rotates its annual meetings among its major facilities across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said that in some cases the bank wrongly foreclosed on homes of members of the military. "We deeply apologize," he said. The bank has forgiven those mortgages and given the houses to borrowers, general counsel Stephen Cutler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's profits last year were as much as $7 billion short of the bank's normal earnings power, largely because of the falling housing market and the costs of cleaning up bad mortgage loans and related lawsuits, Dimon said in his annual letter to shareholders on April 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan made a record $17 billion in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;House prices will "continue to go down modestly because of the continuous high levels of homes for sale," Dimon said in the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The housing market will recover after employment and the economy recover, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry.

&lt;p&gt; * Dimon acknowledges problems with mortgage foreclosures&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Shareholders ask for help staying in their homes&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Dimon says economic recovery may be gathering steam
 (Rewrites throughout, adds detail)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By David Henry&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COLUMBUS, Ohio, May 17 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co
Chief Executive Jamie Dimon faced harsh questions about
mortgage foreclosures at the bank's annual meeting, and he
promised the company would fix what it could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Community organizers from Brooklyn to Cincinnati to San
Francisco complained about Chase losing paperwork, being
unresponsive to borrowers in financial trouble and boarding up
foreclosed houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A woman said she was in danger of losing her house after
being laid off from 30 years of work for the state of Illinois.
Dimon directed a bank officer to take up her case. He referred
other people to the officer too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are doing everything we can to keep people in their
homes that should stay in their homes," Dimon said, reiterating
past comments. The bank has "added a lot of people" and systems
to work on mortgage modifications, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan was one of more than a dozen banks that in April
agreed to fix their foreclosure practices as part of a
settlement with U.S. bank regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said last month it was taking a $1.1 billion
charge, in part because it expected to hire 2,000 to 3,000
people to comply with the settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. banks have foreclosed on millions of homes since the
start of the mortgage crisis, and many have been overwhelmed by
the amount of paperwork involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said on Tuesday that the
company is trying to help people at risk of losing their
homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We understand what you are talking about," Dimon said
after hearing Roger Davis, president of Communities United for
Action in Cincinnati, describe growing blight in neighborhoods
from boarded-up houses and delays in modifying mortgages to
make them more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Can you help us?" asked Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Maybe," said Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Davis later said that he was glad Dimon said anything at
all, but added, "I don't have a lot of confidence any more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During Tuesday's annual meeting, Dimon said nothing at all
much of the time as shareholders challenged the bank's policies
on a range of issues including political contributions,
corporate governance and doing business with international
companies accused of genocide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon offered hopeful comments early in the meeting, noting
that the economy could be at the "beginning of a
self-sustaining recovery."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders gathered in an auditorium in Columbus at one
of the bank's largest account service centers. JPMorgan, the
second-biggest U.S. bank, rotates its annual meetings among its
major facilities across the nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said that in some cases the bank wrongly foreclosed
on homes of members of the military. "We deeply apologize," he
said. The bank has forgiven those mortgages and given the
houses to borrowers, general counsel Stephen Cutler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's profits last year were as much as $7 billion
short of the bank's normal earnings power, largely because of
the falling housing market and the costs of cleaning up bad
mortgage loans and related lawsuits, Dimon said in his annual
letter to shareholders on April 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan made a record $17 billion in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; House prices will "continue to go down modestly because of
the continuous high levels of homes for sale," Dimon said in
the letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The housing market will recover after employment and the
economy recover, he said.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola has awarded one-time $5,000 scholarships each to Teresa 
      Micheletti of Issaquah and Tanner Lemen of Burien and a four-year, 
      $20,000 scholarship to Madison Hollenbeck of Shoreline for academic 
      excellence and leadership.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These distinguished students are three out of 100 selected from 
      applications submitted by Coca-Cola employees on behalf of their 
      children nationwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Micheletti plans to attend Western Washington University http://www.wwu.edu/ 
      . Her father, Joe, is a route planner for delivery trucks in the area. 
      Hollenbeck is headed for Lewis  Clark College http://www.lclark.edu/

      In 2001, Coca-Cola Enterprises, the largest bottling company for brands

      the Johnston Legacy Scholarship program in honor of the former CEO 
      Summerfield Johnston. Last October, The Coca-Cola Company purchased the 
      North American operations of CCE.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The scholarship program provides 100 scholarships annually to children 
      of&#160;employees of the former North American operations of CCE. Ninety 
      winners will receive one-time scholarships of $5,000 and 10 will receive 
      four-year scholarships of $20,000 for a total of $650,000 in total 
      rewards. This program is just one of several supported by The Coca-Cola 
      Company and The Coca-Cola Foundation. https://www.coca-colascholars.org/cokeWeb/
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The scholars were chosen from among nearly 400 applicants. An 
      independent judging panel reviewed every application, which includes a

&lt;p&gt;  GHENT, BELGIUM, May 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 


 REGULATED INFORMATION

    GHENT, Belgium, 17 May 2011 - Ablynx [Euronext Brussels: ABLX] today
announced top-line results from the recently completed POC Phase II
clinical trial of ozoralizumab (ATN-103), an anti-TNF-alpha Nanobody
licensed to Pfizer, in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
The study evaluated five different dosing groups plus placebo, and
preliminary analysis of the data indicates that the study met its
pre-defined primary efficacy endpoint with the highest dose of
ozoralizumab (80 mg every 4 weeks) resulting in a statistically
significant improvement of ACR20 responses compared with placebo at week
16. In addition, an improvement over placebo was also observed for
secondary endpoints such as improvements of clinical scores, DAS28,
ACR50, ACR70 and EULAR response at this dose level at week 16. No dose
limiting toxicities were observed, and the adverse events and serious
adverse events that did occur, did not show a clinically significant
increase on increased dosing.

    Pfizer have now confirmed that clinical proof-of-concept has been
achieved and they are now engaged in a full technical, clinical and
commercial evaluation to determine whether and how to take ATN-103
forward.

    Dr Edwin Moses, Chairman and CEO commented: "We are delighted to announce
the first clinical proof-of-concept for a Nanobody. This has extremely
important implications for Ablynx, the whole Nanobody technology platform
and our R pipeline containing more than 25 programmes. Our progress has
been rapid and we are excited to have passed this critical milestone in
our development into a potentially leading biopharmaceutical company. We
look forward to the completion of Pfizer's internal decision making
process."

    About the clinical development programme Pfizer successfully completed
Phase I studies with ATN-103 in the summer of 2009, and then initiated
two randomized, double-blind Phase II trials in Japan, US and Rest of the
World in September 2009, which finished recruitment of a total of 312
patients in September 2010.

The study evaluated five different dosing groups plus placebo, and preliminary analysis of the data indicates that the study met its pre-defined primary efficacy endpoint with the highest dose of ozoralizumab (80 mg every 4 weeks) resulting in a statistically significant improvement of ACR20 responses compared with placebo at week 16. In addition, an improvement over placebo was also observed for secondary endpoints such as improvements of clinical scores, DAS28, ACR50, ACR70 and EULAR response at this dose level at week 16. No dose limiting toxicities were observed, and the adverse events and serious adverse events that did occur, did not show a clinically significant increase on increased dosing.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Pfizer have now confirmed that clinical proof-of-concept has been achieved and they are now engaged in a full technical, clinical and commercial evaluation to determine whether and how to take ATN-103 forward.&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Dr Edwin Moses, Chairman and CEO commented: "We are delighted to announce the first clinical proof-of-concept for a Nanobody. This has extremely important implications for Ablynx, the whole Nanobody technology platform and our RD pipeline containing more than 25 programmes. Our progress has been rapid and we are excited to have passed this critical milestone in our development into a potentially leading biopharmaceutical company. We look forward to the completion of Pfizer's internal decision making process."&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;About the clinical development programmePfizer successfully completed Phase I studies with ATN-103 in the summer of 2009, and then initiated two randomized, double-blind Phase II trials in Japan, US and Rest of the World in September 2009, which finished recruitment of a total of 312 patients in September 2010. &lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects to rate the transaction and assign Loss Severity (LS) 
      ratings and Outlooks as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$77,861,000 class A-1 'AAAsf/LS1'; Outlook Stable;

      NR or X-B classes.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      primary assets of which are 42 loans secured by 84 commercial properties 
      having an aggregate principal balance of approximately $1.45 billion as 
      of the cutoff date. The loans were originated by JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
      N.A.

      of 1.28 times (x), a Fitch stressed loan-to value (LTV) of 86.7%, and a

      operating income.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      account for 68.8% of the pool. The largest sponsor is a joint venture 
      between the LeFrak and Simon families, with a loan accounting for 13.8% 
      of the pool.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  CHELMSFORD, MA, May 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Aspect, a leading provider of customer contact and Microsoft platform
solutions, today announced the general availability of Aspect(R)
Contact(TM) 2011, a solution designed to deliver essential customer
contact capabilities for small to mid-sized contact centers and IT, HR,
travel or other help desks operating with 20 - 100 seats. Built to use
Microsoft Lync 2010 as its media server, Aspect Contact 2011 enables
organizations to achieve an additional level of productivity and a
quicker ROI from their Lync deployments.

    Aspect Contact 2011 leverages a subset of core functionality from its
enterprise-class Aspect(R) Unified IP(R) to provide voice, instant

operations. Packaged as an appliance, its powerful out-of-the-box
capabilities allow Microsoft-centric businesses to effectively use their
unified communications and collaboration deployments within their contact
centers or help desks to deliver improved service levels.

    Market research firm, Ovum, reports that small- to mid-size contact
centers of 100 seats or less comprise 85 percent of the global contact
center market. Aspect's expansion into the small- to mid-size contact
center market is a natural progression, given its market leadership and
vast expertise in the enterprise contact center category, its partnership
with equity investor, Microsoft Corp. and in-depth experience with Lync.
With this roll out, Aspect is now fully capable to address the needs of
any size contact center. 

    The broad feature set available in Aspect Contact 2011 helps
organizations optimize productivity across all stages of an interaction
whether in a help desk or small contact center environment. Intelligent
routing ensures that customers are serviced by best-skilled resources,
and a comprehensive agent desktop provides enriched information
presentation and streamlined screen pops. Structured workflows and
centralized administration and reporting help to identify and address
performance issues, enabling faster issue resolution and better agent
performance and satisfaction. 

    The solution is pre-configured with standard options, allowing
organizations to deploy and be operational within a few hours using their
own IT resources or remote services from Aspect. Aspect Contact 2011 is
easy to use and maintain, requires very little training, delivers a fully
integrated, robust agent desktop, and its intuitive user interface is

			Microsoft Tech&#8226;Ed 2011: DataCore Software Adds Extra Data Protection, 
      Flexibility and Speed to Windows Home Server with DriveHarmony
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Welcomes Beta Testers to Trial DriveHarmony&#8217;s New Pooling, Mirroring 
      and Caching Features That Boost Performance and Sidestep Hard Disk Drive 
      Limitations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DataCore Software, the industry&#8217;s premier provider of storage 
      virtualization software, today announced the Beta release of 
      DriveHarmony&#8482;, a simple to use add-on software package for Microsoft 
      Windows Home Server (WHS). Users who are eager to protect, pool, 
      accelerate, and easily expand storage capacity are welcome to request an 
      early version of DriveHarmony for their personal beta testing by 
      visiting DataCore&#8217;s booth (#1629) at this week&#8217;s Microsoft Tech&#8226;Ed 2011 
      or by sending a request to WHS@DataCore.com.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Easily Pool and Expand Storage to Simplify File Sharing and Folder 
      Management
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Leveraging techniques learned from a decade of experience in large data 
      centers across the globe, DataCore&#8482; DriveHarmony maximizes the value 
      home users get from their hard disk drives. The software integrates into 
      the familiar WHS dashboard with a simple, easy-to-use control panel. 
      From there, users can combine one or more physical disks of variable 
      sizes and types into one &#8220;Virtual Big Disk&#8221; pool. When this virtual 
      drive is created, it is automatically initialized, formatted, assigned a 
      drive letter, and selectively mirrored for data protection. The virtual 
      drive is then ready for use by any application running on the WHS 2011 
      operating system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Growing with the Needs of Today&#8217;s Digital Lifestyle
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As families and small businesses gather more digital assets, their disk 
      space consumption naturally grows. DriveHarmony delivers the right 
      combination of power, capacity, and ease-of-use for today&#8217;s home 
      consumers. It allows them to expand appropriately by adding more drives 
      to virtual disks without having to split up or re-organize their files. 
      The rest is done behind the scenes without any need for intervention.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With more and more content going digital, people increasingly want a 
      simple way to access, store, and enjoy the wide range of photos, 
      personal videos, music, and films they save at home,&#8221; said Carlos M. 
      Carreras, vice president of alliances and business development, DataCore 
      Software. &#8220;Through the gathering of feedback during the beta process, we 
      look forward to working closely with Microsoft and the Windows Home 
      Server Community to bring to market a powerful solution to help home 
      users easily protect, organize, and manage their growing disk 
      requirements in a digital age.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  GLENVIEW, IL, May 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Apple Rush Co., Inc. (PINKSHEETS: APRU) announced today that pursuant to
the motion of Robert Corr, President and CEO of Apple Rush Co., Inc., the
motion opposed by The Coca-Cola Company; the United States Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) granted
Robert Corr's motion, and suspended the opposition proceeding against
Robert J. Corr by The Coca-Cola Company surrounding the trademark
registration application of the Naturally ZERO mark. The filing can be
found by visiting:
http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91197767=OPP=12.

    Robert Corr and Apple Rush plan to begin the manufacturing, marketing and
distribution of its Naturally ZERO product line through Apple Rush
distribution channels. Robert Corr and Apple Rush previously decided to
cease activity regarding Naturally ZERO until the USPTO came to this
decision regarding The Coca Cola Company's opposition papers. Coke filed
an opposition (No.91197767) against Robert Corr, president of Apple Rush
Co. Inc. the applicant for the mark. A hearing was held by the Trademark
Trial and Appeal Board and a Motion filed by the Applicant (Apple Rush)
to suspend proceedings until a case (United States District Court For The
Northern District Of Illinois Eastern Division No. 08 CV 04206) filed by
the Plaintiff, Mirza N. Baig, and currently pending, against Coke for
Trademark Infringement and false Designation of Origin under the Lanham
Act.

    Robert Corr entered into a contract for the benefit of Apple Rush, with
the Plaintiff, Mr. Baig, in that case to introduce The NATURALLY ZERO
waters here in the United States and to renew the trademark. The
trademark was originally used by Mr. Baig in commerce, including here in
the Midwest during the period from 1999 to 2003, when Coke usurped the
trademark from the Plaintiff and commenced its illegal use of the
trademark on COKE ZERO. The agreement signed by Robert Corr, for the
benefit of Apple Rush Co Inc., permits the use by Apple Rush.

    "This action by Mr. Baig against Coke, demonstrates that the trademark
Zero is not owned by Coke. Yesterday, the Trademark Trial and Appeal
Board granted my motion to suspend Coke's opposition. I intend to
demonstrate the inconsistency between arguments made by Coke in the case
filed by Mr. Baig, and Coke's oppositions against Royal Crown, Unilever
and many others attempting to use the ZERO mark for beverages," says
Robert Corr.

    Apple Rush will be introducing the Naturally ZERO Waters in the
Chicagoland market this summer.

    About Apple Rush Co., Inc.:

    Apple Rush Company, Inc. is a producer of Organic 100% Juice Sparkling
Beverages and Naturally ZERO Waters. The company markets its products
through an extensive distribution network nearly 30 Distributors
throughout the U.S. and in foreign markets. The Company's flagship
product line of Organic Apple Rush(TM) Sparkling Beverages currently has
four mainstream flavors in glass bottles and will introduce the waters
this summer.

&lt;p&gt;  HONG KONG, May 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Today, www.WorldStreetFundamentals.com released its industry report
highlighting Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) and Petroleo Brasileiro
(NYSE: PBR) (BAE: APBR). Full fundamental and technical analysis is
available at www.WorldStreetFundamentals.com/Reports.php.

    With the disruption of exports from Libya and unrest in the Middle East
and North Africa, crude oil continues to trend upward. The recent
disaster in Japan has fueled further volatility, as Japan is the world's
third largest consumer and the second largest importer. As of March, the
U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimated that global oil
demand expanded by 2.85% in 2010 and sees demand growth of 1.70% in 2011
and 1.94% in 2012. Reflecting new OPEC capacity additions, the EIA
estimated that global oil supply increased by 2.5% in 2010 and forecast
supply growth of 1.12% in 2011 and 2.49% in 2012 

    World Street Fundamentals has highlighted Chevron because of focus on
both upstream and downstream operations. Upstream operations consist of
exploring for, developing and producing crude oil and natural gas;
transporting crude oil by international oil export pipelines;
transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas, and a gas-to-liquids
project. Downstream operations consist of refining of crude oil into
petroleum products marketing of crude oil and refined products. The
entire report on Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) is available here:
www.WorldStreetFundamentals.com/ViewFullReport.245.php.

    World Street has highlighted Petroleo Brasileiro for its diverse business
across five segments: exploration and production; refining,
transportation and marketing; distribution; gas and power, and
international. The exploration and production segment includes oil and
gas exploration, development and production in Brazil. The refining,
transportation and marketing segment includes downstream activities in
Brazil, including refining, logistics, transportation, oil products and
crude oil exports and imports, petrochemicals and fertilizers. 

    The distribution segment includes distribution of oil products through
the BR retail network in Brazil. The gas and power segment includes gas
transportation and distribution, electric power generation using natural
gas and renewable energy sources. The international segment includes
exploration and production, refining, transportation and marketing,
distribution and gas and power operations outside of Brazil. The entire
report on Petroleo Brasileiro (NYSE: PBR) (BAE: APBR) is available here:

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			AppSense Exceptional Growth Results in Microsoft Managed Partner 
      Status
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Elevated status with Microsoft confirms user virtualization market 
      leader continues to surge forward with 50-plus percent annual growth and 
      $70M investment from Goldman Sachs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft TechEd, AppSense booth #701 &#8211; AppSense, the leading 
      provider of user 
      virtualization technology, has been elevated to a Managed 
      Independent Software Vendor (ISV) Partner status by Microsoft Corp. The 
      company was previously a High Potential Partner since 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Less than five percent of Microsoft ISV partners achieve Managed ISV 
      Partner status, a category reserved for high-growth companies with 
      significant joint revenue potential. As a Managed ISV Partner, AppSense 
      will work closely with Microsoft to ensure its popular user 
      virtualization platform enhances and extends the enterprise user 
      management capabilities of Microsoft System Center, Windows Server and 
      Windows Client. User virtualization significantly reduces the IT burden 
      and cost associated with onboarding and deploying users on enterprise 
      desktops, especially during migrations and deployments of new desktop 
      and application delivery technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;User virtualization will become an important category for the 
      enterprise. We believe that every company will be challenged with a mix 
      of physical, virtual desktop and application delivery technologies,&#8221; 
      says David Roussain, AppSense&#8217;s vice president of Strategic Technology 
      Alliances. &#8220;Ensuring IT pros successfully manage users across these 
      technologies is key to ensuring on-time rollouts with zero user 
      disruption. Most companies redesigning their desktop architecture to 
      take advantage of new, more efficient technologies such as Windows 7 and 
      Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) find that user-related 
      challenges can become an obstacle to deployment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to see AppSense extend Microsoft&#8217;s User State 
      Virtualization to deliver enhanced capabilities that help customers 
      manage their employees&#8217; data and settings across physical and virtual 
      environments. The combination of AppSense with our Desktop 
      Virtualization technologies, such as App-V or VDI Suites, can enable 
      customers to move to Windows 7 even more quickly,&#8221; said Karri 
      Alexion-Tiernan, director of product management for desktop 
      virtualization at Microsoft.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      AppSense recently received a $70 million investment from Goldman Sachs 
      for market expansion and new product development. Currently staffed with 
      300 employees, the company anticipates adding 150 new staff in 2011.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Wyse Delivers New Configuration and Provisioning Software 
      Capabilities around Its Cloud Client Computing Solutions on Microsoft 
      Windows Embedded Standard 7
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wyse Technology, the global leader in cloud 
      client computing, today introduced significant enhancements to the 
      family of desktop and mobile thin clients based on the Microsoft Windows 
      Embedded Standard 7 operating system. Chief among the Wyse Feature 
      Release 2 (WFR2) enhancements are those resident in Wyse Configuration 
      Manager (also announced today), an innovative self-configuring 
      client technology for the VDI industry that was previewed (as Project 
      Pyramid) earlier this year, and begins 
      shipping today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wyse Configuration Manager (WCM)
			automates the deployment of Wyse 
      thin clients throughout a private cloud or server, whether the 
      deployment entails ten devices or tens of thousands of them. IT simply 
      determines the desired configuration, and WCM automatically does the 
      rest, with no imaging or re-booting required. For instance, Windows 
      Embedded client devices are updated to the latest configuration 
      automatically on startup or user logon, making them truly &#8220;plug and 
      display.&#8221; WCM works with Microsoft write-filter technology, so it's 
      fully secure. Users can be stationary, mobile, office or home-based.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the improved management capabilities via WCM, Wyse now 
      offers Windows Embedded Standard 7 WFR2 users enhanced features such as:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Image size reductions: More free space means a longer lifespan for a 
        device
      
			
        Enhanced configuration capabilities, including self-provisioning, 
        provisioning via USB, secure provisioning for mobile users and 
        state-based provisioning.
      
			
        Better performance through Wyse Z class devices, incorporation of 
        RemoteFX and Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 support
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brewers, the UK's largest independent merchant supplier of decorating 
      materials, is deploying new Wyse thin clients with Windows Embedded 
      Standard 7 in a major refresh of their in-store desktop systems for 
      electronic point of sale, stock management and backend solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      David Relf, IT Manager, Brewers said: "We've always been impressed with 
      the reliability and performance of Wyse thin client solutions and 
      implementing Windows Embedded Standard 7 will enable us to deliver the 
      full benefits of Windows 7 to our end users in the 130-strong branch 
      network."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We have a limited amount of stations so tying up a thin client for any 
      length of time to apply security patches would impact patient care. Only 
      Wyse thin clients can download the patches in the background without 
      impacting clinician productivity. Once the patches have fully 
      downloaded, there are several options to install patches while limiting 
      the impact to our clinician," according to Raciel De Armas, Sr. 
      Technical Architect at Overlake Hospital Medical Center in Bellevue, WA. 
      "The combination of Wyse and Microsoft Windows Embedded Standard 7 
      allows us to maintain a higher level of security and productivity and to 
      improve patient care."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We are pleased to be working with innovative companies such as Wyse to 
      quickly bring to market RemoteFX-ready thin client devices,&#8221; said Alexa 
      Barron, senior product manager for Windows Embedded at Microsoft. 
      &#8220;Windows Embedded Standard 7 is the premier development platform to 
      equip OEMs with the tools to build the next generation of thin client 
      devices with features including extended manageability, compatibility 
      and security.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "When it comes to technology, there's no such thing as 'too simple,'" 
      according to Param Desai, Sr. Director, Product Management at Wyse 
      Technology. "Ease of use and simplified VDI management is a growing 
      market and one we are confident that we are addressing."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Availability
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The family of desktop and mobile thin clients based on the new Microsoft 
      Windows Embedded Standard 7 operating system is available immediately.

			Pfizer Announces Simultaneous Filing Of New Drug Applications For 
      Crizotinib With U.S. Food And Drug Administration And Japanese Ministry 
      Of Health, Labour And Welfare
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Crizotinib Submission Accepted for Filing and Granted Priority 
      Review by FDA
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced today that its New Drug Application (NDA) for 
      crizotinib, an oral first-in-class anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) 
      inhibitor, has been accepted for filing and granted Priority Review 
      status by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and has been filed 
      with the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW). The 
      proposed indication is for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive 
      advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our ability to file applications for regulatory review in the U.S. and 
      Japan simultaneously only three years after beginning worldwide clinical 
      trials in patients with ALK-positive lung cancer is a testament to the 
      hard work of the crizotinib team and the productive discussions that we 
      have had with the respective regulatory agencies. Given the clinical 
      trial results seen to date, we believe that crizotinib, if approved, may 
      change the treatment paradigm for patients with ALK-positive advanced 
      NSCLC,&#8221; said Garry Nicholson, president and general manager, Pfizer 
      Oncology Business Unit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The FDA&#8217;s Priority Review status accelerates the review time from 10 
      months to a goal of six months and is given to drugs that may offer 
      major advances in treatment or may provide a treatment where no adequate 
      therapy exists.1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Crizotinib received orphan drug designation from the FDA in September 
      2010 and was granted Fast Track status in December 2010. As a result of 
      the Fast Track designation, Pfizer initiated a rolling submission of 
      crizotinib in January 2011. The FDA&#8217;s Fast Track process is designed to 
      facilitate development and expedite review of drugs that treat serious 
      or life-threatening diseases and demonstrate the potential to address 
      unmet medical need.1 In Japan, Pfizer commenced crizotinib 
      clinical trials for patients with ALK-positive advanced NSCLC in March 
      2010, and crizotinib was granted orphan drug status in January 2011. 
      These filings represent the first simultaneous filings in Japan and the 
      U.S. for a non-Japanese-based pharmaceutical company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Crizotinib is an investigational oral first-in-class compound that 
      inhibits the anaplastic lymphoma kinase, or ALK.2 Alterations 
      in the ALK gene are believed to be a key driver of tumor development in 
      cancers like NSCLC.3 The presence of the ALK fusion gene in 
      lung cancer was first reported by a Japanese researcher in 2007. 
      Preliminary epidemiology suggests that approximately 3&#8211;5 percent of 
      NSCLC patients have tumors that are positive for the ALK fusion gene. By 
      inhibiting ALK, crizotinib blocks signaling in a number of cell pathways 
      that are believed to be critical for the growth and survival of tumor 
      cells.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Worldwide, lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men and 
      the second leading cause of cancer death in women.4 NSCLC 
      accounts for about 85 percent of lung cancer cases and remains difficult 
      to treat, particularly in the metastatic setting. Approximately 75 
      percent of NSCLC patients are diagnosed late with metastatic, or 
      advanced, disease, where the five-year survival rate is only 6 percent.5,6 
      In addition, the current standard of care for advanced NSCLC 
      demonstrates a response rate of about 15-35 percent.7

&lt;p&gt; * 77 percent of crizotinib patients alive after 1 year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 64 percent of crizotinib patients alive after 2 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Results significantly higher than historical comparison&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - More than 60 percent of lung
cancer patients who received Pfizer (PFE.N) Inc's crizotinib in
an early stage clinical trial were still alive after two years,
according to data released on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the drug was not compared to other medicines or
placebo -- a higher standard of clinical trial -- the results
marked the first overall survival data from the closely watched
Pfizer drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crizotinib could eventually reach annual peak sales of $2.5
billion, according to Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer on Tuesday filed applications seeking U.S. and
Japanese approval for the drug considered among the most
important in its developmental pipeline. The U.S. Food and Drug
Administration has given it priority review status and the drug
could gain approval by the end of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer desperately needs new products with its cholesterol
fighter Lipitor, the world's biggest selling prescription
medicine, set to lose U.S. patent protection late this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crizotinib is an oral drug from a new class of cancer
medicines that inhibits a gene called anaplastic lymphoma
kinase, or ALK. Alterations of ALK are believed to be a driver
of tumor development in certain cancers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About four percent of lung cancer patients tend to be ALK
positive, but about 10 percent to 15 percent of lung cancer
patients who were never smokers fall into the category,
researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the study of 82 previously treated patients with ALK
positive non-small cell lung cancer who received crizotinib, 77
percent were alive after one year and 64 percent were still
alive after two years, data from an abstract, or brief summary
of the study, showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Median overall survival data was not yet available, meaning
more than half the patients were still alive. The study is due
to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology
meeting in Chicago in early June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A subset of patients in the Phase I study was compared with
historical records of similar ALK positive patients who were
not treated with crizotinib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Using those comparisons, 71 percent who received the Pfizer
drug achieved one-year survival versus 46 percent in the
historical control group, while 61 percent achieved two-year
survival versus just 9 percent in the control group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We already know that crizotinib has impressive activity in
terms of inducing responses," said Dr Alice Shaw, lead
investigator for the overall survival study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This data suggests that crizotinib may prolong overall
survival for these patients who have ALK in their lung tumors
and may improve the natural history of disease," she said.

&lt;p&gt; * Axitinib meets goal of Phase III study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Extends progression free survival by 6.7 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Company expected to seek U.S. approval this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 18 (Reuters) - A drug for advanced kidney
cancer from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) delayed progression of the
disease by nearly seven months, and by two months longer than a
commonly used medicine, in previously treated patients,
according to data from a late stage clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug, axitinib, extended progression-free survival, or
the time it took for the disease to worsen, by 6.7 months
compared with 4.7 months for patients who took Nexavar, a drug
from Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Onyx Pharmaceuticals ONXX.O that is
a standard of care for such patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer plans to use the Phase III data in an application
seeking U.S. approval that it expects to file later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axitinib is one of the more closely watched drugs in
Pfizer's developmental pipeline. The company is working to
bring new medicines to market while girding for generic
competition for cholesterol fighter Lipitor -- by far its
biggest product -- beginning late this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morningstar analyst Damien Conover is forecasting annual
peak sales of just over $1 billion if axitinib is approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Participants in the 732-patient study received either 5
milligrams of axitinib twice daily or 400 mg of Nexavar, known
chemically as sorafenib, twice daily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All patients in the study had been previously treated with
other drugs, including Pfizer's Sutent or medicines from a
class of drugs called cytokines, such as Interleuken-2 or
interferon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In patients who received prior treatment with cytokines,
axitinib extended progression-free survival (PFS) by 12.1
months. It extended PFS by 4.8 months in those previously
treated with Sutent. Both results were a statistically
significant improvement over Nexavar in the head-to-head trial,
researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results of the study will be presented at the American
Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago next month, the
year's most important cancer meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axitinib is an oral drug that belongs to a class that
blocks vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptors in
cells, thereby inhibiting tumor growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adverse side effects seen with the Pfizer drug were
considered manageable. The most common adverse events that
occurred more frequently with axitinib than with Nexavar
included higher blood pressure, fatigue, vocal disorders and
hypothyroidism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The clinically meaningful improvement in PFS seen with
axitinib is even more encouraging as it was accompanied by
generally manageable tolerability, an important consideration
for these patients," Dr. Brian Rini, the study's lead
investigator, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 210,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with kidney
cancer and nearly 102,000 are expected to die from the disease
each year, Pfizer said.

			First Potential Treatment to Demonstrate Significant PFS 
      Improvement vs. a Targeted Agent in a Phase 3 Trial in Advanced RCC
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. today announced data from the pivotal Phase 3 AXIS 1032 
      trial, showing that in patients with previously treated advanced renal 
      cell carcinoma (RCC), axitinib significantly extended progression-free 
      survival (PFS) [HR=0.665, 95% CI; P0.0001], with a median PFS of 6.7 
      months (95%CI, 6.3-8.6), compared with 4.7 months (4.6-5.6) for those 
      treated with sorafenib, a standard of care for this patient population. 
      PFS was significantly longer in axitinib-treated patients compared to 
      those treated with sorafenib, regardless of prior therapy with Sutent&#174; 
      (sunitinib malate) or cytokines. These data will be presented on June 6th 
      at the 47th Annual American Society of Clinical Oncology 
      (ASCO) meeting in Chicago from June 3-7, 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are very pleased that this Phase 3 trial met its primary endpoint 
      and demonstrated that axitinib could prolong median PFS to more than six 
      months in patients with previously treated advanced RCC. It is notable 
      that in the subset of patients previously treated with cytokines, 
      axitinib extended median PFS to greater than a year," said Dr. Mace 
      Rothenberg, senior vice president of clinical development and medical 
      affairs for Pfizer&#8217;s Oncology Business Unit. &#8220;We hope that axitinib will 
      be approved as an additional therapeutic option for patients with 
      advanced RCC, alongside Pfizer&#8217;s two medications approved in this 
      disease, Sutent and Torisel.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer is working with global health authorities on filing submissions 
      for axitinib in RCC.

		&lt;p&gt;
			About the AXIS 1032 Data To Be Presented at ASCO
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In this global study, including centers in the U.S., E.U. and Japan, 723 
      patients with clear-cell advanced RCC who had progressed following prior 
      therapy with regimens containing sunitinib (54 percent), cytokines (35 
      percent), bevacizumab (8 percent) or temsirolimus (3 percent) were 
      enrolled. Participants received either axitinib at a starting dose of 
      5mg twice daily or sorafenib 400mg twice daily (N=361 and 362). PFS was 
      statistically significantly longer in axitinib-treated patients in both 
      the prior cytokine-treated subgroup (12.1 vs 6.5 months; P0.0001) and 
      the prior sunitinib-treated subgroup (4.8 vs 3.4 months; P=0.0107), with 
      a 43 percent improvement in median PFS in the overall patient 
      population, compared to sorafenib. In a secondary endpoint, objective 
      response rates (either complete or partial responses assessed by 
      independent central review) were more than doubled with axitinib 
      compared to sorafenib in the overall patient population (19.4 percent vs 
      9.4 percent, P=0.0001). (Abstract #4503)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consistent with previous analyses, axitinib demonstrated a generally 
      manageable safety profile in this study. The study abstract lists the 
      following common adverse events (all grade), which occurred more 
      frequently in the axitinib arm compared to sorafenib: hypertension (40 
      percent), fatigue (39 percent), dysphonia (31 percent), and 
      hypothyroidism (19 percent).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In an additional oral abstract evaluating patient-reported outcomes 
      (PRO), a secondary endpoint of the AXIS study, patients treated with 
      axitinib reported similar kidney cancer-specific quality of life scores 
      compared to patients treated with sorafenib, and a delay in a 
      pre-specified composite endpoint, which consisted of death, disease 
      progression and worsening of quality of life. (Abstract #4504)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These data, from the first head-to-head Phase 3 study comparing active 
      targeted therapies in advanced RCC, are important for clinicians as they 
      help us advance our understanding of this tumor, where there are limited 
      proven options for previously-treated patients,&#8221; said Dr. Brian I. Rini, 
      Taussig Cancer Institute at Cleveland Clinic, who served as principal 
      investigator of this Pfizer-sponsored study and has been a paid 
      consultant to Pfizer Oncology. &#8220;The clinically meaningful improvement in 
      PFS seen with axitinib is even more encouraging as it was accompanied by 
      generally manageable tolerability, an important consideration for these 
      patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Each year, approximately 210,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with 
      kidney cancer and nearly 102,000 people are expected to die from the 
      disease. Within the last five years, great advances have been made in 
      the treatment of patients with advanced RCC, the most prevalent form of 
      kidney cancer. However, five-year survival rates for patients with 
      advanced RCC remain low, at around 20 percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Axitinib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Axitinib is an oral and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial 
      growth factor (VEGF) receptors 1, 2 and 3, receptors that can influence 
      tumor growth, vascular angiogenesis and progression of cancer (the 
      spread of tumors). Axitinib is an investigational agent that has not 
      been approved by regulatory agencies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Axitinib is also being investigated in a randomized Phase 3 clinical 
      trial in patients with treatment-na&#239;ve as well as previously treated 
      advanced RCC, and in a randomized Phase 2 clinical trial for the 
      treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Advancing the Science of Kidney Cancer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a leader in the treatment of advanced RCC, Pfizer Oncology is 
      dedicated to offering multiple treatments and investigating new agents 
      in different populations and stages of disease. Pfizer&#8217;s RCC portfolio 
      offers two approved therapies for the treatment of people with advanced 
      RCC, Sutent&#174; (sunitinib malate) and Torisel&#174; 
      (temsirolimus). By working collaboratively with academic institutions, 
      individual researchers, cooperative research groups, governments, 
      licensing partners and people affected, we are committed to advancing 
      the science of RCC through research into established and novel 
      compounds, as well as the exploration of biomarkers to better 
      personalize therapy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About SUTENT(&#174;) (sunitinib malate)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SUTENT is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor that works by blocking multiple 
      molecular targets implicated in the growth, proliferation and spread of 
      cancer. Two important SUTENT targets, vascular endothelial growth factor 
      receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) are 
      expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to play a 
      crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood 
      vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. SUTENT also inhibits 
      other targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Important SUTENT(&#174;) (sunitinib malate) Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;

      Hepatotoxicity has been observed in clinical trials and post-marketing 
      experience. This hepatotoxicity may be severe, and deaths have been 
      reported. It is recommended to monitor liver function tests before 
      initiation of treatment, during each cycle of treatment, and as 
      clinically indicated. SUTENT should be interrupted for Grade 3 or 4 
      drug-related hepatic adverse events and discontinued if there is no 
      resolution. SUTENT should not be restarted if patients subsequently 
      experience severe changes in liver function tests or have other signs 
      and symptoms of liver failure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy 
      should be informed of the potential for fetal harm while on SUTENT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the 
      lower limit of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with 
      concomitant cardiac conditions should be carefully monitored for 
      clinical signs and symptoms of congestive heart failure. Patients should 
      be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with standard 
      antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet 
      count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each 
      treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with SUTENT.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common adverse reactions in GIST, RCC and pancreatic NET 
      clinical trials were diarrhea, fatigue, asthenia, nausea, 
      mucositis/stomatitis, anorexia, vomiting, neutropenia, hypertension, 
      dyspepsia, abdominal pain, constipation, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin 
      discoloration, hair color changes, altered taste and bleeding.

			About Torisel&#174; (temsirolimus)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Torisel is the only intravenous mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) 
      inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma 
      (RCC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on preclinical studies, Torisel inhibits the activity of mTOR, an 
      intracellular protein implicated in multiple growth-related cellular 
      functions including proliferation, growth and survival. The inhibition 
      of mTOR also reduces levels of certain growth factors, such as vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which are overexpressed in solid 
      tumors like kidney cancer and are thought to play a crucial role in 
      angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood vessels, 
      nutrients and oxygen needed for growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Torisel&#174; (temsirolimus) Safety 
      Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Torisel is contraindicated in patients with bilirubin 1.5 times the 
      upper limit of normal (ULN). If Torisel must be given to patients with 
      mild hepatic impairment, it should be used with caution and at a reduced 
      dose.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Torisel has been associated with serious and sometimes fatal side 
      effects including: hypersensitivity reactions, hyperglycemia/glucose 
      intolerance, infections, interstitial lung disease, hyperlipidemia, 
      bowel perforation, renal failure, wound healing complications, and 
      intracerebral hemorrhage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Live vaccines and close contact with those who received live vaccines 
      should be avoided. Women of childbearing potential should be advised of 
      the potential hazard to the fetus and avoid becoming pregnant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common adverse reactions (incidence &#8805; 30%) are rash, asthenia, 
      mucositis, nausea, edema, and anorexia. The most common laboratory 
      abnormalities (incidence &#8805; 30%) are anemia, hyperglycemia, 
      hyperlipidemia, hypertriglyceridemia, elevated alkaline phosphatase, 
      elevated serum creatinine, lymphopenia, hypophosphatemia, 
      thrombocytopenia, elevated AST, and leucopenia. Strong inducers of 
      CYP3A4/5 and inhibitors of CYP3A4 may affect concentrations of the 
      primary metabolite of Torisel. If alternatives cannot be used, dose 
      modifications of Torisel are recommended.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About Accretive Health
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Accretive Health is a leading provider of services to healthcare 
      providers. Our business purpose is to help U.S. hospitals, physicians 
      and other healthcare providers more efficiently manage their revenue 
      cycle operations and population-based health management initiatives. Our 
      distinctive operating model that includes people, processes and 
      sophisticated integrated technology, which we refer to as our solutions, 
      helps our customers realize sustainable improvements in their operating 
      margins and improve the satisfaction of their patients, physicians and 
      staff. Our customers typically are multi-hospital systems, including 
      faith-based or community healthcare systems, academic medical centers 
      and independent ambulatory clinics, and their affiliated physician 
      practice groups. Our revenue cycle solution spans our customers&#8217; entire 
      revenue cycle, unlike competing services that we believe address only a 
      portion of the revenue cycle or focus solely on cost reductions. Our 
      revenue cycle management customers have historically achieved 
      significant improvements in cash collections measured against the 
      contractual amount due for healthcare services, which we refer to as net 
      revenue yield. Our population health management infrastructure spans the 
      entire healthcare delivery continuum and enables providers to manage the 
      health of their patient populations delivering higher quality care while 
      reducing aggregate cost of care. For more information, please visit www.accretivehealth.com.

      As of the April 2011 distribution date, the pool's certificate balance 
      has paid down 31.6% to $635.9 million from $929.8 million at issuance. 
      Of the remaining 108 loans, 19 (26.3%) have defeased.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch expects losses of approximately 2.3%, or approximately $14.6m.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are four specially serviced loans in the pool (3.4%). One loan is 
      current, two are delinquent 60 days and one is in REO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest specially serviced asset (1.1%) is a 93,677 square feet (sf) 
      anchored retail complex built in 1989 and located in Naugatuck, CT. The 
      loan transferred to special servicing in December 2010 due to the 
      bankruptcy of a major tenant representing 56% of the total rentable 
      space. The loan is current.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest specially serviced asset (0.9%) is a 108,244 sf 
      retail shopping center located in Brunswick, GA. The loan transferred in 
      September 2008 and is currently 60 days delinquent. The property is 
      anchored by a Winn-Dixie. The borrower is making partial payments. 
      Recent valuations indicate the property value is higher than the 
      outstanding loan amount.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest specially serviced asset is (0.9%) is secured by a 
      122,253 sf office complex built in 1974 located in Sacramento, CA. The 
      loan transferred to special servicing in April 2011 and is currently 60 
      days delinquent. The special servicer is determining a resolution 
      strategy.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates Disney's Proposed Offering 'A'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A' rating to The Walt Disney Company's 
      (Disney) proposed senior unsecured note offering. Proceeds are expected 
      to be used for general corporate purposes. A full rating list is shown 
      below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating and Stable Outlook reflect the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Disney's strong financial flexibility, which is supported by more than 
      $2.5 billion of annual free cash flow, total leverage around 1.3 times 
      (x) and net leverage (excluding Hong Kong and Euro Disney debt and cash) 
      below 1.0x. Although the company's maturity schedule over the next 
      several years is heavy, with nearly $2 billion of annual maturities 
      through 2013, it will be easily manageable with free cash flow and 
      access to the capital markets. Ratings incorporate Fitch's expectations 
      that the company will concurrently deploy cash for upcoming large capex 
      programs, as well as share repurchase and moderate MA activity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The cyclicality of the company's businesses, particularly Parks  
      Resorts and Broadcasting. Operating results at these businesses have 
      improved after the cyclical weakness experienced at these businesses in 
      2009. Fitch expects the recovery to continue in a stable economic 
      environment, with overall revenue growth in the low single digits and 
      EBITDA growth in the mid/high single digits, given positive operating 
      leverage. Should macroeconomic volatility return, Fitch expects these 
      cyclical businesses to be under renewed pressure but that the company's 
      credit and financial profile will likely remain within current ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Strong multi-year performance at Disney's cable networks, driven by 
      subscriber growth and rate increases, resulting in growth of recurring, 
      high-margin carriage fees. Fitch expects this dynamic to continue, given 
      the leverage that content providers have with distribution platforms, 
      and that the cable networks will continue to generate a significant 
      amount of Disney's cash flow. In Fitch's view, there is a longer-term 
      risk to the ability of cable networks in general to pass increased 
      programming costs onto distributors, who heretofore have pushed higher 
      affiliate fees through to subscribers. ESPN faces some incremental risk 
      given the long-term nature of sports-rights contracts. However, Fitch 
      believes that the top-tier channels that can continue to command 
      audience share/ratings will continue to be a must-carry for the 
      distributors and are likely to retain pricing power going forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Disney's consistent ability, surpassing that of its peers, to 
      consistently leverage and monetize its brands and characters across all 
      aspects of its business: TV, movies, music, theme parks, consumer 
      products and other licensing opportunities. This benefits the company's 
      operating profile and free cash flow generation. Fitch expects this 
      ability to continue, given the company's vast resources to attract and 
      develop content and talent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The inherent volatility of the company's Studio Entertainment 
      business, given the hit-driven nature and low margins. Ratings 
      incorporate Fitch's expectations that this segment will remain volatile 
      and low margin. The maturation of the DVD business will also pressure 
      this segment, although declines should be accommodated within current 
      ratings.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney's liquidity at March 31, 2011 was solid and consisted of $3.1 
      billion of cash ($576 million of which was held at Euro Disney and Hong 
      Kong Disney), as well as $4.4 billion (net of $101 million letters of 
      credit) available under two revolving credit facilities (RCF). The $2.25 
      billion RCF matures in February 2013 and the $2.25 billion RCF matures 
      in February 2015. These facilities backstop Disney's commercial paper 
      (CP) program. Liquidity is further supported by the company's annual 
      free cash flow generation, which Fitch expects to exceed $2.5 billion 
      going forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total debt at March 31, 2010 was $12.8 billion and consisted of:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$1.7 billion of CP;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$6.8 billion of notes and debentures, with maturities ranging from 
      2011-2093;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.5 billion of debt related to Euro Disneyland and Hong Kong Disney, 
      which is non-recourse back to Disney but which Fitch consolidates under 
      the assumption that the company would back the loan payments rather than 
      risk hurting its brand image by letting these entities default;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$1.8 billion of other domestic and European notes and other debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company's material maturity schedule could be handled organically if 
      needed, given free cash flow expectations. Fitch notes the company's 
      pension was 70% funded at Sept. 30, 2010 (the last reported date). While 
      annual pension funding obligations could total several hundred million 
      dollars over the next few years, they will be more than covered by free 
      cash flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch links the Issuer Default Ratings (IDRs) of the issuing entities 
      (predominantly based on the lack of any material restrictions on 
      movements of cash between the entities) and treats the unsecured debt of 
      the entire company as pari passu. Fitch recognizes the absence of 
      upstream guarantees from the operating assets and that debt at Disney 
      Enterprises is structurally senior to the holding company debt. However, 
      Fitch does not distinguish the issue ratings at the two entities due to 
      the strong 'A' category-investment grade IDR, Fitch's expectations of 
      stable financial policies and the anticipation that future debt will be 
      issued by Walt Disney Company. Fitch would consider distinguishing 
      between the ratings if we viewed there to be heightened risk of the 
      company's IDR falling to non-investment grade (where Disney Enterprises' 
      enhanced recovery prospects would be more relevant).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch currently maintains the following ratings:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Walt Disney Company
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt 'A';

			ISC and Tribridge Form Strategic Partnership to Enhance HeyGov! and 
      Microsoft Dynamics CRM 311 Call Center for Government
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today ISC 
      and Tribridge, two leading Microsoft Gold Partners, announce a new 
      partnership to provide a complete 311 government call center solution 
      for ISC&#8217;s HeyGov! product and Microsoft Dynamics CRM. Through this 
      partnership, ISC and Tribridge have developed a world-class 
      311 call center solution with a web-based citizen service portal, 
      mobile apps, telephony integration and more for government customers in 
      the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tribridge, two-time Worldwide Microsoft Dynamics Partner of the Year, 
      led the effort to enhance Microsoft Dynamics CRM to support the needs of 
      a 311 call center. These include customizable citizen request screens, 
      the addition of pre-packaged call scripts, telephony connectors, a 
      robust knowledge base, connectors to social networking sites, and 
      dashboard analytics. With a staff of 300+ employees and a history of 
      success in public sector CRM deployments, Tribridge is equipped to 
      handle cloud subscription and onsite implementations of Dynamics CRM, as 
      well as workflow integration between departmental systems like Hansen, 
      SAP, CityWorks, and others.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ISC will continue to support and enhance its award-winning HeyGov! 
      cloud-hosted software-as-a-service product. HeyGov! includes a 
      map-centric public facing customer service portal, hosted in Microsoft&#8217;s 
      Windows Azure, for citizens to visualize and analyze open and closed 311 
      service requests. The web-based HeyGov! portal also allows citizens to 
      submit a service request to a city by dragging and dropping a pushpin on 
      the map. In addition to the web-based citizen portal, HeyGov! includes 
      mobile apps for the Windows Phone, iPhone, Android and BlackBerry that 
      can be branded for a government. ISC also provides the GIS, mapping and 
      routing integration for the 311 call center using ISC&#8217;s MapDotNet UX GIS 
      product.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft is very excited to have two experienced partners like ISC and 
      Tribridge coming together to build a next generation 311 call center 
      solution and customer portal based on Dynamics CRM,&#8221; says Amir Capriles, 
      Dynamics Sr. Director US Public Sector at Microsoft. &#8220;ISC with their 
      expertise in geospatial software development combined with Tribridge&#8217;s 
      ability to deliver highly customized Dynamics CRM solutions will enable 
      governments to have more efficient communication with their citizens, 
      saving time and reducing costs for service delivery,&#8221; adds Capriles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Response has been overwhelming since first sharing the news with our 
      government customers in April during Microsoft&#8217;s annual Convergence 
      customer conference,&#8221; says Josh 
      Jaquish, Director of Public Sector at Tribridge. &#8220;People absolutely 
      love the idea of combining these two leading cloud applications to 
      improve citizen services&#8221;.

			IBM and George P. Johnson Win Ex Award for Best All-Virtual Event of 
      2010
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Event industry&#8217;s top honor goes to IBM&#8217;s on-demand Virtual Event 
      Center
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM and its experience marketing partner George P. Johnson (GPJ) took 
      home one of marketing&#8217;s highest honors yesterday when it was announced 
      that IBM&#8217;s Virtual Event Center (VEC) won an Ex Award for the Best 100% 
      Virtual Event/Expo. This prestigious win demonstrates the power of 
      online experiences to engage customers, employees and partners at a time 
      when marketers are seeking to leverage technology to deliver better 
      results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The VEC is part of IBM marketing&#8217;s ongoing efforts to push the 
      boundaries of its vision for a Smarter Planet and deliver better brand 
      experiences to its global customer base. The robust virtual platform 
      contains multiple interconnected experience zones pavilions, architected 
      as a &#8220;campus environment&#8221; representing different areas of IBM&#8217;s 
      business, from which sales and marketing teams are launching customized 
      turnkey events for targeted audiences and geographic locations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Built in collaboration with GPJ on strategy and experience design, VSA 
      Partners for creative and technology from Unisfair, the VEC is an 
      always-on tool with more than 60 unique interchangeable environments, 
      support for 16 languages, lead management, metrics and reporting, full 
      integration with social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter and 
      special support for hybrid events, in which the VEC neatly ties into 
      physical experiences such as product launches, conferences, briefing 
      centers and trade shows.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Virtual Event Center is another milestone in our ongoing effort to 
      bring to life the promise of a Smarter Planet, this time through a 
      web-delivered brand experience that helps businesses move forward 
      regardless of where and when they interact with us,&#8221; said Larry Cook, 
      IBM&#8217;s Manager of Events and Digital Metrics. &#8220;By empowering our 
      audiences to participate and contribute to the experience, we are 
      gathering insights and having the kind of high-quality interactions that 
      advance business relationships and generate better business results.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The award was announced at the annual Ex Awards Gala at the Event 
      Marketing Summit in Chicago and was received by representatives of both 
      IBM and GPJ. The 100% virtual category is particularly competitive in 
      the Ex Award program: IBM&#8217;s VEC platform beat out other all-virtual 
      programs submitted by top brands from around the world and from such 
      diverse fields as healthcare, technology, automotive and financial 
      services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s certainly an honor to be recognized for the risk-taking, 
      unconventional thinking, team building and collaboration that made the 
      roll-out of the Virtual Event Center possible,&#8221; said Fiona Bruder, 
      Senior Vice President, Client Services for GPJ. &#8220;The hallmark of every 
      great client-agency relationship is the ability to produce extraordinary 
      ideas and make them a reality in ways that improve business performance. 
      The VEC is setting a new standard for strategy, creative and execution 
      globally.&#8221;

			Mellanox Sets New Low-Latency Record for Real-time Market Data over 
      10GbE on IBM Systems
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			STAC&#174; Benchmark Tests Show 30 Percent Improvement over Previous Record
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mellanox&#174; Technologies, Ltd. (NASDAQ: MLNX; TASE: MLNX), a leading 
      supplier of end-to-end connectivity solutions for data center servers 
      and storage systems, today announced a new record in low-latency 
      messaging performance for Ethernet networks based on the latest STAC-M2 
      benchmark test conducted by Mellanox on IBM systems. The record was 
      achieved using Mellanox ConnectX-2 EN 10GbE NICs with RDMA over 
      Converged Ethernet (RoCE), the IBM BNT RackSwitch&#174; G8264 10GbE switch, 
      and IBM x3550 servers running IBM&#8217;s WebSphere 
      MQ Low Latency Messaging (LLM) technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Mellanox and IBM solution outperformed the most recent record holder 
      (based on a comparable configuration), achieving a 30 percent 
      improvement over results that were announced just two months ago. The 
      benchmark results highlight an enhancement in latency reduction and 
      scaling of messaging performance, validating Mellanox&#8217;s and IBM&#8217;s 
      performance leadership for high-performance connectivity to data centers 
      in the financial services industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With industry-leading, low-latency performance, Mellanox&#8217;s ConnectX-2 
      EN with RoCE NICs and the IBM BNT RackSwitch G8264 deliver superior 
      results to high-transaction databases and financial services,&#8221; said John 
      Monson, vice president of product marketing at Mellanox Technologies. 
      &#8220;These recent STAC-M2 benchmarks are the latest application level 
      evidence of our performance leadership in low-latency connectivity 
      solutions.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Financial organizations require performance-leading, low-latency 
      solutions to drive competitiveness and growth,&#8221; said Dan Tuchler, vice 
      president of strategy and product management for IBM System Networking. 
      &#8220;This STAC benchmark demonstrates that Mellanox and IBM are addressing 
      the performance requirements of the financial services industry by 
      providing financial services enterprises with innovative server, 
      storage, software and networking solutions that meet their customers&#8217; 
      needs for fast transactions and value-added services.&#8221;

--  Control Sametime Calls Remotely: walk, talk, and multitask with the
    ability to answer/end, mute, and control call volume and manage
    multiple calls remotely from the headset
--  Smart Sensor(TM) Technology Wearing Status: Built in sensors deliver
    automatic functionality like answering a call by placing the headset
    on and simultaneously updating softphone availability status
--  Mobile Phone Presence: Automatically changes Sametime presence status
    to 'on phone' when on a mobile call
--  Synchronized UC Presence: Updates presence status in Sametime and
    Skype(R) PC clients

    

"Unified communications is helping reinvent how people work,
providing a new, seamless and transparent way of connecting," said Caleb
Barlow, director of UC(2), IBM. "UC(2)done right includes all elements of
enterprise communications, including voice, instant messaging, video, and
of course the highest quality of audio, which is typically derived from
headsets. UC(2)is helping organizations take one step closer to becoming
a social business -- one that embraces networks of people to get real
work done."

    Please visit the Plantronics strategic IBM Partner site to hear more from
Caleb Barlow about the IBM and Plantronics relationship, and how the two
companies are working together to advance the UC experience.

    "The Plantronics software built expressly for IBM Sametime now has new
autosensing capabilities with our Voyager(R) Pro UC Bluetooth(R) headset
for use on the softphone and mobile phone," said Michael Gjerstad, vice
president of Strategic Partnerships at Plantronics. "We focus on making
the collaboration application more social and more intelligent by
providing headsets capable of sensing the user's availability and
reporting that information directly back to Sametime. Additionally, this
new software will integrate with Plantronics' Savi(R) wireless headsets
and solutions within the company's new product portfolio," continued
Gjerstad.

    Plantronics will reveal the new product portfolio on May 18, 2011 during
the company's 50th anniversary celebration and live webcast featuring
Jeff Schick, VP of Social Software at IBM. The live webcast will take
place at 10 am EDT and will be broadcasted from the New York Stock

&lt;p&gt;  HENDERSON, WV, May 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
At a real estate auction on Saturday in Henderson, W.Va., the 17,000
square-foot Bello Vista Estate sold for $1.65 million through J. P. King
Auction Company, the nation's premier real estate auction marketing firm. 

    The home's new owner, William Baker, was also a registered bidder at the
Kluge Winery and Vineyard, which J. P. King sold last month in
Charlottesville, W. Va., for $8.07 million. 

    "This [Bello Vista] estate presented a great opportunity to buy a
well-known, established home with a great history," Baker said. "It has
beautiful architecture and was well-built with high-quality materials."

    The auction event, which attracted 15 registered bidders from Ohio and
West Virginia, took place at the estate, built by Captain Robert Bosworth
in 1968. The home includes five bedrooms, 7.5 bathrooms, a heated pool,
elevator, wine cellar, commercial kitchen and an owner's kitchen, all in
a Mediterranean-style architecture.

    The Bello Vista Estate features a view of the Ohio River and sits at the
highest point in Point Pleasant, creating a local legend that embodies
the nautical influence of the town's own legendary riverboat captain. 

    J. P. King Auction Company specializes in high-value properties and
portfolios such as luxury homes, developments, condominiums and land and
ranches. The company has marketed properties in all 50 states and six
countries with upcoming events in Oklahoma, Colorado, Alabama and
Montana.

&lt;p&gt;Goldman analysts, including James Covello and Simon Schafer, also lowered their view on the U.S. semiconductor equipment sector to "cautious" from "neutral," citing a likely glut in processors due to recent strong capital expenditure levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capex levels in 2012 will likely decline 20 percent as industry capacity could reach a new peak in the fourth quarter, but will still be 15 percent above the prior peak exiting 2012, well ahead of demand growth, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index .SOX was down 1.26 percent at 432.30 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of KLA Tencor Corp (KLAC.O) fell 5 percent while those of Applied Materials Inc (AMAT.O) were down about 3 percent, after Goldman analysts downgraded both stocks by a notch each, on looming excess supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel shares -- which have gained about a fifth since the company's record quarterly earnings on April 19 -- were down 62 cents at $23.26 in morning trade on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters data, 31 analysts out of the 50 tracked by StarMine rate the stock a "buy" or "strong buy," while 17 rate it a "hold," and two others rate it a "sell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RISKS FROM RECORD CAPEX LEVELS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman expects Wall Street analysts to lower their 2012 earnings estimates for Intel as the company's record capital expenditure in 2011 will hurt sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Wall Street is forecasting a 6 percent year-over-year rise in Intel's sales, amid expanding gross margins, Goldman analysts expect sales to be about flat as average selling prices fall on excess capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average selling price may decline at least 5-10 percent in 2011 owing to the record capex levels at Intel this year, as well as due to improved products from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.N) and competitive offerings for tablets, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts also expect processor shipments to slow over the course of the year, as they believe processors outshipped PCs by about 10 percent in the first quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Intel -- whose slow progress in the red-hot mobile business has worried investors -- faces increased competition in the long-term from Britain's ARM Holdings (ARM.L) as the UK company's chip technology is favored in devices like Apple's (AAPL.O) iPad, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy-efficient chips that conserve batteries and are made with technology licensed by ARM are used by Apple and Samsung (005930.KS), and have become the industry standard in mobile devices at the expense of Intel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Maju Samuel and Sriraj Kalluvila)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;    * Lowers view on semiconductor equipment sector to cautious&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Expects strong capex levels to lead to excess supply&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Cuts KLA Tencor to sell, Applied Materials to neutral&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Raises LAM Research to buy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * Intel shares down 2 pct premarket&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    May 19 (Reuters) - Slowing processor shipments, risingcompetition, and record capital expenditure this year couldpressure Intel Corp (INTC.O), Goldman Sachs said, and downgradedthe chipmaker to "sell" from "neutral."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The brokerage also lowered its coverage view on the U.S.semiconductor equipment sector to "cautious" from "neutral"citing looming excess supply on account of recent strong capitalexpenditure levels.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Capex levels in 2012 will likely decline 20 percentyear-over-year as industry capacity could reach a new peak inthe fourth quarter of 2011, and be 15 percent above the priorpeak exiting 2012, well ahead of demand growth, the brokeragesaid.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This is being driven by a tripling in foundry capex peak topeak, and by Intel doubling its 2011 capex YoY," it said, addingthat the company, the world's largest chipmaker, could suffer2012 earnings estimate cuts by Wall Street owing to its recordcapex levels.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman lowered its rating on KLA Tencor Corp (KLAC.O) to"sell" from "neutral," saying the chip equipment maker has themost exposure to the foundries and Intel.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It also downgraded Applied Materials Inc (AMAT.O) to"neutral" from "buy," as it expects the world's largest maker ofequipment for semiconductor manufacturing to be hurt by thelikely 20 percent decline in 2012 capex levels for the industry.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Applied Materials may, however, be able to offset some ofthe topline pressure through cost cutting as the companyrestructures its global supply chain and shifts somemanufacturing to Singapore, the brokerage said.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman upgraded Lam Research Corp (LRCX.O), which suppliestools for etching circuits on to microchips, to "buy" from"neutral," saying the chip-gear maker's above-average memorysales, and limited Intel exposure should allow it to outperformpeers.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Intel fell more than 2 percent in pre-market tradeon Thursday. They closed at $23.88 on Wednesday on Nasdaq.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Maju Samuel)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ((tenzin.pema@thomsonreuters.com; within U.S. +1 646 223 8780;outside U.S. +91 80 4135 5800; Reuters Messaging:tenzin.pema.reuters.com@reuters.net))	Keywords: INTEL/RESEARCH GOLDMAN &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2011.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron recently announced the publication of its 2010 Corporate 
      Responsibility Report that includes specific examples of the company&#8217;s 
      community engagement activities around the world. For this year, the 
      report included information on its activities in the City of Richmond, 
      California, including water recycling efforts, STEM programs and air 
      emissions reductions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Chevron Richmond Refinery has initiated a broad-based effort to 
      better listen to and engage with its neighboring communities and 
      stakeholders, including concerns over health and emissions. To reduce 
      air emissions, Chevron installed new technologies and ran plants more 
      efficiently, reducing air emissions by 70 percent since the 1970s. A 
      refinery-wide flare-minimization program that began in 2007 has helped 
      decrease flaring by more than 97 percent. As the region&#8217;s largest 
      refinery, the Richmond Refinery represents approximately 38 percent of 
      oil refining capacity in the Bay Area but less than one percent of the 
      volume of vented gas flared in 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Across the company, Chevron follows an environmental stewardship process 
      that provides a consistent, systematic, risk-based approach to managing 
      aspects of the environment, including air, water, biodiversity and 
      waste. As part of that effort, Chevron completed its Richmond Advanced 
      Recycled (RARE) Water Project last year to treat 3.5 million gallons of 
      municipal wastewater each day for the refinery&#8217;s steam-producing 
      boilers. The refinery uses an additional 4 million gallons of reclaimed 
      water for the refining process as part of the 11 million gallon-per-day 
      operation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our efforts to reduce emissions and increase water efficiency in 
      Richmond illustrate our continued commitment of striving to improve our 
      operations and the environment around us,&#8221; said Richmond refinery 
      general manager Mike Coyle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Chevron responded to stakeholder interest in supporting 
      community programs by contributing $3.7 million toward education, youth 
      leadership programs, economic development and job training programs in 
      West Contra Costa County, where unemployment rates remain higher than 
      the national average. Chevron&#8217;s participation with the Stride Center 
      provided a $211,000 grant in 2009 to create a job-training program in 
      the community. Chevron&#8217;s investments in STEM education in 2010 reached 
      more than 245,000 students and 3,900 teachers in California.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Helping to support local educational and economic programs in areas 
      near our operation promotes a better standard of living and better links 
      us with both our community and our local businesses,&#8221; said Steve Green, 
      vice president, Policy, Government and Public Affairs at Chevron. &#8220;We 
      understand that California will never maintain its leadership without 
      world-class education, and that our company cannot maintain its 
      leadership without a world-class, well-educated work force.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron is committed to improving education and economic development in 
      California, which we believe is the cornerstone of our state&#8217;s 
      competitiveness,&#8221; added Green. &#8220;We do this by supporting nonprofits that 
      offer innovative approaches to enhance education, foster economic 
      development and improve vocational training.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We recognize that business success is deeply linked to society&#8217;s 
      progress,&#8221; said Chairman and Chief Executive Officer John Watson. &#8220;Our 
      investments in communities &#8211; developed in partnership with those 
      communities &#8211; also are investments in the long-term success of our 
      company.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s ninth annual Corporate Responsibility Report demonstrates 
      Chevron&#8217;s focus on creating mutual benefit and shared progress in seven 
      geographic areas where some of its most important projects are located. 
      The company also achieved its safest year in company history, reduced 
      its total energy consumption by 33 percent compared with 1992 levels, 
      and invested $197 million in communities around the world, according to 
      the company's 2010 Corporate Responsibility Report issued today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Energy is essential to human progress &#8211; it creates jobs, fuels 
      innovation and powers virtually every element of the global economy,&#8221; 
      added Watson. &#8220;Providing that energy safely, reliably and economically 
      is a great responsibility that we take seriously.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bangalore (Reuters) - Intel Corp (INTC.O) could suffer due to slowing processor shipments, rising competition and record capital expenditure levels this year, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, who in a rare downgrade cut their rating on the stock to "sell" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of the world's largest chipmaker -- which have gained about a fifth since the company's record quarterly earnings on April 19 -- fell 2 percent in pre-market trade on Thursday. They had closed at $23.88 on Wednesday on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman analysts, including James Covello and Simon Schafer, also lowered their coverage view on the U.S. semiconductor equipment sector to "cautious" from "neutral" on a likely glut in processors due to recent strong capital expenditure levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capex levels in 2012 will likely decline 20 percent as industry capacity could reach a new peak in the fourth quarter of this year, but will still be 15 percent above the prior peak exiting 2012, well ahead of demand growth, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Wall Street is forecasting a 6 percent year-over-year rise in Intel's sales, amid expanding gross margins, Goldman analysts expect sales to be about flat as average selling prices fall on excess capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Average selling price will likely decline at least 5-10 percent in 2011for Intel due to the record capex spent this year, improved products from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.N) and competitive tablet product offerings, the analysts said, and expect Wall Street to cut its 2012 earnings estimates for Intel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analysts also expect processor shipments to slow over the course of the year, as they believe processors outshipped PCs by about 10 percent in the first quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, Intel -- whose slow progress in the red-hot mobile business has worried investors -- faces increased competition in the long term from Britain's ARM Holdings (ARM.L) as the UK company's chip technology is favored in devices like Apple's (AAPL.O) iPad, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy-efficient chips that conserve batteries and are made with technology licensed by ARM are used by Apple and Samsung (005930.KS), and have become the industry standard in mobile devices at the expense of Intel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to StarMine, 31 analysts rate the stock a "buy" or "strong buy," 17 a "hold," while two rate it a "sell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DOWNGRADES ON INTEL EXPOSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman analysts lowered their rating on KLA Tencor Corp (KLAC.O) to "sell" from "neutral," saying the chip equipment maker has the most exposure to the foundries and Intel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They also downgraded Applied Materials Inc (AMAT.O) to "neutral" from "buy," as they expect the world's largest maker of equipment for semiconductor manufacturing to be hurt by the likely decline in 2012 capex levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Applied Materials may, however, be able to offset some of the topline pressure through cost cutting as the company restructures its global supply chain and shifts some manufacturing to Singapore, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They upgraded Lam Research Corp (LRCX.O), which supplies tools for etching circuits on to microchips, to "buy" from "neutral," saying the company's above-average memory sales, and limited Intel exposure should allow it to outperform peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Maju Samuel)&lt;/p&gt;

			Univision Goes Big at 2011 Upfront by Accelerating Original 
      Productions and Expanding Televisa Content across Platforms
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Unveils Three New Networks and Nearly 500 Hours of Original 
      Programming in Primetime and Late Night Delivers Unprecedented 
      Opportunities for Marketers in Televisa  Original Content
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Univision Communications Inc., the leading media company serving 
      Hispanic America, is today unveiling the 2011-2012 programming line-up, 
      delivering expanded Televisa content across all television and 
      interactive platforms and a robust slate of original productions &#8211; 
      including three new networks. With nearly 500 hours of new original 
      productions scheduled for primetime and late night, the Company is 
      shining a spotlight on the growth the Hispanic population is fueling 
      across the nation, while remaining keenly focused on innovation and 
      expansion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the launch of three new networks and continued ratings 
      momentum vs. ABC, CBS, NBC and FOX, today&#8217;s Univision Upfront 
      presentation will underscore how its enhanced partnership with Televisa 
      is creating powerful new cross-platform branding and integration 
      opportunities that have not existed until now. The presentation is 
      taking place this afternoon at the New Amsterdam Theatre in New York 
      City and will be hosted by Univision Executive Vice President and Chief 
      Operation Officer, Randy Falco; Univision Networks President Cesar 
      Conde; and President of Advertising Sales and Marketing, David Lawenda.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There is a New American Reality and businesses looking to deliver 
      growth need to establish and maintain a relationship with the 
      fastest-growing consumer segment in our nation,&#8221; said Falco. 
      &#8220;Univision&#8217;s close to 50-year relationship with Hispanics makes us one 
      of the leading media brands in this country and the gateway to connect 
      with this consumer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Recognizing the power of the burgeoning Hispanic consumer base, 
      Univision is investing in expanding our content across all media 
      platforms with both traditional distributors as well as online and 
      mobile video providers. Today we are expanding our already robust slate 
      of original programming by unveiling nearly 500 hours of new original 
      productions in primetime and late night, innovative series and 
      specials,&#8221; added Conde. &#8220;We have also expanded our partnership with 
      Televisa, and other leading Spanish-language producers in the world, to 
      deliver the content Hispanic America seeks via Univision&#8217;s multiple 
      outlets and services. In addition, the upcoming launches of Sports, 
      Novela and News networks will further deliver culturally-relevant, 
      proven content to our audiences.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The groundswell of the Census has led to more demand than ever. Active 
      clients are looking to raise the bar and do more across the entire media 
      portfolio, while inactive clients are looking for strategies to win with 
      Hispanics,&#8221; said Lawenda. &#8220;Univision is able to surround the Hispanic 
      consumer unlike any other company in media today. Our expanded 
      partnership with Televisa, coupled with our investment in original 
      productions, creates unprecedented branding and integration 
      opportunities for marketers looking to connect with an incredibly 
      valuable audience.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Univision Network continues to be one of the top five networks in 
      the United States, regardless of language, and is delivering the highest 
      year-over-year audience growth of any broadcast network among Adults 
      18-49 vs. last season (+8%) while ABC (-9%), CBS (-8%), NBC (-14%) and 
      FOX (-5%) are down. In fact, this season-to-date, Univision is beating 
      NBC on half the nights thus far among Adults 18-49 and on two out of 
      three nights among Adults 18-34. Additionally, TeleFutura competes 
      head-to-head for the #2 Spanish-language network position. Posting its 
      best first quarter ratings ever, Galavisi&#243;n continues to be the #1 
      Spanish-language cable network in the country. These networks, coupled 
      with Univision Interactive Media&#8217;s industry leading online and mobile 
      platforms, offer a variety of programming that consistently delivers 
      high viewership among Hispanics across the country.

&lt;p&gt;WARSAW May 19 (Reuters) - Belgium's financial group KBC
(KBC.BR) has hired Goldman Sachs to help it prepare for a
potential sale of its Polish arm, Kredyt Bank BKRE.WA, a
Polish newspaper reported on Thursday, citing an unnamed source.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "This is not a request to find buyers, but rather to prepare
a sale scenario," the Rzeczpospolita daily quoted an investment
banker as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KBC agreed with the European Commission in 2009 to divest
several assets after receiving 7 billion euros ($10 billion) of
state aid during the financial crisis. The plan, however, did
not include the sale of KBC's main Polish assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March the newspaper reported KBC had begun gauging
interest for its Polish assets including Kredyt which has a
current market cap of $1.7 bln.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Belgian newspaper reported in April that KBC was looking
into offloading Kredyt Bank and Polish insurer Warta instead of
the planned flotation of part of its Czech unit CSOB.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KBC has said it remained committed to the divestment plan
agreed with the EU's executive body.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Some Iranian students may seek two-year, multiple-entry U.S. visas, the State Department said on Friday, giving them greater freedom to travel to the United States in a gesture to improve people-to-people ties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The step is the latest in a series by President Barack Obama's administration to reach out to the Iranian people and, in particular, to young Iranians despite the long enmity between the two countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Students from Iran, which the United States accuses of seeking nuclear weapons, sponsoring terrorism and brutally repressing its people, previously were eligible only for three-month, single-entry visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new guidelines apply to Iranians and their dependents applying to study in "nonsensitive, nontechnical fields" -- those that would not contribute to Iran's nuclear, missile or other weapons-related activities, a U.S. official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the revised policy, the visas could be valid for two years and allow Iranian students to come and go as often as they wished in that period without applying for a new visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether they may actually enter the United States and exactly how long they may stay is decided by immigration officers at their port of entry, U.S. officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a video address, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made clear the U.S. gesture aimed to reach out to young Iranians, many of whom turned out in mass protests against the disputed 2009 reelection of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those protests, the biggest challenge to the Islamic state since the 1979 revolution that ended the authoritarian rule of the Shah of Iran, were crushed by Iranian security forces who jailed scores of demonstrators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want more dialogue and more exchange with those of you who are shaping Iran's future," Clinton said in the message, which the State Department said was posted on Youtube in both English and Farsi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because as long as the Iranian government continues to stifle your potential, we will stand with you," she added. "We will continue to look for new ways to fuel more opportunities for real change in Iran."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the visa change aimed to make good on the administration's pledge of seeking to engage ordinary Iranians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama's efforts to persuade Iran to cease its suspected pursuit of nuclear arms have so far failed and he has led a push to tighten U.S. and international sanctions on Tehran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iran says its nuclear program is to generate electricity, not produce weapons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the latest of his annual "Nowruz" messages to mark the Persian new year, Obama on March 20 accused Iran of a two-year "campaign of intimidation and abuse" against its own people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These choices do not demonstrate strength; they show fear," he said, aiming his message at young Iranians. "Though times may seem dark, I want you to know that I am with you."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Paul Simao)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, California (Reuters) - A group of Silicon Valley schools have built the largest solar and power-saving system of any U.S. school district through a project undertaken with the energy efficiency arm of Chevron Corp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 7.1 megawatt project at San Jose's East Side Union High School District should save $43 million over its life, and $3 million next year alone, or enough to fund at least 25 jobs, according to Lan Nguyen, president of the district's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Projects such as this one, which include the deployment of solar panels, allow cash-strapped schools to capture some of the funds set aside for California's clean energy targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At a time when our district is being forced to absorb painful budget cuts due to the continued economic downturn, this program is a huge reason to celebrate," Nguyen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project led by Chevron Energy Solutions (CES) used solar panels made by SolarWorld and Sharp, which will also serve as canopies for cars in parking lots, as well as energy-efficiency improvements, such as lighting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tom Torlakson, California's state superintendent of public education, said at the East Side project's unveiling on Friday that he hoped it would push more of the state's 1,000 school districts to adopt similar schemes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efficiency played a crucial part in making them pay, he added. Recognizing that smaller districts might not be able to tackle them alone, his office aims to set up partnerships among public-sector bodies to work through red tape together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;California funding for solar energy also plays a part, worth more than $14 million on the East Side project alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;East Side does have advantages. The district covers 180 square miles (466 sq km) in sprawling, sun-drenched Silicon Valley, and has nearly 24,000 students. Such projects have now added 20 MW across Silicon Valley schools, a spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet California is not alone.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) executives have good reason to be worried about the risk of receiving subpoenas from the Justice Department, and investors should be concerned too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government has a real chance of finding inconsistencies between Goldman executives' testimony to Congress and their internal documents, which means subpoenas could turn into something more serious, lawyers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distractions and the reputational damage from any government action could result in clients hesitating to work with the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There's no evidence of that happening, but it is a risk. Even if the expected subpoenas turn up nothing, they reflect growing political pressure for the United States to do something -- anything -- to punish Goldman for the events of the financial crisis, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is extremely vulnerable," says Harvey Silverglate, an attorney who represented Michael Milken after the junk-bond king pleaded guilty to felony charges in 1990. "The statutes are so vague, a reasonably good prosecutor or a reasonably inventive prosecutor can manage to squeeze anything that might not look so great into a federal felony."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Goldman, there is a lot that does not look great.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Senate subcommittee report in April said the bank offloaded much of its subprime mortgage exposure to unsuspecting clients in late 2006 and 2007 as the market was starting to tank. In some cases, it refused to end bad trades with customers, even as clients pressed them to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin forwarded the report to the Department of Justice, and on Friday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman executives expect the Justice Department to issue subpoenas for more information about mortgage-related matters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs spokesman David Wells declined to comment. At the time the Levin report was released, Goldman said, "While we disagree with many of the conclusions of the report, we take seriously the issues explored by the subcommittee."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key question as Justice Department prosecutors review Levin's report will be whether they believe they can prove criminal violations beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration has had some trouble prosecuting senior corporate executives with ties to the housing meltdown. Prosecutors dropped a probe of former Countrywide Financial CEO Angelo Mozilo after determining his actions did not amount to criminal wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice also failed to win criminal prosecutions against two former Bear Stearns executives in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two attorneys whose firms are involved in civil litigation against Goldman said that there wasn't enough evidence for a criminal case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Prosecutors have been pretty careful not to indict someone unless they have the Raj Rajaratnam wire-tap smoking gun," said one lawyer, who declined to be identified to avoid hurting his client's case. "I'm not sure they have it here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Department spokeswoman Alisa Finelli declined to comment about Goldman or political pressure on the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HEAVY PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether or not they believe the evidence unveiled so far warrants a criminal case, lawyers say the Justice Department may take some sort of legal action simply to send a message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One former federal prosecutor said that the Justice Department might avoid pressing charges against the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nobody wants to bring down Goldman," said the former prosecutor, who declined to speak on the record because of current business relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But pressing lesser charges against Goldman Sachs officials might make sense, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to send a message to the rest of the community that you can't do this kind of activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors may seize on the difference between what executives said in front of lawmakers at a hearing last spring and what they said in email messages or other documents when the financial crisis was brewing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In testimony to the Senate subcommittee in April 2010, Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said, "we didn't have a massive short against the housing market and we certainly did not bet against our clients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subcommittee report said the opposite on both of those crucial points, contending that Goldman's denials "are not credible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin said that generally, in his estimation, "Goldman clearly misled their clients and they misled Congress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a chart, the subcommittee shows Goldman holding short positions of $1.5 billion to $13 billion through most of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein also said that Goldman lost about $1.2 billion from activities in the residential housing market, while the subcommittee contends it actually earned money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman said at the time of the report's release that the testimony was "truthful and accurate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's unclear how prosecutors will interpret those discrepancies and turns of phrase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Department of Justice probe is the latest in a series of inquiries and investigations into Goldman. The bank paid $550 million last year to settle civil fraud charges with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission over a complicated derivatives deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank did not admit to any wrongdoing as part of that settlement, but acknowledged a "mistake." The Commodity Futures Trading Commission is investigating a Goldman unit, and staffers have told Goldman they intend to recommend the commission bring charges, according to the company's most recently quarterly filing with regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A BELLY WOUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In aggregate, this kind of political pressure is poisonous to a bank, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Vinella, a director at the consulting firm Berkeley Research Group who specializes in bonds and derivatives, held a senior management position at Drexel Burnham Lambert before its collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vinella cautions that he does not think Goldman will go out of business, but said the high-profile accusations of dishonesty and double-dealing can wear on a bank's reputation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He compares the Goldman situation to Drexel's downfall, which happened over a period of four years. Prosecutors first targeted individual employees in 1986. The Securities and Exchange Commission eventually sued the company and the Department of Justice settled felony charges with the firm. Drexel filed for bankruptcy in February 1990.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What happens in these kinds of instances is usually not immediate," says Vinella. "It's usually this kind of slow, agonizing, belly-wound death."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eventually, he said, public officials, wealthy clients and talented employees no longer want to be associated with a bank that has garnered so much negative attention. As talented employees leave, clients who once flocked to Goldman for advice on major deals or to obtain financing may no longer see the cachet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Veteran banking analyst Richard Bove of Rochdale Securities wrote in a note last week that the likelihood for the U.S. and Goldman to keep fighting "does not work for shareholders." He downgraded the bank's shares to "sell" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Thomson Reuters data, 19 other analysts advise clients to buy the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Goldman customers that spoke with Reuters said they plan to continue doing business with the bank if only to get access to information and attractive deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But there are signs that Goldman's stature is waning, including its absence in some of the larger MA transactions this year and its declines in trading revenue. Since the subcommittee report was released, Goldman's stock has shed 13 percent, representing $10.8 billion in market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Said former Drexel executive Vinella, "You want to get bad news over with as quickly as possible and, with Goldman, we're now almost into year three."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra.

two to four people per million annually worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sutent, which is already approved to treat advanced kidney
cancer and gastrointestinal stromal tumor, or GIST, a type of
cancer of the digestive system, had sales of $276 million in
the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It had previously received approval in Europe and nine
other countries for pancreatic NET, which was the type of
cancer that afflicted Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Steve
Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An expert FDA advisory panel in April recommended that the
agency approve Sutent for the rare cancer based on a pivotal
Phase III trial in which it more than doubled progression free
survival, or the time it takes for the disease to worsen,
compared with a placebo, to 10.4 months versus 5.4 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This approval is welcome news for physicians who have
struggled to find a treatment option that shows a substantial
clinical benefit in treating advanced pancreatic NET," Dr. Eric
Raymond, who led the Phase III study, said in a statement.

&lt;p&gt; * Eliquis wins first regulatory approval&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * To compete with Bayer's Xarelto, approved in EU in 2008
 (Adds Bristol-Myers comments, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 20 (Reuters) - European regulators approved a
potentially lucrative medicine from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co
(BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) for prevention of blood clots in
patients who have undergone hip or knee replacement surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The approval announced on Friday gives European patients
undergoing such surgeries the option to take the pill, called
Eliquis, rather than the widely used injectable blood thinner
enoxaparin to prevent potentially dangerous blood clots after
orthopedic surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In two late-stage European studies involving such patients,
Eliquis, know chemically as apixaban, proved superior at
preventing blood clots to a 40-milligram daily injection of
enoxaparin, which is sold by Sanofi (SASY.PA) under the brand
name Lovenox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in a large U.S. trial called Advance 1, Eliquis failed
its main efficacy goal among patients undergoing knee surgery.
In that study, it was compared with 30 milligrams of
enoxaparin, dosed twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bristol-Myers and Pfizer, following the failed U.S. trial,
have not asked U.S. regulators to approve Eliquis for
orthopedic patients, or signaled an intention to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eliquis, like a rival drug called Xarelto (rivaroxaban)
being developed by Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson  Johnson
(JNJ.N), works by blocking a protein called Factor Xa that
plays a key role in the clotting process. European regulators
approved Xarelto for hip and knee surgery patients in October
2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jack Lawrence, head of development for Eliquis at
Bristol-Myers, said hip-replacement patients typically need
enoxaparin treatment for 32 to 38 days after surgery and that
those having knee surgery are encouraged to receive enoxaparin
injections for 10 to 14 days after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As a pill, rather than injections, Eliquis has the
potential to improve patient compliance outside the hospital,"
Lawrence said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Eliquis and Xarelto are also being tested to see if they
are better than oral anticoagulant warfarin in preventing
strokes among patients with an irregular heartbeat called
atrial fibrillation -- a potentially far more lucrative use
than the orthopedic indication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street expects the two drugs, and another novel pill
from Boehringer Ingelheim called Pradaxa, to all become
blockbuster alternatives to current blood clot preventers --
mainly due to sales for stroke-prevention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pradaxa was approved in October for stroke prevention in
the United States. Bayer and JJ asked U.S. and European
regulators in January to approve Xarelto for the indication.
Bristol-Myers and Pfizer plan to unveil stroke-prevention data
for Eliquis this summer and to seek approvals for that use
later in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bristol-Myers shares were down 0.8 percent to $28.37 in
afternoon trading, while Pfizer was 1 percent lower at $20.82
amid a downturn in the broader market.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Investigators hunting for culprits in the financial crisis are keeping Goldman Sachs in their crosshairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Securities and Exchange Commission got off an early shot when they settled with Goldman last year for $550 million in the most high-profile enforcement case to emerge from the 2007-2009 financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Almost a year later, the drumbeat is growing louder for investigators to nail Goldman again, fueled by a Senate report, even though regulators haven't taken a first big swipe at other major Wall Street players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Goldman is a high-octane, high-profile target," said Dick Beckler, a partner in Bracewell  Giuliani's white-collar defense practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC's Goldman case, which accused the firm of misleading clients who invested in a subprime mortgage-backed product known as "Abacus," was a big win for the agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC is under intense pressure along with the Justice Department to hold financial players accountable for the crisis that required a $700-billion taxpayer bailout and sent the economy into a prolonged swoon still being felt with 9-percent unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC and DOJ have so far failed to bring a comparable case against other major financial firms, such as American International Group (AIG.N), which required more than $180 billion in government help, or Citigroup (C.N), which got a $45 billion bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet buzz has grown that Goldman is again public enemy No. 1 for investigators, even after the SEC settlement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That was a civil case, and you don't get a sense of vengeance and satisfaction from civil settlements," said Robert Hillman, a law professor at the University of California, Davis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Goldman may jump again to the top of investigators' lists because it plays better as a culprit than other financial players. "They're unpopular. They're big. They're sort of the face of Wall Street. They're very profitable. And there's the perception they did quite well from the financial crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Goldman shares fell 3.5 percent in one day after veteran bank analyst Richard Bove downgraded the shares to "sell" from "neutral," saying "it now appears that the pressure on the Justice Department to bring a criminal lawsuit against Goldman is building to a high pitch." A Standard  Poor's analyst also downgraded the company's shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bove call dovetailed with an article in Rolling Stone describing findings from a recent investigation led by Senator Carl Levin, and the story said prosecutions could follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York attorney general is also tightening the screws on Goldman, requesting information from Goldman, Bank of America (BAC.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) on their mortgage securitization practices, according to a source familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman itself is bracing for a criminal probe, according to a Wall Street Journal article on Friday, and expects subpoenas from the Justice Department could come within days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman declined to comment, as did the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Any such subpoenas would closely follow the pressure Levin has put on investigators by recently forwarding his Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation's 639-page report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In my judgment, Goldman clearly misled their clients and they misled Congress," Levin told an April media briefing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Levin told Reuters on Tuesday, "Where there is evidence in those reports that we think might lead to either administrative action or prosecution, we forward those reports."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;University of California's Hillman said one would hope investigators don't focus their energy because of outside pressure, but in reality the Justice Department is as political as any federal agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think the Justice Department has the strength to resist the political pressure," Hillman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Karey Wutkowski, with additional reporting by Dave Clarke, Jeremy Pelofsky in Washington, and Lauren Tara LaCapra in New York; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

market.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has moved closer to offloading Litton Loan Servicing, with Ocwen Financial Corp (OCN.N) leading in an auction to acquire the troubled mortgage business, sources familiar with the situation said this week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A deal, however, has not been reached yet, so talks could still fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Litton is not a large component of Goldman's operations, divesting the business would close an unpleasant chapter for the Wall Street bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman bought Litton in 2007 for about $430 million, hoping to glean more information about the housing market to aid its mortgage-bond trading business. Shortly after the deal closed, the subprime housing market fell into shambles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of delinquencies and foreclosures have cut into profits of many servicing businesses. In recent months, sloppy foreclosure practices have also attracted regulatory attention and bad publicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman began considering a sale of Litton late last year, and in the first quarter it took a $220 million writedown related to the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a regulatory filing, the bank said it expected to sell Litton within a year and was cooperating with requests for information from regulators and state attorneys general about its foreclosure practices as part of a nation-wide probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Houston-based business could fetch up to $500 million in the auction, sources said last month. At the time these sources said Goldman was also offering 85 percent financing for the deal, which would be used to finance roughly $2.5 billion of "advances."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies like Litton, which collect mortgage payments from borrowers and foreclose on properties, make advances to mortgage owners when a loan goes bad, to cover things like principal and interest payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ocwen has been buying businesses from banks in recent months. Last May, Ocwen bought a $6.9 billion servicing portfolio from Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) Saxon Mortgage Services. Ocwen also bought Barclays (BARC.L) U.S. mortgage servicing business HomEq for $1.3 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Ocwen declined to comment. The sources declined to be named because the sale process is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other firms that looked at buying Litton include, Carrington Holding Co, Fortress Investment Group's (FIG.N) Nationstar, and several private equity firms, sources have previously said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ocwen's shares were off 0.7 percent at $11.72, while Goldman's stock was down 1.1 percent at $137.87 in early afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra and Paritosh Bansal; Editing by Lisa Von Ahn, Steve Orlofsky and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

principal and interest payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ocwen has been buying businesses from banks in recent
months. Last May, Ocwen bought a $6.9 billion servicing
portfolio from Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) Saxon Mortgage Services.
Ocwen also bought Barclays (BARC.L) U.S. mortgage servicing
business HomEq for $1.3 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and Ocwen declined to comment. The sources declined
to be named because the sale process is not public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other firms that looked at buying Litton include,
Carrington Holding Co, Fortress Investment Group's (FIG.N)
Nationstar, and several private equity firms, sources have
previously said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ocwen's shares were off 0.7 percent at $11.72, while
Goldman's stock was down 1.1 percent at $137.87 in early
afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters Life!) - Musician Pete Doherty was jailed for six months on Friday after pleading guilty to possession of cocaine, the Press Association reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 32-year-old was arrested in January last year by police investigating the suspected overdose death of heiress Robyn Whitehead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The controversial Babyshambles singer has been jailed twice before and has repeatedly admitted possession of banned substances.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge David Radford said he had an "appalling record" of committing offences, having made 13 other court appearances in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Wolfe, 42, who had pleaded guilty to two counts of possession of cocaine and one count of supplying cocaine to Whitehead, was sentenced to a total of 12 months in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitehead, 27, the granddaughter of the late Teddy Goldsmith, founder of The Ecologist magazine, spent the last 10 days of her life making a documentary about Doherty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutor Alison Morgan said paramedics were called to Wolfe's flat in Hackney, east London, where Whitehead collapsed on January 24 last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They tried to resuscitate Whitehead but she was pronounced dead shortly afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Toxicology reports found she had a combination of cocaine and heroin in her body and had died of heroin poisoning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Footage filmed inside the flat two days earlier showed her in the flat with Wolfe and him passing her a crack pipe, which she then smoked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The prosecutor told Snaresbrook Crown Court that Doherty later joined them and was also filmed smoking on the crack pipe and putting crack cocaine inside it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She said the drugs offences to which the two men had been charged had been committed between January 22 and 24 but that the crack cocaine that Wolfe had supplied Whitehead with could not have been what killed her.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Radford said she had died from the poisoning of another illegal drug which she had chosen to take.&lt;/p&gt;

Morgan Securities said and downgradedMetroPCS Communications PCS.N and Leap Wireless InternationalLEAP.O to "neutral".	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This year April seems to have gone well for prepaid, but webelieve things are slowing down in May and expect traffic toslow further before it rebounds in the fall," analysts led byPhilip Cusick said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Though the shift to smartphones has benefited the industry,tighter customer budgets have slowed the upgrades, Cusick said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Gas prices are at a high of about $4 a gallon, up from about$3 a gallon at the start of 2011. Food prices have alsoincreased, he said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The brokerage, however, kept its price target of $16 on theLeap stock and $20 on MetroPCS.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Leap shares closed at $16.70 on Thursday on Nasdaq.

worldwide. It is popular with prospective students and agents in all of
Australia's major source markets. I'm sure that all of Australia's
universities, VET and English language providers join me in welcoming the
re-introduction of the TOEFL test for student visa purposes," commented
Jeffrey Smart, Pro Vice- Chancellor (International and Recruitment) at
Melbourne's Swinburne University of Technology. "For many years, students
have been able to gain academic admission into Australia's universities
on the basis of their TOEFL score: now applicants will be able to satisfy
visa requirements with this test as well. With students in 165 countries
taking the TOEFL test, the Department's decision provides a boost to
Australia's international student recruitment efforts offering a larger
and more diverse applicant pool."

&lt;p&gt;  PRINCETON, NJ, May 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Students from around the world who wish to study in Australia can now use
their TOEFL(R) test scores as part of their visa application as announced
by Australia's Department of Immigration and Citizenship (DIAC). 

    "I am very pleased the TOEFL test has been chosen as one of the new
English test providers and I am confident they will provide a valuable
service to student visa applicants," said the Hon. Chris Bowen MP,
Minister for Immigration and Citizenship.

    This announcement has significant meaning for large numbers of
international students from Assessment Level 3 and 4 countries, including
China, India, Vietnam, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Turkey and the Philippines, who
are interested in studying in Australia. International students now have
the opportunity to use the TOEFL test to demonstrate their English
language proficiency, satisfying the required language component of the
visa application process. 

    "Nearly every university and college in Australia already accepts TOEFL
scores for admission purposes. Today's announcement means that students
globally can now use their TOEFL scores for both visa and academic
admission purposes," explains David Hunt, Vice President and Chief
Operating Officer of ETS's Global Division.

    For more than 45 years, the TOEFL test has been the most widely
recognized English language assessment in the world, used by more than
8,000 colleges, universities and agencies, including the most prestigious
institutions in the U.K., Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the U.S. And
with more than 4,500 test sites globally, the TOEFL test is more
convenient than ever for students wishing to apply for study in
Australia. 

    "The TOEFL test is the most widely accepted English language assessment

Australia's major source markets. I'm sure that all of Australia's

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING May 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has trimmed its
economic growth forecasts for China to 9.4 percent this year,
from 10 percent previously, citing a recent run of surprisingly
weak data, high oil prices and supply constraints.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The growth slowdown has been even sharper than we forecast,
especially evident in April industrial production," Goldman said
in a research note to clients.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In addition, inflation is not coming down as rapidly as we
hoped," the U.S. bank said. It predicts China's annual inflation
will peak at 5.6 percent in June, with average annual inflation
hitting 4.7 percent in 2011.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If China's inflation does indeed hit 5.6 percent in June, it
would be the highest since July 2008, when inflation ran at 6.3
percent. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For 2012, Goldman reduced its economic growth forecasts for
China to 9.2 percent, from the initial 9.5 percent.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it expects China to keep its monetary policy
tight until the third quarter of this year, even though growth
seems to be "clearly below trend".	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speculation that China's economy, the world's second
biggest, could be breaking sharply has gained traction after its
April factory output disappointed some investors by growing 13.4
percent, compared with forecasts for 14.7 percent.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But not all economists think the data suggests an acute
slowdown is at hand. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HSBC, for instance, noted that even though April's
industrial output was softer than expected, it is still a solid
growth pace of over 13 percent, and does not point to a "hard
landing" in the economy.

&lt;p&gt; * IPO could raise about $3 billion - IFR

 (Adds full list of banks, changes sourcing in lede)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Elzio Barreto and Fiona Lau	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, May 24 (Reuters) - Jewellery retailer Chow Tai
Fook, controlled by billionaire Cheng Yu-tung, has hired
Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs Group Inc ,
HSBC Holdings Plc  and JPMorgan Chase  Co
 as the main underwriters for its Hong Kong IPO, said a
source familiar with the matter.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company could raise $3 billion from the initial public
offering, slated for the first quarter of 2012, Thomson Reuters
publication IFR reported late on Monday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The retailer had also hired Citigroup Inc , Credit
Suisse Group AG and UBS AG , to underwrite
the offer, the source told Reuters on Tuesday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source was not authorised to speak to media as the
mandates had not yet been made public. Chow Tai Fook officials
were not immediately available for comment.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumption of luxury items in China, the world's
second-largest economy, has surged at double-digit rates in
recent years as a new class of consumers snaps up jewellery from
Tiffany  Co , ties and scarves from Hermes International
SCA and handbags from LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton
SA . 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chow Tai Fook, founded by Cheng's father-in-law Chow Chi
Yuen in Guangzhou in 1929, has 1,400 stores, mostly in greater
China. It competes with domestic players, such as Luk Fook
Holdings (International) Ltd and Emperor Watch and
Jewellery Ltd , and foreign brands such Tiffany. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We aim to open 200 stores every year, with 90 percent of
them in China," Alan Chan, Chow Tai Fook Jewellery's global
branding director, told the Reuters Global Luxury Summit in Hong

&lt;p&gt;Disney's Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides Posts Global Record Opening
Weekend in IMAX(R) Theatres

LOS ANGELES, May 23, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMAX Corporation (NYSE:IMAX)
(TSX:IMX) and The Walt Disney Studios announced today that the action fantasy
adventure Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides posted global opening
weekend record results for IMAX of $16.5 million on 394 IMAX screens.
Domestically, IMAX screens generated approximately $8.2 million of the film's
$90.1 million, for a per-screen average of $32,000. Internationally, the film
grossed approximately $8.3 million on 138 IMAX screens, or roughly $60,100 a
screen.

"These results demonstrate the rising global appeal of top Hollywood
blockbusters presented in IMAX's format, and perfectly highlight the potential
inherent in IMAX's international growth strategy," said IMAX CEO Richard L.
Gelfond. "This dynamic is driving our global network expansion and is
particularly encouraging in some of our under-penetrated overseas markets, where
we continue to see excellent opportunity for future growth."

The IMAX release of Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides generated a
per-screen average of more than $100,000 on 15 international IMAX screens, eight
of which are in Russia and the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS). Others
are in China, Korea, Taiwan, Australia, Europe and Japan. The highest-grossing
screen worldwide is the IMAX Kinosfera in Moscow, with a gross to date of more
than $240,000. Newly opened IMAX(R) theatres in Milan, Italy ($51,650) and
Mallorca, Spain ($48,000) have also posted strong results.

The Company noted that its results in China were particularly encouraging. Wanda
Cinema Line, with which IMAX recently signed a 75-theatre joint revenue sharing
agreement, reported an opening weekend total gross of $675,000 from its nine
existing IMAX locations for an average of $75,000 per screen.

"The film's excellent performance worldwide demonstrates that, when given the
choice, consumers both domestically and abroad continue to seek out The IMAX
Experience(R)," added Greg Foster, Chairman and President, IMAX Filmed
Entertainment. "Disney, Jerry Bruckheimer and the production team have their
hands on the pulse of the global marketplace and we're thrilled to be along for
the ride."

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides: An IMAX 3D Experience has been
digitally re-mastered into the image and sound quality of The IMAX Experience
with proprietary IMAX DMR(R) (Digital Re-mastering) technology for presentation
in IMAX(R) 3D. The crystal-clear images, coupled with IMAX's customized theatre
geometry and powerful digital audio, create a unique immersive environment that
will make audiences feel as if they are in the movie.

About Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides:

Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Rob Marshall, Pirates of the
Caribbean: On Stranger Tides captures the fun, adventure and humor that ignited
the hit franchise--this time in Disney Digital 3D(TM). Johnny Depp returns to
his iconic role of Captain Jack Sparrow in an action-packed adventure. Crossing
paths with the enigmatic Angelica (Penelope Cruz), he's not sure if it's
love--or if she's a ruthless con artist who's using him to find the fabled
Fountain of Youth. When she forces him aboard the "Queen Anne's Revenge," the
ship of the legendary pirate Blackbeard (Ian McShane), Jack finds himself on an
unexpected adventure in which he doesn't know whom to fear more: Blackbeard or
Angelica, with whom he shares a mysterious past. The international cast includes
franchise vets Geoffrey Rush as the vengeful Captain Hector Barbossa and Kevin
R. McNally as Captain Jack's longtime comrade Joshamee Gibbs, plus Sam Claflin
as a stalwart missionary and Astrid Bergs-Frisbey as a mysterious
mermaid.

Opening in Disney Digital 3D(TM) and IMAX 3D, Walt Disney Pictures' and Jerry
Bruckheimer Films' Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides features a screen
story and screenplay by Ted Elliott &amp; Terry Rossio, based on characters created
by Ted Elliott &amp; Terry Rossio and Stuart Beattie and Jay Wolpert, and suggested
by the novel by Tim Powers.

Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides has been rated PG-13 for intense
sequences of action/adventure violence, some frightening images, sensuality and
innuendo.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - International Business Machines edged past old rival Microsoft Corp in market value for the first time since April 1996, marking the latest twist in the fluctuating fortunes of two of the world's most storied technology companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move marks another unhappy milestone for Microsoft, which has failed to persuade investors that it can dominate the future of technology as it did in the past, and has seen its share price stagnate over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investor putting $100,000 into both stocks 10 years ago would now have about $143,000 in IBM stock and about $69,000 in Microsoft stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is now the third-largest U.S. tech company by market value, after a resurgent Apple Inc roared past a year ago to take first place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM ruled the computer industry for decades until it hired the tiny, unknown Microsoft to provide an operating system for its new range of personal computers in the early 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Gates parlayed that breakthrough into industry dominance -- proving his theory that software would be more valuable than hardware -- so that by the end of 1999, Microsoft's market value was three times that of IBM's, and bigger than any other U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Throughout Seattle-based Microsoft's rise, IBM was pilloried as an old-fashioned, immobile Goliath that could not keep up with the computing revolution.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft will seek to cut its 899 million euro ($1.3 billion) antitrust fine in Europe's second-highest court on Tuesday, marking the last chapter of a decade-long battle with EU regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Commission fine, which set a record when it was imposed in 2008, penalized Microsoft for failing to comply with the regulator's order four years earlier to provide information that would allow other products to work with computers running its software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has since taken a more conciliatory approach in its relations with the Commission and rival Google Inc has adopted a similar tone in dealing with an EU regulatory probe of its Internet search practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The hearing is a remnant of the old, aggressive Microsoft. The company has changed their strategy in dealing with the Commission dramatically since then," said lawyer Susanne Zuehlke, a partner at Latham  Watkins in Brussels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have become more cooperative in their own matters. In addition, they have become an active complainant. The Commission has picked up several matters against other companies in line with Microsoft's business objectives," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The hearing, in the EU General Court in Luxembourg, will be watched by companies challenging regulatory fines, among them Intel, which has appealed in EU courts against a 1.06 billion euro penalty imposed by the Commission last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even three years after the decision, the Microsoft fine remains as one of the highest ever imposed worldwide. It is therefore obvious that one key battle will be on whether the fine was excessive," said antitrust lawyer Tobias Caspary, at Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver  Jacobson in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From a legal perspective, a ruling will give some important insights as to what the Commission can do and to what extent it needs fines for failure to comply that significantly exceed the fines for the actual infringement, to have a deterrent effect," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The non-compliance fine was nearly double the original 497 million euro penalty the Commission imposed in 2004 against Microsoft for abusing its dominant position to thwart competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The odds are against Microsoft even though it will argue that it did not get clear instructions from the Commission on how to comply with its decision, Zuehlke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Microsoft wants to win this case in total or in part, they will somehow need to prove that their initial proposals were timely and complied with the decision, or that otherwise the Commission did not afford them due process," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The court will be mindful that the Commission's enforcement credibility is at stake, so unless the Commission made some serious mistakes in the process, the chances for Microsoft for an annulment or even a meaningful reduction of the fine appear fairly slim," Zuehlke said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Rex Merrifield) ($1 = 0.7109 euro)&lt;/p&gt;

      epay, a division of Euronet Worldwide, Inc. (NASDAQ: EEFT) and a leading 
      global prepaid and payments processor in the U.S., today announced the 
      completion of multi-country agreements with Microsoft Corp. covering 
      Europe, the Middle East and Asia-Pacific regions. The agreements enable 
      epay to distribute Microsoft point-of-sale-activated products, including 
      Microsoft Office 2010, across epay&#8217;s worldwide network of over 278,000 
      retailer locations.

      Device) or download the Office 2010 software directly from the Internet. 
      The POSA solution eliminates software installation in favor of a simpler 
      consumer experience and activation process, reducing costs and risk of 
      theft of physical software merchandise, and is more environmentally 
      friendly, thereby significantly reducing packaging and plastic use.

      company and well placed to complement the growth and product development 
      aspirations of Microsoft, and we welcome the opportunity to work with a 
      global brand such as Microsoft.&#8221;

      Content&#8217; opportunity through Point of Sale Activated solutions across 
      the world, kicking off with Office 2010. epay provides Microsoft with

      &#8220;Communication and utility service providers are struggling to address 
      the complexity and immediacy inherent in today&#8217;s new services, products, 
      and customer service. They need to implement systems that support 
      real-time rating, billing, and charging as well as a superior, seamless, 
      and comprehensive next-generation customer care experience,&#8221; said Bob 
      Lento, President, Information Management, Convergys. &#8220;With Convergys 
      CRM, service providers now have an enterprise CRM solution that manages

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI May 23 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley's head of
India equity capital markets  P.V. Krishna is leaving the bank
to join Goldman Sachs as managing director and head of
capital markets in India, IFR reported on Monday.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  COLORADO SPRINGS, CO, May 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Xiotech Corporation, the ISE Company, today announced that Hybrid ISE has
been named the "Breakthrough Product of the Year" and also earned the
"Attendees' Pick" in the Best of TechEd 2011 awards program.

    Produced by Penton Media's Windows IT Pro, SQL Server Magazine,
DevProConnections and SharePointPro, the Best of TechEd 2011 awards
recognize companies who offer innovative products for the industry. The
judges reviewed 334 products and services submitted for the award and
chose 48 finalists to be interviewed at the Microsoft TechEd North
America 2011 conference in Atlanta, Georgia on May 16. Winners were
announced at an invitation-only evening reception at the Georgia Aquarium
in Atlanta, May 18.

    Hybrid ISE was selected for these two awards because it has the best
price/performance of any storage system in the industry. Microsoft tested
Hybrid ISE achieving more than 60,000 IOPS in a single 3U system. Hybrid
ISE intelligently integrates HDDs and SSDs delivering high performance
for any application and workload.

    According to Jason Bovberg, Senior Editor at Windows IT Pro, "One of the
most important aspects of Hybrid ISE is its unique Continuous Adaptive
Data Placement (CADP) technology, which automatically moves data to the
right tier as needed. This breakthrough technology creates the optimal
balance of performance, capacity and price. Everyone is talking about
using SSDs within networked storage systems and for the most part these
solutions have been disappointing. Hybrid ISE is the best implementation
we have seen and we've looked at just about everything that is out there
and that is why it won both of these TechEd awards." In securing the
Attendees' Pick distinction, Bovberg noted it "only confirmed our view
that Hybrid ISE is one stylish, powerful, revolutionary piece of
technology."

    "We're really proud to receive these two prestigious awards in an
impressive field of solutions. The technical rigor and evaluation that
goes into the TechEd awards is validation that we are executing on our
vision," said Steve Sicola, CTO at Xiotech. "We've been successfully
working with Microsoft in a number of ways, including the Partner
Solutions Center. They have continued to test and affirm our value
proposition even in the most demanding environments. The Xiotech team
believes in what we've built and these awards are important because they
are a real testament from an objective third-party expert that is
respected in the market. I have a big smile on my face."

    "We congratulate Microsoft partner Xiotech for achieving these two Best
of TechEd accolades," said David Hayes, Director, Microsoft Partner
Solutions Center. "We are big proponents of Hybrid ISE and have plans to
deploy the system as part of our core platform. We have performed
rigorous testing and the Hybrid ISE performed better than any other
storage system we've tested over the last 3 years. With the MPSC it is
essential that we address the needs of our customers with design
innovations that provide real and quantifiable value. We look forward to
continuing our collaborative efforts with Xiotech to showcase the
performance of Hybrid ISE in this dynamic IT data center environment."

      Visa Launches Travel-Themed Marketing Campaign with New Facebook 
      Application and National Promotion
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) announced today a new travel-themed integrated 
      marketing campaign in the U.S. to reinforce Visa as the preferred&#160;way&#160;to 
      pay for travel. Visa offers cardholders peace of mind in knowing they 
      can use their cards with convenience, security and ease, virtually 
      anywhere in the world, at any time -- ultimately providing greater 
      freedom to enjoy their travel experiences.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The campaign gives travelers&#160;a new tool to share their experiences 
      through the introduction of&#160;a Facebook application, Memory Mapper, which 
      uses Google Maps satellite technology and a consumer&#8217;s own photos, 
      videos and captions to chronicle a visual story of their travels for a 
      unique keepsake to share with friends and family. Additional campaign 
      elements include a national promotion, the Trip of a Lifetime 
      Sweepstakes, featuring a chance to win $100,000 to experience a 
      dream vacation and national television and digital advertising which 
      bring the Memory Mapper to life by profiling one family&#8217;s dream vacation 
      surfing in Tahiti.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Travel planning and booking is inherently an online and increasingly 
      social experience. Consumers turn to friends and others for ideas and 
      recommendations to inspire their travel plans before booking their 
      vacations and then post-trip, they want to share their experiences,&#8221; 
      said Alex Craddock, Head of North America Marketing, Visa Inc. &#8220;Our 
      understanding of how consumers travel today inspired the creation of the 
      social media tool &#8211; Memory Mapper &#8211; to support the promotion and enhance 
      the consumer&#8217;s travel experience from planning to sharing.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Social Media Engagement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Memory Mapper is now available at www.facebook.com/visa 
      for travelers to chronicle and share their memories. With Memory Mapper, 
      consumers are able to upload photos and videos, input the locations in 
      which each image originated, write captions, and add music to create a 
      virtual keepsake of their adventures to share with family and friends 
      via Facebook, email and Twitter. Additional features include exclusive 
      travel-related merchant offers and a public gallery of recently uploaded 
      Memory Maps.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Advertising  Sweepstakes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa is airing a national television commercial in support of the 
      campaign that follows the real-life Igloi family of four as they surf 
      first on the shores of their home state of California and later in 
      Teahupoo, Tahiti while on their own trip of a lifetime. The commercial 
      brings the Memory Mapper to life using satellite map views of each 
      location they visit in combination with photos and video of their dream 
      vacation. The commercial highlights the Trip of a Lifetime Sweepstakes 
      and encourages viewers to visit www.facebook.com/visa 
      to engage further with the campaign.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      From April 27 &#8211; Oct. 31, 2011, Visa cardholders in the United States 
      will automatically be entered for a chance to win $100,000 to embark on 
      their personal trip of a lifetime when they use their Visa card. 
      Official rules for the Trip of a Lifetime Sweepstakes are 
      available at www.facebook.com/visa. 
      No purchase or obligation is necessary to enter or win. The winner will 
      be selected on or around Nov. 14, 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Travelers will also meet the Igloi family in a series of digital videos 
      and banners across social networking channels such as Facebook, Flickr 
      and Photobucket, online travel merchants and services including 
      Orbitz.com, and popular online media channels DailyCandy and Yahoo.com. 
      At each point of engagement, viewers will be encouraged to use their 
      Visa card to enter for a chance to win their personal $100,000 trip of a 
      lifetime and use the Memory Mapper to share their experiences with their 
      social networks.

			Tourism on the Upswing
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Entering the 2011 travel season, the tourism industry is showing signs 
      of strength and regained optimism of travelers both domestically and 
      internationally. Visa&#8217;s recently released Tourism Outlook: USA 
      report showed an increase in the amount spent on travel related 
      purchases made on Visa payment cards abroad in 2010. VisaVue Travel Data 
      from 2009 to 2010 showed that spending by U.S. cardholders traveling 
      internationally increased by six percent, from $29 billion in 2009 to 
      $31 billion in 2010, while spending by international cardholders 
      traveling to the U.S. increased by 18 percent, from $29 billion to more 
      than $34 billion. Additionally, the U.S. Travel Association recently 
      reported domestic and international travelers spent $758.7 billion in 
      the U.S., an increase of 7.7 percent over 2009. Of this total, $655.6 
      billion was spent by domestic travelers (7.4% increase from 2009) and 
      $103.1 billion by international travelers to the U.S. (9.8% increase 
      from 2009).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Tourism Outlook: USA
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa cardholder spending data cited is based upon VisaVue&#174; Travel data, 
      which reviews tourism spending on Visa-branded payment cards by 
      international visitors from key source countries while visiting the 
      United States during the calendar years 2010 (Jan. 1 &#8211; Dec. 31, 2010) 
      and 2009 (Jan. 1 &#8211; Dec. 31, 2009). These findings are based upon 
      VisaVue&#174; Travel data. Visa introduced the VisaVue&#174; Travel tourism 
      reports to a pilot group of U.S. tourism organizations in early 2008 and 
      have continued to produce reports on a variety of popular tourist 
      destinations every year since.

&lt;p&gt;  SCOTTSDALE, AZ, May 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Informative Graphics Corporation (IGC) today announced the launch of two
new solutions: Redact-It Enterprise and Net-It Enterprise for Microsoft
SharePoint 2010. These additions to the IGC product portfolio demonstrate
IGC's commitment to helping companies get the most out of their
SharePoint investment.

    Redact-It Enterprise (RIE) for SharePoint 2010 completely removes
sensitive content from electronic documents for safe, efficient
distribution to courts, the media, customers, vendors or any other
audience not authorized to see the complete content. Built to leverage
the Microsoft SharePoint 2010 platform, RIE can be integrated into an
automated workflow process or can redact content across entire SharePoint
libraries. 

    IGC's rich redaction technology can search for text or patterns like
Social Security numbers or phone numbers, or it can apply a template to
redact specific areas or zones on forms. The easy-to-use interface works
with virtually any format and creates a PDF, TIFF or CSF (Content Secure
Format) rendition of the redacted file, leaving the original document
untouched. RIE assists in regulatory compliance and ensures alignment
with privacy policies.

    Net-It Enterprise (NIE) for SharePoint 2010 converts documents to PDF,
TIFF, or CSF for archiving or sharing read-only versions. NIE can publish
selected pages of a document or add banners and watermarks to a document
for tracking purposes. Build Net-It into your SharePoint workflows, have
it monitor a SharePoint library for new documents to publish, or
configure it so it will publish based on SharePoint metadata. 

    NIE eliminates cumbersome document conversion and publishing by
automating the entire process. It can be used out-of-the-box in
SharePoint or integrated into other SharePoint-based solutions. Net-It
lets you publish an accurate reproduction of your original documents and
assists with internal records management policies.

    "IGC continues its strategic alignment with Microsoft SharePoint by
introducing the integrations of our Redact-It and Net-It Enterprise
products," remarked Gary Heath, IGC's president and CEO. "SharePoint
continues to gain momentum and market share, and our technology makes a
great complement to its customer base."

      infections. The BACcel&#8482; system eliminates culturing and analyzes 
      individual live microbial cells directly from a patient specimen. All 
      specimens came from the lower respiratory tract, used to diagnose 
      pneumonia and other severe lung or bronchial infections. Hospital 
      acquired pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in ICUs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The study targeted three major pathogenic bacterial species responsible 
      for infections multi-drug resistance (MDR). Together, these three 
      species account for more than half of hospital acquired MDR infections. 
      They include Staphylococcus aureus (&#8220;Staph,&#8221; including MRSA), Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter species. The latter two 
      organisms already have high MDR propensity. But investigators are now 
      finding new strains that recently acquired novel, rapidly-spreading 
      &#8220;superbug&#8221; KPC genes from entirely unrelated species.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new ASM study reported that the total time from specimen to results 
      only required 4 hours, instead of the typical 3-day time for 
      cultures using the same specimens. Results included organism counts, 
      identification, and expression of two major resistance types for each 
      one, including MRSA. Identification was correct in 182 of 186 tests, and 
      antibiotic resistance classification in 31 of 32 tests.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second study characterized Accelr8&#8217;s new test for a hidden type of 
      resistance in &#8220;Staph.&#8221; Not only MRSA, but also the more common type of 
      Staph can effectively resist the standard anti-MRSA antibiotic, 
      vancomycin. With a new type of strain known as hVISA, culturing tests 
      indicate susceptibility to vancomycin, but fails to detect subtle 
      indications of low-level resistance that can lead to treatment failure. 
      Microbiologists refer to this type of cryptic behavior as 
      &#8220;heteroresistance.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investigators screened Staph clinical isolates (laboratory strains) 
      and found 15 hVISA using complex culturing methods. The new BACcel&#8482; 
      assay correctly classified 14 of the 15 as hVISA, and 14 of 14 Staph 
      clinical isolates negative for cryptic resistance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Culturing methods to detect hVISA take 3 days or longer, depending on 
      the methods. The BACcel&#8482; system produced results in 4 hours. The test 
      can be used directly from patient specimens, which would add no more 
      than 1 hour to the total processing time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to David Howson, Accelr8&#8217;s president, &#8220;the specimen study used 
      types of specimen that may be the most difficult specimens for a lab to 
      analyze. They are highly variable, and contain large amounts of sticky 
      and bulky interfering materials. In the past, new diagnostic tests that 
      have worked well with cultured strains often failed when challenged 
      directly with respiratory specimens. We believe this study demonstrates 
      that we&#8217;ve overcome this major hurdle. The study also set a new speed 
      record for counting, identifying, and analyzing multiple targets with 
      multiple resistance tests&#8212;only four hours after starting with a 
      specimen. If we consider these results and the results presented a week 
      ago at ATS, the combined data show that the BACcel&#8482; rapid diagnostic 
      system is accurate and very fast.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The hVISA study also follows a presentation three weeks ago at the 
      European ECCMID meeting that used the BACcel&#8482; hVISA test, along with 
      others. The new results add details that more fully characterize the 
      test performance with this difficult new strain. The ASM study 
      demonstrates the BACcel&#8482; system&#8217;s potential for revealing fundamental 
      modes of resistance expression that were neither predicted nor detected 
      using standard culturing methods,&#8221; Howson continued.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These and other tests for multiple organisms and multiple resistance 
      expression modes provide the platform for expanded studies and 
      integration into the next BACcel&#8482; generation. We are now widening our 
      key opinion leader network to prepare for these important studies,&#8221; 
      Howson concluded.

			Vision Solutions Launches New Resilience Capabilities for Virtualised 
      Environments and Microsoft Exchange 2010
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New versions of Double-Take Availability, Double-Take RecoverNow and 
      Double-Take Move offer improved protection and management features for 
      disaster recovery and high availability of virtual, physical and 
      cloud-hosted systems
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Vision 
      Solutions, Inc., a leading provider of information availability 
      software and services with over 25,000 customers running Windows, Linux, 
      IBM Power Systems and Cloud Computing environments, today announced the 
      release of the latest versions of its Double-Take Move, RecoverNow and 
      Availability products. The updates in version 5.3 expand support for 
      virtualised IT environments as well as providing faster and easier 
      installation of disaster recovery solutions for virtual machines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Simplified management and protection for virtual environments - Double-Take
				Availability 5.3 provides the ability to configure the protection 
        of VMs in aggregate without the need to pre-install software on each 
        virtual machine (VM).&#160;Rather than having to install a Double-Take 
        software agent on each VM prior to configuration, version 5.3 allows 
        the administrator to configure protection of VMs at the host level 
        instead.&#160;All the required functionality and agent software is 
        automatically injected into the VM in the background as protection for 
        the VM is configured and started.
      
			
				Improved protection for virtual clusters - For remote 
        availability of workloads based on Microsoft Hyper-V, Double-Take 
        Availability now supports protection of clustered Hyper-V hosts over 
        wide area networks. The integration of Hyper-V clustering and 
        Double-Take real-time replication of data provides unified local 
        availability and remote availability for Hyper-V hosts. As part of 
        this, administrators also have the choice to set the IP address to use 
        on the target side, providing greater flexibility around fail-over.
      
			
				Expanded Microsoft Exchange support - Double-Take Availability 
        5.3
				now supports protection of Exchange 2010 in Database 
        Availability Group (DAG) environments - this is particularly valuable 
        for organisations that want to implement disaster recovery for DAG 
        installations across low-bandwidth environments.&#160;Double-Take 
        RecoverNow 5.3 also enhances its protection of Exchange 2010 by now 
        offering Exchange log file trimming capabilities. This ability to 
        schedule trimming of log files on the production server is coordinated 
        with application consistent recovery points on the repository server 
        for the flexibility to recover from the most recent data or an earlier 
        application-consistent snapshot.
      
			
				Updated OS support - Double-Take 5.3 now supports Microsoft 
        Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 across the Availability, RecoverNow and 
        Move products.
      
			
				Simplified, effective Failback operations - Minimising downtime 
        with an effective availability plan is only half the battle. Getting 
        back to &#8220;how things were&#8221;, or failing back, can be just as stressful, 
        as the process can incur its own downtime.&#160;Double-Take Availability 
        5.3 adds additional capabilities to both full-server failover and VM 
        failover to reduce the potential for downtime during a failback. New 
        within Double-Take 5.3 is support for multi-job failback tasks and 
        enterprise-wide monitoring capabilities.

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 21 (IFR) - Wall Street behemoth Goldman Sachs
has promoted a number of foreigners with years of experience in
Asia to senior investment banking positions, as the firm
continues to pin its hopes on building its franchise in
increasingly important markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Like many of its competitors, Goldman has talked about
building its presence in the developing markets for years. With
regulators pulling the plug on many traditional sources of
profit at home -- from prop trading to over-the-counter
derivatives -- most US houses are now looking abroad as their
primary source of growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We continue to believe that this will be the century of the
BRICs and other growth markets," chief executive Lloyd Blankfein
wrote in Goldman's most recent annual report. He went on to
discuss how 400m people were projected to move to Chinese cities
by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank's appointment of Richard Gnodde, a South African
based in London, to be a co-head of investment banking seems to
tally with that view. Gnodde, who will remain as the co-chief
executive of the firm's international business, has an enormous
depth of global experience following long stints in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His addition to the top tier of the firm's managers should
help Goldman to achieve its aim. Worldly-wise Gnodde takes his
position alongside two Americans, John Weinberg and David
Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AMERICAS STILL EARNINGS BEDROCK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its part, Goldman has boosted its international business
over the years. In 2008, a whopping 70 percent of its revenues
came from the Americas -- mainly the US. Insiders say that at
present about 50 percent of revenues come from abroad, with 30
percent from Europe and 20 percent from Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, most of today's business still comes from the
"developed markets" of Western Europe, North America and Japan.
Since 2006, "growth markets" have contributed only about 12
percent of total revenues, according to a source at the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A move abroad shouldn't just help increase the top line, say
some. According to Jeff Harte, an analyst with Sandler O'Neill,
investment banks don't have to deploy as much capital in
developing markets, since companies in these regions are more
focused on MA and underwriting activity than they are on
capital-intensive trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, given the small size of the revenues that Goldman
generates from developed markets, the bank would require a huge
jump in this business to see a meaningful increase in its return
on equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nevertheless, Goldman has fared reasonably well
internationally, in terms of generating investment banking and
loan fees. In 2010, it ranked number four in Europe, second in
Asia-Pacific, seventh in Japan and 12th in the Middle East and
Africa, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MANAGEMENT NODS TO ASIA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Goldman has plenty of work ahead of it to increase
its business and adjust its focus. In February, the bank
announced that it was doubling the size of the Asia
representation on its 33-person global management committee. The
bank increased it from two members to a mere four.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, in a recognition of the importance of such markets,
the firm recently created a new position -- global head of
growth markets -- and appointed Michael Evans, vice-chairman of
Goldman Sachs and chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia, to the
position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of last Monday's announced reshuffle, Gordon Dyal,
who is the global head of MA, will be leaving that role and
joining Christopher Cole as co-chairman of investment banking.
Dyal, whose career has been mostly in Europe, was named co-head
of investment banking in Europe and became global head of MA in
2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MA SLIPPAGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dyal's move comes at a time when Goldman has slipped on the
global MA ladder. In the first quarter, the bank lost its top
spot to Morgan Stanley, with its market share dropping from 6.6%
to 4.9%. Its financial advisory unit produced US$357m in
revenues in the first quarter, 23% lower than a year earlier 
while the industry-wide decline was 4%.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank also fell from first to fourth in the league tables
during the first quarter based on "announced" worldwide MA
deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, with Dyal switching to co-chair the investment
bank, Goldman has announced two other significant changes. It
has promoted Yoel Zaoui, a Frenchman, and Gene Sykes, an
American, to global co-heads of MA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zaoui joined Goldman in 1988 in MA in New York and moved to
London in 1989. He was appointed co-head of European MA in 1999
and became head of European investment banking in 2004. Sykes
was co-chairman of global MA and is the chairman of global TMT
investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Within the memo announcing the promotions, Goldman CEO Lloyd
Blankfein said that these "important changes reflect the
continued importance and growth of the firm's global client
franchise".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's investment bank generated about 11% of the
company's overall business in the first quarter  compared with
about 56% for sales and trading. However, trading revenues 
with new regulation and the vagaries of the market  are
becoming less reliable. The firm will be hoping its global
ambitions pay off soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   * Three bankers to lead Nordic business in London&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * New hires reporting to de Givenchy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, May 23 (Reuters) - JP Morgan's private banking unit
will announce on Monday it has hired three senior bankers for a
newly created London-based team to focus on ultra-rich clients
in Scandinavia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three new specialists on Sweden, Denmark, Norway and
Finland will report to Olivier de Givenchy, extending his
regional remit from his post as head of JP Morgan Private Bank
in the UK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pontus Aldell joins from Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) where he
was head of Nordic countries and Israel and Stephan Treschow
comes from Carnegie Bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both will be executive directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A third hire to the post of associate banker, Bjorn Bohm,
was previously a relationship manager for the Nordic team at
Credit Suisse, based in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have identified a great growth opportunity in this
region and these appointments truly reflect our commitment to
further developing our presence in the Nordics," de Givenchy
said.

&lt;p&gt; * Assets grow 15 times since Aug launch to $60 mln&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Aims to boost assets to $100 mln by end of 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Fund has returned about 11 percent since launch
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Nishant Kumar	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, May 23 (Reuters) - RSR Capital, a hedge fund
launched by former Goldman Sachs Group Inc and Morgan
Stanley traders, aims to boost assets by more than 60
percent to $100 million this year as its strategy gains investor
favour, said partner Christophe Delorme.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Singapore-based RSR Capital's volatility hedge fund, Caerus
Arbitrage Asia, started trading with $4 million in August last
year and now manages about $60 million, said Delorme, former
head of Japanese over-the-counter multi-products at Newedge
Group.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volatility, the rate of change in the price of an asset, has
an inverse relationship with price. Funds such as the one from
RSR Capital tend to do well when markets are falling as
volatility increases.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caerus Arbitrage Asia gained 4.4 percent in March, its
highest monthly return, as markets fell following unrest in
North Africa and Japan's earthquake.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By comparison, hedge fund on an average returned 1.1 percent
in March, according to data from industry tracker Eurekahedge.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are expecting more shocks than that, not coming from
events like this one, but economic events," Delorme told Reuters
in a telephone interview.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said it was a good time to bet on the strategy as issues
in the Middle East and sovereign debt crisis in Europe were not
resolved and "you don't know what's going top happen after QE
(quantitative easing)."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are just getting prepared because we think the big shock
could happen tomorrow or it could happen in six months," he
said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RSR Capital's other partners are Remi Colinmaire, former
head of index volatility trading in London and Tokyo at Goldman
Sachs, Serge Handjian, former head of equity derivatives in
Tokyo at Barclays Capital and Robert Webb, who ran
Asian index option trading for Morgan Stanley.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund, which counts fund of hedge funds among its major
investors, has gained about 11 percent since its launch in
August and aims to deliver 20 to 25 percent per year.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It follows multiple strategies such as mean reverting and
pattern recognition and plans to cap at $500 million.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think for that strategy, the amount of the money is
maximum. We think the market can only hold $400-500 million,"
Delorme added.

&lt;p&gt;  PITTSBURGH, PA, May 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
HWI Global, Inc., the Pittsburgh-based clean room design builder, (OTCBB:
IVTW) reports commencing construction of a Class 10,000 Life Science
clean room at Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Springs,
MD, under the direction of the United States Army Corps of Engineers.

    The project includes four separate clean room work zones within the
designated space. An ISO 7 Clean Work Room will house two Bio-Safety
Cabinets and two Incubators, as well as an ISO 8 Centrifuge Clean Room.
HWI will install its proprietary Bio-Gard Modular Wall System; an
aseptic, high-impact, Class 1/A bio-pharmaceutical wall system with
heat-welded seams; and the complete air handling and control system. 

    Deric Haddad, CEO, HWI Global states, "This contract has been on hold
since 2010 due to coordination and occupancy delays. It is the ideal
project for our proprietary Bio-Gard Modular Wall System. Composed of
upgraded uPVC, the Bio-Gard is an extremely aseptic high-impact, finished
surface with heat-welded seams. Unlike the pristine walls in other
systems that can't even hold up to low-impact interfacing with busy
technicians, Bio-Gard is perfect for the prominent pharmaceutical
facilities -- like Amgen, Wyeth, Merck, and others. The bio-pharma
industry should take note of the innovative and resilient Bio-Gard system
about to be placed in Walter Reed."

    HWI Global was chosen for this project by FLAD Architects, and Affiliated
Engineers, both life science specialists located in Gainesville FL. HWI
Global has entered into a subcontract with Rockville, MD-based general
contractor John J. Kirlin for the Walter Reed assignment.

			Pfizer Announces Detailed Results Of ORAL Sync Showing 
      Investigational Compound Tofacitinib Reduces Signs And Symptoms And 
      Improves Physical Function In Patients With Moderate-To-Severe Active 
      Rheumatoid Arthritis, With Results Seen As Early As Two Weeks
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer Also Presents Results of a Separate Phase 2 Trial, Study 
      A3921109, Evaluating Atorvastatin in Patients with Moderate-to-Severe 
      Active Rheumatoid Arthritis Taking Tofacitinib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Data to Be Presented at 12th 
      Annual Congress of the European League Against Rheumatism in London
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today announced data from ORAL Sync (A3921046) 
      and Study A3921109, two clinical trials of tofacitinib (development 
      code: CP-690,550), an investigational, novel, oral JAK inhibitor, being 
      studied in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Top-line results of ORAL Sync, a 
      pivotal Phase 3 trial, were announced earlier this year. A separate 
      trial, Study A3921109, evaluated the safety and efficacy of atorvastatin 
      versus placebo in reducing LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) in moderate-to-severe 
      active RA patients taking tofacitinib. Detailed results of these studies 
      are being presented as late-breaking abstracts at the 12th 
      Annual Congress of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The results of ORAL Sync are encouraging, with tofacitinib plus 
      background traditional DMARDs showing clinically meaningful reductions 
      in the signs and symptoms of RA with statistically significant 
      separation from placebo at both doses by the second week of treatment,&#8221; 
      said Joel M. Kremer, M.D., head of the Division of Rheumatology at 
      Albany Medical College and director of research of The Center for 
      Rheumatology in Albany, New York.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ORAL Sync Trial Design and Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ORAL Sync is a completed 12-month Phase 3 study that enrolled 792 
      patients with moderate-to-severe active RA who had a previous inadequate 
      response to a traditional or biologic disease- modifying anti-rheumatic 
      drug (DMARD) and were randomized to receive tofacitinib 5 mg or 10 mg 
      twice a day (BID) or placebo added to background traditional DMARD(s), 
      including methotrexate (MTX). At Month 3, non-responder placebo patients 
      were advanced to tofacitinib 5 or 10 mg BID. At Month 6, the remaining 
      placebo patients were advanced to tofacitinib.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ORAL Sync met its primary efficacy endpoints by showing statistically 
      significant changes versus placebo in reducing signs and symptoms of RA, 
      as measured by ACR20 response rates at six months; in improving physical 
      function, as measured by mean change in HAQ-DI at three months; and in 
      reaching DAS 28-4(ESR) 2.6 (DAS-defined remission) at six months. See

      Onset of action, as measured by statistically significant ACR20 or 
      HAQ-DI responses versus placebo, was seen by Week 2.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In ORAL Sync, a comparable incidence of adverse events (AEs) and serious 
      adverse events (SAEs) was seen across treatment groups during Months 0-3 
      and the incidence of these events did not appear to increase thereafter. 
      There was a higher incidence of discontinuations due to AEs in 
      tofacitinib treatment groups over Months 0-6. See details in the table 
      below. The majority of AEs were mild and the most frequently reported 
      class of AEs throughout the study was infections and infestations. 
      Serious infectious events (SIEs) were reported for two (5 mg BID) and 
      four (10 mg BID) patients in Months 0-3 and one patient each in the 
      placebo-to-5 mg BID and placebo-to-10 mg BID groups during Months 3-6. 
      There were four deaths, one of which was assessed by the investigator as 
      study drug related, and four opportunistic infections in the study (all 
      events in the tofacitinib treatment groups).

      Among patients treated with tofacitinib, dose-dependent decreases in 
      mean neutrophil counts and increases in mean LDL, HDL and total 
      cholesterol were observed. Most cases of neutropenia were mild and there 
      were no cases of life-threatening neutropenia. Changes in neutrophils 
      and lipids were observed during Months 0-3 and stabilized thereafter. 
      Transaminase increases and small increases in serum creatinine were also 
      observed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer is encouraged by the efficacy and safety findings from ORAL 
      Sync, which showed that tofacitinib may be an oral option for patients 
      not responding adequately to traditional DMARDs,&#8221; said Yvonne 
      Greenstreet, senior vice president and head of the Medicines Development 
      Group for Pfizer&#8217;s Specialty Care Business Unit.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Study A3921109 Trial Design and Results
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Study A3921109 is a completed 12-week Phase 2 study that enrolled 111 
      patients to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atorvastatin treatment 
      versus placebo in reducing LDL-C in RA patients taking tofacitinib. 
      After receiving 10 mg BID tofacitinib open-label for six weeks, patients 
      were randomized to receive atorvastatin 10 mg once daily (50 patients) 
      or placebo (47 patients) in a double-blind manner in addition to 
      open-label tofacitinib 10 mg BID for six weeks. Concomitant MTX or other 
      background DMARDs were not allowed. The primary endpoint of the study 
      was the percent change in mean LDL-C from baseline (Week 6) to Week 12.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In patients on tofacitinib, the addition of atorvastatin 10 mg resulted 
      in a statistically significant 35 percent reduction in mean LDL-C 
      compared to a 5.8 percent increase in LDL-C in the placebo group at Week 
      12, with median LDL-C achieved in the ATP-III optimal target range (100 
      mg/dL) in the atorvastatin group at Week 12. The ATP-III (Adult 
      Treatment Panel) are guidelines developed by the National 
      Heart, Lung and Blood Institute to evaluate target blood cholesterol 
      levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The median LDL-C level increased at Week 6 after treatment with 
      tofacitinib in both groups and then decreased after randomization in the 
      atorvastatin group to values below tofacitinib pre-treatment levels. A 
      similar pattern was observed in apolipoprotein B, triglycerides and 
      total cholesterol levels, with decreases to below pre-treatment levels. 
      HDL-C and apolipoprotein A-1 increased with tofacitinib treatment and 
      continued to trend upward during the last six weeks of the study 
      regardless of treatment group.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After six weeks of tofacitinib treatment, 76 percent of patients 
      exhibited ACR20 response. By Week 12, the atorvastatin group had an 
      ACR20 response rate of 82.6 percent versus the placebo group with 65.2 
      percent. Given the size of the study, the significance of a higher 
      numeric ACR score in the atorvastatin group is unclear.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The safety profile of tofacitinib in this study was similar to that seen 
      in other studies of tofacitinib in patients with RA and no significant 
      differences were seen between treatment groups, including effect on 
      serum transaminases. The most common classes of treatment emergent AEs 
      throughout the study were infections/infestations and gastrointestinal 
      disorders. Three SAEs were reported during the course of the study, one 
      case each of pneumonia, right hip arthritis aggravation and bacterial 
      pneumonia. None of these cases occurred in patients receiving 
      atorvastatin.

			About Rheumatoid Arthritis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease that 
      typically affects the hands and feet, although any joint lined by a 
      synovial membrane may be affected. RA affects approximately 1.3 million 
      people in the U.S. 1 and one percent of the adult population 
      worldwide.2
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Tofacitinib
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tofacitinib is a novel, oral Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor that is being 
      investigated as a targeted immunomodulator and disease-modifying therapy 
      for RA. More than 4,000 RA patients have been treated with tofacitinib 
      in clinical trials to date. Unlike more recent therapies for RA, which 
      are directed at extracellular targets such as pro-inflammatory 
      cytokines, tofacitinib takes a novel approach, targeting the 
      intracellular signaling pathways that operate as hubs in the 
      inflammatory cytokine network.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer is studying tofacitinib for RA in the Phase 3 ORAL (Oral 
      Rheumatoid Arthritis 
      Phase 3 TriaLs) program at more than 350 
      locations in 35 countries worldwide. The ORAL Trials program consists of 
      five completed pivotal trials and one ongoing Phase 3 trial. In 
      addition, tofacitinib is being investigated in an ongoing long-term 
      open-label treatment study.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer is also studying orally administered tofacitinib in psoriasis, 
      inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn&#8217;s disease and ulcerative colitis) and 
      renal transplant, and topical tofacitinib in both psoriasis and dry eye 
      disease.

			Important U.S. Prescribing Information for Lipitor (atorvastatin 
      calcium)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LIPITOR is a prescription medicine that is used along with a low-fat 
      diet, and when diet and exercise are not enough to lower the LDL ("bad" 
      cholesterol) and triglycerides in your blood. It can raise HDL ("good" 
      cholesterol) as well. LIPITOR can lower the risk for heart attack, 
      stroke, certain types of heart surgery, and chest pain in patients who 
      have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease such as age, 
      smoking, high blood pressure, low HDL, or family history of early heart 
      disease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LIPITOR can lower the risk for heart attack or stroke in patients with 
      diabetes and risk factors such as diabetic eye or kidney problems, 
      smoking, or high blood pressure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LIPITOR is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. 
      And it is not for women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Patients taking LIPITOR should tell their doctor if they feel any new 
      muscle pain or weakness. This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle 
      side effects. Patients should tell their doctor about all medications 
      they take. This may help avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should 
      do blood tests to check your liver function before and during treatment 
      and may adjust the dose. Common side effects are diarrhea, upset 
      stomach, muscle and joint pain, and changes in some blood tests.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Safety of tofacitinib pill in spotlight at London meeting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Drug's efficacy "in same ballpark" as anti-TNF injections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ben Hirschler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - Four deaths during a study of
Pfizer's (PFE.N) new rheumatoid arthritis pill will be pored
over at a medical meeting in London this week, as doctors weigh
the drug's chances of upending current clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tofacitinib is Pfizer's biggest pipeline hope and could
become the first major new medicine to come from its own labs
since Viagra more than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has the potential to disrupt the rheumatoid arthritis
market -- currently dominated by multibillion-dollar injections
-- by offering patients a more convenient twice-daily tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the experimental drug's prospects have been clouded by
safety worries following news that four patients died after
taking it in a late-stage Phase III study. [ID:nN21295734]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel Kremer of Albany Medical College, the primary
investigator for the study, told Reuters that this number of
deaths was not unusual, given the profile of patients involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer itself said last month that three of the deaths were
determined by local investigators not to be study related,
leaving just one case of a 58-year-old U.S. patient with
respiratory infection linked to the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But deciding causality is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kremer said it seemed clear two of the other deaths -- one
due to brain trauma and one caused by heart failure in a Chinese
patient with valvular disease -- were not linked to tofacitinib,
but the case of a 48-year-old Russian patient was less certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Russian patient, on the lower 5 milligram dose of the
drug, died 42 days after discontinuing treatment from a
respiratory complication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's unlikely that two of the four were associated (with
tofacitinib). It's possible that the other two of the four were
associated, but based upon the information I have it's
impossible to say with absolute certainty," Kremer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results of the study will be laid out at a news conference
on Wednesday, ahead of presentation to the annual meeting of the
European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Headline findings in March already declared the trial a
success and Kremer said the drug's effectiveness was "in the
same ballpark" as injected biotech drugs, such as Abbott's
(ABT.N) $6.5 billion-a-year blockbuster Humira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 792-patient trial tested two doses of tofacitinib
against placebo in people with rheumatoid arthritis who failed
to respond to an existing disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Significant and sustained responses were seen within a few
weeks and, after six months, 58.3 percent of patients on the
higher 10 mg dose had a 20 percent improvement in symptoms, such
as swollen joints, pain and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MONITORING SAFETY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Georg Schett, head of rheumatology and immunology at the
University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and a member of EULAR's
scientific committee, who was not involved in the research, said
tofacitinib looked promising but safety was a critical factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The key issue from this data is that safety has to be
carefully monitored -- also when the drug is approved," he said
in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "It's clear that you have to be careful about a drop in
white blood cell counts, which is usually mild but can lead to
increased rates of infection, and also increased lipid levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Infection risk and raised cholesterol -- a potential problem
for heart safety -- are among the drug's known side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer hopes to capture a large chunk of the arthritis
market with its so-called JAK inhibitor pill, which works by
blocking signals from entering cells that would activate
inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, have forecast annual tofacitinib sales
of $1.1 billion by 2015, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It should be filed for approval by the end of 2011 and
Pfizer believes it has a healthy lead over rivals. "We are one
phase ahead and that usually translates to about two years,"
said Saeed Fatenejad, head of inflammation drug development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the U.S. drugmaker has its work cut out to displace
successful injected drugs like Humira, Johnson  Johnson's
(JNJ.N) Remicade and Amgen's (AMGN.O) Enbrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, other companies are chasing Pfizer with rival JAK
inhibitors and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) also has another kind of oral
arthritis drug in development called a SYK inhibitor.

 NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - U.S. crude futures rebounded
nearly 2 percent on Tuesday after Goldman Sachs lifted its
price forecast on Brent crude, the dollar weakened and economic
data showed rising sales of U.S. single-family homes.

 Trading was choppy, with gains pared around midday after
after front-month July contract CLN1 hit a session high of
$100.09 a barrel, which provoked some profit-taking.

 June RBOB gasoline futures RBM1 also lent some support to
crude futures, rising above $3 a gallon early, then paring
gains on news that Irving Oil of Canada had restarted a
gasoline unit, which was shut down earlier this week. The
shutdown had lifted June gasoline initially on Monday.

 Traders were refocusing on weekly inventory data, forecast
to show that domestic crude stocks fell 1.3 million barrels
last week, a Reuters poll of analysts showed. [EIA/S]

 Distillate stocks were forecast up 100,000 barrels and
gasoline supplies up 300,000 barrels, the poll showed.

 The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it charged
oil trader Arcadia and Parnon Energy and two of their senior
traders in a civil complaint with artificially driving up crude
oil prices three years ago, netting illegal gains of more than
$50 million. [ID:nN24273712]

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil rose 2 percent on Tuesday in choppy trading after Goldman Sachs raised its price forecasts for Brent crude, saying demand from economic growth will eat into stockpiles and OPEC spare capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman raised its Brent price forecast to $115, $120 and $130 a barrel on a three-, six-, and 12-month horizon and boosted its year-end target for Brent to $120 per barrel from $105 and its 2012 forecast to $140 from $120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A weaker dollar also supported oil prices, which had declined 2 percent the previous session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The euro edged up from a two-year low against the dollar on German data that was better than expected, though nagging fears about Europe's debt crisis were expected to check euro gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent crude for July delivery rose $2.43 to settle at $112.53 a barrel, having swung between $109.50 and $112.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. July crude rose $1.89 to settle at $99.59 a barrel, having pushed intraday as high as $100.09 and ending above its 100-day moving average of $98.80.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude futures trading volumes remained tepid, with total U.S. volumes 23 percent below and Brent volumes 18 percent under their 30-day averages, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Data showing U.S. home sales rose in April was supportive to the market, in addition to the buying encouragement prompted by the Goldman Sachs forecast for higher Brent crude prices," said Joe Posillico, broker at MF Global in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New U.S. single-family home sales rose a second straight month in April, but an overhang of previously owned homes was expected to limit any market recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The view that the U.S. economy is mired in a soft patch was reinforced by a Richmond Federal Reserve survey showing central Atlantic region manufacturing activity stalled in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil prices showed little immediate reaction to news the United States announced new sanctions on OPEC-member Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA and six other smaller oil and shipping companies for trading with Iran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sanctions are narrowly targeted and will not affect PDVSA's sales of oil to the United States or the activities of its subsidiaries including U.S.-based CITGO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. front-month June gasoline and heating oil futures helped lead the complex up early and posted higher settlements, though gains were pared when trade sources said a gasoline-making unit at Irving Oil's Canadian refinery had restarted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also curbing gasoline gains was a report that U.S. retail gasoline demand fell last week against both the previous week and the year-ago period, even as fuel prices began to recede, according to a MasterCard report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN PRICE TARGET SHIFTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs in April predicted a sharp oil price correction that materialized the first week of May, then issued a note in early May saying oil could surpass recent highs by 2012, before issuing raised targets for Brent on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley on Tuesday also raised its Brent crude price forecast for 2011 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing improved demand coupled with production lost to Libya's conflict, Morgan Stanley raised its 2011 Brent crude price forecast to $120 per barrel from $100 a barrel, and its 2012 forecast to $130 from $105.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. OIL INVENTORIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude oil inventories fell 860,000 barrels last week, according to the weekly report from the industry group American Petroleum Institute, released late on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude stocks increased slightly at the key Cushing, Oklahoma, hub, but gasoline stocks rose 2.4 million barrels and distillate stockpiles fell 846,000 barrels, the API said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil prices pared gains slightly after the report in post-settlement trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the report, a Reuters poll of analysts yielded a forecast for U.S. crude stocks to have fallen 1.3 million barrels. Distillate stocks were expected to be near flat, up only 100,000 barrels, while gasoline stockpiles were estimated to be up by 300,000 barrels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The weekly inventory report from the U.S. Energy Information Administration will follow on Wednesday at 10:30 a.m. EDT (1430 GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gene Ramos in New York and Simon Falush and Christopher Johnson in London; Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York City may be perceived as the capital of the world, and to make it the true shopping mecca, one luxury executive wants the U.S. government to make it easier for foreign visitors to come and spend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saks Inc SKS.N Chief Executive Steve Sadove said that his chain of department stores is at a disadvantage compared with its European counterparts because of tough tourist visa rules that are keeping out many travelers with voracious appetites for designer gowns, $8,000 handbags and Armani suits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International tourism makes up from 5 to 10 percent of Saks' total sales, but is even more important to its flagship store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue, which accounts for one-fifth of sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you go to Paris, to Galeries Lafayette and Printemps, you go to London, you go to Harrod's, the Asian tourists, the Brazilian tourists, the Russian tourists are very brand-conscious, very luxury-focused," Sadove said at the Reuters Global Luxury and Fashion Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Europeans and Canadians get visa waivers when they visit as tourists, but citizens of most countries need visas, a process that can be expensive and take weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saks operates 46 full-service department stores and 57 factory outlets. In its first quarter, it reported a 10.2 percent sales gain at its stores open for at least a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But that could be higher if the United States eased its rules for Chinese, Russian and Brazilian tourists, Sadove said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They would clearly love to see the U.S. cities as much as some of the European cities," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese consumers are expected to fuel global luxury spending and account for about 25 percent in worldwide sales within 10 or 15 years, and spend much of that abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, they spent a total of $3.8 billion in the United States, up 38 percent from a year earlier, according to the U.S. State Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sadove said New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg was sympathetic and that Saks, along with other retailers, has lobbied the White House and U.S. State Department through the National Retail Federation, an industry group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Sadove said that tourism is not a decisive factor to his business' success, a more welcoming visa system could help sales by a few percentage points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Chinese love brands, and they travel, too," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Phil Wahba, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Oil jumped about 2 percent on Tuesday after Goldman Sachs forecast robust fuel demand growth, while the euro pulled away from a two-month low against the dollar on better-than-expected German data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nagging euro zone debt fears kept market sentiment fragile, however, curbing gains in the euro and driving gold prices to a 20-day high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, one of the most influential institutions in the global oil spot market, raised its 12-month price forecast for Brent crude to $130 a barrel, citing global economic growth and tight OPEC spare capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors are realizing that, at the end of the day, there's more demand for commodities than there is supply. That means the long-term trend is higher," said Oliver Pursche, president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services in Suffern, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude oil ended up 1.89 percent at $99.59 a barrel, while Brent crude rose 2 percent to $112.53 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy-related shares gained with oil prices and provided a small boost to global equities, driving the MSCI All-Country World index .MIWD00000PUS 0.26 percent higher, a day after it dropped 1.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares closed up 0.2 percent, though it remained 0.28 percent lower for the year to date.

 By Walter Brandimarte

 NEW YORK, May 24 (Reuters) - Oil jumped about 2 percent on
Tuesday after Goldman Sachs forecast robust fuel demand growth,
while the euro pulled away from a two-month low against the
dollar on better-than-expected German data.

 Nagging euro zone debt fears kept market sentiment fragile,
however, curbing gains in the euro and driving gold prices to a
20-day high.

 Goldman Sachs, one of the most influential institutions in
the global oil spot market, raised its 12-month price forecast
for Brent crude to $130 a barrel, citing global economic growth
and tight OPEC spare capacity. For details, see
[ID:nL3E7GO153]

 "Investors are realizing that, at the end of the day,
there's more demand for commodities than there is supply. That
means the long-term trend is higher," said Oliver Pursche,
president at Gary Goldberg Financial Services in Suffern, New
York.

 U.S. crude oil CLc1 ended up 1.89 percent at $99.59 a
barrel, while Brent crude LCOc1 rose 2 percent to $112.53 a
barrel.

 Energy-related shares gained with oil prices and provided a
small boost to global equities, driving the MSCI All-Country
World index .MIWD00000PUS 0.26 percent higher, a day after it
dropped 1.8 percent.

 The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European shares
closed up 0.2 percent, though it remained 0.28 percent lower
for the year to date. Miners were among the biggest gainers.

 Energy shares also rose on Wall Street, but key U.S. stock
indexes fell with technology and industrial shares, as concerns
about the U.S. economic recovery still haunted investors.

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended down 25.05
points, or 0.20 percent, at 12,356.21, while the Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX dipped 1.09 points, or 0.08 percent, to
end at 1,316.28. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 12.74
points, or 0.46 percent, at 2,746.16.

 The U.S. stock market had closed at its lowest in a month
on Monday.

 A Reuters poll of top financial institutions found that
economists have cut back their expectations for U.S. economic
growth this year. For details, see [ID:nN2439520]

 The median of forecasts from economists at 18 of 20 primary
dealers was for an annualized gross domestic product growth of
2.85 percent this year, down from a median of 2.95 percent in a
similar poll on April 1.

 "There isn't much for the market to get excited (about) at
this point, especially going into summer months and the QE
coming to an end soon," said Randy Frederick, director of
trading and derivatives at the Schwab Center for Financial
Research in Austin, Texas.

 Next month's end of the Federal Reserve's massive
bond-buying program, also known as quantitative easing, or QE2,
is expected to weigh on stocks and the euro, a Reuters poll
showed last week. [ID:nSLAJGE7U1]

 EURO RECOVERS

 The euro EUR= rose as high as $1.4133, a day after
touching a two-month low against the dollar, as data showed
German business morale held steady in May. Most economists
polled by Reuters had expected a decline in the index of
consumer confidence from the Munich-based Ifo think-tank.

 The euro's gains were said to be contained by concerns
about the impact of a possible debt default by Greece in other
peripheral euro-zone economies.

 Monday's sell-off of the euro followed another credit
downgrade of Greece, a ratings warning about Italy and a
Spanish voter revolt against austerity measures designed to
address the country's debt. [ID:nLDE74M0V7]

 Underscoring those risks, Moody's Investors Service said on
Tuesday a debt default by Greece could knock the ratings of
Portugal and Ireland into junk territory. [ID:nLDE74N0AQ]

 "A Greek default would be highly destabilizing and would
have implications for the creditworthiness of issuers across
Europe," Moody's EMEA chief credit officer Alastair Wilson told
Reuters.

 Gold prices XAU= rose on concerns about the euro-zone
debt crisis spreading, hitting a high of $1,527.45 an ounce,
its highest since May 4. It was later bid at $1,525.49 an
ounce, or 0.6 percent higher on the day.

 Silver XAG=, considered an cheaper safe-haven option,
jumped 4.4 percent to $36.59 an ounce.

 U.S. Treasury debt prices erased early losses after an
auction of $35 billion of two-year notes found solid demand.
Benchmark 10-year Treasury notes were up 2/32 in price, with
their yield at 3.1194 percent.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 24 (Reuters) - Brent crude oil futures
settled more than 2 percent higher on Tuesday, rebounding after
a bullish price forecast from Goldman Sachs and as a weaker
dollar attracted buyers to commodities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In London, ICE July Brent crude LCON1 settled at $112.53
a barrel, gaining $2.43, or 2.21 percent, after trading between
$109.50 and $112.65.

			AMC Theatres&#174; Teams with the Coca-Cola&#174; 
      Company and Nestl&#233; Dreyer&#8217;s Ice Cream Company to Cool off Guests This 
      Summer with Coca-Cola Floats
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Refreshing Coca-Cola and Vanilla Ice Cream Now Co-Starring at Select 
      AMC Theatres
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visitors to AMC Theatres, a leading theatrical exhibition and 
      entertainment company, will now notice a new star at the concession 
      stand &#8211; Coca-Cola Floats, featuring refreshing Coca-Cola and vanilla ice 
      cream from Nestl&#233; Dreyer&#8217;s Ice Cream Company. The new beverage choice &#8211; 
      exclusive to AMC Theaters &#8211; will offer moviegoers a refreshing 
      complement to the action, drama and romance that will light up movie 
      screens all summer long.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As we considered how to expand our beverage lineup and give our guests 
      even more options, a classic float featuring Coca-Cola with vanilla ice 
      cream provided by Nestl&#233; Dreyer&#8217;s Foodservice was a natural fit,&#8221; said 
      George Patterson, senior vice president of food and beverage at AMC 
      Theatres. &#8220;We think the Coca-Cola Float will appeal to guests of all 
      ages. The delicious taste, the memories it conjures and the feel of the 
      nostalgic cup in their hand will most certainly add to the movie-going 
      experience this summer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Float will pair refreshing Coca-Cola with custom-made, 
      single-serve vanilla ice cream in a 32-ounce cup specifically designed 
      to for this unique treat.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Few things are more fun than enjoying the latest summer movie with an 
      ice cold Coca-Cola in hand, unless that Coke is combined with vanilla 
      ice cream,&#8221; said Stefanie Miller, Group Vice President, Strategic 
      Partnership Marketing, Coca-Cola Refreshments. &#8220;We can&#8217;t think of a 
      better way to open summertime happiness than heading to your local AMC 
      Theater with family and friends and treating yourself to a vanilla 
      Coca-Cola Float.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The opportunity to partner with a leader in theatre concessions like 
      AMC Theatres is a natural fit for Nestl&#233; Dreyer&#8217;s Ice Cream Company. We 
      look forward to working with AMC to continuously develop new and 
      exciting frozen dessert opportunities that excite its guests,&#8221; said

      Foodservice brand.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 24 (Reuters) - U.S. crude oil futures
rebounded on Tuesday on the back of Goldman Sach's bullish
price forecasts, a weaker dollar and supportive economic data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Trading was choppy, with gains pared around midday after
front-month July CLN1 hit a session high of $100.09 a barrel,
which provoked some profit-taking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the New York Mercantile Exchange, July crude settled at
$99.59, gaining $1.89. or 1.93 percent. Early in the day, it
traded as low as $96.61.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp will resubmit plans for an upgrade of its San Francisco Bay refinery after a California court blocked it about two years ago because of shortcomings in the environmental-impact review.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron will seek to address concerns about pollution.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp launched an update of its Windows phone software on Tuesday, hoping a host of new features will help it close the gap on smartphone leaders Google Inc and Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The updated software, code-named Mango, will appear on new Windows phones beginning this autumn, and be available for existing Windows phone users before that, although Microsoft has not set a timetable for making the update available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update -- announced eight months after the launch of Windows Phone 7 -- involves 500 new features, including Internet Explorer 9 as the mobile browser, integrated Twitter and LinkedIn feeds, automated Facebook check-ins, and access to more than 17,000 downloadable applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The update improves Microsoft's distinctive "live tiles", which allow users to see real-time information on the phone screen without actually opening an application, and allows more than one application to run at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said Acer Inc, Fujitsu Ltd and ZTE Corp were planning to bring new Windows phone devices to market, joining established handset makers Samsung Electronics, HTC Corp and LG Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new Windows phone handsets will be exclusively powered by Qualcomm Inc's second-generation Snapdragon mobile processors, the chip-maker said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is banking on the new version of its phone software to get its recent alliance with Nokia off to a strong start. The first phones made by Nokia using Windows software are expected late this year or early in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two have some work to do to catch up with Google's Android, which now runs 36 percent of smartphones sold globally, followed by Apple with 17 percent, according to research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last quarter, Microsoft held only 4 percent of the smartphone operating system market, but was looking to convert the 27 percent market share held by Nokia's Symbian, which will be replaced by the Windows system in most of Nokia's new phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms ExxonMobil's IDR at 'AAA'; Outlook Remains Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings of Exxon Mobil 
      Corporation (ExxonMobil):
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AAA';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'AAA';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper at 'F1+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR at 'F1+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has also assigned an 'AAA' to the long-term IDR and senior 
      unsecured ratings of XTO, following the closing of the XTO transaction 
      and ExxonMobil's guarantee of that debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings reflect the unsurpassed breadth and quality of ExxonMobil's 
      asset portfolio and its strong competitive position in all parts of the 
      integrated oil chain; its relatively heavy exposure to liquids in the 
      upstream; disciplined focus on generating high returns on capital 
      employed (ROCEs) with very low levels of financial leverage; strong cash 
      flow generation and a record of maintaining the highest levels of credit 
      quality throughout previous hydrocarbon price cycles; as well as the 
      strategic value the rating confers on the company in negotiations with 
      partners in long-term deals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the close of the XTO acquisition and assumption of related 
      debt, ExxonMobil's gross debt doubled to $20.43 billion at June 30, 
      2010. However, gross debt has since fallen to $15.88 billion (just $3.04 
      billion in net debt on an asset base of $319.53 billion),following debt 
      retirement in the fourth quarter of last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As calculated by Fitch, ExxonMobil's latest upstream operational metrics 
      were robust. Consolidated reserves rose to 17.22 billion barrels of 
      equivalent (boe) at year-end 2010 versus 14.96 billion boe the year 
      prior, an increase of 15.1%. Reserves including equity affiliates 
      increased 7.9% year-over-year to 24.81 billion boe from 22.98 billion 
      boe. The largest single source of reserve adds came from the XTO 
      acquisition. As calculated by Fitch, the company's all-in consolidated 
      one- and three-year reserve replacement ratios (RRR) were 283% and 192%, 
      well above the levels seen in recent years. One- and three-year FDA was 
      $20.24/boe and $15.53/boe in 2010, which compares favorably to North 
      American peers. ExxonMobil's 2010 reserves-to-production (R/P) ratio 
      rose to 14.4 years, while proven developed reserves comprised 60.4% of 
      consolidated reserves. Consistent with other supermajors, liquids 
      continue to comprise a majority of the firm's output (54.5%), although 
      this was down from levels seen the previous year (60.7%)due to the 
      addition of gas-heavy XTO.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company's credit metrics continue to be among the strongest across 
      all peers, consistent with its current 'AAA' rating. As calculated by 
      Fitch, at year-end (YE) 2010, total debt/boe proven (1p) reserves was 
      just $0.87/boe versus $0.64/boe the year prior. EP debt/boe proven 
      developed reserves (excludes equity affiliate reserves and asset 
      retirement obligation [ARO] and allocates 28% of debt to other 
      operations) was just $1.04/boe. For the 12-month period ending March 31, 
      2011, ExxonMobil generated EBITDA of $62.44 billion and total debt of 
      $15.87 billion, resulting in debt/EBITDA leverage of just 0.25 times 
      (x), EBITDA/gross interest coverage of 81.6x, and free cash flow (FCF) 
      of $15.36 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil's liquidity remains very strong and is provided mainly by 
      internally generated cash flows and existing cash balances. At the end 
      of the first quarter, cash and equivalents were $12.83 billion versus 
      gross debt of $15.88 billion, resulting in net debt of $3.04 billion. At 
      Dec. 31, 2010, ExxonMobil had unused short-term uncommitted credit lines 
      of $5.6 billion, of which $2.8 billion was available to support its 
      commercial paper program. FCF was $15.36 billion. The company's large 
      and flexible share buyback program (averaging $23.5 billion per year in 
      buybacks from 2005-2010) is also a key source of financial flexibility, 
      as the company can and does dial the program up and down in line with 
      spending and FCF levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil's pending debt maturity schedule at March 31, 2011 is light 
      and includes nothing due in 2011, $3.22 billion in 2012, $1.02 billion 
      in 2013, and $622 million in 2014. Other obligations are manageable. The 
      company's ARO rose to $9.61 billion at YE 2010, up primarily due to the 
      incurrence of new liabilities as well as revisions in cost estimates. 
      The underfunded status on ExxonMobil's multiple pension plans rose to 
      $13.13 billion at YE 2010 but remains very manageable when scaled to 
      underlying cash flows. Expected pension contributions in 2011 are $1.4 
      billion. Operating lease expense totaled $3.76 billion in 2010 and 
      covered drilling equipment, tankers, service stations, and other 
      properties. Derivatives exposure is limited, and the company had a net 
      derivative asset of $168 million on its books at March 31, 2011, 
      including remaining XTO gas price hedges which have not yet rolled off.

			ROAM Data Adopts New Visa Mobile Payment Security Best Practices
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mobile Payment Pioneer Is First To Announce It Follows All Best 
      Practices Unveiled By Visa On April 27th
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ROAM Data, the leading mCommerce platform provider that extends both 
      physical POS and eCommerce to the mobile environment, today announced 
      that it is following the best practices and minimum standards for 
      encryption guidelines for mobile payments released by Visa last month. 
      After careful review, the company said its solutions meet or exceed all 
      Visa guidelines for mobile payment acceptance solution vendors, from 
      encrypting cardholder data at the time of swipe through authorization to 
      encryption of key management processes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today there are multiple mobile card acceptance providers that are not 
      compliant with either PCI security standards&#160;or best practices, leaving 
      significant holes in their systems for card fraud. According to Visa, 
      building security into the DNA of mobile acceptance solutions is 
      necessary to help grow the channel and encourage innovation. Commenting 
      on this, CEO and Founder of ROAM Data, Will Graylin, said, "From day 
      one, we designed our solutions with security as a top priority. We are 
      happy to announce that we meet all guidelines Visa put out for 
      protecting mobile payments, and we will continue to meet or exceed 
      industry guidelines to protect our customers and partners."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ROAM Data offers ROAMpay as its turnkey mobile card acceptance solution 
      that runs on hundreds of phones and is also compatible with the ROAMpay 
      Swipe device, which is the world&#8217;s first encrypted mag stripe card 
      reader that plugs into a phone&#8217;s audio jack. Mr. Graylin, who pioneered 
      mobile phone POS as founder of WAY Systems (now part of Verifone), has 
      now brought to market a more ubiquitous, lower cost and highly secure 
      solution that works across the vast majority of smart phones, tablets 
      and PCs. ROAM has leveraged its own patented technology, and has 
      licensed exclusively and non-exclusively three other pieces of 
      technology to enable its secure mobile card acceptance solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ROAM partners with payment providers, integrators and app developers -- 
      who are incorporating mobile commerce into their offerings to merchants 
      -- to distribute its solutions. These customers and partners include 
      First Data, Chase Paymentech, Intuit, Global Payments, Sage, Ingenico 
      and hundreds more. ROAM won the 2010 Technology Innovation Award 
      sponsored by the Electronic Transaction Association and is the leader in

&lt;p&gt;LUXEMBOURG (Reuters) - An 899 million euro ($1.3 billion) EU antitrust fine was excessive and undeserved, Microsoft Corp told an EU court on Tuesday in a case which could draw a line under a decade of legal battles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 2008 European Commission fine -- a record at the time -- penalized Microsoft for failing to comply with the regulator's order four years earlier to provide information that would allow other products to work with computers running its software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software group has since taken a more conciliatory approach in dealing with the Commission, highlighted by its decision to reach a settlement with the regulator in 2009 when agreeing to let users of its Windows operating system choose their own browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rival Google Inc has adopted a similar tone in handling an EU regulatory probe of its web search practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fine was "most undeserved," Jean Francois Bellis, Microsoft's lawyer told the General Court, Europe's second-highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This case would not have arisen if the Commission had been as explicit with respect to rates which it wanted Microsoft to charge as it had been with all other terms of licensing proposed by Microsoft," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission argued that Microsoft's actions after a 2007 court ruling showed that it was able to identify within a short time the measures needed to comply with its order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a case about a gambler who doubled up on a losing bet, lost again and now wants his money back," Nicholas Khan, a lawyer for the Commission, told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRACK RECORD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The General Court typically gives its verdict between six months and just over a year after a hearing.

&lt;p&gt; * Fine imposed in 2008, first for non-compliance in 50 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Court verdict likely in 6 months to just over a year &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds lawyer comments) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Foo Yun Chee &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LUXEMBOURG, May 24 (Reuters) - An 899 million euro ($1.3
billion) EU antitrust fine was excessive and undeserved,
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) told an EU court on Tuesday in a case
which could draw a line under a decade of legal battles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 2008 European Commission fine -- a record at the time --
penalised Microsoft for failing to comply with the regulator's
order four years earlier to provide information that would allow
other products to work with computers running its software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software group has since taken a more conciliatory
approach in dealing with the Commission, highlighted by its
decision to reach a settlement with the regulator in 2009 when
agreeing to let users of its Windows operating system choose
their own browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rival Google Inc (GOOG.O) has adopted a similar tone in
handling an EU regulatory probe of its web search practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fine was "most undeserved", Jean Francois Bellis,
Microsoft's lawyer told the General Court, Europe's
second-highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This case would not have arisen if the Commission had been
as explicit with respect to rates which it wanted Microsoft to
charge as it had been with all other terms of licensing proposed
by Microsoft," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission argued that Microsoft's actions after a 2007
court ruling showed that it was able to identify within a short
time the measures needed to comply with its order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a case about a gambler who doubled up on a losing
bet, lost again and now wants his money back," Nicholas Khan, a
lawyer for the Commission, told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TRACK RECORD &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The General Court typically gives its verdict between six
months and just over a year after a hearing. Appeals can be
lodged with the EU Court of Justice, Europe's highest court, but
only on points of law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The odds would appear to be in the Commission's favour, said
Christian Riss-Madsen, a partner at law firm O'Melveny  Myers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would think, based on its track record, the court would
be reluctant to overrule the Commission's fining decision,
giving the Commission some discretion in its enforcement," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, it was possible the court could use the opportunity
to issue a benchmark ruling that could set the direction for
other abuse of dominant position cases coming up for judicial
scrutiny, said Ramon Garcia Gallardo, a partner at SJ Berwin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Normally fine reductions in cartel fines have been
relatively small. This case is important as it could show the
court's approach on the Commission's position on high fines," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hearing will be watched by companies challenging
regulatory fines, among them Intel Corp (INTC.O), which has
appealed in EU courts against a 1.06 billion euro penalty
imposed by the Commission last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's non-compliance penalty was nearly double the
original 497 million euro fine the Commission imposed on the
company in 2004 for abusing its dominant position to thwart
competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft was supported in the case by the Computing
Technology Industry Association and the Association for
Competitive Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM (IBM.N), Oracle Corp ORCL.O and Red Hat Inc (RHT.N)
were among seven parties who supported the Commission's
position.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 24 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
launched an update of its Windows phone software on Tuesday,
hoping a host of new features will help it close the gap on
smartphone leaders Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Apple Inc (AAPL.O).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The updated software, code-named Mango, will appear on new
Windows phones beginning this autumn, and be available for
existing Windows phone users before that, although Microsoft
has not set a timetable for making the update available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said the update involved 500 new features,
including Internet Explorer 9 as the mobile browser, Twitter
and LinkedIn (LNKD.N) feeds integrated into contact cards,
automated Facebook check-ins, and access to more than 17,000
downloadable applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is banking on the new version of its phone
software to get its recent alliance with Nokia (NOK1V.HE) off
to a strong start. The first phones made by Nokia using Windows
software are expected late this year or early in 2012.
[ID:nLDE71F029]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two have some work to do to catch up with Google's
Android, which now runs 36 percent of smartphones sold
globally, followed by Apple with 17 percent, according to
research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last quarter, Microsoft held only 4 percent of the
smartphone operating system market, but was looking to convert
the 27 percent market share held by Nokia's Symbian, which will
be replaced by the Windows system in most of Nokia's new
phones.

&lt;p&gt;  RESTON, VA, May 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Netuitive, Inc today announced it has completed an enhanced integration
with Microsoft Systems Center Operations Manager (SCOM) that adds Hyper-V
monitoring to Netuitive's predictive analytics software platform for
virtualization and application performance management (APM). With this
integration, Netuitive provides a single solution for managing the
performance of Microsoft Hyper-V and VMware.

    Netuitive's predictive analytics platform, powered by its patented
Behavior Learning Engine(TM), allows enterprises to synthesize data
streams from any monitoring and management source. It uses automated
mathematics and statistical analysis to self-learn, forecast and resolve
IT issues before they impact quality of service -- without requiring
manual rules, scripts or thresholds.

    The addition of Microsoft Hyper-V further enhances Netuitive's unique
ability to enable end-to-end management of applications running in
virtualized environments. It joins a growing portfolio of IT monitoring
and management tools that can be analyzed by the Netuitive platform. This
includes solutions from leaders such as VMware, CA, IBM, BMC, HP, NetApp,
Oracle, EMC and others to monitor everything from virtual servers, to
application or database servers, to end-to-end services. 

    This technology-agnostic approach provides seamless visibility and highly
accurate analysis allowing ultimate flexibility in how enterprises deploy
virtualization and APM strategies across their virtualized and cloud
environments. 

    "Organizations shouldn't have to buy a new management solution as their
infrastructure changes and evolves," said Nicola Sanna, CEO of Netuitive.
"Companies are going to standardize on one hypervisor or have a
combination of them. Netuitive delivers an open analytics solution that
provides service-level management regardless of the underlying
infrastructure."

    Forward looking companies around the globe migrate to new technologies to
gain a competitive advantage along with cost savings and productivity
gains for their workforce. Currently, many CIOs are implementing UC
solutions like Microsoft's Lync and SIP trunking services to communicate
via IP inside and outside the enterprise. SIP trunks allow voice traffic
to travel over the data network, resulting in significantly lower costs
for the provider and, therefore, for the customer as well. SIP trunking
also enables streamlined management and provisioning. But SIP trunking is
not without its challenges. To benefit from the technology, companies
must pay especially close attention to integration and quality of
service. For example, to integrate these technologies and secure the
corporate network from malicious attacks a Session Border Controller
(SBC) is recommended as a demarcation device. This session will address
these issues along with early-adopter lessons learned for SIP PSTN
integration into environments such as Microsoft Lync 2010. 

    The event will cover timely topics such as: 


--  Lessons learned: security and interoperability -- do them right and
    you've got a next-generation communications infrastructure
--  Considering SIP trunking as a cost-effective alternative
--  Integration and interoperability with Microsoft Lync 2010
--  Benefits of using a Session Border Controller (SBC) as a demarcation
    device when integrating legacy voice, SIP trunks and Microsoft Lync
    2010
--  Overview of IntelePeer

&lt;p&gt;  IRVINE, CA, May 24 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Solarflare, the 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE) pioneer, today announced the
results of a recently completed multi-vendor benchmark test with IBM. The
vendors used the STAC-M2(TM) Benchmark to measure the messaging
performance of the solution stack. Once again, Solarflare was chosen as
the preferred 10GbE server adapter. The company has now participated in
more audited STAC M2 benchmarks than any other 10GbE adapter vendor.

    Using standard Ethernet and UDP protocols, the mean latency of the
solution did not exceed 10 microseconds, while the standard deviation of
the latency was measured at zero microseconds. At the highest tested rate
of 2.3 million messages / second, the mean latency of the solution was
just 14 microseconds, while the standard deviation of latency was
measured at 2 microseconds. These results are significant for IT managers
and Linux engineers building high-frequency trading systems because they
show that a low-latency, highly-deterministic system that achieves near
zero jitter can be built with standard, off-the-shelf Ethernet and IP
network equipment. Other recent tests have used special protocols to get
low latency, but at the cost of higher jitter, which is a highly
undesirable trade off for high-frequency trading applications that
require predictability and low jitter over the course of the trading day.

    Since 2008, Solarflare's OpenOnload application acceleration middleware
has proven its application transparency and protocol richness in 100s of
demanding, mission-critical production environments in Chicago,
Frankfurt, London and New York. IT managers designing high-speed,
low-latency networks need compatibility with the control planes and data
paths of TCP/IP, Ethernet and the Linux operating system. With
OpenOnload, these customers get access to all the necessary Layer 2 and
Layer 3 features, such as: virtual LAN trunking for the management,
separation and security of IP traffic flows; link aggregation for
failover and redundancy; address resolution protocol (ARP) caching for
high-speed mapping of Ethernet to IP addresses; and Internet control
message protocol (ICMP) notifications for network diagnostics and
resiliency. Since Solarflare's middleware provides true transparency to
POSIX sockets, designers of high-performance networks do not need to
rewrite their applications to get the performance increase that the
software provides. Solarflare's solution transparently supports the Linux
networking functions required by high-frequency trading applications,
such as poll, select, epoll, fork, exec, signals and comprehensive socket
flags. The middleware also includes optimizations for concurrent socket
access by multi-threaded applications, as well as support for
fine-grained latency measurements, diagnostics and per-socket performance
controls. 

    The tests were audited by STAC(R) (The Securities Technology Analysis
Center). The highlights of the audited report are available to members
with a premium subscription at http://www.stacresearch.com/node/8766 and
are available to the public at http://www.stacresearch.com/node/8763. 

    The tested solution under test consisted of:


--  Solarflare SFN5122F 10GbE adapters with OpenOnload application
    acceleration middleware
--  IBM WMQ Low Latency Messaging v2.4.0.2
--  Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS 5.5
--  2x Quad-Core Intel Xeon X5570 2.93 GHz
--  IBM x3550 M2 Model Servers
--  IBM-BNT G8264 10Gb/40Gb Ethernet switch

    

All of the above products are available to financial firms today. 

    "In real world environments on Wall Street, the City of London and
Frankfurt, Solarflare continues to win because we deliver protocol
maturity, ease of use, application transparency and a rich Layer 2 and
Layer 3 feature set, including support for VLAN trunking and high
availability features, such as link aggregation control protocol (LACP)
and multiple switch link aggregation (MLAG)," said Bruce Tolley, VP of
solutions and outbound marketing at Solarflare. "We continue to look for
opportunities to participate in STAC M2 Benchmark tests, so our customers
can make informed decisions and build solutions with best-of-class
elements, like Solarflare's 10GbE adapters and IBM messaging middleware,
switches and servers."

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union could temporarily reintroduce visas for some travellers from outside the bloc in case of a sudden influx of migrants from a specific country, under plans presented by the EU executive on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The proposal addresses concerns by some EU governments about a sharp increase in asylum seekers from the western Balkans, where countries won the right to visa-free travel to the 25 member states of Europe's border-free Shengen area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also reflects a growing reluctance in Europe to keep its borders open at a time when turmoil in North Africa is driving thousands of people to seek refuge and jobs in the EU, while public opinion grows hostile to newcomers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission said new rules would allow EU member governments to quickly restore visas in case of a "high inflow of irregular migrants or a sudden increase of unfounded asylum requests from a third country".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Establishing a safeguard clause will help to preserve the integrity of the visa liberalisation processes and to build credibility vis-a-vis the public," the executive said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under current laws it could take up to a few years to change visa rules. The proposed changes need to be approved by EU governments and the European Parliament.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EU governments granted visa-free travel to citizens of Bosnia and Albania at the end of 2010, a year after visitors from Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia saw travel restrictions eased, as part of EU policies of stabilising the Balkans.

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft says 899-million-euro fine was excessive&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Fine imposed in 2008, first for non-compliance in 50 years&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft more cooperative with regulators now&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Court verdict likely in 6 months to just over a year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LUXEMBOURG, May 24 (Reuters) - An 899 million euro ($1.3
billion) antitrust fine imposed by EU regulators was excessive,
Microsoft (MSFT.O) told an EU court on Tuesday, in a case
expected to draw a line under its decade-long battle in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 2008 European Commission fine -- a record at the time --
penalised Microsoft for failing to comply with the regulator's
order four years earlier to provide information that would allow
other products to work with computers running its software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software firm has since taken a more conciliatory
approach in dealing with the Commission, highlighted by its
decision to reach a settlement with the regulator in 2009 when
agreeing let users of its Windows operating system to choose
their own browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rival Google Inc (GOOG.O) has adopted a similar tone in
handling an EU regulatory probe of its web search practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fine was "most undeserved", Jean Francois Bellis,
Microsoft's lawyer told the General Court, Europe's
second-highest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This case would not have arisen if the Commission had been
as explicit with respect to rates which it wanted Microsoft to
charge as it had been with all other terms of licensing proposed
by Microsoft," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission argued that Microsoft's actions after a 2007
court ruling showed that it was able to identify within a short
time the measures needed to comply with its order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The General Court typically gives its verdict in six months
to just over a year after a hearing. Appeals can be lodged with
the EU Court of Justice, Europe's highest court, but only on
points of law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The odds would appear to be in the Commission's favour, said
Christian Riss-Madsen, a partner at law firm O'Melveny  Myers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would think, based on its track record, the court would
be reluctant to overrule the Commission's fining decision,
giving the Commission some discretion in its enforcement," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hearing will be watched by companies challenging
regulatory fines, among them Intel (INTC.O), which has appealed
in EU courts against a 1.06 billion euro penalty imposed by the
Commission last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's non-compliance penalty was nearly double the
original 497 million euro fine the Commission imposed on the
firm in 2004 for abusing its dominant position to thwart
competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft was supported in the case by the Computing
Technology Industry Association and the Association for
Competitive Technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM (IBM.N), Oracle ORCL.O, Red Hat (RHT.N), information
technology lobby group ECIS, the Free Software Foundation
Europe, the Software  Information Industry Association and
software organisation Samba supported the Commission's position.

			NYSE Euronext Welcomes Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. to its European 
      Market
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			One of the world's largest independent Coca-Cola bottlers uses Fast 
      Path to cross-list in Europe
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE: CCE), one of the world's largest 
      independent Coca-Cola bottlers, celebrated its Fast Path secondary 
      listing on NYSE Euronext in Paris today. CCE is the first NYSE-listed 
      company in 2011 to take advantage of this streamlined, cost-effective 
      process and the eleventh1 to do so since the facility was 
      made available by NYSE Euronext in 2008.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The decision for Coca-Cola Enterprises to list on NYSE Euronext in Paris 
      followed the separation of its European operations from its North 
      American business, which was assumed by The Coca-Cola Company, and its 
      simultaneous acquisition of The Coca-Cola Company&#8217;s bottling operations 
      in Norway and Sweden in October 2010. Coca-Cola Enterprises employs 
      13,500 employees across Western Europe, where the company distributes a 
      wide range of beverages, including regular, no- and low-calorie 
      sparkling, energy and sports drinks, waters, juices and juice drinks, 
      coffees and teas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises&#8217; Common Stock was admitted to listing and trading 
      on NYSE Euronext by direct listing of the existing 340,763,680 shares 
      making up the company's capital stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The admission price of the company&#8217; shares was set at &#8364;20.73 each, i.e. 
      the closing price of its shares on 23 May 2011 converted into Euros on 
      the basis of the European Central Bank EUR/USD exchange rate of the same 
      trading day. Coca-Cola Enterprises&#8217; market capitalization on the day of 
      admission amounted to &#8364;7.06 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We would like to extend a warm welcome to Coca-Cola Enterprises, a 
      strong addition to the international companies already listed on the 
      professional segment of NYSE Euronext in Paris,&#8221; said Dominique Cerutti, 
      President and Deputy CEO of NYSE Euronext. &#8220;We are delighted that 
      Coca-Cola Enterprises has chosen Paris for its international listing. 
      Such a high-profile float is a major win for the French financial market 
      and we are confident that more global firms will seek to take advantage 
      of the profile and access to capital that a NYSE Euronext in Paris 
      listing offers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ronald Kent, Group Executive Vice President and Head of International 
      Listings at NYSE Euronext, added: &#8220;Coca-Cola Enterprises&#8217; cross-listing 
      on NYSE Euronext in Paris reflects its strong commercial presence in 
      Europe. It will allow the company to extend the geographical scope of 
      its investor base, offering optimal visibility and access to the euro 
      zone capital markets.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Coca-Cola Enterprises is committed to delivering long-term shareowner 
      value, and we have a consistent track record of solid growth in Europe,&#8221; 
      said John F. Brock, Chairman and CEO of Coca-Cola Enterprises. &#8220;European 
      investors will now have the opportunity to benefit more easily from our 
      growth plans, and the outstanding brands, superior customer service and 
      people who are at the core of our performance.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A total of 48 companies are currently cross-listed on both NYSE and NYSE 
      Euronext.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Fast Path listing enables US-listed, non-EU companies to use their 
      existing filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) for a 
      listing on NYSE Euronext&#8217;s European market. This listing process can be 
      used in connection with various transactions, including IPO, secondary 
      capital raising, spin-off or technical listing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2.
			Background about the professional segment of NYSE 
      Euronext&#8217;s Paris market
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The professional segment of NYSE Euronext&#8216;s Paris market is designed to 
      meet the needs of international companies and is aimed at professional 
      investors only. The segment is part of the Regulated Market of NYSE 
      Euronext in Paris. It has simplified listing requirements including the 
      use of the English language for all documentation, streamlined permanent 
      and periodic reporting requirements and simplified and accelerated 
      review procedures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      3. Background about Cross-Listing on NYSE Euronext European markets
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        NYSE Euronext is the first and only exchange group to offer a truly 
        global cross-market listing, trading and visibility platform, 
        providing cost-effective, convenient access to investors and business 
        partners in the US and in Europe.
      
			
        NYSE Euronext is the first exchange group to offer companies the 
        ability to trade and raise capital in &#8364; and $ and reach investors and 
        constituents directly across continents and multiple time zones, 
        regions and countries.
      
			
        Valuable for any company looking to enhance its global profile, 
        support an international business or expand its non-US investor base, 
        a Fast Path listing provides an easy, cost-effective way to gain a 
        European trading presence. Euronext regulators accept documentation, 
        previously filed with the SEC, to meet the EU Prospectus Directive. 
        With Fast Path, a company avoids the need to draft and translate a 
        separate prospectus in order to be admitted to trading. Documents 
        filed with the SEC serve as the primary component to obtain approval 
        from the competent Euronext regulator. The SEC documentation is 
        combined with a summary &#8220;wrapper&#8221;, addressing any additional European 
        and local requirements, forming the company&#8217;s European prospectus.

&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank, seen as one of the most influential in commodity markets, said it was "structurally bullish" on oil and raised its year-end Brent forecast to $120 per barrel from $105 a barrel, and its 2012 forecast to $140 from $120.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's bullish tone comes just a month after the bank rocked markets in April by calling a nearly $20 fall in Brent, saying speculators had pushed prices ahead of fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is only a matter of time until inventories and OPEC spare capacity will become effectively exhausted, requiring higher oil prices to restrain demand, keeping it in line with available supplies," Goldman analysts said in a report dated Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect that the ongoing loss of Libyan production and disappointing non-OPEC production will continue to tighten the oil market to critically tight levels in early 2012."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it estimates the level of effective full capacity in top oil exporter Saudi Arabia at between 10.5-11.0 million barrels per day (bpd), well below the 12.5 million bpd capacity figure given by the kingdom. That would leave Saudi with spare capacity of around 2 million to 2.5 million bpd, around half the 4 million bpd that Saudi states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are differentiating between what is likely nameplate engineering capacity against what is most likely to be brought to market in a short period of time and sustained for a long period of time," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The routs in commodity prices this month provide a good entry point to buy oil, Goldman said, recommending going long on the December 2012 ICE Brent crude contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley also raised its Brent crude price forecast for 2011 and 2012 on Tuesday, citing an improvement in demand coupled with a loss in production from Libya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley raised its 2011 Brent crude price forecast to $120 per barrel from $100 a barrel, and its 2012 forecast to $130 from $105.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLOWER DEMAND GROWTH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Higher prices have started to eat into demand and would continue to do so, Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank cut its forecast for global oil demand growth for 2011 to 1.7 million bpd on Monday from the previous forecast of 1.9 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate report dated Tuesday, the bank also changed its 2012 oil demand growth forecast to 1.7 million bpd, from 2.0 million previously, and its 2013 growth estimate to 1.3 million bpd, down from 1.6 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;METALS, CHINA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman also said that the current pause in economic growth is nearing a trough and creating upside potential for metal prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While a sharp decline in world economic growth remains a downside risk to commodity prices, we see the current slowdown in economic growth as part of a normal mid-cycle pause, partially driven by higher commodity prices, and therefore not a reason to expect commodity prices to decline substantially," the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said that current copper prices offer an attractive opportunity to buy the metal. It also said that the recent weak data from China raises "some caution and we recognize that China may experience some further economic weakness before comfortably resuming a growth trend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman trimmed its economic growth forecasts for China to 9.4 percent this year, from 10 percent previously, citing a recent run of surprisingly weak data, high oil prices and supply constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The growth slowdown has been even sharper than we forecast, especially evident in April industrial production," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it expects gold prices to continue to climb in 2011 as the resumption of quantitative easing should keep real interest rates in the U.S. low. It said it expects gold prices to peak in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Francis Kan; Additional reporting by Antonita Madonna in BANGALORE; Writing by Manash Goswami; Editing by Simon Webb)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman raises yr-end Brent forecast to $120/bbl from $105&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Only matter of time before OPEC spare capacity exhausted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Recommends buying Brent Dec 2012 contract

 (Adds Morgan Stanley's price forecasts, details)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SINGAPORE, May 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has raised its
Brent crude price forecast for 2011 and 2012 on expectation fuel
demand growth will sap global inventories and strain OPEC's
spare oil output capacity.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wall Street bank, seen as one of the most influential in
commodity markets, said it was "structurally bullish" on oil and
raised its year-end Brent forecast to $120 per barrel from $105
a barrel, and its 2012 forecast to $140 from $120.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's bullish tone comes just a month after the bank
rocked markets in April by calling a nearly $20 fall in Brent,
saying speculators had pushed prices ahead of fundamentals.
[ID:nN12168871]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is only a matter of time until inventories and OPEC
spare capacity will become effectively exhausted, requiring
higher oil prices to restrain demand, keeping it in line with
available supplies," Goldman analysts said in a report dated
Monday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect that the ongoing loss of Libyan production and
disappointing non-OPEC production will continue to tighten the
oil market to critically tight levels in early 2012."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said it estimates the level of effective full
capacity in top oil exporter Saudi Arabia at between 10.5-11.0
million barrels per day (bpd), well below the 12.5 million bpd
capacity figure given by the kingdom. That would leave Saudi
with spare capacity of around 2 million to 2.5 million bpd,
around half the 4 million bpd that Saudi states.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are differentiating between what is likely nameplate
engineering capacity against what is most likely to be brought
to market in a short period of time and sustained for a long
period of time," Goldman said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The routs in commodity prices this month provide a good
entry point to buy oil, Goldman said, recommending going long on
the December 2012 ICE Brent crude contract.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley also raised its Brent crude price forecast
for 2011 and 2012 on Tuesday, citing an improvement in demand
coupled with a loss in production from Libya.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley raised its 2011 Brent crude price forecast to
$120 per barrel from $100 a barrel, and its 2012 forecast to
$130 from $105. [ID:nL3E7GO054]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 	
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SLOWER DEMAND GROWTH	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Higher prices have started to eat into demand and would
continue to do so, Goldman said. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank cut its forecast for global oil demand growth for
2011 to 1.7 million bpd on Monday from the previous forecast of
1.9 million bpd.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a separate report dated Tuesday, the bank also changed
its 2012 oil demand growth forecast to 1.7 million bpd, from 2.0
million previously, and its 2013 growth estimate to 1.3 million
bpd, down from 1.6 million bpd.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 	
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; METALS, CHINA   	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also said that the current pause in economic growth
is nearing a trough and creating upside potential for metal
prices. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While a sharp decline in world economic growth remains a
downside risk to commodity prices, we see the current slowdown
in economic growth as part of a normal mid-cycle pause,
partially driven by higher commodity prices, and therefore not a
reason to expect commodity prices to decline substantially," the
report said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said that current copper prices offer an attractive
opportunity to buy the metal. It also said that the recent weak
data from China raises "some caution and we recognise that China
may experience some further economic weakness before comfortably
resuming a growth trend."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman trimmed its economic growth forecasts for China to
9.4 percent this year, from 10 percent previously, citing a
recent run of surprisingly weak data, high oil prices and supply
constraints.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The growth slowdown has been even sharper than we forecast,
especially evident in April industrial production," it said.
[ID:nL3E7GO0BV]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank said it expects gold prices to continue to climb in
2011 as the resumption of quantitative easing should keep real
interest rates in the U.S. low. It said it expects gold prices
to peak in 2012.

&lt;p&gt; (Fixes typo in third paragraph)	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman raises yr-end Brent forecast to $120/bbl from $105&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Recommends buying Brent Dec 2012 contract&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Only matter of time before OPEC spare capacity exhausted

 (Adds outlook on metals, details)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SINGAPORE, May 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has raised its
Brent crude price forecast for 2011 and 2012 on expectations
that fuel demand growth will draw on global inventories and
strain OPEC's spare oil output capacity.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street bank said it was "structurally bullish" on
oil and raised its year-end Brent forecast to $120 per barrel
from $105 a barrel, and its 2012 forecast to $140 from $120. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is only a matter of time until inventories and OPEC spare
capacity will become effectively exhausted, requiring higher oil
prices to restrain demand, keeping it in line with available
supplies," Goldman analysts led by David Greely said in a report
dated Monday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman predicted in April a correction in oil prices, ahead
of the asset-wide rout earlier this month. It said the recent
pull back provides a good entry point to buy oil and recommended
going long on the December 2012 ICE Brent crude contract.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect that the ongoing loss of Libyan production and
disappointing non-OPEC production will continue to tighten the
oil market to critically tight levels in early 2012," the report
said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman also said that the current pause in economic growth
is nearing a trough and creating upside potential for metal
prices. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While a sharp decline in world economic growth remains a
downside risk to commodity prices, we see the current slowdown
in economic growth as part of a normal mid-cycle pause,
partially driven by higher commodity prices, and therefore not a

report said.

 (Adds details on Einhorn, online unit; byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Svea Herbst-Bayliss and Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK/SEATTLE, May 25 (Reuters) - Influential hedge fund
manager David Einhorn has called for Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer to step down, saying the world's
largest software company's leader is stuck in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "His continued presence is the biggest overhang on
Microsoft's stock," Einhorn said in reference to Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The comments by outspoken Einhorn, who made his name
warning about Lehman Brothers' financial health before the
investment bank's collapse, are the most pointed yet from a
high-profile investor against Microsoft's leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares, which have been static for over a decade,
gained 0.87 percent in after-hours trading after Einhorn's
comments, the most of any Dow Jones industrial average
component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software giant, which was the largest U.S. company by
market value in the late 1990s, has since been overtaken by
Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and IBM in market value, and is no longer
seen as a dominating force in technology after a failure to
capitalize on new Internet and mobile computing markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock is down 6 percent in the last two weeks alone
after Microsoft agreed to pay $8.5 billion for Internet phone
service Skype, a move which mystified many investors.
[ID:nN1095174]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at the annual Ira Sohn Investment Research
Conference in New York on Wednesday, Einhorn said it was time
for Ballmer -- who succeeded co-founder Bill Gates in 2000 --
to step aside and "give someone else a chance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Einhorn's comments echo what some investors have said for
some years in private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Microsoft spokesman declined comment on Einhorn's
remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RECENT BUYER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Einhorn's Greenlight Capital hedge fund has been a recent
buyer of Microsoft stock, which at under 10 times expected
earnings is regarded by many as undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greenlight held about 9 million shares in Microsoft, or
0.11 percent of the company's outstanding shares, at the end of
the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Einhorn also said it was time for Microsoft to consider
strategic alternatives for its money-losing online business,
which has so far failed to win share from online search leader
Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The online services unit, which runs the Bing search engine
and MSN web portal, had a loss of $726 million last quarter and
has now lost $7 billion in four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bing has made some progress, raising its U.S. Internet
search market share to 14 percent from 8 percent in the two
years since launch, but has not taken any share from Google,
which has held on to its 65 percent share, according to
research firm comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OLD FOES APPLE, IBM REVIVED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, Microsoft was overtaken by IBM (IBM.N) in
market value for the first time in 15 years, chiefly because of
Microsoft's static share price. Apple roared past it last year
to become the world's most valuable tech company.[ID:nN23178552]
 (Graphic showing market value of Apple, IBM and Microsoft over
time: r.reuters.com/jaw69r )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An investor who put $100,000 into Microsoft stock 10 years
ago would now have about $69,000 worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Einhorn, the president of Greenlight Capital, which had
$7.8 billion of assets as of Jan. 1, made his name with the
prescient call on Lehman's accounting troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the spring of 2008, Einhorn said Lehman -- and its
then-Chief Financial Officer Erin Callan -- had understated its
own problems and needed to raise capital to support a balance
sheet peppered with risky assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Einhorn's public speeches on the matter in April and May
2008 -- including one at the Ira Sohn conference that year --
touched a nerve with other investors and are widely credited as
leading to Callan's departure from the company a few months
before its collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares, which gained 4 cents in normal trading,
ended up a further 12 cents at $24.31 in after-hours activity.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Influential hedge fund manager David Einhorn called on Microsoft's Chief Executive Steve Ballmer to step down, while famed short-seller Jim Chanos threw cold water on alternative energy companies during the annual Ira Sohn Investment Research Conference on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who succeeded co-founder Bill Gates in 2000, is "stuck in the past" and has become the biggest overhang on Microsoft's stock, said Einhorn, who rose to prominence for making a prescient call on Lehman Brothers' accounting troubles before the firm's collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following his comments, Microsoft Corp sharestraded as high as $24.40 after hours, 0.86 percent higher than the Wednesday closing of $24.19. Einhorn's Greenlight Capital holds about 9 million Microsoft shares, or 0.11 percent of the company's outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another high moment of the conference, Jim Chanos recommended investors short solar and wind energy companies such as First Solar Inc and Vestas Wind Systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a presentation that prompted rare laughter from the audience, he recognized his investment idea would disappoint "greenies" and those in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Below is a compilation of the main investment ideas floated at the conference:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JIM CHANOS, KYNIKOS ASSOCIATES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDEA: short wind turbine manufacturer Vestas and solar company First Solar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chanos laid out why he thinks alternative energy is no panacea and will not create the jobs the Obama administration has predicted -- a contrarian idea to many investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts are skeptical that Vestas, which posted a first-quarter loss, will meet its full-year sales forecast because of weak demand in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vestas said last October it would cut 3,000 jobs and shut five plants.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 25 (Reuters) - Influential hedge fund manager
David Einhorn called on Microsoft's Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer to step down, while famed short-seller Jim Chanos threw
cold water on alternative energy companies during the annual
Ira Sohn Investment Research Conference on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ballmer, who succeeded co-founder Bill Gates in 2000, is
"stuck in the past" and has become the biggest overhang on
Microsoft's stock, said Einhorn, who rose to prominence for
making a prescient call on Lehman Brothers' accounting troubles
before the firm's collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following his comments, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) sharestraded as high as $24.40 after hours, 0.86 percent higher than
the Wednesday closing of $24.19. Einhorn's Greenlight Capital
holds about 9 million Microsoft shares, or 0.11 percent of the
company's outstanding shares, according to Thomson Reuters
data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In another high moment of the conference, Jim Chanos
recommended investors short solar and wind energy companies
such as First Solar Inc (FSLR.O) and Vestas Wind Systems
 (VWS.CO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a presentation that prompted rare laughter from the
audience, he recognized his investment idea would disappoint
"greenies" and those in power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Below is a compilation of the main investment ideas floated
at the conference:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JIM CHANOS, KYNIKOS ASSOCIATES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IDEA: short wind turbine manufacturer Vestas and solar
company First Solar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chanos laid out why he thinks alternative energy is no
panacea and will not create the jobs the Obama administration
has predicted -- a contrarian idea to many investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts are skeptical that Vestas, which posted a
first-quarter loss, will meet its full-year sales forecast
because of weak demand in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vestas said last October it would cut 3,000 jobs and shut
five plants. Its shares have tumbled nearly 45 percent in the
past year and are down some 12 percent so far in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vestas shares, which are traded at the Copenhagen stock
exchange, closed at 154.60 Danish crowns before Chanos'
comments. First Solar's shares fell 2.64 percent on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DAVID EINHORN, GREENLIGHT CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IDEA: buy Dutch insurer Delta Lloyd NV (DLL.AS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Einhorn also sent Microsoft's stock higher in after-hours

discount stores in 44 U.S. states, has been able to narrow the
gap with its main competitor, which should result in "very
meaningful outperformance" for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said the company could become an attractive
leveraged buyout target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Family Dollar, which closed on Wednesday at
$54.82, rose 1.4 percent in after-hours trading following
Ackman's comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DINAKAR SINGH, TPG-AXON CAPITAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IDEA: buy Sprint Nextel (S.N) and Orkla Asa (ORK.OL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Singh said Sprint Nextel's shares are cheap, and sees an

Crosstex, expects the company's earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation and amortization to climb to at least $230
million this year from $182 million in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said he expects wireless broadband company
Lightsquared to go public in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOB HOWARD, KKR  CO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IDEA: buy WABCO Holdings Inc (WBC.N) and HSN Inc (HSNI.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of WABCO Holdings, a supplier of safety and control

&lt;p&gt; * Says CEO Ballmer stuck in past&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft stock rises after hours
 (Rewrites, adds details on Einhorn's holdings)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, May 25 (Reuters) - Influential hedge fund manager
David Einhorn has called for Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief
Executive Steve Ballmer to step down, saying the world's
largest software company's long-time leader is stuck in the
past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which was the largest U.S. company by market
value in the late 1990s, has seen its stock stand still for the
past 10 years as it failed to attack new Internet and mobile
computing markets, surrendering leadership of the tech sector
to Apple Inc (AAPL.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares shot up 0.87 percent in after-hours
trading, the most of any Dow Jones industrial average
component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many have been privately critical of Ballmer, but Einhorn's
remarks are the most pointed yet from a high-profile investor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Einhorn's Greenlight Capital hedge fund has been a recent
buyer of Microsoft stock, which at under 10 times expected
earnings is regarded by many as undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greenlight currently holds about 9 million shares in
Microsoft, or 0.11 percent of the company's outstanding shares,
according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at the annual Ira Sohn Investment Research
Conference in New York on Wednesday, Einhorn said it was time
for Ballmer -- who succeeded co-founder Bill Gates in 2000 --
to step aside and "give someone else a chance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "His continued presence is the biggest overhang on
Microsoft's stock," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, Microsoft was overtaken by IBM (IBM.N) in
market value for the first time in 15 years, chiefly because of
its static shares. Apple roared past it last year to become the
world's most valuable tech company. [ID:nN23178552]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An investor who put $100,000 into Microsoft stock 10 years
ago would now have about $69,000 worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Einhorn, the president of Greenlight Capital, which had
$7.8 billion of assets as of Jan. 1, first rose to prominence
for making a prescient call on Lehman Brothers' accounting
troubles before the bank's subsequent collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft edged up 0.87 percent to $24.40 in
after hours trade from a regular-session close of $24.19.

&lt;p&gt;May 25 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve Bank of New York is
investigating whether Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) mortgage servicing
arm did not conduct proper reviews before denying borrowers the
option to lower their payments under a government loan
modification programme, the Financial Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman unit, Litton Loan Servicing, denied loans without
appropriate review under a "denial sweep" strategy in order to
clear a backlog of applications, the newspaper said citing a
source familiar with the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesperson for Goldman Sachs declined to comment when
contacted by Reuters, while the NY Fed was unavailable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FT reported that the Fed has confirmed it was "conducting
an inquiry."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Earlier this year, Goldman said it was looking at selling
Litton and is reportedly in talks with Ocwen Financial Corp
(OCN.N) for the sale. [ID:nN20198642]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Goldman had bought Litton in 2007 for about $430 million,
hoping to glean more information about the housing market to
aid its mortgage-bond trading business. Shortly after the deal
closed, the subprime housing market fell into shambles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FT said the person familiar with Litton had denied
modification of loans that met the criteria for a government
modification.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The paper said loans were denied modification on account of
missing documents, even though Litton's computer system
reflected receipt of the necessary paperwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At other times, the Goldman unit denied loan modifications
as Litton employees made mistakes in how they calculated the
borrower's income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sach's shares closed at $136.24 on Wednesday on the
New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Himank Sharma in Bangalore; Editing by Lisa

Corp (CVX.N) shareholders support greater disclosure about the
risks of hydraulic fracturing following the company's big move

environmental risks, according to the initial results of the
shareholder vote announced at its annual meeting on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fracking is used to extract natural gas or oil from shale
rock by blasting in a mix of water, chemicals and sand. The
practice has created serious concerns about water contamination
among both politicians and people living near the wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, became
heavily involved in the huge Marcellus shale region centered on
Pennsylvania through its purchase last year of Atlas Energy and
a recent acreage deal with Chief Oil  Gas. [ID:nN04180588]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the meeting at Chevron headquarters in San Ramon,
California, speakers largely focused on other environmental
topics, including an $18 billion judgment against the company
in Ecuador that it is fighting in a U.S. court.[ID:nN25225194]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokesman said fracking is regulated well enough
at the state level to not need federal oversight, and the
company believes fracking can be done safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We look forward to working with the rest of the industry
to raise the standards in hydraulic fracturing in the Marcellus
and elsewhere," said Kurt Glaubitz, a company spokesman focused
on exploration and production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron also supports the publication of chemicals used in
the process, and the company will make its first disclosure
online by the end of June, he added.

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp defended hydraulic fracturing at its annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, even as investors peppered CEO Rex Tillerson with concerns and questions about the technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A shareholder proposal requiring greater disclosure by Exxon on the risks and impact of its hydraulic fracturing practices was voted down by about 70 percent of the world's largest publicly traded oil company's shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, is a process of injecting a mix of water, chemicals and sand into the earth to break up rock like shale, in order to release oil or natural gas.

"We're not trying to characterize this as an activity that does not have risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the debate should be "fact-based," and said there were claims about the 50-year-old technology that had no basis in fact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To help combat what it considers misinformation, Exxon meets with local officials and politicians and is running a national advertising campaign aimed at addressing concerns about fracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators in states where shale drilling is growing at breakneck speed "are stretched," but rules governing fracking should remain at the state level, not federal level, Tillerson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon made a $35 billion bet on shale gas when it purchased XTO Energy in 201O.

			Chevron Highlights 2010 Performance and Future Growth at Annual 
      Meeting of Stockholders
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today highlighted the company&#8217;s 2010 
      performance and discussed the company&#8217;s future growth at the 2011 Annual 
      Meeting of Stockholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;A combination of safe, reliable operations and superior execution 
      helped make 2010 an outstanding year both operationally and 
      financially,&#8221; said John Watson, chairman and CEO. &#8220;As we look ahead to 
      the next decade, we remain committed to safety and delivering profitable 
      growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Watson discussed Chevron&#8217;s strong 2010 financial and operational 
      performance, which produced earnings of $19 billion. The company 
      increased the quarterly dividend by 5.9 percent in 2010, marking 23 
      consecutive years of annual dividend increases. During this period, 
      dividends grew at an average annual rate of 7 percent. Chevron announced 
      another quarterly dividend increase in April 2011. Watson said that 
      Chevron led its peers in total stockholder return over the past five 
      years, besting the SP 500 by more than 14 percentage points. The 
      company maintained its leading position in total stockholder return 
      through the first quarter of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Watson reinforced Chevron&#8217;s long-standing commitment to safe, reliable 
      operations. Chevron is an industry leader in safety and in 2010 achieved 
      the best safety performance in the company&#8217;s history. He also discussed 
      the partnerships Chevron has formed to address health, education and 
      economic development issues in the communities where the company 
      operates. Over the past four years, Chevron&#8217;s social investments around 
      the world have more than doubled.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      George Kirkland, Chevron vice chairman and executive vice president for 
      Global Upstream and Gas, discussed Chevron&#8217;s world-class queue of 
      projects to meet the world&#8217;s future energy needs. Chevron plans on 
      investing $26 billion in 2011, with 87 percent of that amount expected 
      to fund upstream activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kirkland noted that since late 2009, Chevron has added 14 million acres 
      to its portfolio, including the acquisition of Atlas Energy in the 
      northeast United States, and deepwater opportunities in Liberia and 
      China. Kirkland also discussed Chevron&#8217;s queue of major capital 
      projects, including Gorgon and Wheatstone in Australia. Over the next 
      three years, 25 projects with a Chevron share of more than $250 million 
      each are scheduled to start production, nine of which have a net Chevron 
      share that exceeds $1 billion. Chevron has four major capital projects 
      planned to start up in 2011. Additionally, over the next three years, 
      the company expects to make final investment decisions on 13 more 
      projects, each with a Chevron share in excess of $1 billion. 
      Construction on the Gorgon project is nearly 25 percent complete, with 
      startup expected in 2014, and Chevron remains on schedule to reach a 
      final investment decision this year on the Wheatstone project, with 
      startup planned for 2016.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kirkland also discussed Chevron&#8217;s Downstream and Chemicals business, 
      which delivered improved earnings and competitive performance in 2010. 
      After completing a restructuring, Downstream and Chemicals has a lower 
      cost structure and a portfolio focused on core markets, including North 
      America and Asia. Last year, Chevron had three key downstream project 
      startups at plants in South Korea, in Qatar, and in Pascagoula, 
      Mississippi. Kirkland also discussed Chevron&#8217;s investments in projects 
      that improve energy efficiency, flexibility and product diversity, 
      including the 25,000-barrel-per-day base-oil plant in Pascagoula. When 
      complete in 2013, Chevron will be one of the world&#8217;s leading suppliers 
      of premium base oil. In addition, Chevron plans to deliver $700 million 
      in improvements to its refinery system by the end of 2012, through a 
      combination of improved efficiency, and controllable margin and yield 
      improvement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stockholders voted on 11 proposals and supported the board&#8217;s

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - Skype founder Niklas Zennstrom said Microsoft could capitalize on its $8.5 billion acquisition of the Internet calling service by expanding into mobile and improving video call quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Skype's full potential hasn't been realized yet," said Zennstrom in an interview at the e-G8 forum in Paris, saying improvements in networks and devices such as smartphones meant the experience of using the service was still getting better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that Microsoft has a huge opportunity to integrate it into a lot of their different services," said the Swedish entrepreneur and venture capitalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zennstrom, who along with partner Janus Friis started Skype in 2003 and grew it into an online giant with 145 million users a month, no longer has a management role at Skype and will sell all his shares once the deal with Microsoft closes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how Microsoft could incorporate Skype into its business, Zennstrom declined to provide specifics, adding that it was up to the software giant to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course they have so many different assets. If they do a good job integrating Skype, the company can grow even more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors initially questioned the wisdom of Microsoft's acquisition, especially its high price tag. Its shares are down more than 6 percent since the deal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could combine Skype with its software such as Outlook to appeal to corporate users, while the voice and video communications could link to Microsoft's Xbox live gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype also would offer Microsoft another route to develop its mobile presence, an area into which it has already put more energy and resources -- for example through a partnership with Nokia -- as PC usage comes under threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zennstrom said he thought the service was entering a second phase -- focused on mobiles and video -- after having started out as simply voice calls between desktop computers. "That is a huge opportunity that still has room to grow," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still all travel a lot for meetings because you can't match the intimate experience of seeing someone in person, even with Skype video calling," he said. "There is a lot more work to do on the core technology to improve quality of video calls."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zennstrom previously sold Skype to online auction house eBay in 2005 for roughly $3 billion.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - Skype founder Niklas Zennstrom said Microsoft (MSFT.O) could capitalize on its $8.5 billion acquisition of the Internet calling service by expanding into mobile and improving video call quality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Skype's full potential hasn't been realized yet," said Zennstrom in an interview at the e-G8 forum in Paris, saying improvements in networks and devices such as smartphones meant the experience of using the service was still getting better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that Microsoft has a huge opportunity to integrate it into a lot of their different services," said the Swedish entrepreneur and venture capitalist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zennstrom, who along with partner Janus Friis started Skype in 2003 and grew it into an online giant with 145 million users a month, no longer has a management role at Skype and will sell all his shares once the deal with Microsoft closes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked how Microsoft could incorporate Skype into its business, Zennstrom declined to provide specifics, adding that it was up to the software giant to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Of course they have so many different assets. If they do a good job integrating Skype, the company can grow even more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors initially questioned the wisdom of Microsoft's acquisition, especially its high price tag. Its shares are down more than 6 percent since the deal was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could combine Skype with its software such as Outlook to appeal to corporate users, while the voice and video communications could link to Microsoft's Xbox live gaming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Skype also would offer Microsoft another route to develop its mobile presence, an area into which it has already put more energy and resources -- for example through a partnership with Nokia (NOK1V.HE) -- as PC usage comes under threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zennstrom said he thought the service was entering a second phase -- focused on mobiles and video -- after having started out as simply voice calls between desktop computers. "That is a huge opportunity that still has room to grow," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still all travel a lot for meetings because you can't match the intimate experience of seeing someone in person, even with Skype video calling," he said. "There is a lot more work to do on the core technology to improve quality of video calls."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zennstrom previously sold Skype to online auction house eBay (EBAY.O) in 2005 for roughly $3 billion. In 2009, he was part of a consortium that bought Skype back from eBay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Four deaths during a study of Pfizer's new rheumatoid arthritis pill will be pored over at a medical meeting in London this week, as doctors weigh the drug's chances of upending current clinical practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tofacitinib has the potential to disrupt the rheumatoid arthritis market -- currently dominated by multibillion-dollar injections -- by offering patients a more convenient twice-daily tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the experimental drug's prospects have been clouded by safety worries following news that four patients died after taking it in a late-stage Phase III study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Joel Kremer of Albany Medical College, the primary investigator for the study, told Reuters that this number of deaths was not unusual, given the profile of patients involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer itself said last month that three of the deaths were determined by local investigators not to be study related, leaving just one case of a 58-year-old U.S. patient with respiratory infection linked to the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But deciding causality is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kremer said it seemed clear two of the other deaths -- one due to brain trauma and one caused by heart failure in a Chinese patient with valvular disease -- were not linked to tofacitinib, but the case of a 48-year-old Russian patient was less certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Russian patient, on the lower 5 milligram dose of the drug, died 42 days after discontinuing treatment from a respiratory complication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's unlikely that two of the four were associated (with tofacitinib). It's possible that the other two of the four were associated, but based upon the information I have it's impossible to say with absolute certainty," Kremer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Results of the study will be laid out at a news conference on Wednesday, ahead of presentation to the annual meeting of the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Headline findings in March already declared the trial a success and Kremer said the drug's effectiveness was "in the same ballpark" as injected biotech drugs, such as Abbott's $6.5 billion-a-year blockbuster Humira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 792-patient trial tested two doses of tofacitinib against placebo in people with rheumatoid arthritis who failed to respond to an existing disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Significant and sustained responses were seen within a few weeks and, after six months, 58.3 percent of patients on the higher 10 mg dose had a 20 percent improvement in symptoms, such as swollen joints, pain and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MONITORING SAFETY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Georg Schett, head of rheumatology and immunology at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg and a member of EULAR's scientific committee, who was not involved in the research, said tofacitinib looked promising but safety was a critical factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key issue from this data is that safety has to be carefully monitored -- also when the drug is approved," he said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's clear that you have to be careful about a drop in white blood cell counts, which is usually mild but can lead to increased rates of infection, and also increased lipid levels."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Infection risk and raised cholesterol -- a potential problem for heart safety -- are among the drug's known side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer hopes to capture a large chunk of the arthritis market with its so-called JAK inhibitor pill, which works by blocking signals from entering cells that would activate inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, have forecast annual tofacitinib sales of $1.1 billion by 2015, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It should be filed for approval by the end of 2011 and Pfizer believes it has a healthy lead over rivals. "We are one phase ahead and that usually translates to about two years," said Saeed Fatenejad, head of inflammation drug development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the U.S. drugmaker has its work cut out to displace successful injected drugs like Humira, Johnson  Johnson's Remicade and Amgen's Enbrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, other companies are chasing Pfizer with rival JAK inhibitors and AstraZeneca also has another kind of oral arthritis drug in development called a SYK inhibitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visafone Announces the Availability of the Motorola Milestone XT800 at the 2011
Africa CDMA Summit Hosted by the CDMA Development Group

LAGOS, Nigeria, May 25, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The CDMA Development Group
(CDG) kicked off the 2011 Africa CDMA Summit today, where Nigerian operator
Visafone announced the immediate availability of the Motorola Milestone(TM)
XT800.

The XT800 is an Android smartphone developed by Motorola as part of the CDG's
Open Market Handset (OMH) initiative to increase device availability, operator
flexibility and consumer choice in CDMA2000(R) devices. Currently enjoying
commercial success on the open market in India, this high-end smartphone is now
exclusively available to Visafone's customers in Nigeria as the flagship device
in its CDMA2000 product portfolio.

"Visafone's launch of the Motorola Milestone XT800 is an example of what the OMH
program is intended to accomplish by creating greater device variety and
flexible distribution channels for operators," said Perry LaForge, executive
director of the CDG. "We hope this smartphone launch will encourage other CDMA
operators to benefit from the OMH program when looking to bring high-end devices
with proven success to Africa."

OMH devices move operator-specific network configuration, service provisioning
and subscriber-identity data onto an OMH SIM card rather than in the handset's
internal memory. A device developed to the OMH standard is therefore designed
independent of the operator, since it will work with any operator's OMH SIM.
This results in devices that can be sold on the "open market" and used by
multiple operators, and provides consumers with a greater selection of CDMA2000
devices and the mobile data services they desire. The open market model also
improves device time-to-market, expands distribution channels and reduces
inventory risk for manufacturers and operators. Visafone is currently one of 17
operators in Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, Thailand
and Vietnam that support the OMH initiative.

"Our customers have clearly expressed their demand for a greater variety of
Android-based devices, and we are excited to offer the Motorola Milestone XT800
to our customers," said Sailesh Iyer, Managing Director and CEO of Visafone.
"The XT800 has already proven to be a successful Android smartphone in other
CDMA markets such as India, and because of OMH we are able to add Nigeria to the
list."

The Motorola Milestone XT800 offers CDMA2000 1X and EV-DO Rev. A connectivity in
the 800 and 1900 MHz frequency bands. It utilizes the Android 2.1 mobile phone
platform, which has access to over 350 thousand applications for use on the
handset's WVGA zoom capacitive touch display, music player and video player.
Users can also access corporate email over Wi-Fi and store images taken with its
5 megapixel camera on up to 32GB of expandable memory.

"It is exciting to see Visafone and Motorola bringing this innovative smartphone
to Nigeria," said James Munn, vice president of business development for
Sub-Saharan Africa at Qualcomm Incorporated. "This launch exemplifies how OMH
enables high-end Android smartphones to be developed and brought to market
quickly, either for an open market environment or for exclusive distribution,
and without requiring a lengthy, customized testing process."

Industry research firm IDC recently issued a white paper titled, "OMH: Unlocking
the Open Market Potential for CDMA Devices," which explores the opportunity for
operators and manufacturers to succeed with OMH. The white paper can be

&lt;p&gt; * Safety of tofacitinib in spotlight at medical meeting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * EULAR president says clinical study results "impressive"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Efficacy seen around the same as for anti-TNF injections&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Updates with more reaction from doctor, analyst)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ben Hirschler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, May 25 (Reuters) - Pfizer's (PFE.N) new rheumatoid
arthritis pill impressed experts at a medical meeting in London
on Wednesday, despite four deaths in a study that spooked
investors last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tofacitinib is Pfizer's biggest pipeline hope and could
become the first major new medicine to come from its own labs
since Viagra more than a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has the potential to upend the rheumatoid arthritis (RA)
market -- currently dominated by multibillion-dollar injections
-- by offering patients a more convenient twice-daily tablet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the experimental drug's prospects have been clouded by
safety worries following news that four patients died after
taking it in a late-stage Phase III study. [ID:nN21295734]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Emery, president of the European League Against
Rheumatism (EULAR) and a rheumatologist from Leeds Teaching
Hospital, said the trial results presented at the organisation's
annual meeting showed tofacitinib had considerable potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a very impressive drug," he told reporters. "The way
it is priced will have the biggest influence on its market
penetration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emery said such mortality rates were to be expected among RA
patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said last month that three of the deaths were
determined by local investigators not to be study related,
leaving just one case of a 58-year-old U.S. man with respiratory
infection linked to the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But deciding causality is not easy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joel Kremer of Albany Medical College, the primary
investigator for the study, told Reuters it seemed clear two of
the other deaths -- one due to brain trauma and one caused by
heart failure in a Chinese patient with valvular disease -- were
not linked to tofacitinib, but the case of a 48-year-old Russian
man was less certain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Russian patient, on the lower 5 milligram dose of the
drug, died 42 days after discontinuing treatment from a
respiratory complication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's unlikely that two of the four were associated (with
tofacitinib). It's possible that the other two of the four were
associated, but based upon the information I have it's
impossible to say with absolute certainty," Kremer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results of the study were laid out at a news conference,
ahead of presentation to the EULAR meeting on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Headline findings in March already declared the trial a
success and Kremer said the drug's effectiveness was "in the
same ballpark" as injected biotech drugs, such as Abbott's
(ABT.N) $6.5 billion-a-year blockbuster Humira.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 792-patient trial tested two doses of tofacitinib
against placebo in people with rheumatoid arthritis who failed
to respond to an existing disease modifying anti-rheumatic drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Significant and sustained responses were seen within a few
weeks and, after six months, 58.3 percent of patients on the
higher 10 mg dose had a 20 percent improvement in symptoms, such
as swollen joints, pain and disability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MONITORING SAFETY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Georg Schett, head of rheumatology and immunology at the
University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, said tofacitinib looked
promising but safety was a critical factor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's clear that you have to be careful about a drop in
white blood cell counts, which is usually mild but can lead to
increased rates of infection, and also increased lipid levels,"
he said in an interview&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Infection risk and raised cholesterol -- a potential problem
for heart safety -- are among the drug's known side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another EULAR study showed that adding Pfizer's existing
drug Lipitor to tofacitinib helped bring down cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss said the rate of
deaths among elderly RA patients in various studies was very
similar to that with other potent treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "My conclusion is that tofacitinib is no different from any
of the other RA drugs," he said. What would be worrying was if
all the deaths were from the same cause, such as heart attack,
but in fact they have been "all over the place" Purkiss said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer hopes to capture a large chunk of the market with its
so-called JAK inhibitor pill, which works by blocking signals
from entering cells that would activate inflammatory responses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, have forecast annual tofacitinib sales
of $1.1 billion by 2015, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It should be filed for approval by the end of 2011 and
Pfizer believes it has a healthy lead over rivals. "We are one
phase ahead and that usually translates to about two years,"
said Saeed Fatenejad, head of inflammation drug development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the U.S. drugmaker has its work cut out to displace
successful injected drugs like Humira, Johnson  Johnson's
(JNJ.N) Remicade and Amgen's (AMGN.O) Enbrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, other companies are chasing Pfizer with rival JAK
inhibitors and AstraZeneca (AZN.L) also has another kind of oral
arthritis drug in development called a SYK inhibitor.

			Ping Identity Launches New Consumer Cloud Identity Tools for 
      LinkedIn, Twitter, and Microsoft Live
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Connectors Streamline Consumer Authentication at Online Businesses, 
      Increasing Registration and Purchase Rates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Ping 
      Identity&#174;, the leader in Cloud Identity Security, today 
      announced the release of PingFederate&#174; 
      Cloud Identity Connectors for LinkedIn, Twitter, and Microsoft Live, 
      enabling enterprise organizations to rely on cloud services providers 
      and social networking sites for third-party user authentication. Ping 
      Identity can now connect cloud businesses with six of the largest cloud 
      service and social network sites, including Google (and other OpenID 2.0 
      providers), Salesforce and Facebook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The registration process is a source of frustration for consumers 
      online &#8211; they are just as likely to leave a site as they are to spend 
      the time to create a new identity profile. To increase registration and 
      purchase rates, online businesses need to make access easier, without 
      compromising security,&#8221; said Roger Oberg, Vice President of Marketing 
      for Ping Identity. &#8220;PingFederate Cloud Identity Connectors provide our 
      customers with ways to simply and securely authenticate their users into 
      their Web properties by leveraging LinkedIn and other popular social 
      networking services.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A recent survey by Blue Research found that cloud identity barriers have 
      a significant impact on online business, with 75 percent of online 
      shoppers stating they may leave or not use a site that requires 
      registration. The survey also found that 45 percent of respondents would 
      rather leave a website if they forget password or login information, 
      instead of re-setting passwords1. The Ping Identity Cloud 
      Identity Connectors avoid consumer registration pain-points by using the 
      identity profiles of the most widely used social networks on the 
      Internet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Giving our customers the option to let their users access their 
      purpose-built Fuz1on portal with social network credentials makes it 
      even easier to access the work apps they need anytime, anywhere,&#8221; said 
      Fred Brown, EVP of SaaS social business solutions provider Fuz1on. &#8220;Ping 
      Identity&#8217;s expanding list of Connectors provides even more choices for 
      our customers, ensuring user adoption and usage, as well as increased 
      customer satisfaction.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			How PingFederate Cloud Identity Connectors Work
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The LinkedIn, Twitter, and Microsoft Live Cloud Identity Connectors 
      enable any of these social networking sites to be used for third party 
      authentication. Users visiting an e-business site can sign-on and 
      register using an existing consumer identity. This significantly 
      improves registration rates by eliminating the need to develop a new 
      profile and create another password, while providing a more personalized 
      user experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Installed as an add on to PingFederate, 
      the identity connectors use configuration information from PingFederate 
      to create the HTML and javascript code necessary to develop compelling 
      log-in pages featuring the logos of the top social networking websites. 
      The Cloud Identity Connectors interface with the LinkedIn, Twitter, and 
      Microsoft Live APIs utilizing OAuth for consent/authorization and 
      authentication. The access token obtained during this interaction can be 
      used to authenticate subsequent API calls in order to gather additional 
      data about the user or push information to the application.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Nigeria says Exxon leases on huge oil blocks are invalid&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Delayed reforms hamper license renewals with oil majors&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, oil reforms)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joe Brock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABUJA, May 25 (Reuters) - Nigeria is making progress towards
resolving a dispute with U.S. energy giant Exxon Mobil (XOM.N)
over oil licensing renewals covering fields producing more than
500,000 barrels per day, the state oil firm said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said last week it signed agreements in 2009 with the
Nigerian government for the long-term renewal of licenses OML
67, 68 and 70, which it operates as part of a joint venture with
state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nigerian government has said these licenses are invalid
and Exxon needs to express a new interest in acquiring leases
for these valuable oil blocks. An NNPC spokesman said the oil
major had now done this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon decline to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are on track," the spokesman told Reuters when asked
about resolving the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The disputed blocks are situated in the shallow water creeks
of the Niger Delta and are some of the largest oil-producing
assets in Africa's largest energy industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Delays to wide-ranging energy reforms mean several expired
drilling licenses dating back as far as 2008 have not been
renewed with foreign oil companies, including Royal Dutch Shell
(RDSa.L) and Chevron (CVX.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nigerian government has been reluctant to sign new deals
until the Petroleum Industry Bill (PIB), which is likely to
increase royalties and taxes, has been passed into law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the ambitious legislation has been subject to years of
delays, costing the Nigerian government billions of dollars in
lost investment, according to oil executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The National Assembly is debating the bill, but the current
parliamentary administration ends on June 3 following April's
elections. If the PIB is not passed by then, new lawmakers may
make amendments that could lead to months of further delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government hopes the bill will tackle issues including
funding shortfalls at its joint ventures with foreign firms,
insecurity in the Niger Delta, increasing local involvement in
the industry and production of more gas for domestic power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by William Hardy)

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA May 25 (Reuters) - Nigeria is making progress towards
resolving a dispute with U.S. energy giant Exxon Mobil (XOM.N)
over oil licensing renewals covering fields producing more than
500,000 barrels per day (bpd), the state oil firm said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon said last week it signed agreements in 2009 with the
Nigerian government for the long-term renewal of licenses OML
67, 68 and 70, which it operates as part of a joint venture with
state-run Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nigerian government has said these licenses are invalid
and Exxon needs to express a new interest in acquiring leases
for these blocks. An NNPC spokesman said on Wednesday the oil
major had now done this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are on track," the spokesman told Reuters when asked
about resolving the dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Joe Brock; editing by William Hardy)

			Ramtron Ships First F-RAM Samples Built on New IBM Manufacturing Line
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ramtron International Corporation (Nasdaq: RMTR), a leading developer 
      and supplier of ferroelectric-based low-power memory and integrated 
      semiconductor products, today announced broad sampling of the first 
      pre-qualification ferroelectric random access memory (F-RAM) devices 
      built on the company&#8217;s new manufacturing line at IBM Corporation (NYSE: 
      IBM). The FM24C04C and FM24C16C are serial 5-volt devices with 4- and 
      16-kilobits of F-RAM memory, respectively. The devices offer a 
      high-performance nonvolatile data collection and storage solution for 
      electronic systems. Ramtron&#8217;s F-RAM products provide nonvolatile RAM 
      memory performance with NoDelay&#8482; writes, high read/write endurance, and 
      low power consumption.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Releasing samples of the FM24C04C and FM24C16C devices is a significant 
      milestone in our new foundry program,&#8221; said Eric Balzer, Ramtron&#8217;s CEO. 
      &#8220;These pre-qualification devices, which meet all datasheet 
      specifications and our stringent quality standards, are available now 
      for customer evaluation. Additional devices, including 3-volt I2C and 3- 
      and 5-volt SPI products, will become available for sampling as testing 
      is completed.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The FM24C04C and FM24C16C feature a serial I2C interface, have an active 
      current of 100&#181;A (typical at 100kHz) and perform up to 1MHz bus 
      frequency. The devices are direct drop-in replacements for 4- and 16-Kb 
      serial EEPROM memories used in industrial controls, metering, medical, 
      military, gaming, and computing applications, among others. The FM24C04C 
      and FM24C16C are offered in an industry standard 8-pin SOIC package and 
      operate over the industrial temperature range of -40&#176;C to +85&#176;C.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ramtron&#8217;s FM24CxxC products offer single-byte writes that are 200 times 
      faster than those of EEPROM. In addition, the devices offer no timing 
      delays and can be written to at standard bus speeds as compared to 
      EEPROM, which requires a 5- to 10-millisecond write delay before new 
      data can be registered. The FM24C04C and FM24C16C feature 1-trillion 
      write cycles, compared to 1-million write cycles for EEPROM, and have an 
      extremely low operating current compared to competing nonvolatile memory 
      products.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			About the IBM/Ramtron Foundry Relationship
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ramtron and IBM entered into a foundry services agreement in early 2009 
      that called for the installation of Ramtron&#8217;s F-RAM semiconductor 
      process technology in IBM&#8217;s Burlington, Vermont, advanced wafer 
      manufacturing facility. Ramtron&#8217;s proprietary F-RAM technology stack has 
      been inserted into IBM&#8217;s 0.18 micron CMOS process to create Ramtron&#8217;s 
      signature high-performance nonvolatile F-RAM products. IBM&#8217;s world-class 
      foundry provides a flexible and cost effective manufacturing platform 
      for Ramtron&#8217;s existing products and new product development initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Ramtron and F-RAM Technology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ramtron International Corporation, headquartered in Colorado Springs, 
      Colorado, is a fabless semiconductor company that designs, develops and 
      markets specialized semiconductor memory and integrated semiconductor 
      solutions used in a wide range of product applications and markets 
      worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ramtron pioneered the integration of ferroelectric materials into 
      semiconductor products, which enabled the development of a new class of 
      nonvolatile memory, called ferroelectric random access memory, or F-RAM. 
      Ramtron&#8217;s ferroelectric memories combine the high speed of DRAM (Dynamic 
      Random Access Memory) with nonvolatile data storage, or the ability to 
      save data without power. Since commercializing the technology, Ramtron 
      has sold nearly a half-billion F-RAM devices into demanding applications 
      such as automotive safety and entertainment systems, portable medical 
      devices, industrial process control systems, smart electricity meters, 
      and consumer printer cartridges. As the most power-efficient of any 
      nonvolatile memory technology on the market, F-RAM products promise to 
      pave the way for the development of ultra-efficient battery powered 
      products and energy harvesting applications, among others. For more

&lt;p&gt;SHENZHEN (Reuters) - ZTE Corp, China's No.2 network equipment maker, plans to launch LTE (long term evolution) devices in the United States along with smartphones based on Microsoft's Mango operating system to expand its U.S. footprint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shenzhen-based company plans to roll out LTE devices in the United States in the second half of this year and aims to launch its Mango smartphones early next year, ZTE's U.S. CEO Cheng Lixin told Reuters in an interview on Wednesday during a company event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Phone carriers in the U.S. have expressed a lot of interest and we've said that we'll support Mango.

&lt;p&gt;SHENZHEN May 25 (Reuters) - ZTE Corp  ,
China's No.2 network equipment maker, plans to launch
smartphones based on Microsoft Corp's Mango operating
system in Europe in the third quarter of this year, executives
said.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We are already working on a smartphone based on Mango and
it will be launched in Europe," Jeffrey Fan, a vice-president
from ZTE's terminal devices unit, told Reuters during a company
event on Wednesday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft launched an update of its Windows phone software
code-named Mango on Tuesday, hoping a host of new features will
help it close the gap on smartphone leaders Google Inc 
and Apple Inc . 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ZTE and larger Chinese rival Huawei Technologies Co Ltd
 , traditionally in the network equipment business, have
been aggressively entering the fast-growing mobile devices
sector by rolling out smartphones and tablet PCs.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ZTE expects to ship more than 80 million handsets this year,
up by a third from last year's 60 million units, an executive
told Reuters earlier this year.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shipments of smartphones, which run Google Inc's 
Android operating system, would rise to 12 million units from 3
million last year, ZTE said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the fourth quarter of last year, ZTE became the
fourth-largest handset maker by unit shipments globally, ranking
behind Nokia ?Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and LG
Electronics Inc , market research group IDC said.

&lt;p&gt; * Refinery production was cut after docks closed 	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Docks closed May 11 by flooding Mississippi	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 	
 (Adds details, background)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, May 24 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's 
504,500 barrel per day (bpd) Baton Rouge, Louisiana, refinery
reopened part of its Mississippi River docks on Tuesday, a
company spokesman said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Refinery production has been cut by at least 10 percent
since the docks were shut on May 11 after being covered by the
rain-swollen Mississippi which has reached near record flood
levels at Baton Rouge, sources have told Reuters.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Baton Rouge refinery, which is the nation's second
largest, uses the docks to receive feedstock and send out
products by barge. The refinery's storage tanks were approaching
full late last week, the sources said, creating the risk of
further cuts in production.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon made the decision to reopen the docks after studying
safety conditions.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After a thorough safety assessment, we partially reopened
the docks facilities at our Baton Rouge complex on Tuesday to
receive some shipments and load products," said Exxon's Kevin
Allexon in a statement.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil continues to monitor the high water situation
and will make adjustments as necessary."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flood levels crested last week at Baton Rouge at 45 feet
(13.72 meters) after the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers opened the
Morganza Spillway, 45 miles (72.4 km) northwest, to drain off
floodwaters.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Baton Rouge refinery receives most of its crude oil via

			Vision Solutions Launches New Resilience Capabilities for Virtualised 
      Environments and Microsoft Exchange 2010
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New versions of Double-Take Availability, Double-Take RecoverNow and 
      Double-Take Move offer improved protection and management features for 
      disaster recovery and high availability of virtual, physical and 
      cloud-hosted systems
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Vision 
      Solutions, Inc., a leading provider of information availability 
      software and services with over 25,000 customers running Windows, Linux, 
      IBM Power Systems and Cloud Computing environments, today announced the 
      release of the latest versions of its Double-Take Move, RecoverNow and 
      Availability products. The updates in version 5.3 expand support for 
      virtualised IT environments as well as providing faster and easier 
      installation of disaster recovery solutions for virtual machines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Highlights:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Simplified management and protection for virtual environments - Double-Take
				Availability 5.3 provides the ability to configure the protection 
        of VMs in aggregate without the need to pre-install software on each 
        virtual machine (VM).&#160;Rather than having to install a Double-Take 
        software agent on each VM prior to configuration, version 5.3 allows 
        the administrator to configure protection of VMs at the host level 
        instead.&#160;All the required functionality and agent software is 
        automatically injected into the VM in the background as protection for 
        the VM is configured and started.
      
			
				Improved protection for virtual clusters - For remote 
        availability of workloads based on Microsoft Hyper-V, Double-Take 
        Availability now supports protection of clustered Hyper-V hosts over 
        wide area networks. The integration of Hyper-V clustering and 
        Double-Take real-time replication of data provides unified local 
        availability and remote availability for Hyper-V hosts. As part of 
        this, administrators also have the choice to set the IP address to use 
        on the target side, providing greater flexibility around fail-over.
      
			
				Expanded Microsoft Exchange support - Double-Take Availability 
        5.3
				now supports protection of Exchange 2010 in Database 
        Availability Group (DAG) environments - this is particularly valuable 
        for organisations that want to implement disaster recovery for DAG 
        installations across low-bandwidth environments.&#160;Double-Take 
        RecoverNow 5.3 also enhances its protection of Exchange 2010 by now 
        offering Exchange log file trimming capabilities. This ability to 
        schedule trimming of log files on the production server is coordinated 
        with application consistent recovery points on the repository server 
        for the flexibility to recover from the most recent data or an earlier 
        application-consistent snapshot.
      
			
				Updated OS support - Double-Take 5.3 now supports Microsoft 
        Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1 across the Availability, RecoverNow and 
        Move products.
      
			
				Simplified, effective Failback operations - Minimising downtime 
        with an effective availability plan is only half the battle. Getting 
        back to &#8220;how things were&#8221;, or failing back, can be just as stressful, 
        as the process can incur its own downtime.&#160;Double-Take Availability 
        5.3 adds additional capabilities to both full-server failover and VM 
        failover to reduce the potential for downtime during a failback. New 
        within Double-Take 5.3 is support for multi-job failback tasks and 
        enterprise-wide monitoring capabilities.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) board stood behind Chief Executive Officer Steve Ballmer on Thursday, defending its longtime leader after influential hedge fund manager David Einhorn touched off a debate by calling for his dismissal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fund manager, who made his name warning about Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEHMQ.PK financial health before the investment bank's collapse, accused Ballmer on Wednesday evening of being stuck in the past, launching the sharpest attack yet by a high-profile investor against the company's leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn's comments, which echo what some investors have said for some years in private, caused a stir on Wall Street and helped Microsoft shares climb 2 percent on Thursday to $24.67.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His continued presence is the biggest overhang on Microsoft's stock," Einhorn told fellow fund managers at the annual Ira Sohn Investment Research Conference in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's nine-person board, including Chairman and co-founder Bill Gates, supports Ballmer, a source close to the board told Reuters on Thursday. Microsoft itself declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates, who co-founded the software company in 1975 and is still the largest shareholder with 6.6 percent of the company's stock, is generally regarded as the one person who could make the decision to switch management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bill Gates is a ruthless capitalist. If he wanted to, he'd walk Ballmer to the door himself," said a fund manager at one of Microsoft's largest shareholders, who asked to remain anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates, who spends most of his time on his philanthropic foundation, has given no indication he is considering a change. A representative declined comment on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DISSATISFACTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other investors acknowledged Microsoft's stock has suffered under Ballmer, but stopped short of calling for his ouster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought the board was firmly behind Steve, and the only way Steve was going to leave was if Steve wanted to leave," said Eric Jackson at hedge fund Ironfire Capital, which sold its position in Microsoft last autumn, disappointed the company would not lift its dividend higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see anybody else on the management team at Microsoft that I think would be much better than Ballmer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whitney Tilson, founder and managing partner of T2 Partners LLC, which holds Microsoft stock, suggested Ballmer might be running out of steam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This dissatisfaction with Ballmer, with the company, is more than baked into the stock," said Tilson in an appearance on financial news channel CNBC.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - An unfriendly U.S. tourist visa system is bad for the luxury business and the government needs to ease its rules, according to industry officials.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expense of applying for a tourist visa for the United States, followed by an often weeks-long wait to get the document, is turning off a lot of wealthy tourists from Russia, Brazil and China and leading them to choose Europe for their shopping vacations, several executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We absolutely want to support the safety of the U.S., but what's unclear to me is how waiting three months to get a visa because there's a backlog, as opposed to two weeks, makes the country any safer," Starwood Hotels and Resorts (HOT.N) Chief Executive Frits van Paasschen told the Reuters Global Luxury and Fashion Summit this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International visitors spent $103.1 billion in the United States in 2010, up 10 percent from a year earlier. Spending by Chinese and Brazilian tourists rose 39 percent and 30 percent, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That growth could be even higher if the United States eased its visa rules, executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you go to Paris, to Galeries Lafayette and Printemps, you go to London, you go to Harrod's, the Asian tourists, the Brazilian tourists, the Russian tourists are very brand-conscious, very luxury-focused," Saks Inc SKS.N CEO Steve Sadove said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They would clearly love to see the U.S. cities as much as some of the European cities," he added. Saks' flagship store on Manhattan's Fifth Avenue is a major tourist attraction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Starwood's famed St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan, 35 percent of guests are foreign tourists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INDUSTRY LOBBIES GOVERNMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the U.S. Travel Association urged the government to overhaul its visa system, saying it serves as a virtual "keep out" sign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trade group wants the U.S. State Department to extend its visa waiver program to more countries, and ensure it has enough staff to quickly process visa applications. It says the steps would boost tourism and tourist spending in the United States, creating 1.3 million jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If those (visa) regulations were lightened, would it help the tourism business? Absolutely," said Neiman Marcus Group NMRCUS.UL CEO Karen Katz. The chain's Bergdorf Goodman store in Manhattan is also a big draw for tourists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A State Department official told Reuters the Obama administration understands the industry's concerns and its role in the U.S. economy, but must weigh security and immigration issues, hence the need for in-person interviews for visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Department officials met with U.S. Travel Association representatives earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Europeans, Canadians and Australians are among those who do not need visas when they visit the United States as tourists. Citizens of most other countries need visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department says it has issued 13.4 percent more visas so far this fiscal year than in the same period a year earlier. It says the number of tourist visas issued to Chinese nationals has risen 124 percent in the last five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chinese travelers are among the world's biggest spenders. snapping up Louis Vuitton LVMH (LVMH.PA) bags and jewelry at Tiffany  Co (TIF.N) in the world capitals they visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They are set to overtake their Japanese counterparts as the second-largest luxury spender behind the United States within a few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. Commerce Department study forecast the number of Chinese tourists visiting the United States will more than triple in the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Quite frankly, the Chinese tourist is today the dominant influence in the gateway cities," Polo Ralph Lauren (RL.N) Chief Operating Officer Roger Farah said on a call with Wall Street analysts on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourists' dollars don't only benefit stores or hotels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our sales at duty free are mindboggling," said Bernd Fritz, chief executive of the perfume company Coty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Phil Wahba; additional reporting by Jeremy Pelofsky; Editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

			Chevron Announces $2 Million Investment in South Bay Schools
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Million Dollar Field Trip&#8221; Marks El Segundo Refinery&#8217;s Centennial
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, Chevron completed the distribution of its 2011 &#8220;Energy for 
      Learning&#8221; grants delivered via a yellow school bus to South Bay schools. 
      The grants represent a significant increase in funding for local 
      Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM)-related education 
      programs through Chevron&#8217;s Energy for Learning program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The $2 million investment is a reflection of the Chevron El Segundo 
      Refinery&#8217;s ongoing support for education programs in the region and 
      celebrates the facility&#8217;s 100-year anniversary in El Segundo. The grants 
      are part of Chevron&#8217;s California Partnership, an initiative targeting 
      investments in education and economic development throughout the 
      company&#8217;s home state.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Education is the cornerstone of our state&#8217;s competitiveness,&#8221; said 
      Frank Semancik, General Manager, Chevron El Segundo Refinery. 
      &#8220;Supporting STEM is a key Chevron value, and these funds are truly an 
      investment in preparing the next generation workforce for increasingly 
      technical careers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among the grant recipients is Environmental Charter High School (ECHS), 
      which will direct its grant funds toward renovating science and math 
      classrooms to meet the National Science and Mathematics Education 
      Program Standards. The grant will help extend math and science education 
      beyond the classroom through the enhancement of outdoor learning spaces 
      at ECHS.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;STEM programs and increased student achievement are a top priority,&#8221; 
      said Alison Suffet Diaz, Founder and Executive Director of Environmental 
      Charter Schools. &#8220;This funding fulfills a great demand for advanced 
      science and math classrooms since each student is required to take four 
      years of lab courses.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Manhattan Beach Middle School will use its grant to continue to provide 
      support for the Chevron Futures Institute for the Advancement of Young 
      Women in Science, Mathematics, and Technology. In addition, the school 
      will also use a portion of the funds to create Chevron Futures 
      Institutes curriculum for male students. With a strong emphasis on 
      creative problem solving and teamwork, the program includes studies in 
      robotics, genetic engineering, alternative energy, bioinformatics, 
      telematics, astrogeology, astrophysiology, astrobiology, space and ocean 
      exploration, and environmental issues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The economic growth of California is dependent upon quality education 
      for students,&#8221; said Geoff Yantz, superintendent of El Segundo Unified 
      School District. &#8220;Allowing our schools to emphasize STEM curriculum 
      helps us build a promising future.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another grant will be used by the Da Vinci Schools to outfit a 
      campus-based Chevron Energy Center, which is designed to provide 
      project-based curriculum emphasizing the chemistry fundamentals of 
      fossil fuels and alternative energy sources. Chevron&#8217;s gift will be used 
      to provide the school with state-of-the-art lab equipment where students 
      will learn chemistry content through investigations similar to those 
      that might be conducted in the professional chemical engineering 
      industry, including Chevron&#8217;s own labs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron&#8217;s investment&#160;in education in the South Bay&#160;supports our school 
      districts' efforts to&#160;increase and broaden their educational offerings,&#8221; 
      said Don Knabe, Los Angeles County Supervisor representing the County&#8217;s 4th 
      District. &#8220;As an&#160;important contributor to the state&#8217;s economy, 
      their&#160;investment in education&#160;expands the availability of&#160;innovative 
      K-12 education programs and helps prepare young people with the 
      knowledge and skills needed for the jobs of tomorrow.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs believes its clients are "largely past" the regulatory investigations and accusations that have surrounded the bank, according to an analyst who met its Chief Financial Officer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Chief Financial Officer David Viniar said the bank does not expect the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission to bring any more claims against it after a $550 million settlement last year, according to a report from Susquehanna Financial Group analyst David Hilder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viniar also said a report from a Senate subcommittee -- known as the Levin report -- unfairly accused the bank's employees of failing to disclose information at hearings, according Hilder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Clients have moved on, Viniar told Hilder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers paid the bank more than $9.2 billion in the first quarter, excluding revenue from Goldman's investing and lending activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many large and small firms competed with (Goldman Sachs) for that revenue, and clients chose to pay it to (Goldman)," Hilder wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. government chose Goldman as the lead seller of nearly $9 billion worth of American International Group Inc (AIG.N) stock, as well as Chrysler debt, Viniar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has been the subject of intense scrutiny for more than a year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Influential hedge fund manager David Einhorn has called for Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer to step down, saying the world's largest software company's leader is stuck in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"His continued presence is the biggest overhang on Microsoft's stock," Einhorn said in reference to Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments by outspoken Einhorn, who made his name warning about Lehman Brothers' financial health before the investment bank's collapse, are the most pointed yet from a high-profile investor against Microsoft's leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares, which have been static for over a decade, gained 0.87 percent in after-hours trading after Einhorn's comments, the most of any Dow Jones industrial average component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software giant, which was the largest U.S. company by market value in the late 1990s, has since been overtaken by Apple Inc and IBM in market value, and is no longer seen as a dominating force in technology after a failure to capitalize on new Internet and mobile computing markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock is down 6 percent in the last two weeks alone after Microsoft agreed to pay $8.5 billion for Internet phone service Skype, a move which mystified many investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the annual Ira Sohn Investment Research Conference in New York on Wednesday, Einhorn said it was time for Ballmer -- who succeeded co-founder Bill Gates in 2000 -- to step aside and "give someone else a chance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn's comments echo what some investors have said for some years in private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesman declined comment on Einhorn's remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECENT BUYER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn's Greenlight Capital hedge fund has been a recent buyer of Microsoft stock, which at under 10 times expected earnings is regarded by many as undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenlight held about 9 million shares in Microsoft, or 0.11 percent of the company's outstanding shares, at the end of the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn also said it was time for Microsoft to consider strategic alternatives for its money-losing online business, which has so far failed to win share from online search leader Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online services unit, which runs the Bing search engine and MSN web portal, had a loss of $726 million last quarter and has now lost $7 billion in four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing has made some progress, raising its U.S. Internet search market share to 14 percent from 8 percent in the two years since launch, but has not taken any share from Google, which has held on to its 65 percent share, according to research firm comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OLD FOES APPLE, IBM REVIVED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Microsoft was overtaken by IBM in market value for the first time in 15 years, chiefly because of Microsoft's static share price. Apple roared past it last year to become the world's most valuable tech company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Graphic showing market value of Apple, IBM and Microsoft over time: r.reuters.com/jaw69r )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investor who put $100,000 into Microsoft stock 10 years ago would now have about $69,000 worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn, the president of Greenlight Capital, which had $7.8 billion of assets as of January 1, made his name with the prescient call on Lehman's accounting troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2008, Einhorn said Lehman -- and its then-Chief Financial Officer Erin Callan -- had understated its own problems and needed to raise capital to support a balance sheet peppered with risky assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn's public speeches on the matter in April and May 2008 -- including one at the Ira Sohn conference that year -- touched a nerve with other investors and are widely credited as leading to Callan's departure from the company a few months before its collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares, which gained 4 cents in normal trading, ended up a further 12 cents at $24.31 in after-hours activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, Svea Herbst and Edwin Chan; Editing by Steve Orlofsky, Lisa Shumaker and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

      Worldwide Power  Utilities Industry, Microsoft. &#8220;Bentley&#8217;s V8i 
      portfolio fully leverages the enhanced user experience, increased 
      performance, and improved ability to find and access information that 
      Windows 7 delivers. As a result, Bentley software users can take 
      advantage of multi-touch interfaces and multiscreen monitors, save time

			IBM Validates Obsidian's Longbow for DB2 pureScale Stretch Clusters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Mission Critical&#8221; Solution for Disaster Recovery and Business 
      Continuity
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following several months of system testing, Obsidian is pleased to 
      announce that IBM has now validated LongbowTM configurations 
      for its flagship database product, DB2 pureScaleTM. Matt 
      Huras, IBM&#8217;s Chief Architect for DB2 pureScale, included material on the 
      &#8220;Geographically Dispersed DB2 PureScale Cluster&#8221; (or GDPC for short) in 
      his presentation to a receptive audience of knowledgeable network 
      administrators at the International DB2 User Group held earlier this 
      month. Complete details on the solution can be found in an IBM white 
      paper (URL listed below).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/data/library/long/dm-1104purescalegdpc/index.html
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DB2 pureScale is a clustered database implementation capable of scaling 
      from small footprints up to very large installations which combine the 
      power of many servers to deliver world-class database performance and 
      mission critical reliability. DB2 pureScale's servers are interconnected 
      with InfiniBand technology, which has historically prevented DB2 
      pureScale from offering multi-site disaster tolerance. Obsidian and IBM 
      have now removed this restriction with the announcement of GDPC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Originally developed for military networks, Longbows are quickly 
      hitting their stride in the Enterprise Data Center&#8221;, said Dr. David 
      Southwell, Obsidian's CVO, &#8220;...for example by enhancing DB2 pureScale's 
      value proposition with synchronous multi-site disaster tolerance over 
      metro-area networks. DB2 pureScale's Longbow-enabled GDPC now delivers 
      Enterprise grade scalability, security and availability&#8221;.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GDPC distributes pureScale's servers and underlying mirrored GPFS 
      storage across remote sites, connected by Obsidian's Longbows which 
      provide AES-protected InfiniBand links with transparency, low-latency 
      and high-bandwidth. For the first time, this ultra-fast connection 
      allows each half of the cluster to maintain perfect database 
      synchronization across metro-area distances without significant 
      performance penalty.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the event of a site-wide failure, the surviving site always has a 
      perfect image of the database, which not only continuously protects 
      against data loss but also enables the Enterprise to fail-over database 
      operations to the remaining site thereby maintaining business continuity 
      in the face of major outages. Multiple Longbow links may be established 
      to provide protection against link failure and yield incremental 
      performance benefits.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Wipro Launches WDaaS &#8211; a &#8216;Desktop as a Service&#8217; Solution Based on 
      Citrix, Microsoft and HP Technology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			WDaaS Simplifies Desktop Virtualization for Organizations and Cuts 
      Technology Deployment Cycle by Half
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wipro Technologies, Global Information Technology, Consulting and 
      Outsourcing business of Wipro Limited (NYSE: WIT), in partnership with 
      Citrix and Microsoft, launched Wipro Desktop as a Service (WDaaS), a 
      desktop virtualization solution that delivers desktops, applications and 
      data as an on-demand service. The solution is based on HP technology. 
      The announcement was made at Citrix 
      Synergy&#8482; 2011 in San Francisco, the conference where virtual 
      computing takes center stage. WDaaS was announced earlier in October 
      2010 and is available in the market now.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WDaaS is an integrated service offering which uses the market-leading 
      desktop virtualization technologies of Citrix and Microsoft and provides 
      efficient plug and play desktop and application virtualization 
      capabilities. The solution is built on HP Converged Infrastructure. For 
      enterprises that want to deploy desktop virtualization on-premises, 
      WDaaS will offer a pre-configured appliance (hardware, software and 
      services) that can be managed remotely by Wipro. This solution lowers 
      deployment cost and reduces the implementation time by half as compared 
      to traditional system integration approach. For enterprises seeking a 
      hosted or cloud offering, Wipro delivers desktops and applications as a 
      service from a dedicated private cloud environment in its own 
      datacenters or by leveraging cloud infrastructure providers. These 
      delivery models lower the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) and move the 
      desktop cost from a CAPEX to an OPEX model.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Dominique Raviart, Research Director, IT Outsourcing, NelsonHall, a 
      leading analyst and advisory firm, says, &#8220;The development of the 
      Wipro Desktop as a Service offering is a good example of the growing 
      take-up of cloud desktops in the market. Interest is growing across the 
      world and especially in the U.S. and U.K., typically initially triggered 
      by server cloud computing and virtualization overall.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The WDaaS solution is based on Citrix 
      XenDesktop&#174;, the Microsoft VDI (Virtual Desktop Infrastructure) 
      Premium Suite and Microsoft Application Virtualization (App-V) software 
      components. It leverages Citrix 
      FlexCast&#8482; delivery technology which enables IT to optimize the 
      performance, security and cost of virtual desktops, hosted or local, for 
      any type of user, including task workers, mobile workers, power users 
      and contractors. It uses Citrix 
      HDX&#8482; technology that assures each user gets a rich, high definition 
      experience over any network on any device, including PCs, Macs, thin 
      clients, tablets and smartphones. The solution relies on Hyper-V for 
      running the Windows desktop in the guest virtual machines and 
      incorporates Microsoft&#8217;s comprehensive VDI infrastructure and management 
      software, including Windows Server 2008 R2 Remote Desktop Services, 
      App-V as well as System Center management solutions so customers can 
      virtualize, manage and deliver applications and desktops. WDaaS will be 
      offered on the HP Converged Infrastructure solution. The hosted and 
      cloud delivery models leverage Rackspace infrastructure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WDaaS includes a hosted session virtualization platform that can be 
      efficiently used to build industry-specific cloud solutions. Utilizing 
      this platform, Wipro has created an &#8216;Application access over the 
      Internet&#8217; solution to address the needs of higher education. Students 
      and faculty will have a convenient way to access applications anywhere, 
      anytime from any device instead of visiting the traditional computer lab 
      on campus. For the industry specific solutions, Wipro will work with its 
      channel partners to address the Small and Medium Business (SMB) market 
      segment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wipro conducted a primary research with colleges in the US to analyze 
      the benefits of desktop virtualization in higher education and compare 
      traditional implementation approach through in-house system integration 
      with a cloud computing delivery model. The findings of this research are 
      published in a White 
      Paper and clearly demonstrate reduction of implementation time from 
      18 months in a traditional approach to 3 months with cloud computing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Traditionally, desktop virtualization has been complex to implement,&#8221; 
      said Neeraj Jaitley, Vice President, Cloud Infrastructure Solutions, 
      Wipro Technologies. &#8220;Customers are now looking for providers with 
      end to end technical and operational capabilities who can deliver 
      scalable and highly reliable infrastructure, leveraging hybrid cloud 
      architecture as appropriate. Wipro Desktop as a Service solution 
      benefits from focused technology RD investments and supports &#8216;as a 
      Service&#8217; delivery models. Our engagement methodology can reduce the 
      technology deployment cycle by half.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Desktop virtualization is a key priority for today&#8217;s CIOs as they look 
      to transform their desktops to become more agile, flexible and secure. 
      Citrix XenDesktop supports this desktop change with market leading 
      technologies that turn desktops, applications and data into an on-demand 
      service that can be accessed from any user on any device,&#8221; said Dave 
      Jones, Vice President of System Integrator Development at Citrix. 
      &#8220;WDaaS is a perfect example of how customers can transform their 
      workplace and quickly realize the benefits of desktop virtualization

&lt;p&gt;   * Tofacitinib price seen critical to new drug's uptake&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * May be harder to justify premium than with MS, hep C pills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ben Hirschler &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, May 26 (Reuters) - Price may be the biggest factor
in deciding whether Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) has a winner on its hands
with its new rheumatoid arthritis pill tofacitinib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is the view of doctors who like what they see of the
experimental drug -- despite some deaths among patients in
clinical tests -- but point out the new product appears to be
only about as effective as existing injectable treatments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novel oral medicines are starting to change the landscape
for a number of diseases, offering patients an alternative to
often painful injections, and several manufacturers have pushed
them through at lofty prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novartis AG's (NOVN.VX) Gilenya for multiple sclerosis and
two hepatitis C treatments from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc
(VRTX.O) and Merck  Co Inc (MRK.N) have all been launched at
hefty premiums.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Pfizer may have less leeway since tofacitinib does not
have an obvious superiority in efficacy over injectable drugs,
known as anti-TNF inhibitors, and also comes with side effects,
including infection risk and raised cholesterol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Georg Schett, head of rheumatology and immunology at the
University of Erlangen-Nuremberg, believes tofacitinib should be
priced between biological anti-TNFs, costing up to $20,000 a
year, and the around $1,000 older drug methotrexate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Small molecule pills are, after all, a lot cheaper to make
than complex biotech drugs, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would hope they (Pfizer) will price it lower than a
biological drug," Schett said. "We live in a world of limited
healthcare budgets and price is always an issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paul Emery, president of the European League Against
Rheumatism (EULAR) and a rheumatologist from Leeds Teaching
Hospital, agrees price is key but is not banking on a bargain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RISK-BENEFIT RATIO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The data is very impressive but the biggest thing these
days will be the cost and we have no idea what that will be ...
I do not think it will be much cheaper -- that is a personal
opinion," he said. "The way it is priced will have the biggest
influence on its market penetration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Pfizer spokeswoman said it was premature to speculate
about price as tofacitinib was still in development. The U.S.
drugmaker aims to file for regulatory approval of the product --
the most advanced of a group of new arthritis pills being
developed by various firms -- by the end of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tofacitinib is Pfizer's biggest new drug hope but analyst
sales forecasts are subdued, reflecting uncertainty about how it
will fit into treatment regimens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, have forecast annual tofacitinib sales
of $1.1 billion by 2015, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roch Doliveux, chief executive of UCB SA (UCB.BR), maker of
the anti-TNF Cimzia, said it was too early to quantify the
threat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our assumption is that they will have a place in the
market. It is too soon to say what the risk-benefit ratio is yet
and that will determine how big that place is," he said during
EULAR's annual congress in London, where fresh tofacitinib data
was presented. [ID:nLDE74O1RE]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tofacitinib's progress so far has echoes of Novartis's
Gilenya, which was also linked to safety issues during its
development yet was ultimately approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Novartis went on to set an average annual U.S. price for
Gilenya of $48,000 last October -- around half as much again as
for older injectable multiple sclerosis (MS) drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trevor Mundel, the Swiss drugmaker's head of development,
told Reuters that price was justified because head-to-head data
showed Gilenya was "dramatically better" than injections. The
convenience of an oral pill was a lesser consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I do not think the oral versus biologic in terms of pricing
is as crucial as is the value," Mundel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When it comes to choosing between a pill and an injection,
many doctors are unsure if convenience will prompt current
anti-TNF patients to switch from successful treatments
like Abbott Labs' (ABT.N) Humira, Johnson  Johnson's (JNJ.N)
Remicade, Amgen Inc's (AMGN.O) Enbrel and Cimzia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is very interesting. I was talking to some of the
leading RA (rheumatoid arthritis) specialists," said Mundel.
"They think that the hurdle is actually higher in RA for an oral
agent than maybe it was in MS."

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Rising inflation, higher commodity prices and lower global economic growth will weigh on margins of SP 500 .SPX companies, said Goldman Sachs, as it forecast a lower 2012 earnings outlook, and reduced its year-end target on the index.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs, which expects a rebound in U.S. economic growth in the second quarter, lowered its year-end target on the Standard  Poor's 500 index to 1,450 from 1,500.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It estimates U.S. gross domestic product growth to increase from 1.8 percent in the first quarter, to a 3 to 3.5 percent range for the rest of this year and next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we transition into the late expansion phase of the cycle later this year the risk-reward balance for the SP 500 is likely to become slightly less attractive," the brokerage wrote in its portfolio strategy note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As such, Goldman revised its sector recommendations with respect to late cycle performance trends, and urged investors to overweight energy and consumer staples companies, and underweight consumer discretionary and utilities stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SECTOR RECOMMENDATIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy, consumer staples and information technology companies are likely to post the highest revenue growth in 2012, the brokerage said, as it upgraded consumer staples and healthcare sectors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We focus on sectors and stocks best positioned to grow earnings through higher sales," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumer staples companies should generate superior sales and earnings growth compared to consumer discretionary as input cost inflation begins to decline in the second half of this year and pricing starts to catch up, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage, which expects SP 500 companies' margins to contract in 2012, forecast 2012 earnings per share of $104, down from its prior view of $106.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It downgraded the information technology sector, and said it expects margins at these companies to reduce in 2012, with many large firms failing to match market earnings and sales growth rates, aside from Apple Inc (AAPL.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 index was down 2.96 points, or 0.22 percent, to 1,317.51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

			OpenTrust Joins the IBM Health Integration Framework
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			OpenTrust for Healthcare has been verified as meeting IBM&#8217;s Health 
      Integration Framework requirements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OpenTrust, the Next-Gen IT security software publisher and a certified 
      IBM Business Partner, today announced that OpenTrust for Healthcare has 
      received IBM Health Integration Framework validation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a component of the IBM Health Integration Framework, OpenTrust for 
      Healthcare joins a select list of both IBM software and complementary 
      partner solutions that have been validated by IBM for ease of use and 
      compatibility. The IBM Health Integration Framework is a software 
      platform that provides healthcare-specific reference architectures and a 
      suite of tools, transformation engines and application adapters built on 
      healthcare standards. The Health Integration Framework provides 
      companies in the healthcare industry with flexibility, interoperability 
      and lower costs. Validated solutions are easier to deploy and to 
      integrate and address the specific needs of the healthcare vertical.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The validated OpenTrust solution addresses the privacy, identity and 
      security concerns of the healthcare industry making it possible to share 
      digital information in a secure and auditable manner between 
      establishments. A single multi-service smart card can be used for both 
      physical and logical authentication thus significantly reducing the 
      number of passwords required by healthcare personnel. As such, OpenTrust 
      for Healthcare is a compelling solution for medical establishments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The OpenTrust for Healthcare package includes four of the principal 
      OpenTrust security products: OpenTrust PKI for certificate-based 
      strong authentication, OpenTrust SCM for the management of 
      cards/tokens and the credentials stored on these devices, OpenTrust 
      SPI for legally binding electronic signatures and proof management, 
      and OpenTrust MFT for securely exchanging files of all types and 
      sizes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are very pleased that IBM has approved our solution as part of 
      the Health Integration Framework&#8221;, said Olivier Guilbert, CEO 
      OpenTrust. &#8220;As an IBM partner we will be continuing our work towards 
      validation of our products against other IBM Industry Frameworks&#8221;.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ICON plc, (NASDAQ: ICLR; ISIN: IE0005711209), a global provider 
      of outsourced development services to the pharmaceutical, biotechnology 
      and medical device industries, today announced a strategic partnership 
      with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) which will see it serve as one of two 
      preferred providers of clinical trial implementation services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new partnership is part of Pfizer&#8217;s comprehensive program of change 
      in RD to sharpen research focus, deliver differentiated innovation, and 
      create a more flexible cost base through external partnerships for 
      certain RD services. To be fully implemented over an 18 to 24 month 
      period, the partnership will enable Pfizer to focus internally on its 
      core capability in clinical trial design, while leveraging the strengths 
      and scale of ICON to implement clinical development programs with 
      greater efficiency and rigor.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the partnership agreement, Pfizer will retain scientific ownership 
      of the clinical development process, and maintain strict oversight and 
      quality standards relating to patient safety and regulatory compliance. 
      Pfizer will leverage ICON&#8217;s expertise in the areas of program initiation 
      and management; site and country feasibility; data management and 
      reporting set-up; program study drug logistics; scientific and medical 
      communications; and quality assurance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Peter Gray, CEO at ICON plc, commented, &#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement is another 
      significant indicator of ICON&#8217;s ability to partner with major companies 
      in helping them transform their drug development model and validates the 
      investments that we are making to capitalise on the changing market 
      environment. We look forward to working with Pfizer to help realise 
      their development pipeline and expect that over time our partnership 
      will have a significant positive impact on ICON&#8217;s future growth.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SEATTLE (Reuters) - Influential hedge fund manager David Einhorn has called for Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer to step down, saying the world's largest software company's leader is stuck in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"His continued presence is the biggest overhang on Microsoft's stock," Einhorn said in reference to Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments by outspoken Einhorn, who made his name warning about Lehman Brothers' financial health before the investment bank's collapse, are the most pointed yet from a high-profile investor against Microsoft's leadership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares, which have been static for over a decade, gained 0.87 percent in after-hours trading after Einhorn's comments, the most of any Dow Jones industrial average component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software giant, which was the largest U.S. company by market value in the late 1990s, has since been overtaken by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and IBM in market value, and is no longer seen as a dominating force in technology after a failure to capitalize on new Internet and mobile computing markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock is down 6 percent in the last two weeks alone after Microsoft agreed to pay $8.5 billion (5.2 billion pounds) for Internet phone service Skype, a move which mystified many investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the annual Ira Sohn Investment Research Conference in New York on Wednesday, Einhorn said it was time for Ballmer -- who succeeded co-founder Bill Gates in 2000 -- to step aside and "give someone else a chance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn's comments echo what some investors have said for some years in private.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesman declined comment on Einhorn's remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RECENT BUYER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn's Greenlight Capital hedge fund has been a recent buyer of Microsoft stock, which at under 10 times expected earnings is regarded by many as undervalued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenlight held about 9 million shares in Microsoft, or 0.11 percent of the company's outstanding shares, at the end of the first quarter, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn also said it was time for Microsoft to consider strategic alternatives for its money-losing online business, which has so far failed to win share from online search leader Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online services unit, which runs the Bing search engine and MSN web portal, had a loss of $726 million last quarter and has now lost $7 billion in four years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bing has made some progress, raising its U.S. Internet search market share to 14 percent from 8 percent in the two years since launch, but has not taken any share from Google, which has held on to its 65 percent share, according to research firm comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OLD FOES APPLE, IBM REVIVED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, Microsoft was overtaken by IBM (IBM.N) in market value for the first time in 15 years, chiefly because of Microsoft's static share price. Apple roared past it last year to become the world's most valuable tech company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Graphic showing market value of Apple, IBM and Microsoft over time: r.reuters.com/jaw69r )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An investor who put $100,000 into Microsoft stock 10 years ago would now have about $69,000 worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn, the president of Greenlight Capital, which had $7.8 billion of assets as of January 1, made his name with the prescient call on Lehman's accounting troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the spring of 2008, Einhorn said Lehman -- and its then-Chief Financial Officer Erin Callan -- had understated its own problems and needed to raise capital to support a balance sheet peppered with risky assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn's public speeches on the matter in April and May 2008 -- including one at the Ira Sohn conference that year -- touched a nerve with other investors and are widely credited as leading to Callan's departure from the company a few months before its collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - A computer security researcher has found a flaw in Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) widely used Internet Explorer browser that he said could let hackers steal credentials to access FaceBook, Twitter and other websites.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He calls the technique "cookiejacking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any website. Any cookie. Limit is just your imagination," said Rosario Valotta, an independent Internet security researcher based in Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hackers can exploit the flaw to access a data file stored inside the browser known as a "cookie," which holds the login name and password to a web account, Valotta said via email&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a hacker has that cookie, he or she can use it to access the same site, said Valotta, who calls the technique "cookiejacking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability affects all versions of Internet Explorer, including IE 9, on every version of the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To exploit the flaw, the hacker must persuade the victim to drag and drop an object across the PC's screen before the cookie can be hijacked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That sounds like a difficult task, but Valotta said he was able to do it fairly easily. He built a puzzle that he put up on Facebook in which users are challenged to "undress" a photo of an attractive woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I published this game online on FaceBook and in less than three days, more than 80 cookies were sent to my server," he said. "And I've only got 150 friends."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said there is little risk a hacker could succeed in a real-world cookiejacking scam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the level of required user interaction, this issue is not one we consider high risk," said Microsoft spokesman Jerry Bryant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In order to possibly be impacted a user must visit a malicious website, be convinced to click and drag items around the page and the attacker would need to target a cookie from the website that the user was already logged into," Bryant said.

&lt;p&gt;May 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil reported emissions at
its 238,600 barrel per day refinery in Joliet, Illinois, due to
overpressure, in a filing with state regulators.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The refinery, which suffered a compressor trip over the last
weekend, is reporting emissions for a fourth-time since Monday. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for the company said the causes of the emissions
were separate and unrelated, but did not disclose further
information on the same.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chicago gasoline has rallied through the week as fears of 	
supply strains stemmed from problems at the Exxon refinery.

			Goodwin Procter Announces Fifth Annual Public Company Directors 
      Forums in Silicon Valley and Boston
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goodwin 
      Procter, a national Am Law 50 firm, in conjunction with Dartmouth&#8217;s 
      Tuck School of Business, will host its fifth annual Directors 
      Forums on June 2 in Silicon Valley and June 9 in Boston. The 2011 
      Forums will address changes to whistleblower laws and their implications 
      for public company directors; executive compensation issues resulting 
      from Dodd-Frank and other SEC rule changes; and the perils and pitfalls 
      of public company MA activity. This is the first year that the Forum 
      will be held on both the East and West Coasts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The West Coast Forum will feature a keynote address from Maynard 
      Webb, chairman and CEO of LiveOps, which provides on-demand call 
      center technology and solutions to enterprise companies. His 
      presentation, &#8220;Catalysts for Change,&#8221; will focus on risk versus 
      innovation, the speed at which technology platforms are changing and how 
      all of these trends facet the actions and decisions of boards of 
      directors. Webb has more than 30 years experience developing and leading 
      high-growth companies. Before joining LiveOps, he was chief operating 
      officer of eBay and senior vice president and CIO of Gateway. He has 
      also held leadership positions at Bay Networks, Quantum Corp., 
      Thomas-Conrad Corp. and IBM, and sits on the boards of several 
      successful companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The East Coast Forum will feature a keynote address from Dr. 
      Matthew Slaughter, an associate dean of the MBA Program at the Tuck 
      School and the Signal Companies&#8217; Professor of Management. His keynote 
      will provide an overview of the findings of The 
      Squam Lake Report,
			which was authored by 15 of the 
      world&#8217;s leading economists and contains recommendations on fixing 
      troubled financial markets. An expert in the economics and politics of 
      globalization, Slaughter&#8217;s work focuses on the global operations of 
      multinational firms and the labor-market impacts of international trade, 
      investment and immigration. From 2005 to 2007, he served as a member on 
      the Council of Economic Advisers in the Executive Office of the 
      President.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Now in its fifth year, our Directors Forum provides a compelling 
      alternative to traditional corporate governance programs in the 
      marketplace,&#8221; said Stuart 
      Cable, a partner in Goodwin Procter&#8217;s MA/Corporate 
      Governance Practice and founder of the Forum. &#8220;We look forward to 
      once again addressing the most pertinent issues affecting public company 
      directors.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Forum is one of the firm&#8217;s flagship events, and we&#8217;re thrilled to 
      be able to bring it to the West Coast this year,&#8221; added Anthony 
      McCusker, co-chair of the firm&#8217;s Technology 
      Practice and a member of the Forum&#8217;s Steering Committee.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to Goodwin Procter partner participants, including Stuart 
      Cable, Lisa Haddad, Rick Kline, Marian Tse, Deborah Birnbach, Steven 
      Feldstein, David Pitofsky, Edward King and Heidi Goldstein Shepherd,

&lt;p&gt; * Plans to launch hedge fund later this summer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * To run CTAs, credit and equity strategies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * To have offices in Beijing and Hong Kong

 (Adds details, background, quote)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Nishant Kumar	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, May 27 (Reuters) - Principia Capital Advisors is
set to launch a $750 million hedge fund later this summer, three
sources familiar with the matter said, joining the ranks of
former Goldman Sachs trader Morgan Sze's blockbuster launch last
month.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Principia, named after a famous book by the 16th century
French philosopher and writer Rene Descartes, is starting with
commodity trading advisers or CTA, a hedge fund strategy betting
on long-running trends in markets, credit and equity strategies,
the sources said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources identified Hang Hu as one of the top executives.
Hu's background and Principia's backers could not be immediately
ascertained.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Principia will have offices in Hong Kong and Beijing, two of
the sources said, with equity strategy run from Hong Kong.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The launch will make Principia the second-biggest start-up 
in Asia this year after former Goldman Sachs trader
Morgan Sze started with about more than $1 billion for his
multi-strategy hedge fund.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The wave of investor demand for Asian hedge fund product
has coincided with an increase in the number of talented,
"next-generation" regional managers, who adopt sophisticated
investment strategies, risk management and infrastructure," said
Frederick Ingham, head of hedge fund investments in the
Asia-Pacific for money manager Neuberger Berman.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This has led to an increase in significant and sizeable
flows into the region's alternatives sector."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong-based Sze, former head of Goldman's Principal
Strategies group, launched Azentus Capital on April 1 and is set
to grow the fund to more than $2 billion in the next few months,
sources familiar with the matter said. [ID:nL4E7GH06W]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interest in hedge funds has staged a comeback with the
industry adding $93.9 billion in the first four months of the
year or about $28 billion more than the corresponding period
last year, according to data from Eurekahedge.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asian hedge funds have witnessed twelve consecutive months
of net positive asset flows after a recovery last year.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asian hedge funds added $20 billion to their assets in 2010,
backed by positive returns and accelerated flows in the second
half of the year as investors returned to bet on the fast
growing region.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Assets under hedge funds focused on the region rose to
$152.3 billion in 2010, up from $132.2 billion a year earlier, a
survey by fund tracker AsiaHedge showed.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About half of the asset growth was due to net inflows with
95 new hedge fund launches contributing $3.84 billion to the
asset growth in 2010, a rise of 50 percent from a year earlier. 	
   Principia executives could not be reached for comment.
Sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to
comment.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) plans to expand its physical trading activity in China's oil market, Indonesia's coal sector and across Asian metals to cash in on what it sees as a long-term bull market, the head of the bank's Asian commodities unit said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a sharp fall in commodities prices in the first-half of May, JPMorgan is bullish on the sector's future prospects as developing economies consume more raw materials, said Ray Eyles, chief executive of the bank's Asian commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fundamental story is still very strong and the emerging market story would have a significant long-term impact on these commodities prices," Eyles said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China continues to lead a charge in developing world demand that has fueled commodities markets for over a decade, and a chorus of market players this week have said they maintain a bullish outlook for the sector despite the sell-off this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top trader Glencore (GLEN.L) said it saw emerging markets straining supplies and testing the ability of producers to ramp up output. Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) raised oil price forecasts this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan aims to take a bigger slice of the market for physical oil trade into China, Eyles said. China is already the world's second-largest oil consumer and the International Energy Agency expects the nation to account for around 40 percent of the increase in fuel demand worldwide this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China has clearly been a large part of the demand story for physical oil," Eyles said. "Moving forward, this is one of the areas we are placing significant emphasis on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expansion in the Chinese oil trading business is part of the bank's wider strategy to grow in the country, Eyles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China is one of our top priorities for the next several years," Eyles said. "We... are seeking some very significant opportunities there. The platform we've built offshore and are building onshore is well positioned to maximize the opportunity across the physical commodities as well as the investor business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Indonesia, the world's top exporter of coal for power generation, JPMorgan is looking for coal purchase contracts as part of a move to grow its physical trade, Eyles said. The bank is also looking at opportunities to supply fuel to the country's commodities producers, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Physical metals trade in Asia is another target growth area, Eyles said. The bank plans to increase capacity at its Asian metals warehousing facilities, he said. Last year, it opened a precious metals vault in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Asian gas, power and coal sectors also offer growth opportunities, Eyles said. China, India and Japan will all need more imported gas in coming years, and Asian governments are making huge investments in expanding power generation and grids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the gas and power market in Asia is still relatively small, we see strong potential there in the years to come and we are adding resources and increasing our focus in order to capture the opportunity," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will add two to its team of four covering the region's gas, power and coal sectors, said Eyles, who took the helm at the bank's Asian commodities unit in September 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank sees little other change in its 100-strong Asian commodities and energy team, which has expanded from just 60 in mid-2010 as the bank absorbed RBS Sempra Commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ENERGY, PRECIOUS METALS TO OUTPERFORM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slowdown in global industrial production following the massive earthquake and tsunami in Japan in March had made JPMorgan "more cautious" in the short-term on commodities markets, Eyles said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 19-commodity Reuters-Jefferies CRB index .CRB is heading for a monthly loss of over 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about more tightening in Chinese monetary policy and euro zone sovereign debt were also dogging markets, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is still scope in the short-term for prices to go lower, but we don't see it as a long-term move," he said. "In the long run, we believe we are set for significantly higher commodity prices and I think the energy space will be one of the major beneficiaries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank is most bullish on long-term prospects for oil, coal and gas, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'd expect to go through a period of outperformance in energy and precious metals, and underperformance in industrial metals," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fundamentals in oil and copper were finely balanced, giving little room to absorb a strong increase in demand, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agricultural market also provided a big opportunity in coming years, Eyles said, as governments focus on food security and producers looked to increase output to meet demand growth and changes in dietary habits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big oil companies active in natural gas drilling are under increasing pressure to disclose the environmental and financial risks associated with hydraulic fracturing.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At yesterday's annual meetings of Chevron and ExxonMobil, a significant minority of shareholders sent a strong message by voting in favor of resolutions asking for a report on the environmental and financial risks of hydraulic fracturing (commonly referred to as fracking) in natural gas drilling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fracking is a process of injecting a mixture of water, chemicals, and particles underground to create fractures through which gas can flow for collection. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Chevron 41 percent voted in favor, while 28 percent voted in favor at ExxonMobil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the resolutions were voted down, even minority shareholder votes can have a big impact. A vote of 10 percent, for example, is usually enough to send a clear message to company management, says advocacy group As You Sow, which filed the resolutions &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today's votes clearly demonstrate that mainstream investors are concerned about fracking and want more disclosure on how these companies are dealing with the environmental, public health, and financial risks associated with this practice, says Michael Passoff, Senior Strategist with As You Sow. The fact that 41 percent of Chevron investors voted in favor of more disclosure, an exceptionally high level of support for a first-year resolution, shows how seriously the company's shareholders are taking this issue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We know there are risks, ExxonMobil CEO Rex Tillerson admitted to reporters after the meeting. We're not trying to characterize this as an activity that does not have risks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Tillerson insisted that regulation of drilling activities should remain a state - and not federal - concern. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pennsylvania's new Republican governor has essentially handcuffed state regulators in favor of drilling companies. New York currently has a moratorium in place on horizontal fracking until July. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both states sit on the Marcellus Shale formation, which is estimated to hold enough natural gas to support domestic needs for several decades.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon made a big play for that resource when it purchased XTO Energy for $35 billion in 2010, so the company is not likely to back down anytime soon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the federal government is finally exploring the issue. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is studying the use and effects of hydraulic fracturing chemicals. Two critical issues - toxic chemicals used in fracking fluid and the disposal of wastewater - have the most potential to limit expansion of this practice. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the use of hydraulic fracturing skyrockets, communities, regulators, and investors are growing increasingly concerned about the environmental impacts of this process, says Jon Jensen of the Park Foundation in Ithaca, N.Y. and one of the co-filers of the ExxonMobil resolution. Shareholders need assurance that companies are candidly disclosing these risks and are adopting best management practices to minimize them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The resolutions received strong support from mainstream institutional investors. Both ISS and Glass Lewis, the two largest proxy advisory services in the country, supported the resolutions at Chevron; ISS also supported the Exxon resolution. The New York State Common Retirement Fund, the second largest pension fund in the country, also voted for the resolutions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo by ProgressOhio/flickr/Creative Commons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reprinted with permission from Sustainable Business&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WARSAW (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Saturday threw his weight behind efforts in Congress to ease visa restrictions on Poles traveling to the United States, seeking to remove an ongoing irritant with a close NATO ally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Obama announced his support for changing the visa waiver program during a trip to Warsaw, where he praised the eastern European country as an important partner on the world stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poles have found the visa restrictions to be at variance with that partnership, and the issue remains one thorn in an otherwise mostly cordial relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama said he wanted to change existing U.S. law to ease the restrictions, and the White House released a letter he sent to lawmakers expressing that wish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We very much want you to shop on Fifth Avenue and anywhere else in the United States," Obama said at a press conference, responding to a questioner who said the rules were preventing Poles from buying goods on that famous New York shopping street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our expectation is...that by this change in the law, we can be in a position to resolve this issue in a way that is satisfactory to Poland but also meets the security concerns of the United States," Obama said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama will need the support of Congress to make the change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Relaxing the visa requirement would improve Polish perceptions of the United States and could help Prime Minister Donald Tusk's center-right government before October elections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tusk thanked Obama for his "personal engagement" in the issue and said it was in the interest of the United States to make more money from Polish tourists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What is and what should be important in Poland is that more and more Polish people make enough money to be able to afford shopping on Fifth Avenue," Tusk said, according to a translation of his remarks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Poles have long fumed over having to queue outside the U.S. embassy for hours to buy a visa, especially after Warsaw sent troops to serve alongside U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have been repeatedly told that we are America's most loyal ally, but when it comes down to things, we have to queue for visas along with tourists from high-risk countries," said Agata Widera, 21, a history student.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope this matter will finally be solved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his May 28 letter to U.S. lawmakers, Obama said Poland deserved to be part of the Visa Waiver Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Countries that are willing to cooperate with the United States on our global priorities, including on counterterrorism initiatives, information sharing, and prevention of terrorist travel, deserve the opportunity to become part of our VWP. I also share your support for Poland and disappointment that this close NATO ally has been excluded from the VWP to date."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SOFIA May 28 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Chevron (CVX.N)
has won a tender to carry out shale gas exploration work at a
potentially huge field in northeast Bulgaria, Economy and Energy
Minister Traicho Traikov said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron won the tender at the Novi Pazar field with a 30
million euro bid, Traikov told reporters. The other bidder was
Canada's BNK Petroleum (BKX.TO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traikov said initial estimates made by the bidders, based on
similar rock formations elsewhere, were for potential of between
300 billion and 1 trillion cubic meters of shale gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Quantities of one trillion sound... fantastic. This will be
the gas consumption of Bulgaria for 300 years," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A contract with Chevron is expected to be signed in the
coming weeks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shale gas extraction can start in seven to ten years, if the
exploration work finds viable deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bulgaria, almost fully dependent on Russian natural gas
imports, is seeking was to diversify its suppliers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Drilling for shale gas has prompted debate in many countries
over concerns that fracking, a process that involves injecting
water, sand and chemicals into formations to extract trapped
gas, is harmful to the environment. [ID:nN18229665].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova; Editing by John

Bank of America Corp. (BAC) has reached a deal to pay $20 million to end
a lawsuit by the U.S. Department of Justice revolving around the bank's
failure to constantly check the military status of borrowers on whom it
foreclosed through May 31, 2009. The Justice Department suspected

    UBS (UBS), CitigroupCopyright and Goldman Sachs (GS) are predicting

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA AND SAN
MATEO, CALIFORNIA AND TORONTO, ONTARIO, May 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Intertainment Media Inc. ("Intertainment" or the "Company") (TSX VENTURE:
INT)(OTCQX: ITMTF)(FRANKFURT: I4T) announces that at a time when
organizations like Google are reporting the closing down of its popular
Translate application programming interface, Ortsbo (www.ortsbo.com), the
real time language translation platform, is increasing its global social
media distribution by offering a fully enabled cloud computing real time
translation application built on the Microsoft Windows Azure platform.

    Launched ahead of schedule, Ortsbo's new HTML alpha platform offers users
the ability to connect initially, to Facebook, MSN and Google GTalk.
Other social networks are expected to be implemented quickly on the new
platform. The HTML version of Ortsbo combined with the power of
Microsoft's Windows Azure cloud platform allows both commercial and
consumer use of Ortsbo without the need to download a plug- in,
facilitating real time translated chat to virtually all worldwide browser
enabled devices. The move to Windows Azure, provides Ortsbo with
increased user capacity, speed and performance in an operating expense
model versus a traditional capital expense model, providing additional
cost savings.

    Ortsbo is also in development of its new platform, Ortsbo 2.0 with
increased language capabilities, allowing users to chat in real time in
over 80 languages, including user requested languages of Punjabi and
Traditional Chinese. The increased language capabilities are part of the
next generation of Ortsbo which will also include the Ortsbo language
wiki where users will be able to update any language dictionary
potentially increasing translation accuracy. Ortsbo 2.0 is scheduled for
beta release in calendar Q4 2011.

    The original version of Ortsbo using Microsoft Silverlight and enabling
12 of the world's most popular chat networks will remain in operation for
the near future. When initially launched in July 2010, Ortsbo's social
media translation platform infrastructure was designed to handle the
expected first 2 to 3 years of operations or 12 Million monthly users.
Ortsbo exceeded all growth projections in its first 9 months and has
continued to expand to maintain the increase in user growth.

    As disclosed on May 24, 2011, the existing platform has effectively maxed
out at a cap of 16.1 Million users and Ortsbo is compelled to accelerate
the initial launch of the Microsoft Azure Cloud Computing Platform
planned for mid June. As Ortsbo integrates the new cloud app, performance
numbers will be reported monthly.

    It should be noted that the Google announcement closing down the Google
Translate API has no affect on the services provided by Ortsbo.

    Guinness World Record Holder

    On May 20, 2011 Ortsbo Inc. established a world record for the Most
Nationalities In An Online Chat with 92 countries.

    Increased Language Opportunities:

    Ortsbo has received a significant amount of inquiries about adding
languages to its current offering of 53. Currently, Ortsbo and its
development team are working on, and testing, an initiative to increase
the language offering to over 80 languages. The timing of the increased
language offering is expected during calendar Q4 2011. Some of the new
language offerings include Punjabi and Traditional Chinese. Ortsbo
believes that the increased language offerings will provide additional
opportunities for users to engage across global language barriers and
comes at a time when organizations like Google are curtailing language
services offerings.

    Ortsbo Language Wiki:

    Ortsbo is currently developing a crowd sourcing application that will
allow users to input individual words, technical terms, slang and phrases
into an open database and allow users to work collaboratively to provide
the best definition in any of the languages that are offered by Ortsbo.
These will include colloquial statements like "knock on wood" and
"bling", but may also include input items that are part of any language
or culture. The definition for these input items can be further defined
by the "crowd" over time. Upcoming versions of Ortsbo will be able to
detect these input items and identify them to the sender, allowing them
to be converted into the crowd defined meaning for the receiving user.
Ortsbo believes that this innovation will dramatically increase
translation accuracy and value to users.

    Ortsbo Mobile:

    Ortsbo is currently developing a number of mobile and tablet apps
allowing users around the world to use Ortsbo services on their
smartphones and portable computing devices. As previously announced,
Ortsbo has launched a beta version of its iPhone App and additional apps
are slated for Summer 2011. Ortsbo's new HTML platform currently allows
access through mobile browser applications, including iPads.

    Upcoming Events:

    June 3, 2011 - Social Media Camp

    As a Gold sponsor of the second annual Social Media Camp in Victoria, BC,
Ortsbo VP of Technology, Mark Hale and Brad Parry, CMO Intertainment
Media will be attending to showcase and discuss all of Intertainment's

Abouhossein said the market was "overreacting to the negative news flow" lately, as well as the potential impact of regulatory changes on the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In afternoon trading, Goldman shares were up 1.1 percent at $140.23. Earlier in the day, the stock had traded as high as $142.30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is moving toward a client-driven business model thanks to regulatory reform, a move that Abouhossein called "a paradigm shift." It is a stark difference from Goldman's prior model, which relied heavily on investing its own funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That strategy would be unworkable under the so-called Volcker rule, which will prohibit U.S. banks from trading for their own accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result of that new regulation, JPMorgan estimates Goldman will have to divest $28 billion worth of assets from its investing and lending division. That would allow Goldman to buy back shares and boost returns, Abouhossein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe the market is again overreacting to the negative newsflow," the analyst said in his report. "In our view, the price weakness is a buying opportunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abouhossein had earlier issued one of the most pessimistic forecasts of how financial reform would hit Goldman's businesses. He estimated that the Volcker rule would reduce the company's annual profit by $3.7 billion, or 15 percent, and potentially affect $17.3 billion in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In January, he downgraded Goldman to "neutral," based on valuation and a generally negative view on U.S. investment banks, relative to European competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if the bank used proceeds from asset sales to buy back shares, Abouhossein believes Goldman shares could trade around 6.7 times earnings and 1.1 times net asset value in 2012. He predicts its return on net asset value would climb to 15.8 percent from 12.9 percent today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts estimate Goldman's net asset value at $75.7 billion, on average, according to a Thomson Reuters poll, compared with a market value of $71.8 billion as of Friday's close. Goldman said its book value per common share was $129.40 as of March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEVIN REPORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent Senate subcommittee report on the financial crisis said that Goldman offloaded much of its subprime mortgage exposure to unsuspecting clients in late 2006 and 2007 as the market was starting to fall. [ID:nN20278875] When clients tried to get out of these positions, Goldman in some cases dragged its heels, magnifying clients' losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's market capitalization has shrunk by $12 billion, or 15 percent, since a congressional panel led by Senator Carl Levin released its report on the financial crisis, the brokerage said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But on Tuesday, Abouhossein struck a much more positive tone after having met with Michael Sherwood, co-CEO of Goldman Sachs International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst said he is not concerned about a management change, since Goldman has a deep bench of talent that can take over from Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein. He also said that concerns about Goldman's reduced return-on-equity levels are already priced into the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a nutshell, global Tier I investment banks such as Goldman are 'machines' with a unique partnership model that does not rely on individuals," Abouhossein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the brokerage trimmed its 2011 earnings target for Goldman to $12.80 a share from $13.50, mainly due to a slower-than-expected second quarter in fixed income, currency and commodities markets (FICC), and weakness in equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's main concern about the outlook for Goldman's stock price is that consensus estimates are too high. Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters expect the company to earn $14.65 per share in 2011, on average.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of 25 analysts who track Goldman shares, 18 advise clients to buy the stock, six recommend holding it and Rochdale Securities analyst Richard Bove is the sole analyst with a "sell" recommendation. "Sell" recommendations are unusual on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares have shed about 17.5 percent since the beginning of the year.

&lt;p&gt;
SAN JOSE, Calif., May 31, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Align Technology, Inc.
(Nasdaq:ALGN) today announced that the Invisalign system is now commercially
available in the People's Republic of China. The company is training
orthodontists based in the four major cities of Shanghai, Beijing, Shenzhen, and
Guangzhou, which have a combined population of over 70 million people. Align is
offering Invisalign Full, Invisalign Teen and Vivera Retainers directly to
Invisalign-trained orthodontists.

China is estimated to have nearly half a million new orthodontic case starts
each year, with a higher percentage of complex Class II and III malocclusion
cases than in Western countries. In October 2010, Align announced it had
received regulatory approval from the Chinese State Food and Drug Administration
(SFDA) to market and sell the Invisalign system as a Class II medical device for
the treatment of malocclusion. In conjunction with the recent international
launch of Invisalign G3, Align accelerated commercial availability of Invisalign
in China from the second half of 2011. The new features and functionality
delivered with Invisalign G3 are engineered to make Invisalign easier to use
with Class II and III patients and address the higher complexity of malocclusion
among the Asian population. In anticipation of this launch Align has been
building its presence in China and has established its office in Shanghai which
includes country management, sales, marketing, clinical education, and support.

"I am very pleased to announce commercial availability of Invisalign in the
world's second largest economy," said Richard Twomey, Align vice president
international. "China is a great long term growth opportunity for Align and we
are committed to establishing a world-class operation that fosters our long term
success. As part of that strategy, we expect a gradual ramp in case volume as
much of our initial effort is focused on key opinion leaders and early
adopters."

In April, as a pre-curser to the commercial launch, Peking University hosted a
two-day clinical symposium on Invisalign treatment. The "Science in Every Smile"
symposium featured clinical lectures by leading Invisalign practitioners from
around the world and was attended by more than 340 orthodontists from across
China, including faculty, private practitioners and 95 percent of the country's
orthodontic department chairpersons. The symposium demonstrated the commitment
to training and education shared by Peking University and Align Technology, and
was a welcomed opportunity to share Invisalign case studies and techniques with
Chinese orthodontists.

"Peking University School of Stomatology was honored to introduce the Invisalign
system to China's leading orthodontic faculty. The strong attendance and
positive feedback illustrates the heightened interest and demand in China for
the newest technology, such as Align Technology's leading, science-based clear
aligner system," said Professor Yanheng Zhou, Professor and Chair, Department of
Orthodontics, Peking University School of Stomatology.

"The Symposium impressed me by showing the wide-range of malocclusion that can
be treated with Invisalign. I see tremendous potential and immediate
applications in my own practice," said Dr. Haiping Lu, PhD, an orthodontist in
private practice in Hangzhou, China.

Professor Robert Boyd, Chairman of the Department of Orthodontics at the Arthur
A. Dugoni School of Dentistry, University of the Pacific (USA), and one of the
symposium speakers, said, "The success of this Symposium is a testament to the
cooperation between Peking University School of Stomatology and Align
Technology, and bodes well for the growth of Invisalign in China."

About Align Technology, Inc.

Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary
method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign
corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable
appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does
not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign
significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with
braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align
Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market
Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign,
Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers. To
learn more about Invisalign or to find an Invisalign trained doctor in your
area, please visit www.invisalign.com.

Cadent Holdings, Inc. is a subsidiary of Align Technology and is a leading
provider of 3D digital scanning solutions for orthodontics and dentistry. The
Cadent family of products includes iTero and OrthoCAD iOC scanning systems,
OrthoCADiCast, OrthoCAD iQ and OrthoCAD iRecord. For additional information,

It is a prestigious, comprehensive educational institution featuring stomatology
that conducts teaching and research while providing clinical service and
preventative care for the public.

China, including the anticipated ramp in Invisalign case volume. Forward-looking
statements contained in this news release relating to expectations about future
events or results are based upon information available to Align as of the date

(GS.N) shares rose on Tuesday after an influential and

to get out of these positions, Goldman in some cases dragged
its heels, magnifying clients' losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's market capitalization has shrunk by $12 billion,
or 15 percent, since a congressional panel led by Senator Carl

tone after having met with Michael Sherwood, co-CEO of Goldman

change, since Goldman has a deep bench of talent that can take
over from Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein. He also said that
concerns about Goldman's reduced return-on-equity levels are
already priced into the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In a nutshell, global Tier I investment banks such as
Goldman are 'machines' with a unique partnership model that
does not rely on individuals," Abouhossein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the brokerage trimmed its 2011 earnings target for
Goldman to $12.80 a share from $13.50, mainly due to a
slower-than-expected second quarter in fixed income, currency
and commodities markets (FICC), and weakness in equities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's main concern about the outlook for Goldman's
stock price is that consensus estimates are too high. Analysts

"sell" recommendation. "Sell" recommendations are unusual on
Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares have shed about 17.5 percent since the
beginning of the year. JPMorgan kept its price target on the
stock at $175, suggesting a 26 percent surge to year-end from
Friday's close of $138.66 on the New York Stock Exchange.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Foxfire, 
      a Warehouse 
      Management Software (WMS) provider, announced today that it offers a 
      standard, out-of-the-box integration to Microsoft GP platform. The Foxfire-Microsoft 
      Dynamics GP (formerly Great Plains) interface provides a full warehouse 
      management software solution for customers who are using, or would 
      like to use, Microsoft Dynamics GP for their core accounting and ERP 
      business solution. The Foxfire-Dynamics GP Connector utilizes 
      Microsoft&#8217;s eConnect, a collection of web services, tools, components, 
      and interfaces that allow applications to programmatically interact with 
      Microsoft Dynamics GP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through the integration to Foxfire WMS software, Microsoft GP 
      will seamlessly connect the warehouse to the accounting 
      department&#8212;creating greater insight into the warehouse regarding sales 
      orders, inventory, and labor. This integration also provides enhanced 
      automation of the warehouse, further optimizing warehouse resources and 
      operations. Additionally, Foxfire WMS creates a real time, completely 
      barcoded set of capabilities for the warehouse operation that help 
      clients improve labor efficiency and inventory accuracy, while 
      eliminating picking and shipping errors. Foxfire WMS is designed to 
      provide a wireless and paperless solution for clients who have important 
      warehousing and distribution needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By combining their financial ERP investment with the proven Foxfire 
      WMS, customers experience numerous benefits: near real-time updates 
      between Foxfire 
      WMS and Microsoft Dynamics GP with no double entry; a more efficient 
      invoicing process; a single point of entry for items, vendors, purchase 
      orders, and sales orders; greater insight into the status of customer 
      orders; and quick ROI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Foxfire provides an affordable WMS 
      solution that offers extensive functionality without the 
      time-consuming deployment requirements involved with typical warehousing 
      solutions. The integration to Microsoft GP accounting system compliments 
      Foxfire&#8217;s WMS by offering seamless transaction processing&#8212;streamlining 
      warehouse processes and creating greater efficiency.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, May 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Microsoft Corp. (MSFT) will preview a Windows operating system designed
for tablets this week that will compete directly with Apple Inc.'s (AAPL)
iPad, reports Bloomberg. 

    British chip designer ARM Holdings Plc created the technology used in
both the iPad and Microsoft's yet be unveiled product. ARMH says it may
start generating royalties from chips using its technology in
Windows-based laptops and tablets as early as next year, President Tudor
Brown told Bloomberg. 

    Microsoft's attempt to weaken Apple's grip on the tablet- computer market
will likely be attempted this week as PC makers unveil new units at the
Computex trade show in Taipei. Peter Misek, an analyst at Jefferies &amp; Co.
estimates annual sales for tablets sales will almost quadruple to 70
million devices this year. In the following three years, the annual total
will more than triple to 246 million.

    Fuel Technology 

    dPollution International (RMGX) recently announced positive test results
for it's fuel efficiency technology conducted by the Italian army, as
part of trials for possible sales to European armed forces. The company
is moving ahead to conduct further testing with NATO battlefield
vehicles, hoping to make good on their claim of major mileage
improvements.

    The company's flagship product improves engine performance by causing
fuel to burn more efficiently in the combustion chamber. The technology
works on all closed-combustion gas and diesel engines.

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, May 31 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Gasoline Prices: The price of oil did dip somewhat Monday on a stronger
US dollar, but that's temporary if you're to believe Wall Street
heavyweights Goldman Sachs (GS), Morgan Stanley (MOR), and J.P. Morgan
(JPM).

    Goldman Sachs said last week that West Texas Intermediate crude, the US
benchmark, will hit $135 per barrel by the end of 2012. Morgan Stanley
said Brent will average $120 per barrel in six months, and J.P. Morgan
thinks Brent will be $130 per barrel in the third quarter.

    Oil is down about 12 per cent for the month and US pump prices dropped
about three per cent, now at $3.80 per gallon. That doesn't go far to
alleviate the fact that gas prices are about $1.00 more per gallon than
one year ago. If oil does what the big boys say it will, gasoline would
rise to around $4.20 per gallon.

    Fuel Technology 

    dPollution International (RMGX) recently announced positive test results
for its fuel efficiency technology conducted by the Italian army, as part
of trials for possible sales to European armed forces. The company is
moving ahead to conduct further testing with NATO battlefield vehicles,
hoping to make good on their claim of major mileage improvements.

    The company's flagship product improves engine performance by causing
fuel to burn more efficiently in the combustion chamber. The technology
works on all closed-combustion gas and diesel engines.

			Acme Packet Extends Outsourcery&#8217;s Cloud with Microsoft Lync
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Net-Net 3820 session border controllers deliver SIP trunking services 
      for hosted unified communications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Acme Packet&#174; (NASDAQ: APKT), the leader in session delivery network 
      solutions, today announced that Outsourcery, a world-leading, UK-based 
      cloud service provider &#8211; and Microsoft's worldwide 'Hosting Solutions 
      Partner of the Year' 2010 &#8211; is leveraging Acme Packet Net-Net&#174; session 
      border controllers (SBCs) to deliver SIP trunking services to 
      Outsourcery&#8217;s hosted Microsoft unified communications (UC) customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Net-Net 3820 SBCs are deployed in multiple high-availability (HA) 
      pairs at Outsourcery&#8217;s access and interconnect borders to secure its 
      network, route VoIP and UC sessions and aggregate usage statistics for 
      its customers. This deployment extends Outsourcery's broad cloud product 
      offerings for businesses by supporting its launch of Microsoft Lync 2010 
      and allowing geographic distribution across multiple sites.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Outsourcery is a world-leading cloud services and unified communications 
      (UC) provider. The company has one of the broadest cloud product 
      offerings for businesses in the world, covering hosted software 
      applications (software-as-a-service), virtualized infrastructure 
      (infrastructure-as-a-service) and unified communications solutions as 
      well as professional services to customize and integrate solutions for 
      customers. It is a founding member of the Cloud Industry Forum (CIF). 
      Outsourcery is also the UK&#8217;s first carbon neutral UC and hosted IT 
      solutions company, and was awarded the prestigious Comms Business &#8216;Green 
      Channel Company Award 2010&#8217; for offsetting its carbon emissions to 
      replace open cooking fires in the Kisumu region of Kenya with energy 
      efficient Rocket stoves.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft named Outsourcery in the 2010 Worldwide Partner Awards, as 
      their &#8216;Hosting Solutions Partner of the Year&#8217;. Outsourcery is also 
      Microsoft&#8217;s UK launch partner for UC and most recently won the 
      prestigious Business Solutions Provider at the Mobile News Awards 2011, 
      as well as the Parallels New Partner of the Year award 2011. A Microsoft 
      Certified Gold Partner with a total of seven competencies, Outsourcery 
      employs more than 120 staff based in the UK.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We chose Acme Packet for a number of reasons, including their market 
      leadership and experience with Microsoft UC deployments in enterprise 
      and service provider networks,&#8221; said Ryan O&#8217;Reilly, Head of Telecoms 
      Infrastructure  Networks at Outsourcery. &#8220;The Net-Net 3820 SBC will 
      play a key role in our network as we expand our customer base and add 
      new services to our IP communications portfolio.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Acme Packet SBCs are proven to be interoperable with Microsoft UC 
      solutions, having been used by service providers for qualification 
      testing. Microsoft&#8217;s Unified Communications Open Interoperability 
      Program (UC OIP) tests and qualifies third party infrastructure and 
      services for interoperability with Microsoft UC solutions. Acme Packet 
      is deployed in at least 70% of UC OIP-qualified SIP trunking service 
      providers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Outsourcery also chose Acme Packet SBCs for their broad range of 
      functions and features, including security, accounting and routing. Acme 
      Packet call detail records (CDRs) are used by Outsourcery for service 
      level assurance and customer billing. Denial of service (DoS) prevention 
      protects Outsourcery&#8217;s network against outages or degradation from 
      traffic overloads and also ensures that network resources are not 
      compromised by non-compliant protocol traffic. The Net-Net 3820 SBCs are 
      also configured to route sessions between Outsourcery&#8217;s network and 
      other IP service provider networks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Service providers worldwide recognize Acme Packet&#8217;s proven track record 
      in next-generation hosted services solutions,&#8221; said Dino Di Palma, Acme 
      Packet&#8217;s senior vice president of worldwide sales and business 
      development. &#8220;Our commitment to interoperability pays dividends to 
      service providers such as Outsourcery as they build out hosted UC and 
      other service offerings.&#8221;

      Watsco, Inc. (NYSE:WSO) (Paris:WSO) announced today that Barry S. Logan, 
      Senior Vice President, is scheduled to present at the J.P. Morgan HVAC 
      Conference being held at J.P. Morgan&#8217;s Headquarters at 270 Park Avenue 
      in New York City on Monday, June 6, 2011 at 11:15 a.m. (EDT). Internet 
      users can listen to a live webcast of the presentation at the Investor

		&lt;p&gt;
      Watsco improves indoor living and working environments with air 
      conditioning and heating solutions that provide comfort regardless of 
      the outdoor climate. Our solutions also promote healthier indoor spaces 
      by removing pollutants from the indoor air that can lead to asthma, 
      allergies and reductions in productivity. Furthermore, since heating and 
      cooling accounts for approximately 56% of the energy consumed in a 
      typical United States home, we offer consumers the greatest opportunity 
      to save money on energy by replacing existing air conditioning and 
      heating systems with more energy efficient and environmentally friendly 
      solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are approximately 74 million central air conditioning and heating 
      systems installed in the United States that have been in service for 
      more than 10 years. Older systems often operate below government 
      mandated energy efficiency and environmental standards. Watsco has an 
      opportunity to accelerate the replacement of these systems at a scale 
      greater than our competitors as the movement toward reducing energy 
      consumption and its environmental impact continues. As the industry 
      leader with over 500 locations in the United States and Puerto Rico, 
      with additional market coverage on an export basis to parts of Latin 
      America and the Caribbean, significant growth potential remains given 
      that our current revenue run-rate is less than 10% of the estimated $30 
      billion United States market for HVAC/R products. Additional information

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE May 31 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase 's Asian
private wealth unit, which caters to individuals with $10-30
million to invest, has hired DBS Private Bank's North Asia chief
Edwin Lim to strengthen its Greater China business, two sources
said on Tuesday.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lim will report to Peter Flavel, who joined JPMorgan from
Standard Chartered last year to help build the U.S.
bank's regional wealth management business. [ID:nSGE66E03G]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flavel had been credited with the re-launch of Stanchart's
global private bank about four years ago and turning it into a
top 10 Asian private bank.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Edwin Lim, who currently serves as DBS's head of
private banking for North Asia will leave the bank in June
2011.DBS Private Bank is expected to appoint a successor
shortly," a spokeswoman for Singapore's largest lender said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan declined comment.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's wealth management business in Asia comprises two
arms -- JPMorgan Private Bank, which caters to people with more
than $30 million in investible assets, and JPMorgan Private
Wealth, which focuses on those with $10-30 million.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private banks are hiring aggressively in Asia, encouraged by
the strong growth in a region where the number of millionaires
now exceeds the number in Europe.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Standard Chartered Private Bank said recently it is keen to
add around 270 relationship managers to its ranks by end-2013,
raising headcount to around 750 as it seeks to increase its
share of Asia's fast-growing wealth management business.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Improving fundamentals and investor sentiments and attractive valuations are set to drive positive equity returns in 2011 for European small/mid-caps, J.P. Morgan Securities said and recommended investors start buying on dips.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Equity valuations are back to the bottom of their historical range, JP Morgan said, adding the MSCI Europe Index is flat year-to-date versus 30 percent rally from July to December in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It upgraded Denmark SMid-Caps to "overweight," and said Spain, Italy and Ireland are still among best performing SMid countries year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Danish SMid-Caps are down 43.8 percent from 2007 highs on average, which is worse than Ireland's, but their fundamentals are far better, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its pan-European small/mid-cap strategy note, JP Morgan also upgraded the telecom sector to "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage continues to overweight small-caps versus mid-caps as small-caps are benefiting from better growth and valuations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stage is being set for stronger markets within weeks, not months, as commodity rollover will ultimately be seen as a positive and as activity momentum finds a bottom," JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mary Meyase in Bangalore; Editing by Maju Samuel)&lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;The production control umbilicals will provide hydraulic, electrical and fiber optic service to the Jack and St. Malo subsea fields. Scope of work includes three electro-hydraulic steel tube production umbilicals totalling 40 miles (65 kilometres). Engineering, project management, and manufacturing will take place at Aker Solutions' state-of-the-art umbilical facility in Mobile, Alabama. The three umbilicals will be used at Chevron's Jack  St. Malo field, located in the Walker Ridge Area of the Gulf of Mexico in water depths of approximately 7,000 feet (2,100 metres). "Aker Solutions is excited to see Chevron come back to us with a repeat order and is proud to contribute to this very important project for Chevron and for the Gulf of Mexico region," said Erik Wiik, President - Subsea North America, Aker Solutions. &lt;/p&gt;

			&lt;p&gt;Opened in 2003, Aker Solutions' umbilical manufacturing facility in Mobile is strategically located to serve the Gulf of Mexico and global markets. The facility, with its high capacity horizontal cabler, is specially designed to meet the challenges of demanding deepwater applications.&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Aker Solutions is the market leader within steel tube umbilicals. This position has been backed by a strong focus on health, safety and the environment (HSE) which has been exemplified through reaching an important milestone of five years without a lost time injury (LTI) at both production sites in Moss, Norway, and in Mobile, Alabama. &lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
			&lt;p&gt;Over the past 15 years Aker Solutions has delivered more than 400 umbilicals to some of the world's most challenging fields, from harsh environment to ultra-deep, high-pressure water conditions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Gaia Capital Management's Japan-focused hedge fund, started by a former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) trader, lost more than three quarters of its roughly $150 million assets in just two months as the March 11 earthquake blew aside its assumptions, a letter to investors obtained by Reuters showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GAIA J-Multi Strategy Fund, which used to be one of the larger Japan-focused hedge funds in Asia and was launched by Kenichiro Nishi, saw a 44 percent plunge in March returns as the devastating earthquake triggered panic selling in markets and forced the fund to unwind all its positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its assets shrunk to $32.65 million at end-April from $92.06 million at end-March, according to the fund's investor letter. The fund managed more than $150 million before the earthquake, five sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan's benchmark Nikkei share index .N225 was down about 5.6 percent from March 11 till the end of April. That included a 16 percent tumble between March 14 and 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund suffered major losses in volatility-based derivatives strategies in March, the letter showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following "the earthquake and the deterioration of the situation at the nuclear power plant that led to radiation leaks, both the index and volatility broke sharply out of their expected ranges on the 14th and 15th," Gaia Capital wrote to investors in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result, the fund incurred heavy losses that were beyond our expectations and we had to unwind all positions in the portfolio," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nishi, who worked for Goldman Sachs between 1997 and 2003, managed about $2 billion in a Japanese convertible bond portfolio and about $3 billion for DKR Oasis before starting his Japan focused fund, according a report by AsiaHedge in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund declined to comment after several attempts to seek a response. A Reuters reporter visited the fund's office in Tokyo in March but Nishi's representatives declined to discuss the fund's performance. E-mails to Gaia Capital bounced back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Japan-focused hedge funds managed $15.6 billion at the end of March, data from industry tracker Eurekahedge shows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHAT WENT WRONG FOR GAIA?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the fund's strategy prior to the earthquake were the assumptions that the Japanese market would continue to drift in the short-term and remain rangebound within a narrow range and that liquidity in the derivative products it held would not vanish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earthquake, and the nuclear disaster that followed, shattered those assumptions while the speed at which the market reacted and the surge in volatility made it tough for the fund to adjust its positions quickly enough to limit the damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One trade the fund had on its books was going long certain Nikkei 225 dividend swaps -- instruments that give the holders of the contract exposure to the future dividends paid out by Nikkei 225 constituents rather than their share prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund believed markets were underestimating dividends Japanese companies will pay out in two to five years and had positioned to benefit as these expectations, and the value of the contracts the fund held, rose.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, with companies facing escalating uncertainty as the nuclear situation unfolded, expectations of any dividends, now or in the future, collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the derivatives side, the fund had a put spread -- a derivatives strategy that involves buying and selling an equal number of put contracts at different strike prices -- with the maximum payout occurring if the Nikkei was around 10,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the lifespan of the strategy, the fund expected the Nikkei to trade between the 9,500 - 11,000 range, the investor letter showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Nikkei, in fact, plunged to 8,234.6 on March 15 as headlines on the growing nuclear disaster hit trading terminals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even though the fund attempted to exit positions, liquidity in the markets for the contracts it held dried up and the fund was forced to liquidate positions at the bottom of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The situation in March highlighted several issues that we will have to address in the future, including our response to events that occur outside the financial markets (tail risk management), over-confidence in liquidity in the index futures/option market, etc," Gaia Capital wrote to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund returned 36.1 percent in 2009 and 21.7 percent in 2010 with only two negative months in the two years, the investor letter showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund gained 1.4 percent last month, bringing its loss up to end-April in 2011 to 42 percent. By comparison, the Eurekahedge Japan Hedge Fund Index was up 0.87 percent over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm set up a special redemption day at the end of March and turned almost the entire portfolio into cash to meet redemptions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said in the letter that the firm would strengthen risk management and introduce stricter risk guidelines for the gamma and volatility strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nathan Layne in TOKYO and Vikram Subhedar in HONG KONG; Editing by Mike Flaherty, Jacqueline Wong and Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;
