&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) posted a $10.89 billion first-quarter profit on Thursday, but still managed to disappoint investors as weak production volumes and low refining margins blunted the impact of record-high crude prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earnings rose 17 percent year over year, and were the second-highest in U.S. history, but still fell short of Wall Street expectations, and its shares dropped 3.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's near-record profits brought sharpened scrutiny from politicians and consumer groups, who are upset about sky-high gasoline prices at the pump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmark U.S. oil prices averaged a record of nearly $98 a barrel during the quarter, up about 70 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon posted record earnings of $40.6 billion in 2007, with revenue higher than the gross domestic product of Turkey, the world's 17th-largest economy. If oil prices stay above or around $100 for the remainder of 2008, the company could beat that mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A steep drop in profit margins for gasoline cut into Exxon's earnings as the company, like other refiners, struggled to pass on higher crude costs to customers. First-quarter gasoline prices rose 33 percent year over year in the United States -- less than half crude's rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's oil and gas production also fell 5.6 percent in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chris MacDonald, portfolio manager at WHG Funds, said the production decline was "kind of shocking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes the future seem kind of dire, because this quarter they really got bailed out by high oil prices ...

The company also had a whopping 49 percent effective income tax rate in the quarter, up from 44 percent last year, which also weighed on earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings at its exploration and production segment increased 45 percent to $8.79 billion, while refining profits dropped 39 percent to $1.17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said its production shortfall resulted in part from production-sharing contracts that give host countries a larger share of oil and gas produced as commodity prices rise.

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, May 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM Business Partner Leadership Conference -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced
new
software and unveiled for the first time a broad initiative to combine
hardware, software and services to tackle the cost and complexity of IT for
small and medium businesses.  The new, strategic initiative -- code-named the
"Blue Business Platform" -- aims to provide a new and compelling choice to
simplify IT delivery for companies that lack the time and resources to manage
computer systems.

    The initiative, which is part of IBM's ongoing plans to aggressively
targetits largest opportunity for growth in the $500 billion SMB marketplace, is
focused on enabling thousands of software and solution providers to
dramatically accelerate the adoption and simplify the management of their
business applications on IBM systems.

    This new, open platform, which will be piloted and delivered in the coming
months, will offer software and solution providers access to new customers on a
global scale and reduce the high costs of new client acquisition, technology
integration and support.

    The first step in this strategic initiative is IBM Lotus Foundations
Start,the first in a family of servers for small businesses planned for general
availability in the second quarter.  Lotus Foundations Start includes e-mail,
security, backup and recovery features, and is an ideal solution for small
businesses with little or no IT support.  It can be deployed in under 30
minutes and provides the essential collaboration software required to power a
small business.

    Next, IBM is recruiting software and solution providers to participate in
the "Blue Business Platform" to integrate their software with a new
application toolkit and online marketplace that will be piloted later
this
year:


--  Application Integration Toolkit, a set of open standard interfaces
    that will make the installation of new applications, systems management and
    online services -- like remote data protection from IBM Business Continuity
    &amp; Resiliency Services and threat protection -- easy to use, consistent and
    compatible for small and medium businesses.  After an initial beta program
    earlier this year, IBM expects to recruit hundreds of new partners to join
    the Global Application Marketplace.

--  Global Application Marketplace will enable businesses later this year
    to access a rich marketplace of business applications, services, peer
    ratings of these offerings, and access to an online business solutions
    advisor from their IBM system.
    

    
For more details on how business partners can participate in the "Blue
Business Platform" initiative, IBM is hosting educational sessions for
hundreds of software and solution providers later this month.

    Technology innovation has been a key factor in expanding the reach of
smallbusinesses, making it one of the fastest growing segments of the global
economy.
 Today's announcement provides application providers and resellers an open
platform
on which they can reach new customers and grow their businesses.

    The requirements of smaller businesses are unique. They need to be as fast
and
responsive as enterprise companies, but are limited by smaller IT staffs and
fewer integration capabilities. They want integrated solutions that are easy to
use
and manage.    A recent study by Forrester states that the channel influences
more than 90 percent of IT purchasing decisions in the SMB market. Given
these requirements, building and enabling a global partner ecosystem continues
to be a key route to market for IBM.

    Understanding these requirements, IBM has identified one million clients
worldwide that it wants to target more aggressively with its business partners
to
deliver pre-integrated business solutions that are easy to deploy and manage.

    Whether clients start small with a pre-integrated appliance server or gain
real-time access to an online category of business solutions that meet their
business needs, IBM aims to provide SMBs with innovative solutions that simplify
their IT experience.

    Enabling Smaller Businesses With Complete Solutions

    IBM Lotus Foundations Start is a complete collaboration solution for
businesses with five to 500 employees who have limited or no in-house technical
resources.

    Delivered as an on-premise software server that will be offered primarily
through
IBM Business Partners, this software offering will include the Lotus Notes
and Domino mail and collaboration platform, file management, directory services,
firewall, back-up and recovery, anti-virus, anti-spam and Lotus Symphony office
productivity tools.

    A complete, out-of-the box solution designed to get businesses up and
running
quickly, Lotus Foundations Start maximizes business productivity with minimal IT
hassle. It is an appliance server that a small business can launch within 30
minutes with self-managing features that minimize the need for human
intervention.   Pre-loaded with tools that smaller businesses really use, Lotus
Foundations Start is also designed to accommodate growth. Customers will be able
to easily add more users or servers as needed.  The software also gives
business partners the opportunity to build a new business with a turnkey
solution.

    An early release program for Lotus Foundations Start is now available for
select business partners and customers using an IBM Web ID/password at:
https://www-304.ibm.com/software/earlyprograms/surveys/cust/nomination.wss?id=35


    Accelerating Business Partner Growth

    The "Blue Business Platform" aims to provide Business Partners --
includingISV's, resellers and system integrators -- with access to a broader
range of
global clients and simplified integration capabilities, helping save time and
money.

    IBM will open its Global Innovation Centers to enable software providers
tostandardize their applications to the Application Integration Toolkit.  By
enabling applications to this standard platform, clients can gain access
topre-integrated solutions that combine business partner applications with IBM's
software and hardware offerings, including WebSphere, POWER and BladeCenter
Systems.

    As part of today's news, IBM is working with its business partners to launch
more than 250 Business Partner Innovation Centers, enabling faster access to IBM
technology, technical assistance and on-site support.

    The company is also opening eight new IBM Innovation Centers in South
Africa,
Turkey, Ukraine and several other emerging markets, providing business partners
with technology resources, incentives, and sales and marketing opportunities
to help make their businesses more profitable.

    IBM will also offer its global business partners the opportunity to showcase
their solutions through a new Global Application Marketplace.   In less than
four easy clicks, clients can gain access to a range of business solutions
through
an online catalog, based on their geographic locations and business needs.  
This
sets the stage for IBM's future online marketplace that will provide smaller
businesses with a single source from which to research, acquire and manage IT
solutions in a few simple steps on the Web.

    Today's announcement builds on IBM's industry-leading portfolio of SMB
offerings, business partner programs and customer support services organized
under
its Express Advantage strategy.  Earlier this week, for example, IBM
announced the availability of new IT security solutions, business continuity
offerings and POWER6(TM) processor-based servers all designed, developed and
priced for the mid-market.

    The "IBM Blue Business Platform" Initiative

    The "Blue Business Platform," is a code-name for an innovative technology
roadmap
and delivery platform that IBM will pilot throughout 2008.  The cross-company
initiative aims to provide an online marketplace as well as local on-premise
delivery to radically simplify the way smaller businesses buy, access and manage
technology solutions from IBM and its business partners.

    For more details on how business partners can participate in the "Blue
Business
Platform" initiative, IBM is hosting educational sessions for hundreds of
software and solution providers later this month.  More details can be found at:

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) $116
billion in first-quarter revenue was great for shareholders but
was nearly as good for the tax man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company paid a whopping 49 percent effective income tax
rate in the quarter and could pay similarly high taxes in
quarters to come if oil prices stay high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's tax rate has increased with oil prices, rising
every year since 2003. The company's tax rate that year was 36
percent; last year it had an effective income tax rate of 44
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said this quarter's high rate was not
necessarily indicative of where taxes would settle for the full
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When looking at tax rates, as with our business in
general, it is best viewed over longer periods of time," said
Exxon spokesman Gantt Walton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the company's income mix in the current quarter,
which was weighted toward its heavily taxed non-U.S. oil and
gas production assets pushed up the rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 66 percent of the company's first-quarter profit came
from that segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As they become more international, and they deal with more
foreign governments collecting more economic rent, they are
getting less and less of the value" of their projects, said
James Halloran, energy analyst with National City Private
Client Group. "It's another way they are getting their pocket
picked and it just continues to go up."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John S. Herold analyst Lysle Brinker said the companies
2008 tax rate probably won't stay as high as in the first
quarter, but said it will probably be higher than he had
previously expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It will very likely be higher than the 44 percent they
posted last year, he said, suggesting it could be in the 46 to
47 percent range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It certainly does take out a few points on earnings," he
said.

&lt;p&gt; (Refiles to fix reference to gross domestic product in fifth
paragraph)
 (Adds background on Nigeria, new quote from Hillary Clinton)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Erman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
posted a $10.89 billion first-quarter profit on Thursday, but
still managed to disappoint investors as weak production
volumes and low refining margins blunted the impact of the
record-high crude prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's quarterly earnings rose 17 percent year over
year and were the second-highest in U.S. history, but the
results fell short of Wall Street expectations and the its
shares dropped more than 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's near-record profits sharpened scrutiny of the
company from politicians and consumer groups, who are upset
about sky-high gasoline prices at the pump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Benchmark U.S. oil prices averaged a record of nearly $98 a
barrel during the quarter, up about 70 percent from a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon posted record earnings of $40.6 billion in 2007, with
revenue higher than the gross domestic product of Turkey, the
world's 17th-largest economy. If oil prices stay above or
around $100 for the remainder of 2008, the company could beat
that mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A steep drop in profit margins for gasoline cut into
Exxon's earnings as the company, such as other refiners,
struggled to pass on higher crude costs to customers.
First-quarter gasoline prices rose 33 percent year over year in
the United States -- less than half crude's rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's oil and gas production also fell 5.6 percent in the
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chris MacDonald, portfolio manager at WHG Funds, said the
production decline was "kind of shocking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It makes the future seem kind of dire, because this
quarter they really got bailed out by high oil prices ... It
kind of shows that you're at the limit of big new finds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has been criticized by some analysts and
investors for laying back on capital spending while going full
bore on share buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spent $31.8 billion to buy back shares in 2007, while
shelling out $20.9 billion for capital expenditures. In 2008,
the company expects to increase its capital spending to around
$25 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems that they are more of a share buyback machine
that also happens to produce energy," MacDonald said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European oil majors BP Plc (BP.L) and Royal Dutch Shell Plc
(RDSa.L) earlier this week posted big first-quarter earnings
gains as the crude oil surge was an even bigger boon for the
companies than expected. Both companies had flat production
during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REVENUE OF $117 BILLION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest publicly traded company earned $2.03 a
share in the first quarter, up from net income of $9.28
billion, or $1.62 a share, in the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But analysts on average had expected the company to earn
$2.11, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue in the quarter rose to $116.85 billion from $87.22
billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings from the company's exploration and production
segment increased 45 percent to $8.79 billion, while its
refining profits dropped 39 percent to $1.17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said its production shortfall resulted in part
from production-sharing contracts that give host countries a
larger share of oil and gas produced as commodity prices rise.
The decline of older fields and the loss of operations that
were nationalized by Venezuela last year also hurt production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon reached a deal with a Nigerian oil union on Thursday
[ID:nL01628282] after an eight-day old strike had shut down
virtually all of the 800,00 barrels per day of production in
the country, which could hit the company's second output
figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The question is going to come and you always have to ask
it every year: Are they seeing any acceleration in mature field
declines? Because slowly the majors are beginning to see this
to some degree," said James Halloran, energy analyst with
National City Private Client Group in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Halloran was concerned because very little of the volume
shortfall appears to be one-time items such as maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings at Exxon's chemicals unit dropped 17 percent to
$1.03 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is something seriously wrong with our economy when
Exxon's record $11 billion in quarterly profits are seen as a
disappointment by Wall Street," presidential candidate Sen.
Hillary Clinton (D-NY) said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But on Main Street, middle class families are facing
devastating choices every day between buying groceries and
filling up their gas tanks to get to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon shares closed $3.37, or 3.6 percent, down at $89.70
on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Through Wednesday's close they were down less than 1
percent this year, underperforming the Chicago Board Options
Exchange's oil index .OIX, which is up more than 2 percent
over the same period.

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, May 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 For decades Hollywood has looked to science for inspiration, now IBM (NYSE:
IBM)
researchers are looking to Hollywood for new ideas too.

    The entertainment industry has portrayed possible future worlds through
science
fiction movies -- many created by USC's famous alumni -- and IBM wants to tap
into that creativity.

    At a kickoff event at the USC School of Cinematic Arts, five of IBM's top
scientists met with students and alumni of the school, along with other
invitees from the entertainment industry, to "Imagine the World in 2050." The
event is the first phase of an expected collaboration between IBM and USC to
explore how combining creative vision and insight with science and technology
trends might fuel novel solutions to the most pressing problems and
opportunities
of our time.

    The event was also aimed at giving filmmakers access to IBM scientists for
new ideas about the trajectories of science and technology as they create new
films and for IBM to tap into the ideas of Hollywood's current and future
creative minds.

    At the event, IBM researchers discussed the potential for self-healing
spinal cords;
embedded digital assistants that remember all you hear or say; the concept
of "longevity management" for life-spans stretching past the century mark;
drinkable, purified water everywhere; changes to the human genome; and many
other insights into what the world might be like in the Year 2050 and beyond.

    While many of these ideas sound like science fiction, IBM scientists say
that
projects incubating today in IBM labs, and elsewhere, might just make them a
reality.

    "We've long realized that radical innovation can be accelerated by tapping
into
the most creative talent we can find," said Don Eigler, Fellow, IBM Research.
"Working with the USC School of Cinematic Arts is likely to give us a glimpse
of the future that we never would have on our own. I expect sparks to fly."

    IBM has a history of opening the doors of its Research labs to work directly
with clients on their toughest problems, and in the past five years has
accelerated its approach to innovation by tapping into the collective
brainpower of: clients, partners, universities, IBM employees and even their
family
members. This model has accelerated IBM's ability to collaborate on new
ideas and create new market opportunities.

    Following last night's "brainstorm" event, IBM Research and the USC School
of
Cinematic Arts intend to collaborate on a unique research project with the
goal of exploring a future in 2050 based on scientific projections for areas
including nanotechnology, digital imaging, predictive software, and emerging
medical, environmental and collective intelligence technologies. The project
might
inspire new movie or television scripts, digital media projects, a time capsule
or lead to novel projects and applications that IBM could pursue.

    "This research project will give our students and faculty access to
anotherworld of ideas via IBM Research. It's an exchange we hope will fuel the
imagination on both sides of the collaboration," said Professor Richard
Weinberg,
Ph.D.

    IBM Research is a prolific and far-reaching commercial lab, with five
NobelPrize winners and 15 years of US patent leadership. IBM Research is
engagedwith many public and private researchers around the world to better
understand
and address some of the biggest issues of our time.

    Additionally, IBM has long been engaged with media and entertainment
companies, helping
them to transform their business operations and produce, store and distribute
digital content. IBM's advanced technologies help film studios produce vivid
animations and visual effects and make the process of creating movies and
television episodes more efficient.

    With six divisions in animation &amp; digital arts, critical studies, film &amp;
television production, interactive media, producing and writing, the USC
School of Cinematic Arts covers the entire spectrum of the art form and
industry. The school has been heavily involved with technologies such as
high-speed networking, digital cinema, performance capture and computer
animation.
Taught by award-winning faculty, SCA students and alumni are a major force
in entertainment arts production, research and scholarship.

    While IBM and USC discuss the far future of science and technology, in Los
Angeles this week, IBM is gathering more than 1,000 business leaders from its
top partnerships around the world.  The IBM Business Partner Leadership
Conference,
taking place at the Los Angeles Convention Center, is focusing on nearer-term
technology trends that are shaping the world's innovation agenda and creating
new
growth opportunities for companies and countries around the globe.

&lt;p&gt;  WATERLOO, ONTARIO, May 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 MKS Inc. (TSX: MKX) announced today the immediate availability of
Implementer(R) 2008, an integral part of MKS Integrity for IBM i. MKS
Integrity for IBM i is an enterprise software platform that covers all
facets of the application lifecycle from IT Help Desk, requirements
management, software change and configuration management, test management
and release management.

    With the release of Implementer 2008, MKS delivers major improvements for
IBM i (also System i and iSeries) users in the following areas:

    - Streamlined development within IBM WebSphere Development Studio Client
for System i (WDSC) 7.0 and new support for IBM Rational Developer for
System i (RDi) 7.1 - the developer experience now takes advantage of the
latest Eclipse-based technology in WDSC and RDi with a new plug-in for
Remote System Explorer (RSE). Icons, decorators, last used values, and
other common Eclipse features are utilized to simplify development. With
MKS Integrity for IBM i developers can review work assignments, check
out, edit, compile, check in, release and deploy, and update project
information such as status and time entry all within RSE. With these
enhancements, MKS now provides the deepest level of integration into IBM
WDSC and IBM RDi available today, giving users a central point of control
for unifying process across their application lifecycle.

    - Tighter security in support of PCI compliance - to meet the needs of
security conscious customers, such as those clients in the Payment Card
Industry (PCI), encryption can now be utilized for FTP deployments and
communication amongst other servers. MKS also worked closely with IBM to
replace system state programs with new IBM i APIs and enhanced system
commands for greater operating system security.

    - Greater application availability during database promotions - faster
database promotions for all SQL tables (leveraging dynamic Alter Table
technology) and DDS-based physical files helps minimize application down
time during large installations.

    - Usability improvements for the developer - for developers choosing to
use the host-based MKS Workbench, their work is simplified through Named
User Filters which eliminate the need for repetitious entry of common
search criteria. Numerous other usability enhancements have been included
in this area where the developer spends most of his time.

    - Improved third-party integrations - this release offers new support for
Maximum Availability's noMax and enhanced integration support for JDE
World, CA 2E, Visual LANSA, Lotus Domino, and Hawkeye Information Systems
Pathfinder.

    "In this release of Implementer 2008 we focused on simplifying the
developer experience," says MKS Product Manager Marty Acks. "Our main
objective was to let the developer work within WDSC/RDi in the most
natural way possible. Those who have previewed this release have
specifically cited the strong emphasis on working within Remote System
Explorer (RSE) in WDSC/RDi as a major convenience, and the ability to do
so without requiring the use of other clients, host-based interfaces, or
third party products to perform their day-day to activities as
distinguishing our integration from other offerings in the market."

    MKS is pleased to announce two upcoming Webinars to review the new
capabilities and enhancements in Implementer 2008, and demonstrate the
integration between MKS Integrity and IBM WDSC and IBM RDi. The first,

*IMPORTANT NOTES


1.  Calculation of Net Asset Value

This estimated valuation of the Company's net asset value, which has been
prepared in good faith by the Company's administrator, is for information only.
Save as set forth below, it is determined based upon the latest available
valuations (or estimated valuations) provided, directly or indirectly, by the
investment managers ("Advisors") selected by the Company's investment manager
(the "Investment Manager").  The above estimates do not take into account
certain adjustments yet to be made in relation to performance fee calculations
following a repurchase or sale from treasury of the Company's stock.

2.  Calculation of Performance Data

Set out above are the estimated week to date ("WTD"), estimated month to date
("MTD") and estimated calendar year to date ("YTD") performance figures. The WTD
performance figure is calculated by reference to the previously published
estimated NAV. The MTD performance figure is calculated by reference to the
previous month's estimated NAV as published or, if published, the previous
month's final NAV. The YTD performance figure is calculated by reference to the
NAV at the end of the last calendar year.

3.  ERISA

The articles of association of the Company prohibit any purchase or acquisition
of shares by or on behalf of or for the benefit of an ERISA plan or benefit plan
investor subject to similar laws (a "Plan Investor"), and incorporate provisions
whereby purported purchases of shares by or on behalf of or for the benefit of
an ERISA plan or Plan Investor will not operate to confer any interest or rights
whatsoever in such shares in favour of an ERISA plan or Plan Investor, but
instead will take effect as a trust for redemption in favour of the Company and
the Company will subsequently purchase or redeem such shares, which purchase or
redemption may take place at an amount per share which is less than the price
paid by an ERISA plan or Plan Investor on the purported acquisition.

4.  For the Attention of United States Residents

The shares may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, US Persons (as defined in the Regulation S under the
Securities Act of 1933 or any person who would be considered a US person under
Rule 4.7 of the United States Commodity Exchange Act).

5.   Investment Policy

In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Company will (directly or
indirectly) allocate its assets to a relatively concentrated portfolio of
Advisors (or entities managed by them) selected by the Investment Manager. It is
expected that such Advisors will employ a broad range of alternative investment
strategies, which will include both core strategies (i.e., event driven,
tactical trading, equity long/short and relative value strategies) as well as
other niche strategies. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve
its investment objective or that it will be able to implement its investment
policy, or that the portfolio design, risk monitoring and hedging strategies of
the Company will be successful.

6.  Notes on Estimated Valuation

Certain securities or other assets in which the Advisors invest may not have a
readily ascertainable market price or may otherwise be difficult to value and
will be priced by the Advisors.

The Company may not have received valuations (or estimated valuations) from
Advisors on a timely or current basis, and may not have received valuations at
all. In order to arrive at the net asset value, the Company will generally use
the latest available valuations (or estimated valuations) provided, directly or
indirectly, by the Advisors.  Valuations (or estimated valuations) received by
the Company may be unaudited or may be subject to little verification or other
due diligence and may not comply with generally accepted accounting practices or
other valuation principles.

In addition, neither the Company's administrator nor the Investment Manager will
generally have sufficient information to be able to independently confirm or
review the completeness, genuineness or accuracy of the Advisors' valuations (or
estimated valuations).  In certain circumstances as set out in the Company's
prospectus, including if the Investment Manager determines, in its sole
discretion, that a valuation is inaccurate or incomplete, the Investment Manager
may, in its sole discretion, determine the fair value of the Company's interests
independently of the Advisor's valuations based on information available to, and
factors deemed relevant (at its sole discretion) by, the Investment Manager at
the time of such valuation.  As stated in the prospectus, no reliance should be
placed on any weekly valuations.

Other risk factors which may be relevant to this estimated valuation are set out
in the Company's prospectus dated 7 July 2006.

As a result of these factors, the actual value of the Company's assets may be
materially different from this published estimated value.  In the event that an
estimated valuation subsequently proves to be incorrect, no adjustment to a
previously published estimated valuation is expected to be made nor would
compensation be payable.

&lt;p&gt;BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
A record number of kids worldwide participated in this year's
Disney's Environmentality Challenge, a friendly competition among
fifth grade classes to develop solutions for critical environmental
issues.

   Around 150,000 kids in the United States, Cayman Islands and Hong
Kong, the three locales where the challenge takes place, were asked to
identify and develop solutions for local environmental problems. The
challenge builds educational curriculum into the project, giving kids
the opportunity to learn the same content as other fifth graders in an
interactive and fun way.

   In California, Mrs. Sylvia Rodriguez's fifth grade class from
Phoebe Hearst Elementary in Sacramento won first place in the project
portion of Disney's Environmentality Challenge. They were awarded an
all-expense paid trip to Disneyland and the opportunity to star in a
parade down Main Street.

   The winning project aimed to protect and preserve the American
River Watershed, which supplies drinking water, a place for recreation
and play, and resources to sustain wildlife. To spread their message
on watershed protection, Mrs. Rodriguez's class filmed and aired a
documentary about the project and hosted a watershed fair.

   "We introduce kids to environmental issues in hopes that they will
carry lessons learned into the future. The program succeeds because
the kids have fun while learning valuable lessons without skipping a
beat in their regular curriculum," says Dr. Beth Stevens, Senior Vice
President, Disney's Environmental Affairs.

   Disney's Environmentality Challenge is part of a broader company
outreach program that seeks to help kids and families become better
stewards of the environment. The Environmentality Challenge is backed
by several state and federal agencies in California and Florida,
including representatives from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the
Environmental Protection Agency, and state departments of education,
environment, and food and agriculture.

   To date, more than one and a half million students worldwide have
taken Disney's Environmentality Challenge.

   About Disney's Outreach

through global outreach programs, local community initiatives, and the

true for children and families. The Disney VoluntEARS program provides
opportunities for Disney employees to contribute their time and

Disney VoluntEARS. Since the program's inception, Disney Employees and
Cast Members in over 42 countries, have donated more than 5,000,000
hours of service. For more information on Disney's outreach efforts,

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with deal being reached, changes dateline, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Camillus Eboh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA May 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) reached a deal
with a Nigerian oil union on Thursday to end an eight-day-old
strike which had shut down the U.S. oil major's production in
the West African country, a union leader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stoppage has halted virtually all Exxon's 800,000
barrels per day of production in Nigeria and forced the company
on Monday to declare force majeure on its shipments, meaning it
could not fulfill contractural obligations to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have reached agreement, production resumes immediately,"
said Olusola George-Olumoriti, head of the Mobil Producing
Nigeria branch of the PENGASSAN managers union, after talks in
the Nigerian capital Abuja.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The union struck a deal with Exxon on four out of their five
demands, but negotiations over the outstanding issue of the size
of a salary increase would resume once oil was flowing,
George-Olumoriti said. The union is seeking a 25 percent wage
hike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said in a statement that it was in process of
restarting production but a spokeswoman for the company declined
to estimate how long it would take to return to normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for the state-run Nigerian National Petroleum
Corp (NNPC), a joint-venture partner with Exxon, had earlier
estimated this could take two days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strike and attacks by Niger Delta rebels have slashed
production in the world's eighth-largest oil exporter by more
than half, driving prices to a record high around $120 a barrel
on Monday. Oil has since fallen back to below $113 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil had agreed to reduce the quota of expatriate
workers, improve pensions, diminish casual labour and improve
pipeline safety, the union leader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are going back to conclude negotiations on pay rises
because the management said they would not go back to the table
until we agreed to call off (the strike)," said
George-Olumoriti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An NNPC spokesman had told Reuters on Wednesday that
PENGASSAN had agreed to Exxon's request to suspend the strike
while talks continued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WAVE OF MILITANT ATTACKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The disruption comes after a wave of attacks by the rebel
Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND), which
says it wants President Umaru Yar'Adua's government to give a
greater share of oil revenues to the impoverished and polluted
Delta region, which produces most of Nigeria's petroleum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), the company hardest hit by the
militants, said on Tuesday that attacks had forced it to shut in
164,000 bpd of production. A company spokesman on Thursday
denied reports that production was close to restarting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is nothing like that: we are still mobilising to
repair the pipeline. The work is done in stages: you know the
security situation here," he said.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Thursday that it has started resuming its crude oil production
in Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil upstream affiliates in Nigeria confirm that we
are in the process of production start-up following resumption
of services by the senior staff workers union (PENGASSAN)," the
company said in a statement.

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil reached a deal with a Nigerian oil union on Thursday to end an eight-day-old strike which had shut in virtually all the U.S. oil major's production in the West African country, a union leader said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, May 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 High net-worth consumers rated JP Morgan Private Client Services the most
prestigious commercial bank wealth manager in the 2008 Luxury Brand Status Index
(LBSI) survey from the independent New York City-based Luxury Institute
(www.LuxuryInstitute.com). Respondents who would recommend JP Morgan Private
Client
Services said, "They have a very good national reputation," and "provide
excellent services." Wachovia Wealth Management and Deutsche Bank Private Wealth
Management rank second and third, respectively.

    "This has been an unfortunate year for the reputations of many Wealth
Management
firms among wealthy consumers, particularly units attached to larger
financial institutions that have proven to be unreliable as risk managers,"
said Milton Pedraza, CEO of the Luxury Institute.

    "An unprecedented credibility shock, such as the one the financial
servicesindustry has begun to fully recognize, has brought many Wealth
Management brand
scores down dramatically. For example, the defunct Bear Stearns brand scored a
record low 3.49 out of 10. On the other hand, its savior, the J.P. Morgan
brand, did much to enhance its reputation, to the point that the Private
Client Group scored highest, even higher than the Private Bank. Both did
extremely well, but that is the halo effect of a great reputation among the
wealthy," said Pedraza.

    "As a result of industry disarray, and to increase the accuracy of the
survey, we increased the minimum numbers of responders per brand by a
third, and several boutique brands who have been leaders in previous years did
not make the responder cutoff. That is required by the volatility in the
category, but we believe it is worth the accuracy improvement in what we hope
will be a unique set of circumstances. Our impartial surveys, conducted with
independent panels, not biased panels, and tabulated by independent
analytical firms, continue to strive to earn the trust of wealthy consumers,
the media and the brands that are rated," Pedraza noted.

    Following are the 6 Commercial Wealth Managers that were rated (alphabetical
order):


1.      Citigroup Private Bank
2.      Deutsche Bank Private Wealth Management
3.      HSBC Private Bank
4.      JP Morgan Private Client Services
5.      Wachovia Wealth Management
6.      Wells Fargo Private Client Services

    
The proprietary Luxury Brand Status Index (LBSI) survey is the only
measureof the prestige of leading brands among wealthy Americans. A national
sample of
551 wealthy American consumers, with an average income of $751K and average
net-worth of $13.9 million, was surveyed online. Survey results are weighted to
match demographic and net worth profiles of the same audience according to the
latest Survey of Consumer Finances from The Federal Reserve.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) converted a third of its preferred shares in Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T), Japan's third-largest bank, to about $1.3 billion worth of common stock, SMFG said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman in New York said the SMFG stake, valued at $3.55 billion at the end of February, was fully hedged in February and so the transaction will have no impact on its earnings now or going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still the conversion marks the latest milestone in Goldman's five-year investment in Sumitomo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest securities firm converted some of its high-dividend preferred shares to 157,151 common shares, SMFG said in a statement Wednesday. The stock, about 2 percent of its outstanding shares, was worth 136.9 billion yen ($1.3 billion), at Thursday's closing price of 871,000 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A sale in the open market would mean a potential windfall of 86.9 billion yen for Goldman, based on its acquisition price of 318,000 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However Goldman has used the stock to close out a hedge position on its Sumitomo position and will not sell the shares in the market, the banks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman injected 150 billion yen into Sumitomo Mitsui in early 2003, when the lender was struggling to survive the worst of Japan's banking crisis. Over the past few years, Goldman has been able to hedge more of its exposure to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment bank acquired a total of 50,100 shares paying a guaranteed dividend of 4.5 percent, which prompted some of Japanese media to accuse Goldman of gouging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's remaining 33,400 preferred shares in Sumitomo Mitsui will automatically convert to common stock in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=103.67 Yen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Dolan; Additional reporting by Joseph Giannone in New York; Editing by Hugh Lawson and Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has repurchased its North American Disney Store chain from Children's Place Retail Stores Inc (PLCE.O), the companies said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney said it bought back 220 locations in the United States and Canada. Terms were not disclosed. The final number of acquired stores will depend on the outcome of negotiations with landlords, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney also obtained the right to close about 100 stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children's Place said in March it was exiting the Disney Store business, and Disney confirmed it was in talks to take back stores.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Children's Place, whose eponymous chain sells clothes for children, said it would provide transitional support to Disney for up to six months and expects to incur exit costs of $50 million -- at the low end of its anticipated range of $50 million to $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of these cash costs were taken in the first quarter, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney sold a struggling chain of 313 stores to Children's Place in 2004. At the time, Children's Place was seeking to expand in the market for merchandise for newborns to age 10, and Disney was shifting its consumer goods strategy from running its own stores to designing and then licensing products to other retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Martinne Geller; Editing by Derek Caney and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/c90595) has announced the
addition of Romania Insurance Report Q1 2008 to their offering.

   The Romania Insurance Report provides independent forecasts and
competitive intelligence on Romania's insurance industry.

   This report differs from its predecessors in that it includes
BMI's Insurance Business Environment Rating (IBER). The rating brings
together a number of pieces of relevant quantitative data, together
with BMI's Country Risk Rating (CRR). It is now much easier to
consider the business environment for the insurance sector in any one
country relative to the business environment for other industries in
that country that are surveyed by BMI, and the business environment
for the insurance sector in other countries.

   Romania's IBER is 55.5. Relative to other countries in Central and
Eastern Europe, it is very small insurance market for foreign
insurers. Within the region, Romania stands out for the measure of
openness of the non-life and life segments. The economic outlook is
generally positive, although there are some political uncertainties
and a growing budget deficit. The IBER is held back by the very small
size of the industry and low levels of expected growth and penetration
of both the life and non-life sectors. It is also held back by the
legal framework and bureaucracy and external risks.

   Over the forecast period, we anticipate that non-life premiums
will grow by 18% annually in local currency terms and by 18% in US
dollar terms. Life premiums are expected to increase by 21% annually
in local currency terms and by 21% in US dollar terms. The key drivers
of growth in the non-life segment in 2008-2012 are the anticipated
rise in nominal GDP from around US$155.50bn to US$226.01bn and an
expected increase in non-life penetration from 1.68% of GDP to 2.60%.
The key driver of growth in the life segment is the envisaged rise in
life density from US$26.63 per capita in 2007 to US$70.00 per capita
in 2012. Romania's total population is declining very moderately.

   The Romanian non-life market is broadly similar to that of
Hungary: extremely crowded, except it is more fragmented. A
distinctive feature of the Romanian insurance market, as compared with
neighbouring countries such as Bulgaria and Poland, is both the sheer
number of local companies and the fact that none has a truly dominant
position. The market is also small, making it not particularly
attractive to cross-border firms. Nonetheless, the number of firms
operating in Romania is amazing, given its small size.

   The strengths of the sector lie in its relative openness to
foreign players and Romania's overall excellent Regulatory Framework,
Development and Competitive Landscape. The economy is growing
strongly, and although growth will likely slow, it is likely to
continue to grow at around 4-5% through the period 2008-2012.

   The main weakness of Romania's insurance sector is the relatively
low total size of the sector and the very low expected growth and
penetration rates in relation to other countries in the Central and
Eastern European region. There may also be threats from the global
'credit crunch' and some political uncertainty.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 1 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
has made an undisclosed investment in BTIG LLC, a fast-growing
institutional broker-dealer formed by former executives of
Speer Leeds Kellogg and Montgomery Securities, BTIG said on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; BTIG, which has 175 employees executing equity trades for
1,000 institutional investors, was co-founded in 2002 by Steve
Starker of SLK, a major Wall Street trading firm acquired by
Goldman, and Scott Kovalik of Montgomery. The closely held firm
has its main trading floor in New York and its headquarters in
San Francisco.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BTIG will continue operating as an independent firm,
majority-owned by employees. Proceeds from Goldman will help
the firm expand in the United States and build out trading
capabilities overseas.

of news stories is a valuable first step in the information
assessment.

   Sample:

   It's time for the Bear to reinvent itself

   Euroweek

   11/01/2008

   You may remember last September when Joe Lewis, the celebrated
billionaire currency trader, bought a not insignificant stake in Bear
Stearns. The Bear was in all sorts of subprime-related trouble, with
two of its hedge funds resembling the leaning tower of Pisa, and the
firm's shares were buckling.

   Therefore, when Joe Lewis, who doesn't make many mistakes and
knows the Bear well, came riding in on a white horse, the reaction on
Wall Street was "Hallelujah!"

   We were not so enthusiastic, and we made our reservations clear in
these columns. First, in our view, Joe Lewis was a trader rather than
a long term investor.

   Second, he was a septuagenarian, like Bear Stearns' long-serving,
and now ex-boss, Jimmy Cayne, who would be unlikely to be involved in
decision making in New York. Joe could enjoy games of bridge and golf
with Jimmy Cayne, but would he want to walk around the trading floor
of Bear Stearns checking the dealers' positions?

   Third, how had Joe Lewis accumulated his position in Bear Stearns?
Was it a well researched trade backed by massive due diligence, or was
this a huge derivative position which had come unstuck and someone had
to be left holding the baby? There was not only the inherent
volatility of the Bear Stearns share price, but there were financing
considerations, as Bear Stearns stock pays only a minimal dividend.

   Fourth, was Joe Lewis the Rock of Gibraltar investor that the
crumbling Bear Stearns needed? In these columns, we wrote that Warren
Buffett would have been our ideal candidate, but Warren, as has been
clear in recent weeks, had a hectic takeover agenda of his own.

   What the Bear required was an investor who would restore
shareholders' confidence. The firm had already made the mistake of
firing Warren Spector. What could Joe Lewis bring to the table to fill
that gap?

   Were our concerns about Lewis justified? We would have enjoyed
being able to tell EuroWeek readers that our crystal ball was totally
flawed. The price of Bear Stearns shares could have risen from Joe
Lewis' approximate average purchase price of $107 to, say, $150 and he
could have become a hero on Wall Street. He could have brought in new
management and arranged for the graceful retirement of Jimmy Cayne.

   Unfortunately, Joe Lewis' luck seems to have temporarily deserted
him. Certainly, Cayne has departed, to be replaced by Alan Schwartz.
But against Lewis's average price of $107, Bear Stearns shares were
recently trading at $75. The overall loss of 30% may barely make a
dent in Joe Lewis' personal net worth, but we suspect that it will
have hurt his pride.

   It is true that Bear Stearns may have struck a wishy-washy deal
with Citic Securities of China, but the announcement was greeted on
Wall Street by a combination of loud yawns and blown raspberries. What
does Bear Stearns have up its sleeve to replace the inevitable revenue
decline from its once booming mortgage business?

   Because Joe Lewis is smarter than most, we are sure that he is
totally relaxed and that his holding in Bear Stearns, to which he has
been adding, may eventually recover to $150 a share.

   However, at $75, the market is suggesting that Bear Stearns, with
reduced income from mortgages, faces an uncertain future. The firm is
better than you might think in M, and a modest player in equities.
It is less underweight than before overseas, but how the firm must
wish that it had Goldman's international revenues.

   In 2008, under Schwartz's leadership, the Bear has essentially to
reinvent itself.

    GigaSpaces Technologies today announced that they are hosting an executive
breakfast seminar along with Microsoft Corporation and Lab49 to discuss
theGigaSpaces and Microsoft joint solution, which enhances the scalability of
Microsoft Excel.  This offering allows enterprises to harness the power of
their data centers to scale their Excel-based applications and
dramaticallyimprove their users' productivity.  Craig Saint-Amour, Luke Flemmer
and Owen
Taylor will present a complete solution that allows enterprises to off load
data and computation (Excel macros, VBA, etc.) from users' desktops to the
server side, benefit from improved resiliency, scalability, and total cost of
ownership of their Excel based applications.

    During the seminar Saint-Amour, Flemmer and Taylor will discuss solution
benefits
such as how to:


--  Handle massive amounts of data (e.g. market feeds) in a reliable
    manner
--  Dramatically reduce processing times and enable more accurate risk and
    portfolio management (perform more VAR calculations and Monte Carlo
    simulation runs per hour)
--  Share data between multiple traders and analysts, and enable better
    collaboration
--  Shield users from desktop and server failures
--  Enable Excel applications to scale up (and down) to meet varying loads
--  Free up desktop resources
--  Effectively migrate Excel logic to run as server side, managed code

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS May 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Thursday its production in Nigeria remained shut in while talks
with striking unions continued, denying market rumours that it
had begun to restart its 800,000 barrels per day (bpd) output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) also said the
company had yet to reopen production shut in by recent militant
attacks. Shell said earlier this week that 164,000 bpd of its
output had been lost due to the attacks.

   EXXONMOBIL'S CHAIRMAN REX W. TILLERSON COMMENTED:

   "ExxonMobil's first quarter net income was a record $10,890
million, up 17% from the first quarter of 2007. Earnings per share
were up 25% reflecting the impact of the continuing share purchase
program. Higher crude oil and natural gas realizations, driven by
record worldwide crude oil prices, were partly offset by lower
refining and chemical margins, lower production volumes and higher
operating costs.

   "Spending on capital and exploration projects was $5.5 billion in
the first quarter, up 30% from last year, as we continued to actively
invest in projects to bring additional crude oil, natural gas and
finished products to market.

   "Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding were increased to
$8.0 billion in the first quarter of 2008. The Corporation distributed
a total of $9.9 billion to shareholders during the quarter through
dividends and share purchases to reduce shares outstanding, an
increase of 13% or $1.1 billion versus the first quarter of 2007."

   FIRST QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

   --  Record first quarter net income was $10,890 million, up 17%
        from the first quarter of 2007.

   --  Earnings per share were up 25% to $2.03 reflecting strong
        earnings and the reduced number of shares outstanding.

   --  Spending on capital and exploration projects was $5.5 billion,
        up 30% from the first quarter of 2007.

   --  Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately
        $21.8 billion, including asset sales of $0.4 billion.

   --  Share purchases of $8.0 billion reduced shares outstanding by
        1.8%.

   --  The ExxonMobil-operated Kizomba C deepwater development
        started production from the Mondo field in January 2008, 23
        months after project approval. Kizomba C is designed to
        develop 600 million barrels of oil (gross) from the Mondo,
        Saxi and Batuque fields off the coast of Angola, utilizing two
        new floating production, storage, and offloading (FPSO)
        vessels. The Saxi and Batuque fields are expected to begin
        production later in 2008, and combined peak production from
        the three fields is expected to reach 200,000 barrels of oil
        per day (gross).

   --  ExxonMobil and Malaysia's national oil company, PETRONAS,
        signed the main principles agreement for a new 25 year
        production sharing contract (PSC), to further develop
        petroleum resources offshore Peninsular Malaysia. The contract
        includes commitments to implement significant enhanced oil
        recovery activities and for major investments to continue
        conventional oil development.

   First Quarter 2008 vs. First Quarter 2007

   Upstream earnings were $8,785 million, up $2,744 million from the
first quarter of 2007. Record high crude oil and natural gas
realizations increased earnings approximately $4.4 billion. Volume and
mix effects decreased earnings about $800 million, as increased
natural gas volumes were more than offset by lower crude oil volumes.
Higher taxes, increased operating costs and lower gains on asset sales
decreased earnings approximately $900 million.

   On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 5.6% from the
first quarter of 2007. Excluding the Venezuela expropriation,
divestments, OPEC quota effects and price and spend impacts on
volumes, production was down 3%.

   Liquids production totaled 2,474 kbd (thousands of barrels per
day), down 272 kbd from the first quarter of 2007. Excluding the
Venezuela expropriation, divestments, OPEC quota effects and price and
spend impacts on volumes, liquids production was down 6%. Increased
production from projects in west Africa and the North Sea was more
than offset by mature field decline, PSC net interest reductions and
maintenance activities.

   First quarter natural gas production was 10,246 mcfd (millions of
cubic feet per day), up 132 mcfd from 2007. Higher European demand and
North Sea project additions were partly offset by mature field
decline.

   Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $1,631 million,
$454 million higher than the first quarter of 2007. Non-U.S. Upstream
earnings were $7,154 million, up $2,290 million from 2007.

   Downstream earnings of $1,166 million were $746 million lower than
the first quarter of 2007. Significantly lower worldwide refining
margins decreased earnings approximately $1.0 billion, while improved
refinery operations increased earnings about $350 million. Petroleum
product sales of 6,821 kbd were 377 kbd lower than last year's first
quarter, mainly reflecting asset sales.

   U.S. Downstream earnings were $398 million, down $441 million from
the first quarter of 2007. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of
$768 million were $305 million lower.

   Chemical earnings of $1,028 million were $208 million lower than
the first quarter of 2007. Lower margins, which decreased earnings
approximately $350 million, were partly offset by favorable foreign
exchange and tax effects. Prime product sales of 6,578 kt (thousands
of metric tons) in the first quarter of 2008 were 227 kt lower than
the prior year.

   Corporate and financing expenses were $89 million, up
$180 million, mainly due to higher corporate costs and tax items.

   During the first quarter of 2008, Exxon Mobil Corporation
purchased 110 million shares of its common stock for the treasury at a
gross cost of $9.5 billion. These purchases included $8.0 billion to
reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the balance used to
offset shares issued in conjunction with the company's benefit plans
and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced from 5,382 million at
the end of the fourth quarter to 5,284 million at the end of the first
quarter. Purchases may be made in both the open market and through
negotiated transactions, and may be increased, decreased or
discontinued at any time without prior notice.

   ExxonMobil will discuss financial and operating results and other
matters on a webcast at 10 a.m. Central time on May 1, 2008. To listen
to the event live or in archive, go to our website at exxonmobil.com.

   Statements in this release relating to future plans, projections,
events or conditions are forward-looking statements. Actual results,
including project plans, capacities, and timing and resource
recoveries, could differ materially due to changes in long-term oil or
gas prices or other market conditions affecting the oil and gas
industry; political events or disturbances; reservoir performance; the
outcome of commercial negotiations; wars and acts of terrorism or
sabotage; changes in technical or operating conditions; and other
factors discussed under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results"
on our website and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2007 Form 10-K. We
assume no duty to update these statements as of any future date.
References to quantities of oil expected to be developed may include
amounts not yet classified as proved reserves but that we believe will
ultimately be produced.

   Consistent with previous practice, this press release includes
both earnings excluding special items and earnings per share excluding
special items. Both are non-GAAP financial measures and are included
to help facilitate comparisons of base business performance across
periods. A reconciliation to net income is shown in Attachment II. The
release also includes cash flow from operations and asset sales.
Because of the regular nature of our asset management and divestment
program, we believe it is useful for investors to consider sales
proceeds together with cash provided by operating activities when
evaluating cash available for investment in the business and financing
activities. A reconciliation to net cash provided by operating
activities is shown in Attachment II. Further information on
ExxonMobil's frequently used financial and operating measures and
other terms is contained under the heading "Frequently Used Terms"
available through the Investor Information section of our website at
exxonmobil.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc Spinout of Esperion Therapeutics - Founding Team to Focus on HDL
Therapies As a Private Entity

Esperion Therapeutics, Inc. a biopharmaceutical company formed to focus on the
discovery and development of compounds to treat cardiovascular and metabolic
disease, today announced that it has been launched as a privately held,
independent enterprise.

Pfizer Inc, under which Esperion previously operated as a separate research
division, has sold Esperion Therapeutics, holding selected programs and related
assets, to an entity funded by a syndicate of investors. Pfizer retains a
financial interest in the enterprise. Additional financial details of the
transaction were not disclosed.

Co-led by Aisling Capital, Alta Partners and Domain Associates, the tranched
financing for Esperion also included participation by Arboretum Ventures. This
support will allow further development of the Company's lead program for the
treatment of dyslipidemias, as well as other potentially high density
lipoprotein (HDL)-related therapeutics.

Esperion Therapeutics will be led by Dr. Roger Newton, the original co-founder,
CEO and President of the Company. Esperion will continue to leverage the
scientific expertise and resources that reside in its Ann Arbor, Mich.,
headquarters. As part of the spinout from Pfizer, Esperion will retain a small
molecule dual inhibitor of fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis, for the
treatment of dyslipidemias.

"We are extremely pleased to be working with such a strong group of investors as
Esperion Therapeutics continues our important work in treating cardiovascular
and metabolic disease," stated CEO Dr. Roger Newton. "Re-establishing Esperion
as a privately held entity ensures that the programs we have obtained will
continue to advance as potentially important therapeutics. Without Pfizer's
support, we would not have this opportunity to focus on these potential
opportunities."

"Pfizer's contribution to the formation of the new Esperion shows the Company is
embracing new strategies to refocus its R and create value from exited
compounds," said Martin Mackay, president of Pfizer Global Research &amp;
Development. "This transaction also enables Esperion to pursue its interests as
a Michigan-based life science company while allowing Pfizer to support a new
research venture and be involved in Esperion's potential success."

Esperion's Dr. Newton has 27 years experience in the pharmaceutical and life
sciences industries. Most recently, he was the Senior Vice President of Pfizer
Global Research and Development and Director of Esperion Therapeutics, a Pfizer

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) has converted a third of its preferred shares in
Sumitomo Mitsui Financial Group (8316.T), Japan's third-largest
lender, to about $1.3 billion worth of common stock, SMFG said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman converted some of its high-dividend preferred
shares in the bank to 157,151 common shares, Sumitomo Mitsui
said in a statement on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The common stock, which represents about 2 percent of the
bank's outstanding shares, was worth 136.9 billion yen ($1.3
billion), based on Thursday's closing price of 871,000 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A sale in the open market would mean a potential windfall
of 86.9 billion yen for Goldman, based on the acquisition price
of 318,000 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However Goldman has agreed to use the stock to close out a
hedge position, and will not sell the shares in the market,
SMFG said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman injected 150 billion yen into Sumitomo Mitsui in
early 2003, when the lender was struggling to escape from the
worst of Japan's banking crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank acquired a total of 50,100 shares
paying a guaranteed dividend of 4.5 percent, which prompted
some Japanese media outlets to accuse the U.S. firm of gouging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's remaining 33,400 preferred shares in Sumitomo
Mitsui will automatically convert to common stock in 2027.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by David Dolan; Editing by Hugh Lawson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 1 (Reuters) - Chevron said on Thursday its
210,000 barrel per day refinery in Pembroke, UK had been
completely shut but it was in the process of restarting after a
boiler problem late Tuesday caused the plant to lose steam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A company spokeswoman said they were working to restart the
boiler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect it to take 48 hours to get it up and running,"
she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cause of the outage is still under investigation, and
would be continued once restart was complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said that Chevron bought a cargo of gasoline earlier
Thursday at market prices.    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It doesn't appear that Chevron has any production covering
its shorts at reasonable prices," said one cargo trader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reporting by Janet McGurty, (email:janet.mcgurty@reuters.com)

&lt;p&gt;BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) today announced that it has
acquired the Disney Store chain in North America from subsidiaries of
The Children's Place Retail Stores, Inc. As a result of the
transaction, which consisted of an asset purchase by Disney's
subsidiaries through the bankruptcy and insolvency proceedings of Hoop
Retail Stores, LLC in Delaware and Hoop Canada, Inc. in Canada, Disney
acquired approximately 220 Disney Stores in the United States and
Disney Stores in Canada, with actual number of acquired stores
dependent upon the outcome of negotiations with landlords. Disney also
obtained the right to conduct an orderly wind-down and closure of
approximately 98 Disney Stores in the United States and two Disney
Stores in Canada, but without assuming the leases for such stores.

   "From Cars to High School Musical to Disney Fairies, Disney's
entertainment engines are producing multiple popular franchises," said
Andy Mooney, chairman of Disney Consumer Products. "The Disney Stores
can play a vital role in touching the millions who cross their
thresholds. With the reach of a global retail chain, we will be better
able to take advantage of our franchises."

   Mr. Mooney announced that retail and Disney veteran James D.
Fielding has accepted the position of President, Disney Stores
Worldwide. Mr. Fielding will oversee merchandising and all other
operations of the Disney Stores in North America and the 107 existing
Disney Stores in Europe, as well as manage the relationship with
Oriental Land Company, which operates the Disney Stores in Japan under
a license arrangement. (Mr. Fielding's biography can be found at
www.disneyconsumerproducts.com.)

&lt;p&gt;Research and Markets: Microsoft's Digital Advertising Strategy Predicts Its Ambitious Plans for Digital Advertising Will Generate a Quarter of Its Revenues Going Forward

DUBLIN, Ireland--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/reports/c90554) has announced the
addition of "Microsoft's Digital Advertising Strategy: A Case Study"
to their offering.

   Microsoft has ambitious plans for digital advertising, which it
expects to generate a quarter of its revenues going forward. The
vision for achieving this is an integrated offering spanning a range
of inventory across multiple platforms: online, mobile, games and
IPTV. Microsoft has moving quickly to improve its reach and expertise
in digital advertising, mostly through acquisitions, and the standout
here is the $6 billion purchase of aQuantive.

   Microsoft clearly wants to be a serious player and in this case
study we access its potential and give our verdict. We will be
concentrating on Microsoft's efforts around digital advertising aimed
at individual consumers, as opposed to SMEs or the corporate sector.
This means that we will not be examining the role of Office Live in
Microsoft's digital advertising play.

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Highlights: Coca-Cola FEMSA, Liberty Property Trust, Marsh &amp; McLennan, Energizer Holdings and Smith &amp; Nephew

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Coca-Cola FEMSA (NYSE: KOF) as
the Bull of the Day and Liberty Property Trust (NYSE: LRY) as the Bear
of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on
Marsh &amp; McLennan (NYSE: MMC)), Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ENR)
and Smith &amp; Nephew (NYSE: SNN). Full analysis of all these stocks is
available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676.

   Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:

   Bull of the Day: Coca-Cola FEMSA (NYSE: KOF)

   We are keeping our Buy recommendation on Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A. de
C.V. The company posted better-than-expected results for the second,
third and fourth quarters of 2007. The results in South America were
particularly impressive and Mexican results showed a considerable
improvement after some difficult quarters. Additionally, the
short-term outlook for Latin American economic growth remains
positive, despite the difficult economic environment in the U.S. and
its effects on Mexico.

   The company also benefited from the strength of most Latin
American currencies, a trend that should prevail in the following
quarters. Finally, KOF has been reducing net debt, a necessary step to
reduce financial costs and increase confidence.

   Bear of the Day: Liberty Property Trust (NYSE: LRY)

   LRY reported 1Q08 FFO of $0.80 per share, $0.01 above our
estimates and consensus. Operations including are holding up
relatively well in the company's core portfolio although overall
vacancies are increasing. The company has an attractive yield, now
over 7%, although the dividend is barely being covered with operating
cash. We expect rental rates to remain flat through 2008, as the
company has assets in office markets that have high vacancies.

   Office and industrial markets are weakening throughout the US due
to a faltering economy. Liberty has a large development pipeline that
is only mildly pre-leased, and poses risk should the economy continue
to soften in 2008.

   Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog:

   Marsh &amp; McLennan (NYSE: MMC)

   Marsh &amp; McLennan plans to release its 1Q08 earnings results on May
7, 2008 with a conference call scheduled for the same morning. 4Q07
operating earnings from continuing operations came in at $0.26 per
share, compared to $0.39 per share in the prior-year quarter. While
the consulting business continues to exhibit strong performance, the
overall results have been affected in the recent quarters by the
ongoing poor performance in the insurance broking business.

   While we are optimistic about initiatives being taken by the new
Management team, we do not anticipate any significant improvement
anytime soon, due to the current pricing environment. Ahead of 1Q08
earnings release, we are slightly moderating our estimates for FY08
and FY09 and setting our six-month target at $30.00 per share. We are
maintaining our Hold rating on the shares of MMC at current valuation.

   Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ENR)

   Energizer Holdings is experiencing top-line growth both through
organic growth in the razor blade and battery businesses, and through
the acquisition of Playtex. In order to complete the Playtex
acquisition and refinance existing Playtex debt, Energizer's debt
level significantly increased, which could impair the company's
financial condition. At the end of calendar 2007, long-term debt stood
at $2.69 billion versus $1.37 billion in the year-ago period.

   The balance sheet is highly leveraged with debt being 77% of total
capitalization. With the Playtex acquisition, debt rose above the
critical 3.5 times cash flow level, which required (by debt covenant)
a 75 basis point interest rate penalty. Energizer does not pay a
dividend. Therefore, the share repurchase program has been curtailed
as management concentrates in lowering the debt level. Guidance for
integration savings, originally estimated to be $57 million, has been
raised to $70 million.

   Smith &amp; Nephew (NYSE: SNN)

   We are maintaining a Hold recommendation on Smith &amp; Nephew, PLC
prior to the first quarter results due on May 1. The company is
benefiting from its Earnings Improvement Program (EIP) and the recent
stock buy-back should provide support to the stock. SNN reported Q4
and full year results.

   For the full year, revenue of $3.4 billion, up 10% on a comparable
basis with trading profit at $706 million up 17%. As a result of the
company's Earnings Improvement Program, there was over 1% operating
margin improvement.

   SNN's Orthopaedic Reconstruction revenue growth of 13% leads the
market for the 5th consecutive year with Orthopaedic Trauma and
Clinical Therapies revenues up 13% as the company's EXOGEN Ultrasound
Bone Healing System outpaces the market. In Endoscopy, due to
investments made outside the US, revenues were up 10%. In Advanced
Wound Management, trading margin was up 120 basis points as a result
of the restructuring of this division. The EPS increased 15% to 52c
($2.60/ADS) which is exactly in line with our forecast.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT May 1 (Reuters) - Futures on benchmark U.S. stock
market indexes edged up before the start of Wall Street trading
on Thursday, with economic data and corporate earnings back in
the spotlight after the recent single-minded focus on the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Federal Reserve lowered U.S. interest rates by a quarter
percentage point on Wednesday, as expected, and hinted that the
move could be the last. U.S. stocks fell on profit-taking after
the SP 500 index's .SPX best month since December 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today we'll have continued interpretation of what the Fed
said last night," said Richard Wilson, U.S. equities fund
manager at Threadneedle in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is still going to be waiting for the most
important data of the week, the non-farm payrolls on Friday," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 0945 GMT, Dow Jones futures DJc1 were up 0.3 percent,
SP 500 futures SPc1 rose 0.2 percent and Nasdaq futures
NDc1 also traded 0.2 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than 30 SP 500 companies, notably oil major Exxon
Mobil (XOM.N), server-computer maker Sun Microsystems JAVA.O
and diversified manufacturer Tyco International (TYC.N), are
scheduled to report quarterly earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil is expected to post an almost 30 percent
increase in earnings per share to $2.10, according to Reuters
Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIZE MATTERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon is the most important because it's so big," Wilson
said, adding that he would pay particular attention to what the
group says about continued capital expenditure trends, "because
that's so important for the oil services companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The economic data calendar highlight is the ISM
manufacturing index for April at 1400 GMT. Economists polled by
Reuters expect a reading of 48.0, down from 48.6 in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The ISM manufacturing index has long been one of the major
U.S. market moving data releases and with fears about the
duration and depth of the much anticipated recession, it will
certainly be very closely followed today," Dutch bank ING said
in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With U.S. recession fears mounting, markets will be closely
following ... to see if the 'recession level' of 46.0 will be
hit," ING said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilson said another weak ISM number would underline that
U.S. industrial companies "still need to see significant
negative earnings revisions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Challenger job cuts report for April will be released at
1130 GMT, March personal income and spending data as well as
weekly jobless claims at 1230 GMT, and March construction
spending at 1400 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed
0.1 percent lower, the SP 500 fell 0.4 percent and the Nasdaq
.IXIC was down 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the month of April, the Dow rose 4.5 percent, the SP
gained 4.8 percent and the Nasdaq advanced 5.9 percent.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc are making last-minute efforts to seal a deal before Microsoft takes its Yahoo bid hostile or abandons it altogether, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft may raise its offer, now worth $42.2 billion, by a few dollars per share from an initial $31 per share to complete a deal as soon as this weekend, a person familiar with Microsoft's thinking said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But talks are at a "sensitive stage" and a deal is not certain, sources familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors bet an agreement was likely, sending Yahoo shares up 7 percent to $28.67 on the first news of significant contact between the sides since Microsoft's deadline for its initial offer expired last Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My sense is Microsoft is considering raising their price to the mid-$30s," said a San Francisco-based portfolio manager who owns both Yahoo and Microsoft shares, but would not be identified due to a company policy regarding shares that are actively traded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo had previously refused to enter formal negotiations with Microsoft, saying the initial price it made public in February did not properly value Yahoo's search and display advertising technology, or its overseas holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every dollar added to the per-share price amounts to about $1.4 billion extra for the total deal at current prices, and Microsoft shareholders have questioned how much higher the company should go.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it's $35 or less, I think it's fine," said the portfolio manager, whose company owned 21.2 million shares of Microsoft and 1.93 million Yahoo shares as of the end of December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO QUICK EMBRACE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal could give Microsoft a stronger foothold in its battle with Internet search leader Google Inc, which is rapidly expanding into the software maker's own turf with new Web-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer indicated on Thursday he might sweeten the bid after weeks of saying publicly that his offer was fair as it stood.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I know exactly what I think Yahoo is worth to me, exactly," Ballmer said at a meeting with Microsoft employees. "I won't go a dime above, and I will go to what I think it's worth if that gets the deal done."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo executives have repeatedly said the company was not averse to a deal with Microsoft at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a sign of its reluctance, Yahoo has courted a possible deal with Time Warner Inc's AOL division and a search advertising partnership with Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is still in talks on an alternative to the Microsoft bid, sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Microsoft has made clear it will not wait much longer. Ballmer said on Thursday that walking away was one of three options, along with striking a friendly deal or launching a hostile bid, and to expect an announcement shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 0.5 percent to close at $29.24. Yahoo shares closed at $28.67, up nearly 7 percent on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Anupreeta Das in San Francisco, Muralikumar Anantharaman in Boston, Kenneth Li in New York; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with company statement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said a
malfunction on Friday at its 150,000-barrel-per-day refinery in
Torrance, California, was minor and not expected to affect
production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A compressor in a refinery vapor recovery system
malfunctioned late on Friday afternoon, triggering flaring at
the Los Angeles-area refinery, said spokeswoman Barbara
Burgett.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No impact to site operations is anticipated," Burgett
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Refinery vapor recovery systems reclaim substances that can
be returned for refining or used as fuel for the plant's
utilities. Before the introduction of vapor recovery systems to
reduce pollution, the substances were released into the

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A man apparently jumped to his death on Friday from the 14th floor of the Disneyland Hotel at the world-famous amusement park in Southern California, police said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The man, who was in town on business and not immediately identified by authorities, was killed in the 14-story fall from his hotel room balcony. He was pronounced dead at the scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now it is certainly looking like a suicide," Anaheim Police Sgt. Rick Martinez told Reuters. "He was seen leaping off the balcony."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martinez said the man, who was in Anaheim on business and appears to be in his 30s or 40s, also left evidence in the room that suggested it was a suicide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He was sharing a room with another male associate and for some reason he went out on the balcony and all indications are that it was an intentional act, a suicide," Martinez said.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced breakthrough scalability and performance
running the
SAP NetWeaver(R) Business Intelligence Accelerator (SAP NetWeaver BI
Accelerator)
component of the SAP NetWeaver platform on IBM BladeCenter servers.

    Extensive testing utilizing generally available products from both companies
reveals clients running the SAP NetWeaver Business Intelligence (SAP NetWeaver
BI)
component can now scale up to 140 IBM BladeCenter servers as needed to improve
system
response time and more easily manage the exponential growth of information
flowing across the enterprise.

    "This performance delivers an unprecedented 5x scalability improvement
overprevious IBM BladeCenter server configurations running SAP solutions based
on
real-world client environments," said David Gelardi, vice president, Worldwide
Advanced Client Technology Centers, IBM Systems &amp; Technology Group.  "As a
result,
our clients can now have increased flexibility and scalability to drive more
value from their information assets and be more responsive to customer needs."

    Details:

    The test included four key performance indicators: 1) index load time, 2)
average report and query throughput, 3) average number of records touched per
report, and 4) average response time less than five seconds.

    The test also included scalability measurements at 5, 15 and 25 terabytes
(TB) of
InfoCube data.

    Test components included the following:

--  An SAP NetWeaver BI-based datawarehouse with 25TB of data in
    InfoCubes, equivalent to over 50 TB of data including customer-created SAP
    aggregates, imported data from other sources and customer data models
--  SAP NetWeaver BI 7.0 and SAP NetWeaver BI Accelerator
--  IBM BladeCenter servers
--  IBM BI Accelerator servers with Novell SuSe Linux running IBM General
    Parallel File System (GPFS)
--  IBM System p application and System z database servers with IBM DB2
--  IBM high-end Storage connected to all servers
    

    
Results demonstrate linear scalability at the SAP NetWeaver BI
AcceleratorIndex load of 1.2TB/hour with the number of processed business
intelligencereports/queries topping 101.000 at over 160.000 queries per hour.
The
processed reports peaked up to 37 million records delivering an average response
time of just over four seconds.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc have intensified talks in a last-minute effort to reach a friendly agreement on a buyout of Yahoo, a source familiar with the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares rose 7 percent on news of the accelerated talks. Investors had feared Microsoft might walk away from its unsolicited bid, now worth $42.2 billion, or launch a hostile takeover battle. The software maker had set a deadline for Yahoo that passed last Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft has since increased its offer by several dollars per share, the New York Times's DealBook blog reported, citing a person involved in the discussions. Microsoft declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo had previously refused to enter formal negotiations with Microsoft, saying the initial $31-a-share price it made public in February did not properly value Yahoo's search and display advertising technology, or its overseas holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo executives have repeatedly said the company was not averse to a deal with Microsoft at a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a sign of its reluctance, Yahoo has courted a possible deal with Time Warner Inc's AOL division and a search advertising partnership with arch-rival Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the talks between Yahoo and Google told Reuters on Thursday that an ad deal between the two could come as early as next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Microsoft has made clear it will not wait much longer for some kind of resolution. Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told employees on Thursday that walking away from a deal with Yahoo was one of three options the company was weighing, and to expect an announcement shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News of the heightened talks on Friday was first reported on the Wall Street Journal's website. The report said no deal was imminent and that an agreement was not likely on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo officials could not immediately be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 1.3 percent to $29.02.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Brian Moss and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON May 2 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase and Co's (JPM.N)
Boston-based mutual fund servicing group, offering accounting
and financial reporting to thousands of portfolios, expects to
add hundreds of employees as clients add billions of dollars in
new assets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The group, with roughly $4.7 trillion in assets under
administration worldwide, expects to see a 40 percent jump this
year in the roughly $1 trillion in assets it administers out of
Boston alone, said Daniel Kramer, managing director of the Fund
Services Operations in Boston, said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His unit, located near big competitors like State Street
Corp (STT.N) and Bank of New York Mellon (BK.N), is part of
JPMorgan's Worldwide Securities Services, which has $15.7
trillion in assets under custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit counts mutual fund companies MFS Investment
Management and American Century Investments as clients, for
whom it handles unglamorous-but-lucrative back office work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As assets are expected to grow, Kramer said it plans to
hire roughly 400 people in Boston in the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kramer said the company would hire outsiders as well as
possibly bringing people on board from Bear Stearns, the
collapsed investment bank bought this year by JPMorgan Chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boston's many universities and the concentration of other
companies specializing in fund servicing nearby offer a large
pool to choose from.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Friday its first-quarter earnings rose 10 percent as record oil prices outweighed weak profits from gasoline production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil prices have soared more than five-fold since 2002 on surging demand from emerging economies, supply concerns and the weak dollar. They broke $100 a barrel for the first time during the first quarter and hit a record of nearly $120 earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's largest peers, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and BP Plc (BP.L), all posted sizable gains in the quarter, although Exxon's results disappointed on weak oil and natural gas production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's net income in the quarter rose to $5.17 billion, or $2.48 a share, from $4.72 billion, or $2.18 a share, a year before. Analysts, on average, had expected the company to earn $2.41, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's results included a one-time $700 million gain from the sale of refining assets in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales and other revenue in the quarter rose 40 percent to $64.67 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Benchmark U.S. oil prices averaged a record of nearly $98 a barrel during the quarter, up nearly 70 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But margins to produce gasoline have plummeted, with refiners struggling to push through higher crude costs to customers.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds year-earlier gain, average realized price; updates share
price)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Erman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 2 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the
second-largest U.S. oil company, said on Friday its
first-quarter earnings rose 10 percent as record oil prices
outweighed weak profits from gasoline production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices have soared more than five-fold since 2002 on
surging demand from emerging economies, supply concerns and the
weak dollar. They broke $100 a barrel for the first time during
the first quarter and hit a record of nearly $120 earlier this
week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's largest peers, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), Royal
Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and BP Plc (BP.L), all posted sizable
gains in the quarter, although Exxon's results disappointed on
weak oil and natural gas production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's net income in the quarter rose to $5.17 billion,
or $2.48 a share, from $4.72 billion, or $2.18 a share, a year
before. Analysts, on average, had expected the company to earn
$2.41, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year's results included a one-time $700 million gain
from the sale of refining assets in the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales and other revenue in the quarter rose 40 percent to
$64.67 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Benchmark U.S. oil prices averaged a record of nearly $98 a
barrel during the quarter, up nearly 70 percent from a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But margins to produce gasoline have plummeted, with
refiners struggling to push through higher crude costs to
customers. First-quarter gasoline prices rose only 33 percent
year over year in the U.S. -- less than half crude's rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Profits from the company's exploration and production unit
rose 76 percent to $5.13 billion, while earnings from refining
and marketing plunged 84 percent to $252 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's production dipped 1.7 percent to 2.6 million
barrels of oil equivalent per day, mostly due to declines of
older fields in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Argus Research analyst Phil Weiss said the company's dip in
production worried him less than Exxon's output drop announced
yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon's even bigger than Chevron, so it takes more to move
the needle," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the average price it received for oil or other
liquid hydrocarbons was $86.25, up 70 percent from a year
before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The San Ramon, Calif., company's capital spending was $5.1
billion in the quarter, 84 percent of which was for exploration
and production projects. Chevron spent $2 billion to buy back
shares during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soaring gasoline prices and record earnings have been
sharpening scrutiny on big oil companies from politicians,
driving some Democratic lawmakers to call for a windfall tax on
the oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Oil companies are racking up obscene profits left and

statement after Exxon released its earnings on Thursday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's high time for Big Oil to pay its fair share."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares were up 47 cents at $95.41 in afternoon
trading on the New York Stock Exchange. They are up over 2
percent this year, slightly outperforming the Chicago Board

&lt;p&gt;  BETHESDA, MD, May 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT) today announced that IBM (NYSE: IBM) will join its
industry team to develop and maintain the Next Generation Identification (NGI)
system for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) -- the new multi-modal,
state-of-the-art biometrics system to be used by state, local and federal
authorities.

    As the prime contractor on the FBI's NGI program, Lockheed Martin will
provide
program management and oversight as well as biometric and large systems
development and integration expertise.  Joining the NGI team as a
subcontractor, IBM will provide some information technology services, as
well as specific software and hardware to be used in the NGI system.

    "Our entire industry team, with the new addition of IBM, is very pleased
tostart working on the NGI program," said Judy Marks, President, Lockheed Martin
Transportation and Security Solutions. "This represents a win for the FBI,
the justice community, and most importantly, the public who will benefit from
the security of an advanced biometric identification system."

    "IBM and Lockheed Martin have a strong history collaborating in the
Federalcommunity and we are pleased to join their NGI team," said Dave Amoriell,
General
Manager, IBM Global Services, Federal.  "This industry team can provide the
right blend of technology and services needed to support the FBI's critical
mission of using intelligence to prevent national threats and improving public
safety."

    The NGI system will expand fingerprint processing capacity and will now also
include palm prints, iris and facial recognition capabilities. Additionally, the
system
requires a significant degree of technical flexibility in order to accommodate
other biometric modalities that may mature and become important to law
enforcement efforts in the future.

    Continuing on the Lockheed Martin team are Accenture, BAE Systems
Information
Technology Inc., Global Science &amp; Technology (GST), Innovative Management &amp;
Technology Services (IMTS), Platinum Solutions and the National Center for
State Courts (NCSC).

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new social software designed to liberate
business content from Microsoft SharePoint. This new software expands the IBM
Lotus
Quickr line to help businesses of all sizes manage, share and collaborate on
important information.

    While Microsoft preaches interoperability, IBM is delivering alternatives to
SharePoint that work with a variety of file types and IT infrastructures.
IBM Lotus Quickr Content Integrator is a new tool to help businesses access,
share and collaborate with their most valuable asset -- information. Based
on technology from CASAHL Technology, Lotus Quickr Content Integrator helps
organizations migrate critical data from existing repositories into team places
designed for collaboration and sharing. Through wizards and templates the
software
makes it easy to move content from Microsoft SharePoint sites, Microsoft
Exchange
folders, IBM Lotus Domino Document Manager libraries and IBM Lotus Domino
teamroomapplications into Lotus Quickr places.

    Now organizations with a variety of IT applications can standardize on Lotus
Quickr for team collaboration and social networking needs without the hassle
of complex data migration. Competitive software products require businesses to
tackle time consuming and often costly data migrations just to access data
from different sources. Lotus Quickr Content Integrator puts businesses in
control of their content, enabling employees to consolidate important
information
regardless of what tool was used to create the document.

    "Making sure that critical content is easily accessible to employees is
key," said Harry Wong, president and chief executive officer of CASAHL. "Lotus
Quickr Content Integrator combined with Lotus Quickr's easy to use Web 2.0
interface and rich functionality, is a powerful combination, one that our
customers are rapidly adopting."

    "Content is king, and Lotus Quickr helps businesses share and use their
data,
regardless of where it was created," said Jeff Schick, vice president of social
networking, IBM Lotus Software. "With the new features in Lotus Quickr and
Lotus Quickr Content Integrator we have made it easy for companies to migrate
their content from IBM software or competitive products into Lotus Quickr and
get
working right away."

    Also now available is the latest version of Lotus Quickr. Lotus Quickr is
Web 2.0-based software that makes it easier for people to find, access, share
and
work with everyday business content such as documents, photos and videos.
Lotus Quickr includes content libraries, wikis, blogs and connectors -- or
plugins -- for popular desktop applications like Microsoft Office and IBM Lotus
Notes. New features include:


--  New connectors for Microsoft Outlook and Lotus Symphony: Now users
    will be able to access content in team workspaces and content libraries
    directly from Microsoft Outlook and Lotus Symphony. Lotus Quickr connectors
    increase productivity and help people work faster by bringing Lotus
    Quickr's powerful team collaboration capabilities into all major everyday
    desktop applications.

--  New administrative dashboard: A new Web 2.0-based dashboard makes it
    easier to manage enterprise wide deployments of Lotus Quickr. New
    statistical reporting gives administrators insight into the activity in
    their Lotus Quickr environment. Now, administrators have a single view of
    all Lotus Quickr places and can sort and search places by type and owner
    and set policies based on the size or activity level of places.

--  Lotus Quickr Entry: Now available, Lotus Quick Entry provides a pre-
    designed personal file sharing space that eliminates the need to share
    content via email attachments by providing individuals with links to shared
    content. The personal file sharing capabilities of Lotus Quickr Entry are
    included in the latest version of Lotus Quickr and as a stand alone
    offering.

--  Enhanced usability features: New features such as simplified
    navigation, automatic versioning of documents to help track updates and
    feeds that instantly populate the "what's new" section of team places have
    been added to simplify an individual's experience.
    

    
Lotus Quickr Content Integrator and Lotus Quickr 8.1 are now
available.Lotus Quickr Entry is now available to Lotus Notes and IBM Lotus
Domino
WebAccess customers on active maintenance at no additional charge.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has 
shown it is not totally immune to the credit crunch as it makes 
deeper cuts in its business of arranging loans for leveraged 
buyouts, people familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Sources say there is a significant restructuring under way 
in Goldman's leveraged finance business, reflecting the lack of 
big LBOs since credit markets seized up last summer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These job cuts go beyond the 5 percent cuts Goldman 
acknowledged last month and the 1,500 across-the-board cuts 
stemming from year-end performance reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to comment specifically on its leveraged 
finance business, but affirmed the firm's total headcount will 
dip temporarily to reflect the current slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given market conditions, we've been looking at a number of 
areas where we believe we have too many people. We've 
transferred some people to other areas and other regions, while 
others have been asked to leave the firm," spokesman Michael 
DuVally said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, Goldman maintains it will still end 2008 with 
its total employment rising by "low single digits." Goldman had 
32,000 employees at the end of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, the largest investment bank by market value, is by 
far the most active Wall Street firm in the realms of making 
private equity investments and financing deals struck by big 
buyout shops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And while it avoided the crippling losses on subprime 
mortgages, it has recorded some of the largest write-downs on 
leveraged loan commitments -- $1.4 billion in the first quarter 
and $1.7 billion in the third as the breakdown in debt markets 
created a logjam of incompleted deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. leveraged loan issuance fell 74 percent in the first 
quarter versus last year to $54.1 billion, while loans backing 
LBOs plunged 88 percent to $5.4 billion, according to Reuters 
Loan Pricing Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman executives have denied they are under any pressure 
to cut back, citing their impressive record 2007 results and 
the absence of big write-downs that hammered its rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet like the rest of Wall Street, Goldman faces markets 
expected to remain difficult for the next year or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bankers remain busy working through the pipeline of 
leveraged loan commitments extended a year ago, and there are 
still new deals getting done. Goldman, notably, is helping 
arrange funding for Mars Inc's $23 billion takeover of Wm 
Wrigley Jr  Co WWY.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan and Faris Khan,

 *IMPORTANT NOTES

1.  Calculation of Net Asset Value

This estimated valuation of the Company's net asset value, which has been
prepared in good faith by the Company's administrator, is for information only.
Save as set forth below, it is determined based upon the latest available
valuations (or estimated valuations) provided, directly or indirectly, by the
investment managers ("Advisors") selected by the Company's investment manager
(the "Investment Manager").

2.  Calculation of Performance Data

Set out above are the estimated week to date ("WTD"), estimated month to date
("MTD") and estimated calendar year to date ("YTD") performance figures. The WTD
performance figure is calculated by reference to the previously published
estimated NAV. The MTD performance figure is calculated by reference to the
previous month's estimated NAV as published or, if published, the previous
month's final NAV. The YTD performance figure is calculated by reference to the
NAV at the end of the last calendar year.

3.  ERISA

The articles of association of the Company prohibit any purchase or acquisition
of shares by or on behalf of or for the benefit of an ERISA plan or benefit plan
investor subject to similar laws (a "Plan Investor"), and incorporate provisions
whereby purported purchases of shares by or on behalf of or for the benefit of
an ERISA plan or Plan Investor will not operate to confer any interest or rights
whatsoever in such shares in favour of an ERISA plan or Plan Investor, but
instead will take effect as a trust for redemption in favour of the Company and
the Company will subsequently purchase or redeem such shares, which purchase or
redemption may take place at an amount per share which is less than the price
paid by an ERISA plan or Plan Investor on the purported acquisition.

4.  For the Attention of United States Residents

The shares may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, US Persons (as defined in the Regulation S under the
Securities Act of 1933 or any person who would be considered a US person under
Rule 4.7 of the United States Commodity Exchange Act).

5.   Investment Policy

In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Company will (directly or
indirectly) allocate its assets to a relatively concentrated portfolio of
Advisors (or entities managed by them) selected by the Investment Manager. It is
expected that such Advisors will employ a broad range of alternative investment
strategies, which will include both core strategies (i.e., event driven,
tactical trading, equity long/short and relative value strategies) as well as
other niche strategies. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve
its investment objective or that it will be able to implement its investment
policy, or that the portfolio design, risk monitoring and hedging strategies of
the Company will be successful.

6.  Notes on Estimated Valuation

Certain securities or other assets in which the Advisors invest may not have a
readily ascertainable market price or may otherwise be difficult to value and
will be priced by the Advisors.

The Company may not have received valuations (or estimated valuations) from
Advisors on a timely or current basis, and may not have received valuations at
all. In order to arrive at the net asset value, the Company will generally use
the latest available valuations (or estimated valuations) provided, directly or
indirectly, by the Advisors.  Valuations (or estimated valuations) received by
the Company may be unaudited or may be subject to little verification or other
due diligence and may not comply with generally accepted accounting practices or
other valuation principles.

In addition, neither the Company's administrator nor the Investment Manager will
generally have sufficient information to be able to independently confirm or
review the completeness, genuineness or accuracy of the Advisors' valuations (or
estimated valuations).  In certain circumstances as set out in the Company's
prospectus, including if the Investment Manager determines, in its sole
discretion, that a valuation is inaccurate or incomplete, the Investment Manager
may, in its sole discretion, determine the fair value of the Company's interests
independently of the Advisor's valuations based on information available to, and
factors deemed relevant (at its sole discretion) by, the Investment Manager at
the time of such valuation.

Other risk factors which may be relevant to this estimated valuation are set out
in the Company's prospectus dated 7 July 2006.

As a result of these factors, the actual value of the Company's assets may be
materially different from this published estimated value.  In the event that an
estimated valuation subsequently proves to be incorrect, no adjustment to a
previously published estimated valuation is expected to be made nor would
compensation be payable.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) executives will dominate the ranks of investment banking in North and South America following its takeover of Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more half of nearly 14,000 Bear Stearns employees facing layoffs, JPMorgan is slowly setting up the leadership team for the combined investment banks. In the latest moves, announced internally on Thursday, just two out of 14 executives currently work for Bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is expected to complete its fire-sale takeover of Bear Stearns, which nearly collapsed in March, by June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fortunate two are Jeff Urwin, named head of investment banking coverage for the Americas in an earlier announcement, and Ben Berinstein, who along with Morgan's Chris Harvey will lead a business advising companies on capital structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have added world-class talent to our team, expanded our client roster and added new and important capabilities to our platform that will enable us to be even more relevant to clients," said Doug Braunstein, the bank's head of Americas investment banking and origination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among those who reporting to Braunstein will be Jimmy Elliott, to be global head of MA, and Nicolas "Gucho" Aguzin, head of investment banking in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said Kevin Willsey will be head of equity underwriting for the Americas and jointly lead the global business with Viswas Raghavan. Therese Esperdy will be global head of debt underwriting as well as co-head of business in Europe, the Middle East in Africa with Raghavan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jeff Woods will be chief operating officer for Americas investment banking, while Kelly Coffey will serve as corporate derivatives marketing head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One Morgan executive displaced by the merger is Chris Linneman, who along with Jim Casey and Andy O'Brien was a co-head of syndicated and leveraged finance. Under the new structure, Casey and O'Brien will continue those roles while Linneman seeks a new role at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Likewise David Topper, who will continue serving as vice chairman of equity capital markets, will explore other jobs at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a new offering to help small and midsize
enterprises (SME) rapidly deploy SAP software on IBM Power Systems.  The new
offering, IBM i InstallOption for SAP, dubbed "KOBI," provides SAP value added
resellers with a pre-configured and fully customized installation routine for
SAP Business All-in-One solutions that can reduce system installation time at
the customer site significantly.

    "IBM Power Systems is an excellent platform to bring innovation to new
market
segments," said Hans-Peter Klaey, president, Global SME and corporate
officer, SAP AG. "This approach is providing customers with a highly
configurable and customized enterprise solution that lowers the total cost of
ownership."

    KOBI is developed for installing SAP Business All-in-One solutions optimized
for
IBM i running on IBM Power Systems hardware.  Basic components include an IBM
DB2 database, SAP ERP Central Component 6.0, the SAP Solution Manager and SAP
Best Practices. SAP value added resellers work with a midsize enterprise to
determine their specific industry needs, and IBM provides a pre-configured
and installable 'image' for the value added reseller to deploy at the customer
site. KOBI could be made available for all Industry SAP Best Practices.

    KOBI is an "SAP Pinnacle award finalist" and the award winners will be
honored at SAPPHIRE(R) '08 Berlin, SAP's international customer
conference,May 19 through 21 in Berlin, Germany.

    International restaurant chain Barbecue Plaza utilized KOBI with SAP ERP 6.0
applications including financials, controlling, materials management, sales &amp;
distribution and production planning functionalities, running IBM i on an
IBM Power Systems server.  The installation image approach delivered a
ready-to-run
operating system, database and SAP software environment in just one day. 
"Our users are not particularly technically skilled, and we have a small
management team that is focused on running restaurants," said Neerada
Choopojcharoen, Business Development Executive, The Barbecue Plaza Co. Ltd. 
"Our objective was to implement the right solution for the company quickly,
easily and at low cost.  The complete SAP solution was delivered very
rapidly."

    "The ability to create and deliver a pre-configured and customized
solutionfor our joint SME customers helps to drive more value from restrictive
IT
budgets and enables a faster return on investment," said Marc Dupaquier, general
manager, IBM General Business.  "IBM and SAP value added resellers also benefit
from KOBI as the installation routines can be reused with the customer as
they grow and also across specific industries to further speed installation."

    KOBI is available today from IBM and selected SAP value added resellers. For

Market Overview



Goldman Sachs Dynamic Opportunities Limited ("GSDO" or the "Fund") returned
-1.46% net1 in the month of March (for the USD share class).

Fourteen out of nineteen managers in the portfolio posted negative returns.

Three out of four Relative Value managers finished the month negative. Losses in
the strategy were primarily driven by fixed income strategies, where sharp
reversals during the month led to losses, particularly in Japan. These market
reversals also adversely affected multi-strategy funds as well as quantitative
equity and emerging markets strategies, which had partial exposure to the asset
class. As in previous periods of distress, volatility strategies generated
positive performance by capturing relative value trading opportunities. One
multi-strategy manager detracted from performance amidst weakness in its fixed
income and credit portfolio. Another manager trading Asian volatility partially
offset these losses as volatility spiked during the month.

Five out of six Event Driven managers generated negative performance in March. A
second half rally in the financials sector, driven by news of the bailout for
Bear Stearns and U.S. Federal Reserve's rate cut, detracted from some manager's
performance as they were positioned net short the sector. Additionally, long
emerging market positions suffered with equity markets in India and China
trading down significantly. Credit positions also proved challenging as
leveraged loans and high yield bonds continued to trade lower, while the IG9, an
investment grade index used as a hedge, rallied sharply. Merger arbitrage was a
detractor from performance as deal spreads widened during the month. One manager
generated negative returns amidst continued weakness in merger arbitrage, while
another manager also detracted from performance as long positions in credit sold
off significantly.

Five out of six Equity Long/Short managers generated negative performance. The
month-end performances of major equity indices disguised the volatile
intra-month moves. Broadly speaking, equity markets rallied following the Fed's
bailout of Bear Stearns and the above mentioned Federal Reserve 0.75% rate cut.
Several managers gave back profits from some of the core trades which were
profitable in February and generated losses due to the rally in financials
during the second half of the month. Weakness in energy and commodity positions
as well as emerging markets also weighed on returns. One manager benefited from
long positions in industrials, small cap companies, and long volatility
positions. A Europe-focused manager experienced negative performance due to
exposure to telecommunications and technology stocks, which were only partially
offset by long exposure to the consumer finance sector.

Two out of three Tactical Trading managers experienced positive returns.
Following a strong start to the month, some managers experienced losses in the
second half of the month due to trend reversals in a number of markets. Macro
managers experienced difficulty mainly in fixed income trading.  Fundamental
commodity exposure also detracted, primarily due to long exposure to the
agricultural sector, which experienced a sharp sell-off. Positive contributors
to global macro managers included long positions in the energy sector and short
exposure in the U.S. dollar which continued to show significant weakness, as
well as European equity indices. One manager's losses were primarily driven by
commodity and equity strategies. Another manager generated slight gains in its
foreign exchange portfolio.

3 This is the excess return over the risk-free rate (3 Month USD LIBOR).

4 Does not include cash. The Investment Manager may change the allocations over
time. The allocations noted before should not be deemed representative of
allocations in the future. Allocations based upon month-end valuations. Figures

Data will not arithmetically sum to fund total. Cumulative geometric returns for
less than 12 months are calculated as follows: (1+r1)*(1+r2)*...*(1+rn)-1.
Annualized geometric returns for returns greater than 12 months are calculated
as follows: ((1+r1)*(1+r2)*...*(1+m))12/m -1.

Indices are unmanaged. The figures for the index reflect the reinvestment of
dividends but do not reflect the deduction of any fees or expenses which would
reduce returns. Investors cannot invest directly in indices.

Effect of fees on performance:

The following table provides a simplified example of the effect of management
and incentive fees on portfolio returns.  For example, assume a portfolio has a
steady investment return, gross of fees, of 0.5% per month and total management
fees of  0.1250% per month of the market value of the portfolio on the last day
of the month and incentive fees of 10% of net profits. Management fees and
incentive fees are deducted from the market value of the portfolio on that day.
There are no cash flows during the period.  The table shows that, assuming that
other factors such as investment return and fees remain constant, the difference
increases due to the compounding effect over time.  Of course, the magnitude of
the difference between gross-of-fee and net-of-fee returns will depend on a
variety of factors, and the example has been intentionally simplified.

Period          Gross Return              Net Return          Differential

1 year                6.17%                    4.13%                 2.04%

2 years             12.72%                   8.42%                 4.29%

10 years            81.94%                  49.83%               32.11%

MSCI World Index: Morgan Stanley Capital International's market capitalization
weighted index is composed of companies representative of the market structure
of 22 developed market countries in North America, Europe, and the Asia/Pacific
Region. The index is calculated without dividends, with net or with gross
dividends reinvested, in both US dollars and local currencies.

Lehman Brothers Aggregate Index: The index is composed of securities from Lehman
Brothers Government/Corporate Bond Index, Mortgage-Backed Securities Index, and
the Asset-Backed Securities Index. The index's total return consists of price
appreciation/depreciation plus income as a percentage of the original
investment. Indexes are rebalanced monthly by market capitalization.

Supplemental Risk Disclosure for All Potential Investors in Hedge Funds and
other private investment funds (collectively, "Alternative Investments")

In connection with your consideration of an investment in any Alternative
Investment, you should be aware of the following risks:

Alternative Investments are not subject to the same regulatory requirements or
governmental oversight as mutual funds. The sponsor or manager of any
Alternative Investment may not be registered with any governmental agency.

Alternative Investments often engage in leverage and other investment practices
that are extremely speculative and involve a high degree of risk. Such practices
may increase the volatility of performance and the risk of investment loss,
including the loss of the entire amount that is invested.

Alternative Investments may purchase instruments that are traded on exchanges
located outside the United States that are "principal markets" and are subject
to the risk that the counterparty will not perform with respect to contracts.
Furthermore, since there is generally less government supervision and regulation
of foreign exchanges, Alternative Investments are also subject to the risk of
the failure of the exchanges and there may be a higher risk of financial
irregularities and/or lack of appropriate risk monitoring and controls.

Past performance is not a guide to future performance and the value of
Alternative Investments and the income derived from them can go down as well as
up. Future returns are not guaranteed and a loss of principal may occur.

Alternative Investments may impose significant fees, including incentive fees
that are based upon a percentage of the realized and unrealized gains, and such
fees may offset all or a significant portion of such Alternative Investment's
trading profits.

Alternative Investments are offered in reliance upon an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for offers and sales
of securities that do not involve a public offering. No public or other market
is available or will develop. Similarly, interests in an Alternative Investment
are highly illiquid and generally are not transferable without the consent of
the sponsor, and applicable securities and tax laws will limit transfers.

Alternative Investments may themselves invest in instruments that may be highly
illiquid and extremely difficult to value. This also may limit your ability to
redeem or transfer your investment or delay receipt of redemption proceeds.

Alternative Investments generally are not required to provide their investors
with periodic pricing or valuation information.

There may be conflicts of interest between the Alternative Investment and other
service providers, including the investment manager and sponsor of the
Alternative Investment.

Investors in Alternative Investments may have limited rights with respect to
their investment interest, including limited voting rights and participation in
the management of the Alternative Investment.

Alternative Investments may involve complex tax and legal structures. Investment
in any particular Alternative Investment, or Alternative Investments generally,
is only suitable for sophisticated investors for whom such an investment does
not constitute a complete investment program and who fully understand and are
willing to assume the risks involved in such Alternative Investment. You are
urged to consult with your own tax, accounting and legal advisers regarding any
investment in any Alternative Investment.

Investors are also urged to take appropriate advice regarding any applicable
legal requirements and any applicable taxation and exchange control regulations
in the country of their citizenship, residence or domicile which may be relevant
to the subscription, purchase, holding, exchange, redemption or disposal of any
Alternative Investment.

We refer you to the prospectus for a more complete discussion of the risks
relating to an investment in any particular Alternative Investment. You are
urged to read all of the offering materials, including the entire prospectus,
prior to any investment in any Alternative Investment, and to ask questions of
the investment manager or sponsor of such Alternative Investment. Investment
Restrictions apply to many of Goldman Sachs' Alternative Investments. Goldman
Sachs Hedge Fund Strategies LLC (HFS) is the Investment Manager to the Fund
referenced herein. HFS, a US registered investment adviser, is part of Goldman
Sachs Asset Management and is a wholly owned subsidiary of The Goldman Sachs
Group, Inc.

There may be conflicts of interest relating to the Fund and its service
providers, including Goldman Sachs and its affiliates, who are engaged in
businesses and have interests other than that of managing, distributing and
otherwise providing services to the Fund. These activities and interests include
potential multiple advisory, transactional and financial and other interests in
securities and instruments that may be purchased or sold by the Fund, or in
other investment vehicles that may purchase or sell such securities and
instruments. These are considerations of which investors in the Fund should be
aware. Additional information relating to these conflicts is set forth in the
prospectus for the Fund.

This document has been communicated outside of the United States by Goldman
Sachs International, Peterborough Court, 133 Fleet Street, London, EC4A 2BB,
authorised and regulated by the Financial Services Authority.  Hedge Funds are
not schemes of the type described in section 238(4) of the UK Financial Services
and Markets Act 2000.  The Fund will therefore be made available in the UK only
to persons to whom such investment may be promoted in accordance with rules or
orders made pursuant to sections 238(5) or (6) of that Act.

To the extent this presentation is used by Private Wealth Management, this
presentation is intended only to facilitate your discussions with Goldman Sachs
as to the opportunities available to our Private Wealth Management clients. The
presentation is not intended to be used as a general guide to investing.  It
makes no implied or express recommendations concerning the manner in which any
client's account should or would be handled, as finding the appropriate
investment strategies for a client will depend upon the client's investment
objectives.

This presentation may also be communicated in the United Kingdom by Goldman
Sachs Asset Management International which is authorised and regulated by the
Financial Services Authority (FSA).

Prospective investors should inform themselves as to any applicable legal
requirements and taxation and exchange control regulations in the countries of
their citizenship, residence or domicile which might be relevant.

Investors should consider that the returns that they will receive will be a
function of the share price of the Fund.  While we would expect that the Fund
would trade substantially in line with its underlying NAV, investors should
consider that the traded status of the Fund could lead it to have a
significantly higher volatility and correlation to equities.

Investors should consider that the liquidity of their investment will be a
function of the market demand for the shares of the Fund.  There is the
potential for the Fund to trade at a discount to NAV and lack of market demand
may lead to their being a less liquid market.

per &#163; Share of 114.59p, per &#8364; Share of &#8364;1.6296 and per US$ Share of US$2.1027.
The Company's investor base consists of a broad range of private wealth
management groups, insurance companies, pension funds and discretionary asset
managers.

Background to and Reasons for the Issue

The Board believes that there is further existing and new investor demand for
investment in the Company that cannot be satisfied in the secondary market and
that it is in the Company's interests to continue to develop further the breadth
and depth of its investor base. Accordingly, the Directors believe that it is in
the best interests of Shareholders and the Company to raise further monies by
way of the Issue.

Benefits of the Issue

The Directors believe that the Issue will confer the following benefits on
Shareholders and the Company:
     
&#8226;    create a larger Company with a shareholder base more broadly diversified by 
     jurisdiction and investor type, facilitating secondary market liquidity in 
     each class of Shares and reducing the likelihood that small amounts of 
     trading volume will affect the respective share prices of those classes;

&#8226;    provide the Investment Manager with the flexibility to allocate the Net 
     Proceeds among both existing hedge fund investments and new attractive 
     investment opportunities (as the Investment Manager thinks appropriate) in 
     accordance with the Company's investment policy;

&#8226;    position the Company as an even more attractive investor when sourcing 
     scarce or difficult to access Advisors;

&#8226;    allow those investors who would not otherwise have been able to invest in 
     the Company to the extent they wish, to make an investment; and

&#8226;    provide a larger asset base through which the fixed costs of the Company 
     may be spread, thereby providing for a reduction to the Company's total 
     expense ratio.

The Issue

C &#163; Shares, C &#8364; Shares and C US$ Shares are available pursuant to the Issue,
each to be issued at &#163;1.00, &#8364;1.00 and US$1.00 respectively.  The Issue comprises
a placing of the Placing Shares and an Offer for Subscription of the Offer
Shares, all of which are being offered on a non pre-emptive basis.

Hoare Govett Limited is acting as sponsor to the Issue. Hoare Govett Limited and
Goldman Sachs International are acting as Joint Placing Agents in respect of the
Issue.

The Net Proceeds of the Issue are being raised for the purposes of implementing,
and will be applied in accordance with, the investment policy of the Company as
set out below.

Investment Objective

The Company's investment objective is to target attractive risk adjusted
absolute returns above the risk free rate with lower volatility than broad
equity markets over a full market cycle.

Investment Policy

In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Company allocates its assets
(directly or indirectly) to a relatively concentrated portfolio of Advisors (or
entities managed by them) selected by the Investment Manager. Such Advisors
employ a broad range of alternative investment strategies within the relative
value, event-driven, tactical trading and equity long/short sectors. The Company
seeks to make longer term core investments whilst also allocating more
opportunistically to niche Advisors. A general description of the Investment
Sectors is set out below.

Relative Value Sector

Relative value strategies seek to profit from the mispricing of financial
instruments, capturing spreads between related securities that deviate from
their fair value or historical norms. Directional and market exposure is
generally held to a minimum or completely hedged. Hence, relative value
strategies endeavour to have low correlation and beta to most market indices.
Strategies that may be used in the relative value sector include credit relative
value, convertible arbitrage, equity market neutral, and fixed income relative
value. However, other strategies may be employed as well.

Event Driven Sector

Event driven strategies seek to identify security price changes resulting from
corporate events such as restructurings, mergers, takeovers, spin-offs and other
special situations. Corporate event arbitrageurs generally choose their
investments based on their perceptions of the likelihood that the event or
transaction will occur, the amount of time that the process will take and the
perceived ratio of return to risk. Strategies that may be used in the event
driven sector include risk arbitrage/special situations and credit opportunities
/distressed securities. However, other strategies may be employed as well.

Tactical Trading Sector

Tactical trading strategies are directional trading strategies, which generally
fall into one of two categories: managed futures strategies and global macro
strategies. Managed futures strategies involve trading in futures and currencies
globally, generally using systematic or discretionary approaches. Global macro
strategies generally use analysis of macroeconomic and financial conditions to
develop views on country, regional or broader economic themes and then seek to
capitalise on such views by trading in securities, commodities, interest rates,
currencies and other instruments.

Equity Long/Short Sector

Equity long/short strategies involve making long and short equity investments,
generally based on fundamental evaluations, although it is expected that
Advisors in this investment sector will employ a wide range of styles. For
example, such Advisors may (i) focus on companies within specific industries;
(ii) focus on companies only in certain countries or regions; (iii) focus on
companies with certain ranges of market capitalisation; or (iv) employ a more
diversified approach, allocating assets to opportunities across investing
styles, industry sectors, market capitalisations and geographic regions.

Investment Approach

The Investment Manager pursues the investment policy and approach primarily by
allocating the Company's assets to Advisors by investing directly or indirectly
in Portfolio Funds, or other investment funds or investment vehicles, managed by
Advisors.

The Investment Manager typically allocates the Company's assets to approximately
15 to 20 Advisors, although the actual number of Advisors may change materially
over time as determined by the Investment Manager. The number of Advisors to
which the Company allocates assets from time to time is based on factors deemed
relevant by the Investment Manager, which may include the amount of the
Company's assets under management, constraints on the capital capacity of
Advisors, the availability of attractive opportunities, and other portfolio
construction considerations.

The Investment Manager may, from time to time, vary or change materially the
actual allocation of assets made by the Company, as it deems appropriate,
including without limitation by way of allocation of Company assets to any new
Advisor, complete or partial withdrawal of an allocation to any existing
Advisor, a reallocation of assets among existing Advisors, or any combination of
the foregoing. In carrying out any reallocation of Company assets, the
Investment Manager has the discretion to determine the manner of such
reallocation, including from which Advisors to withdraw assets and to which
Advisors to allocate assets. Any reallocation of Company assets, for the
purposes of diversification, to meet target allocations or otherwise, may take a
significant period of time to implement due to the liquidity provisions and
restrictions imposed by Advisors or for other reasons. The Company will invest
and manage it assets in a way which is consistent with its object of spreading
investment risk.

The Investment Manager seeks (i) not to invest more than 20 per cent. of the
Company's total assets at the time of investment with any one Advisor and (ii)
not to invest more than 50 per cent. of the Company's total assets at the time
of investment in any single Investment Sector (although it may deviate from any
such guidelines from time to time, subject always to the maximum exposures,
introduced in accordance with the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority, set
out in the investment restrictions below).

The Company has an annual facility agreement with Royal Bank of Canada (Channel
Islands) Limited for up to the lower of (i) US$92 million (which is expected to
be increased to up to US$150 million (dependent on the amount of the Net
Proceeds) on Admission), (ii) 20 per cent. of its net asset value and (iii) 100
per cent. of its Collateral Value for short-term or temporary liquidity purposes
as may be necessary, among other things, to facilitate investment and
withdrawals from Portfolio Funds, to repurchase Ordinary Shares in the secondary
market or pursuant to the Articles or to fund Ordinary Share redemptions, to
implement the Company's currency hedging strategy, to fund foreign exchange
marked to market adverse movements of exchange rates, to meet day to day
operating expenses and/or timing and settlement requirements of the Company and
for such other purposes as the directors may consider appropriate. The Company
has granted a security interest in support of the facility agreement over
certain collateral, including its interests in Portfolio Funds, which may
comprise up to all of its assets.

The Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money and to give
guarantees, mortgage, hypothecate, pledge or charge all or part of its
undertaking, property or assets and uncalled capital and to issue debentures and
other securities whether outright or as collateral security for any liability or
obligation of the Company or of any third party. The Articles do not specify a
borrowing limit.

The Company does not have any long-term or fixed structural gearing and,
although it is not intended that it should have, the introduction of any such
gearing would be subject to the prior approval of Shareholders. The Company may
be indirectly exposed to gearing to the extent that Portfolio Funds are
themselves geared

Investment Restrictions

The Company has adopted the following investment restrictions which include
certain restrictions set out in the Listing Rules:
     
&#8226;    Not more than 20 per cent. of the total assets of the Company will be 
     invested in any one Portfolio Fund at the time the investment is made; for 
     this purpose any existing holding in the Portfolio Fund concerned will be 
     aggregated with the proposed new investment.

&#8226;    Not more than 30 per cent. of the Company's total assets will be invested 
     with any one Advisor at the time the investment is made.

&#8226;    The Company will not make further investment(s) in any single Investment 
     Sector where, immediately following such further investment(s), that 
     Investment Sector would represent 60 per cent. or more of the total assets 
     of the Company.

&#8226;    The Company will not borrow more than 30 per cent. of its net assets for 
     short term or temporary liquidity purposes, including as may be necessary 
     to facilitate investment and withdrawals from Portfolio Funds, to 
     repurchase Shares in the secondary market or pursuant to the Articles or 
     to fund Ordinary Share redemptions, to implement the Company's currency 
     hedging strategy, to fund foreign exchange marked to market adverse 
     movements of exchange rates, to meet day to day operating expenses and/or 
     timing and settlement requirements of the Company and for such other 
     purposes as the directors may consider appropriate.

&#8226;    The Company will avoid cross-financing between businesses forming part of 
     its investment portfolio.

&#8226;    The Company will avoid the operation of common treasury functions as 
     between the Company and investee companies.

&#8226;    Neither the Company nor any subsidiary will conduct a trading activity 
     which is significant in the context of the group as a whole.

&#8226;    Dividends will not normally be paid and in any event will only be paid if 
     they are covered by income received from underlying
     investments.

&#8226;    The distribution as dividends of surpluses arising from the realisation of 
     investments is prohibited.

&#8226;    Any material change in the investment policies of the Company will only be 
     made with the approval of Ordinary Shareholders by ordinary resolution.

&#8226;    Not more than 10 per cent. of the total assets of the Company in aggregate 
     will be invested in other closed-ended investment funds except for those 
     which themselves have stated investment policies to invest no more than 15 
     per cent. of their gross assets in other closed-ended investment funds.

In the event of any breach of these investment restrictions, the Board will as
soon as practicable make an announcement via a regulatory information service
provider and subsequently write to Shareholders if appropriate.

Investment Review

The second half of 2007 began with increased uncertainty abruptly ending many
trends that had proved successful in the first half of the year. This
uncertainty has continued into 2008 and through March and has provided
challenges as well as opportunities across the spectrum of hedge fund
strategies.

Event Driven

The Company's investments with the Advisors in the event driven sector generally
withstood the volatility experienced in the second half of 2007 across global
equity and credit markets. Advisors were defensively positioned going into the
second half with lower net and gross exposure levels and a fair amount of short
residential mortgage backed secuties ("RMBS") and corporate credit exposure.
This prudent positioning allowed Company's investments in this sector, at an
aggregate level, to generate positive returns over the period. The strongest
performing event driven Advisor primarily benefited from bearish bets on
corporate credit and sub prime RMBS. The Company's weakest performing event
driven Advisor lost more than 10 per cent. due to the poor performance of
several risk arbitrage and special situations investments. Exposure to emerging
markets generated attractive returns as emerging markets outperformed developed
markets over the period.

Advisors within this sector have generally protected capital as global markets
continue to deteriorate in the first three months of 2008. Advisors continue to
be defensively positioned given the headwinds in the credit markets and concerns
about liquidity, and economic slowdown in the US.

Equity long/short

Volatility within the global equity markets sharply increased during the third
quarter of 2007, driven by a global liquidity crunch and accelerating concerns
surrounding the sub-prime mortgage fallout. The Company's positively performing
underlying equity long/short Advisors benefited from long exposure to emerging
markets. Equity long/short Advisors with exposure to energy, large cap
technology, and select industrials also outperformed during that quarter.
Advisors with significant exposure to retail stocks and real estate struggled.

Additionally, some underlying equity long/short Advisors who significantly
lowered risk during the market downturn in late July and August 2007 tended to
under perform relative to the passively managed benchmarks. Many Advisors
finished 2007 near the lowest levels of net and gross exposure they had been at
all year. The reduction in exposures was driven by both the increasing
uncertainty in the markets and rising volatility. Nearly all Advisors generated
positive attribution through their portfolio hedges, with positively performing
Advisors also benefiting from strong short stock picking to generate outsized
returns.

January 2008 saw significant intra-month volatility and a wide dispersion of
manager performance in the month's two halves. Prior to the two rate cuts by the
US Federal Reserve totalling 1.25 per cent., Advisors benefited from short
positioning in the financial and consumer sectors, but saw those gains reverse
as the sectors recovered some of their early losses after the US Federal Reserve
announcement. The first half of the month witnessed broad based selling led by
sectors which contributed significantly to returns in 2007. Additionally,
Advisors who adjusted exposures mid-month tended to underperform as they were
not able to participate in the late-month rally. In February 2008, despite the
fall in global equity markets, Advisors benefited from their relatively low
levels of exposure and some active trading around positions. Strong performance
in February did not fully compensate for losses in January. March proved to be a
challenging month as Advisors gave back profits from many of the trades which
were profitable in February. Although most equity long/short Advisors posted
losses during the month, there was a wide dispersion of returns amongst them.

Tactical trading

During the second half of 2007, the Company's tactical trading Advisors
generated the strongest performance. During this period, weak economic data and
challenging credit market conditions signalled a slowdown in the US. The US
Federal Reserve shifted to an easing bias, cutting the fed funds rate by 1.0 per
cent. Discretionary macro Advisors were able to capitalise on this market
development, profiting from directional positions and yield curve steepeners in
global bond markets; long volatility positions in fixed income and foreign
exchange also saw notable gains. Quantitative macro strategies generally posted
positive results as well. For managed futures strategies, a long-bias in
selected energy and agricultural commodities resulted in material gains.

2008 started strongly for Advisors within the tactical trading sector; notable
contributors to profits in January and February included yield curve steepeners,
long positions in fixed income and trading in foreign exchange. All three of the
Company's tactical trading Advisors were profitable in both January and
February. March saw mixed performance for the Company's tactical trading
Advisors but in aggregate the sector ended the month in positive territory.
Contributors included foreign exchange trading, with short positions in the US
Dollar being notably profitable. Fixed income detracted overall, as significant
mid-month reversals, particularly in the US, hurt directional and yield curve
positions; elsewhere, long positions in Japanese fixed income positively
contributed to performance. The reversal in some commodities markets, notably
agriculture, resulted in losses as previously profitable long positions were
hurt.

Relative value

Following a strong first half of 2007, the Company's relative value Advisors
experienced a volatile second half of the year. Initially, all of the relative
value Advisors were successful, however, volatility trading was the strongest
contributor and the Company's Asia-focused volatility trading Advisor continued
to outperform by capitalising on higher single stock implied volatilities in the
region. Multi-strategy Advisors detracted from returns as fundamental equities
strategies suffered. Advisors' macro hedges failed to protect from idiosyncratic
losses. Quantitative strategies detracted; deleveraging by some funds in the
space caused selling pressure and made the environment very challenging.

The volatile environment at the beginning of 2008 resulted in mixed performance
across relative value strategies. The period from the beginning of the year to
March has presented a challenging environment for the Company's relative value
Advisors. The Company's volatility trading exposure helped performance as the
Company's Asian focused volatility Advisor consistently generated positive
returns. However, most other strategies have detracted from performance during
the first quarter.

Investment Outlook for the Company

Similar to the second half of 2007, the Company's Advisors have approached 2008
with caution given the heightened uncertainty. Advisors remain concerned about
the state of the US economy and the continued deleveraging of the global
financial system. While they continue to maintain defensive portfolio
positioning, they are optimistic about the potential opportunity set through
long and short exposures.

The current market dislocation has created attractive opportunities across asset
classes and capital structure, for Advisors with a healthy balance sheet. The
corporate credit market may continue to experience heightened volatility as
investors sift through economic and corporate data in the first half of 2008.
The Board, after consultation with the Investment Manager, believes that a
continued slowdown in the US economy is likely to make it more difficult for
companies to meet their debt requirements or to access capital markets for
refinancing and could present Advisors with an increased number of distressed
situations. Several Advisors have noted that the current environment presents
potential capital structure arbitrage opportunities. In addition, certain
Advisors have been building expertise and capability to take advantage of
potential distressed opportunities in the structured credit markets. Some
Advisors are also seeing attractive opportunities in asset-based and direct
lending areas as the meltdown in credit markets has led to a decrease in lending
appetite by commercial banks and other traditional lenders. Over time the
Investment Manager may seek to increase the Company's weighting with such
Advisors where those opportunities persist.

Equity long/short Advisors continue to maintain a cautious view towards global
equity markets, especially US and European equities, given the strong economic
headwinds facing these regions. Consequently, many of the Company's equity long/
short Advisors are looking to add multinational corporations with global
revenues and equities with stock-specific stories which are less dependent on
economic growth, the broader macro environment and external financing and the
Investment Manager may look to include further Advisors with such exposure on an
opportunistic basis. Advisors generally remain bearish about the financial and
consumer discretionary sectors as they anticipate these sectors will likely
underperform given the continuing difficulties in the housing markets and the
related slowdown in consumer spending. Additionally, the Company expects merger
arbitrage to have a challenging backdrop in the near-term, driven by tougher
financing conditions and elevated macro economic uncertainty.

The Company's tactical trading Advisors remain focused on housing markets,
credit conditions, consumer and business spending and their implications for
economic growth, foreign exchange movements, inflation and central bank actions.
The Investment Manager is actively considering increasing the Company's
allocation to such Advisors with the potential to also capture diversification
benefits due to their low correlation to other hedge fund strategies over the
long term. Whilst the US yield curve has significantly steepened as markets have
priced in cuts in interest rates, which the Company's Advisors had anticipated
and generated profits from, most other yield curves have had much less movement,
including in many areas with significant economic links to the US; meanwhile,
equity markets have displayed more similar behaviour across these markets. Thus,
a key issue remains the extent to which an economic slowdown in the US affects
the rest of the world and how central banks and equity markets react to this, as
well as the timing and path of any recovery. As many commodities experienced
strong rallies in 2007, supply and demand in these markets and their impact on
consumer spending and inflation also remains a focus. In general, as investors'
and banks' appetite for risk has been reduced and a number of markets have
experienced significantly increased volatility and dislocations in pricing, many
Advisors have become more cautious towards portfolio construction, favouring
more liquid markets and maintaining high cash balances.

Terms of the C Shares and the Conversion Ratio

An issue of C Shares is designed to overcome the potential disadvantages for
both existing and new investors which could arise out of a conventional fixed
price issue of further Ordinary Shares of an existing issued class for cash. In
particular:

&#8226;           the assets representing the Net Proceeds attributable to each class
of C Shares will be valued as distinct pools of assets until the Calculation
Time. The Investment Manager anticipates that at least 85 per cent. of the
aggregate Net Proceeds arising from the issue of the C Shares will be invested
or committed to be invested by 1 July 2008. By accounting for the Net Proceeds
arising from the issue of the C Shares separately, holders of existing Ordinary
Shares will not be exposed to a portfolio containing a substantial amount of
uninvested cash (representing the Net Proceeds) before the Calculation Time;

&#8226;           the Net Asset Value of the existing Ordinary Shares will not be
diluted by the expenses associated with the Issue which will be borne by the
subscribers for C Shares and not by existing Ordinary Shareholders; and

&#8226;           the basis upon which the C &#163; Shares, C &#8364; Shares and C US$ Shares
will convert into &#163; Shares, &#8364; Shares and US$ Shares respectively is such that
the number of &#163; Shares, &#8364; Shares and US$ Shares to which holders of the relevant
tranches of C Shares will become entitled will reflect the relative investment
performance and value of the assets attributable to each such class of C Shares
up to the Calculation Time as compared to the assets attributable to the
relevant class of existing Ordinary Shares at that time and as a result, neither
the Net Asset Value attributable to each class of the existing Ordinary Shares
nor the Net Asset Value attributable to the classes of C &#163; Shares, C &#8364; Shares
and C US$ Shares will be adversely affected by Conversion.

As at the earlier of 30 September 2008 and the date on which 85 per cent. (or
such lower percentage as the Directors may determine) of the aggregate Net
Proceeds have been invested or committed to be invested, on the basis of the Net
Asset Value attributable to each class of existing &#163; Shares, &#8364; Shares and US$
Shares on the NAV Calculation Date on or immediately preceding that date, the
Conversion Ratios for C &#163; Shares, C &#8364; Shares and C US$ Shares into &#163; Shares, &#8364;
Shares and US$ Shares respectively will be calculated. Once such Conversion
Ratios have been calculated (which may take up to 30 business days) the C &#163;
Shares, C &#8364; Shares and C US$ Shares will convert into &#163; Shares, &#8364; Shares and US$
Shares respectively on the basis referred to above.

Pending full investment, the Net Proceeds arising from the issue of the C Shares
will be invested in short-term cash instruments or with institutions (or wholly
owned subsidiaries of institutions) which are rated A1 (or above) by Standard &amp;
Poor's or an equivalent rating agency. Fractions of Ordinary Shares arising on
Conversion will not be allocated to holders of C Shares but will be aggregated
and sold for the benefit of the Company.  The C Shares will not carry any
effective rights to dividends, nor will they carry voting rights, but the
consent of C Shareholders as a class will be required in connection with the
matters specified in the Articles (although if the New Articles are adopted at
the forthcoming AGM, holders of C Shares will lose the right to vote in
connection with any amendments to the Articles announced prior to the opening of
the subscription or offer period for such C Shares).  C Shareholders will be
entitled to participate in a winding-up of the Company or on a return of capital
as specified in the Articles.

The &#163; Shares, &#8364; Shares and US$ Shares arising on Conversion of the C &#163; Shares, C
&#8364; Shares and C US$ Shares respectively will rank pari passu with the &#163; Shares, &#8364;
Shares and US$ Shares respectively then in issue.

Admission Arrangements

Application has been made to the UK Listing Authority for all the C Shares of
the Company which are subject of the Issue to be admitted to the Official List.
Application has also been made for such C Shares to be admitted to trading on
the London Stock Exchange.

It is expected that such admissions will become effective and that dealings in
the C Shares will commence on 20 June 2008. All such C Shares will be in
registered form and may be delivered in certificated or uncertificated form.
Temporary documents of title will not be issued pending the dispatch by post of
definitive certificates, which is expected to take place by 23 June 2008.
Pending the dispatch of such certificates, transfers will be certified against
the register of the Company.

Application is being made for the C &#163; Shares, C &#8364; Shares and C US$ Shares to be
admitted to CREST, Euroclear and Clearstream. The Company's existing &#163; Shares, &#8364;
Shares and US$ Shares are already admitted to CREST, Euroclear and Clearstream.
Accordingly, the C Shares and Ordinary Shares, when issued and fully paid, may
be held and transferred by means of CREST, Euroclear and Clearstream.

Where C Shares have been requested to be issued in uncertificated form, the
Company will arrange for CREST, Euroclear and Clearstream to be instructed on 20
June 2008 (or as soon as practicable thereafter) to credit the appropriate stock
accounts in CREST, Euroclear or Clearstream (as appropriate) of the applicants
concerned with their respective entitlements to C Shares. C Shares initially
issued in certificated form (or Ordinary Shares arising on Conversion) may
subsequently be deposited into CREST, Euroclear or Clearstream in accordance
with normal CREST, Euroclear or Clearstream procedures.

Expenses of the Issue

The expenses of the Issue have been fixed at 1.75 per cent. of gross funds
raised.

Proposed Amendments to Articles

At the forthcoming AGM to be held on 22 May 2008 it is proposed that a special
resolution will be put to Shareholders resolving to adopt the New Articles in
substitution for the existing Articles of Association. To avoid complications
with the Issue, if adopted, the New Articles with take effect from the earlier
of Admission and 31 July 2008. For the avoidance of doubt, the Issue is not
conditional on the passing of the special resolution adopting the New Articles
at the AGM. The principal differences between the existing Articles of
Association and the New Articles are as follows:
     
&#8226;    the Articles which include provisions for the
conversion of C Shares of a new currency class into Ordinary Shares will be
amended to enable a reference NAV to be established against which the conversion
rate of the new C Shares can be based and the Directors will be authorised to
designate any existing class of Ordinary Shares as correspondent shares for such
purpose. This will facilitate issues of non-sterling denominated Shares in the
future should the Directors so determine and circumstances permit;

&#8226;    the Articles that deal with the attribution of
assets on a winding up of the Company will be clarified. In summary, the net
capital contributed in respect of each class of Ordinary Shares (including any
increase (or decrease) resulting from a conversion of other Ordinary Shares or C
Shares into or from that class) is (and will be) attributed to that class
together with the net profits/losses of the Company's foreign exchange hedging
in respect of the assets of that class. Management and performance fees (and
such other fees or expenses as the Directors determine) are accrued in
proportion to the increase in or quantum of (as appropriate), net assets of that
class whilst profits or losses on the Company's portfolio and all other expenses
are apportioned between classes on a monthly basis according to the net assets
attributable to that class at the immediately preceding NAV Calculation Date.
Net assets attributable to a class of C Shares will be attributed to the class
of Ordinary Shares into which those C Shares are to be converted as at the end
of the month in which the NAV Calculation Date used for the purpose of
establishing the Conversion Ratio falls and there are provisions intended to
prevent double-counting. In addition, the Directors will have discretion to make
adjustments to ensure fair and even treatment between classes of Shares. This
will result in certain consequential changes in other provisions of the
Articles;

&#8226;    the existing discount floor provision calculation
method in the Articles will be amended to a rolling 12 month basis with effect
from 1 January 2008 and the share price averaging calculation will be amended to
accommodate the current timing differential associated with the announcement of
each month-end final NAV so that on the day five business days after each
estimated NAV announcement is made the closing mid-market share price on that
day will be ascertained, and such share prices will be used as the basis for
averaging the share price component of the discount floor provision calculation.
The averaging calculation for the NAV component of the discount floor provision
will remain unchanged. In the event that a continuation vote is proposed as a
result of the operation of such mechanism and subsequently passed, no further
continuation vote will be capable of being proposed for a further 12 months;
     
&#8226;    the Articles will be amended so that the Directors
may put forward a continuation vote at any time after the obligation to do so
has been triggered (by reason of the average share price discount to NAV) but
not later than 4 months after the end of the 12 month period triggering the
obligation;

&#8226;    the Articles will be amended so that if a
continuation vote of any class of Ordinary Shares is not passed the Directors
may put forward proposals having substantially equivalent economic effect to
redemption proposals (for instance an on-market tender offer). The Articles will
also be amended to give the Directors greater flexibility in how such redemption
or other proposals are effected in particular in determining the NAV Calculation
Date to be used for calculating the amounts payable to persons accepting such
proposals, clarifying that costs and expenses attributable to accepting
Shareholders include those associated with the Company disposing of investments
or incurring borrowings to fund such payments, and permitting such payments to
be delayed until sufficient of the Company's investments have been realised in a
manner which does not prejudice remaining Shareholders;

&#8226;    the Articles will be amended to permit Shareholders whose
Ordinary Shares are to be compulsorily redeemed by the Company following
completion of a redemption or other proposal (as referred to above), instead to
elect to convert their Ordinary Shares into Ordinary Shares of another
continuing class;

&#8226;    the Articles will be amended to permit conversions
between currency classes of Ordinary Shares on a quarterly basis with effect
from 30 September 2008 and the mechanics of conversion will be amended slightly
for conversions of Ordinary Shares in uncertificated form;

&#8226;    the Articles will be amended to vary the rights of
holders of C Shares to vote on resolutions to vary or amend the Articles so that
they will not be entitled to vote on any variations or amendments that have been
publicly announced prior to the opening of the subscription or offer period for
such C Shares;

&#8226;    the Articles will be amended to require that the
new Shares (or C Shares) of a particular currency class being issued for cash
should first be offered to existing holders of Shares of the same currency class
in proportion to their holding of such Shares as at a record date established
for the purpose. Shareholders (as a whole rather than on a class by class basis)
may disapply such pre-emption rights by ordinary resolution (the Board believes
that it is not appropriate currently for the Company to be required to first
offer new issues of Shares to existing Shareholders and will therefore seek at
the AGM to disapply such new pre-emption rights in respect of all new issues of
Shares for cash in the period to the earlier of the Company's annual general
meeting in 2009 and the date 18 months after the date of the AGM, at which time
authority for the renewal of such disapplication will be sought); and

&#8226;    the Articles will be generally updated to conform
with current practice and applicable legislation and to make minor clarificatory

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Reports First Quarter Net Income of $5.17 Billion, up 10 Percent From First Quarter 2007

      Increase in Price of Crude Oil Boosts Upstream Earnings but
                Sharply Reduces Profits for Downstream
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today reported net income of $5.17
billion ($2.48 per share - diluted) for the first quarter 2008,
compared with $4.72 billion ($2.18 per share - diluted) in the 2007
first quarter. Earnings in the 2007 period included a $700 million
gain on downstream asset sales in Europe.

   Sales and other operating revenues in the first quarter 2008 were
$65 billion, up from $46 billion a year earlier on higher prices for
crude oil, natural gas and refined products.

   "Upstream earnings benefited from a significant increase in the
price of crude oil from a year ago," said Chairman and CEO Dave
O'Reilly. "However, market conditions prevented our downstream
business from fully recovering these higher costs through the price of
gasoline and other refined products. Downstream results in the United
States were essentially break-even in this year's first quarter."

   In the first quarter of this year, the company reported capital
and exploratory expenditures of $5.1 billion. Common stock buybacks in
the period totaled $2 billion, and earlier this week the company
announced a 12 percent increase in its quarterly dividend on common
stock.

   O'Reilly said continued strong cash flows from operations have
enabled the funding of major development projects that are providing
the foundation for the company's growth. Scheduled for start-up this
year in upstream are deepwater projects at 68 percent-owned Agbami in
Nigeria and 75 percent-owned Blind Faith in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico.
Total maximum oil-equivalent production is estimated at 250,000
barrels per day from Agbami within one year of start-up and 70,000
barrels per day at Blind Faith shortly after production begins. Also
this year at the 50 percent-owned Tengizchevroil affiliate in
Kazakhstan, full start-up of new facilities is expected to increase
total crude-oil production capacity from 400,000 barrels per day to
540,000.

   O'Reilly also indicated milestones were achieved in recent months
on other upstream projects:

   --  Republic of the Congo - Confirmed start-up ahead of schedule
        of the 31 percent owned, partner-operated Moho Bilondo
        deepwater project, which is expected to reach maximum total
        crude-oil production of 90,000 barrels per day in 2010.

   --  Thailand - Approved construction in the Gulf of Thailand of
        the 70 percent-owned and operated Platong Gas II project,
        which is designed to have a processing capacity of 420 million
        cubic feet of natural gas per day.

   --  Australia - Announced plans to develop a new liquefied natural
        gas project associated with Chevron's 100 percent-owned
        Wheatstone natural gas discovery.

   --  Nigeria - Confirmed that the company and its partners plan to
        develop the 30 percent-owned and partner-operated offshore
        Usan Field, which is expected to have maximum total production
        of 180,000 barrels of crude oil per day within one year of
        start-up in late 2011.

   UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

   Worldwide oil-equivalent production was 2.60 million barrels per
day in the first quarter 2008, down 44,000 barrels per day from the
corresponding 2007 period. Absent the impact of higher prices on
cost-recovery and variable-royalty volumes under provisions of certain
production contracts outside the United States, production increased
slightly between periods.

   U.S. upstream income of $1.6 billion in the first quarter 2008 was
double the amount earned in the year-ago period, driven mainly by
higher prices for crude oil. Prices for natural gas also increased
between periods. Partially offsetting the benefit of higher prices
were increases in depreciation and operating expenses and the impact
of lower production.

   The company's average sales price per barrel of crude oil and
natural gas liquids was approximately $87 in the 2008 quarter, up
about $37 per barrel from a year earlier. The average price of natural
gas increased $1.15 per thousand cubic feet to $7.55.

   Net oil-equivalent production of 715,000 barrels per day declined
34,000 barrels per day from the 2007 first quarter due mainly to
normal field declines. The net liquids component of production was
down about 5 percent to 437,000 barrels per day. Net natural gas
production of 1.67 billion cubic feet per day in the 2008 quarter
declined 3 percent between periods.

   International upstream earnings of $3.5 billion increased $1.4
billion from the first quarter 2007 due primarily to higher prices for
crude oil. Prices and sales volumes of natural gas were also higher
between periods. Partially offsetting these benefits to income were
higher operating expenses and lower crude-oil sales volumes associated
with the timing of cargo liftings in certain producing regions.

   The average sales price for crude oil and natural gas liquids in
the 2008 quarter was $86 per barrel, up about $35. The average price
of natural gas increased 98 cents to $4.83 per thousand cubic feet.

   Net oil-equivalent production of 1.88 million barrels per day was
essentially unchanged between periods. Absent the impact of higher
prices on cost-recovery and variable-royalty volumes, production would
have increased about 3 percent from last year's first quarter. The net
liquids component of production in the 2008 quarter was 1.26 million
barrels per day, down 93,000 from a year earlier. Net natural gas
production was 3.77 billion cubic feet per day, up 497 million from
the 2007 first quarter.

   U.S. downstream earnings of $4 million decreased $346 million from
the 2007 quarter, mainly due to lower margins on the sale of refined
products. The margin decline was associated with a sharp increase in
the price of crude oil that could not be fully recovered in the sales
price of gasoline and other refined products.

   Refinery crude-input of 894,000 barrels per day was up 165,000
from the first quarter 2007. The improvement was primarily at the
refinery in Richmond, California, which incurred planned and unplanned
downtime last year. Input volumes were lower in the 2008 quarter at
the refinery in Pascagoula, Mississippi, where a crude unit restarted
in February of this year after an extended unplanned outage that began
in August of last year.

   Refined-product sales volumes were 1.43 million barrels per day in
the first quarter 2008, down 1 percent from the year-ago period,
primarily due to reduced demand for gasoline and availability of fuel
oil. Branded gasoline sales volumes were down 3 percent between
quarters to 601,000 barrels per day.

   International downstream income of $248 million in the first
quarter of 2008 was down more than $1 billion from the year-ago
quarter. The 2007 quarter included a $700 million gain on the sale of
assets in the Netherlands. Margins on the sale of refined products
were lower in most areas, due mainly to an increase in crude-oil
feedstock costs. Foreign currency effects benefited earnings by $111
million in the 2008 period, compared with $5 million in the 2007 first
quarter.

   Total refined-product sales volumes of 2.05 million barrels per
day were 1 percent lower than last year's first quarter. Excluding the
impact of the 2007 asset sales in Europe, sales volumes were up 5
percent between quarters on increased trading activity.

   Refinery crude-input of 967,000 barrels per day was 10 percent
lower than the first quarter of 2007, primarily due to the sale of the
company's interest in a Netherlands refinery.

   Chemical operations earned $43 million in the first quarter 2008,
a decline of $77 million from the year-earlier period. Approximately
half of the decline was associated with environmental remediation
costs at a closed manufacturing site. Earnings of the 50 percent-owned
Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem) and Chevron's Oronite
subsidiary also were lower between periods. CPChem margins on the sale
of commodity chemicals were squeezed due to higher feedstock costs,
and utility expenses increased due to higher natural-gas prices. The
impact of higher operating expenses at Oronite was only partially
offset by improved margins on the sale of fuel and lubricant
additives.

   Net charges in the first quarter 2008 were $255 million, compared
with income of $65 million in last year's first quarter. The variance
between quarters was largely due to the absence of favorable corporate
tax items in the 2007 period and an increase in corporate charges in

included approximately $500 million for the company's share of
expenditures by affiliates, which did not require cash outlays by
Chevron's consolidated companies. Expenditures for upstream projects
in the first quarter 2008 represented 84 percent of the companywide

&lt;p&gt;St. Jude Medical and Microsoft Collaborate to Provide Patients and Physicians with Better Access to Health Records

   Integration of St. Jude Medical network and Microsoft HealthVault
     will enable patients to easily share cardiac device data with
                              physicians
ST. PAUL, Minn.--(Business Wire)--
St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE:STJ) today announced a partnership
with the Microsoft Corp. Health Solutions Group to research the
integration of data from implantable devices with patient-controlled,
personal health records. St. Jude Medical and Microsoft will work with
physicians to determine the optimal level of integration (between the
Merlin.net(TM) Patient Care Network and Microsoft(R) HealthVault) that
will allow physicians to efficiently and confidentially share device
information with their patients.

   Merlin.net PCN is a secure Internet-based system that collects and
displays information from implantable devices, such as implantable
cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs). It stores data that is captured
during implant procedures, in-office follow-up visits with physicians
and remote follow-up transmissions in patients' homes. Transmitted
data includes reports of irregular heart rhythms and real-time
electrograms (EGM) which show patients' heartbeats at the time of
transmission.

   The entire Merlin.net PCN system, from user access to data
storage, meets the standards of reliability, privacy and security
established by regulatory requirements and by the International
Quality Certification Standards. All network communications that occur
on Merlin.net PCN are encrypted with the highest level of protection
using industry standard cryptography.

   Microsoft HealthVault is an Internet-based consumer health record
system that allows individuals to collect, store and share their
health information privately and securely. Created in cooperation with
leading privacy advocates (including the Patient Privacy Rights
Foundation), respected security experts and dozens of the world's
leading healthcare organizations, HealthVault was designed to provide
people with a secure way to efficiently store and access their
personal medical records.

   "This partnership between two industry leaders will give patients
and physicians easier access to health records during clinical care,"
said George J. Fazio, president of the St. Jude Medical U.S. Division.
"A centralized, highly secure database with implanted device data, and
additional relevant patient information, will allow patients and their
physicians to more efficiently manage cardiac conditions."

   Microsoft's use of strong privacy principles, including the
principles of the bipartisan Coalition for Patient Privacy, its
ongoing relationship with consumer advocates and its commitment to
independent third-party audits, sets a new standard for privacy
protections in health information technology.

   "Consumers are asking for tools that make their lives easier by
facilitating communication and helping them take steps to manage their
health," said Peter Neupert, corporate vice president, Microsoft
Health Solutions Group. "Through the integration of the St. Jude
Medical Merlin.net PCN application and Microsoft HealthVault, patients
will be able to share more complete health information with their
doctors, privately and securely."

   About Merlin.Net Patient Care Network (PCN)

   Implantable cardiac devices are designed to capture and record
vast amounts of information about device performance and patient heart
rhythms that is vital to patient care. Merlin.net PCN not only stores
this information for physician access, but also allows data to be sent
directly to a clinic's or hospital's electronic health records (EHR)
system so the data is included in the patient's comprehensive personal
health record. With immediate access to patient information through
the secure Merlin.net PCN website, physicians can monitor and assess
patient device data and determine the level of care needed remotely.

   The Merlin.net PCN system adheres to the patient privacy standards
and requirements for the electronic transmission of health
information, as set forth by the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and will be the platform for future
St. Jude Medical device remote monitoring.

neurological and chronic pain patients worldwide through excellence in

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 2 (Reuters) - Colfax Corp (CFX.N), which
makes pumps and other fluid handling products, may not have the
appeal of Visa Inc (V.N) for investors, but it could hold its
own in a lackluster market for initial public offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Colfax, which is expected to price its offering of 18.75
million shares next week, is geographically diverse and has
been growing steadily, making it an attractive long-term
investment, IPO experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But they add that the business lacks the "sex appeal" for
investors to sit up and take notice in a market undermined by
the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Richmond, Virginia-based company makes pumps, fluid
handling systems and specialty valves that are used in sectors
such as oil and gas and power generation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It sells products under some of the oldest brands in a
fragmented global fluid handling industry, which is populated
by more than 10,000 companies. Its Allweiler brand dates back
to 1860.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a quiet, boring, fundamentally strong business," said
Ben Holmes, publisher of Morningnotes.com, an independent
research company. "These are equipment and parts and systems
that most people will never encounter in their lifetime, but
they make the world go round."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EXIT FOR SHAREHOLDERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colfax, which will list on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol "CFX," expects its shares to price between $15
and $17 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will have 41.23 million shares outstanding and a market
cap of roughly $660 million at the mid-point of the range,
according to Dealogic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a deal that will probably open unchanged at this
point," said David Menlow, president of IPOfinancial.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company plans to sell 7.8 million shares, while
stockholders will sell an additional 10.9 million shares,
according to a U.S Securities and Exchange Commission filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers and UBS Securities are the
lead managers for the IPO, Dealogic said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colfax expects net proceeds of $111.3 million from the sale
of its 7.8 million shares. It plans to use the money to repay
debt, pay dividends to preferred shareholders and for other
corporate purposes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "None of it goes to the company. And that's one of the
things that doesn't excite investors," said Francis Gaskins,
president of IPOdesktop.com. "It's clearly an exit for the
shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colfax has thought about going public before. In August
1998, it filed a preliminary prospectus with the SEC for an IPO
but did not set any terms, and ultimately withdrew those plans
in March 2003 without saying why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company declined to comment for this article.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STABLE COMPANY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colfax posted net income of $64.9 million in 2007 compared
with $94,000 in 2006, helped by higher sales and one-time
items. Net sales increased to $506.3 million from $393.6
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are in the right sector," said Sal Morreale, who
tracks IPOs for Cantor Fitzgerald. "If I had to look, it is one
of the more solid deals to come out in a while."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colfax's clients include commercial, industrial, marine and
governmental customers such as Siemens, General Dynamics and
the U.S. Navy. Last year, about a quarter of its revenue came
from aftermarket sales and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the potential risks for the company is exposure to
asbestos-related liabilities. Two of its units are among
defendants in a large number of personal injury lawsuits
related to alleged asbestos exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even though they have what you might call significant
customer base, the company itself is just not going to put a
big enough spark under the seats of investors to make them
jump," Menlow said. "This is not a sector where investors trip
over themselves to say I have to have this."

   Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog:

   Stupid Idea of the Week

   Recently, Sen. McCain proposed suspending the $0.18 per gallon gas
tax from Memorial Day through Labor Day. The tax goes directly into
the highway trust fund. The country's infrastructure is crumbling as
it is, as dramatically illustrated by the bridge collapse in the Twin
Cities awhile back. Construction workers are among the groups hardest
hit on the unemployment front, with much more pain to come as
Commercial Real Estate is about to slow down big time. So, let's cut
off the funds to repair our highways and throw more people out of
work: Brilliant!

   The stupidity of the idea goes much further than that. If demand
for a product is high, and the supply is limited, particularly in the
short term, then eliminating a tax on the product will not cause the
price to come down significantly, it will just mean that to sellers
will get higher margins. In the short term the supply is very much
fixed. Refineries always run flat out during the summer to make as
much gasoline as they can. They have some flexibility in the spring
and fall months to adjust their mix of product, but that inventory
building season is just about done now.

   To the extent that prices do come down they will simply stimulate
higher demand (or prevent demand from falling). Given our country's
dependence on imported oil, and all the economic and national security
considerations that go along with it, this is exactly the opposite of
what we need. Not to mention that higher gas demand means more carbon
in the atmosphere, eventually dooming the entire planet.

   Sen. Clinton has gone along with the proposal, although she wants
to slap a windfall profits tax on the oil companies to make up for the
shortfall in the highway trust fund. This addresses some of the
concerns, but defining what exactly are windfall profits is a task
akin to judging the number of angels dancing on the head of a pin.

   Imposing such a tax for only a few months is, in a word, silly,
and will never get through Congress by Memorial Day. In any case, it
is not that refiners are making huge profits, the crack spread has
been very low recently. This is not energy policy, it is political
pandering at its absolute worst.

   The problem is in the price of crude, which the oil companies have
no control over. Given the difficulty in finding new supplies and
raising global production, get used to high crude oil prices, they
will be with us for a long time. The only way that prices will come
down is if global demand for oil stops growing. However, it is
unlikely that demand from China, India, or domestically in OPEC
countries is going to fall anytime soon.

   Yes, oil prices have been pulling back in recent days as the
dollar has rebounded a bit on hopes that the Fed is done with rate
cuts. I would be surprised if we go lower than the most recent low in
the high $90's. After this low we are likely to see another new high
above the most recent high of around $120.

   Use any weakness in oil stocks caused by this pull back to add to
you positions in quality companies. For conservative investors, Exxon
(NYSE: XOM) and Conoco (NYSE: COP) look like good bets, even if XOM
did disappoint this morning due to downstream weakness (see comment
above about the refineries). Internationally Petrobras (NYSE: PBR) is
sitting on the most significant new oil discovery in recent decades
and looks like a good bet.

   More aggressive investors might want to look at some of the E
companies, such as Chesapeake (NYSE: CHK). Another good way to play
things is through the oil service and drilling companies such as
Transocean (NYSE: RIG).

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the world's biggest 
drugmaker, is to invest 190 million euros ($297 million) 
establishing a new biotech plant in Ireland for the production 
of experimental medicines, it said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The facility, which will create around 100 permanent jobs 
over three years, will develop and produce small-scale 
quantities of products for Phase II and III clinical trials. 
Some 500 people will also be employed during construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the first time that Pfizer has placed such internal 
biopharmaceutical clinical development outside the United 
States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The facility at Shanbally in County Cork will be located on 
a site adjacent to Pfizer's existing operation in Ringaskiddy 
and will be completed by the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nat Ricciardi of Pfizer Global Manufacturing said the 
investment reflected the U.S. group's determination to become a 
leader in biotech medicine, which is a growing focus for many 
drug companies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ben Hirschler; Editing by Erica Billingham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded the European
retail sector to "underweight" and personal and household goods
sector to "neutral", saying it had a more bearish view of food
price inflation in the retail sector, and the ability of food
retailers to pass this inflation on to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It cited a deteriorating outlook of consumer spending for
its downgrade of the personal and household goods sector, along
with input cost pressures increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, however, upgraded the basic resources sector to
"overweight" from "neutral" and said it expected commodity
prices to stay high through 2009, despite a global slowdown on
the back of supply-related issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said there may be further dividend cuts in
the banking sector and added that it expected the sector to
underperform due to weak profit growth and valuations, which
have not adjusted back to levels seen in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it viewed the European insurance sector as the
most attractive in the financials space, citing attractive
fundamental valuation.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) posted a 
$10.89 billion first-quarter profit on Thursday, but still 
managed to disappoint investors as weak production volumes and 
low refining margins blunted the impact of record-high crude 
prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Earnings rose 17 percent year over year, and were the 
second-highest in U.S. history, but still fell short of Wall 
Street expectations, and its shares dropped 3.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's near-record profits brought sharpened scrutiny from 
politicians and consumer groups, who are upset about sky-high 
gasoline prices at the pump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Benchmark U.S. oil prices averaged a record of nearly $98 a 
barrel during the quarter, up about 70 percent from a year 
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon posted record earnings of $40.6 billion in 2007, with 
revenue higher than the gross domestic product of Turkey, the 
world's 17th-largest economy. If oil prices stay above or 
around $100 for the remainder of 2008, the company could beat 
that mark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A steep drop in profit margins for gasoline cut into 
Exxon's earnings as the company, like other refiners, struggled 
to pass on higher crude costs to customers. First-quarter 
gasoline prices rose 33 percent year over year in the United 
States -- less than half crude's rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's oil and gas production also fell 5.6 percent in the 
quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chris MacDonald, portfolio manager at WHG Funds, said the 
production decline was "kind of shocking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It makes the future seem kind of dire, because this 
quarter they really got bailed out by high oil prices ... It 
kind of shows that you're at the limit of big new finds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has been criticized by analysts and investors 
for laying back on capital spending while going full bore on 
share buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spent $31.8 billion to buy back shares in 2007, while 
shelling out $20.9 billion for capital expenditures. In 2008, 
the company expects to increase its capital spending to around 
$25 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems that they are more of a share buyback machine 
that also happens to produce energy," MacDonald said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, European oil majors BP Plc (BP.L) and 
Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) posted big first-quarter 
earnings gains as the crude oil surge was an even bigger boon 
for them than expected. Both companies had flat production 
during the quarter.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REVENUE OF $117 BILLION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest publicly traded company earned $2.03 a 
share in the first quarter, up from net income of $9.28 
billion, or $1.62 a share, in the same period last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But analysts, on average, expected profit of $2.11, 
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose to $116.85 billion from $87.22 billion. The 
company also had a whopping 49 percent effective income tax 
rate in the quarter, up from 44 percent last year, which also 
weighed on earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings at its exploration and production segment 
increased 45 percent to $8.79 billion, while refining profits 
dropped 39 percent to $1.17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said its production shortfall resulted in part 
from production-sharing contracts that give host countries a 
larger share of oil and gas produced as commodity prices rise. 
The decline of older fields and the loss of operations that 
were nationalized by Venezuela last year also hurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon reached a deal with a Nigerian oil union on Thursday 
after an eight-day old strike had shut down virtually all of 
the 800,000 barrels per day of production in the country, which 
could hit the company's second-quarter output figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The question is going to come, and you always have to ask 
it every year: Are they seeing any acceleration in mature field 
declines? Because slowly the majors are beginning to see this 
to some degree," said James Halloran, energy analyst with 
National City Private Client Group in Cleveland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Halloran is concerned because very little of the volume 
shortfall appears to be one-time items such as maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earnings at Exxon's chemicals unit dropped 17 percent to 
$1.03 billion.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'DEVASTATING CHOICES'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is something seriously wrong with our economy when 
Exxon's record $11 billion in quarterly profits are seen as a 
disappointment by Wall Street," Democratic presidential 
hopeful, New York Sen. Hillary Clinton, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But on Main Street, middle-class families are facing 
devastating choices every day between buying groceries and 
filling up their gas tanks to get to work."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon shares closed down $3.37 at $89.70 on the New York 
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock is off more than 4 percent this year, 
underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index 
.OIX, which is nearly flat over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Euan Rocha in New York)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Andre Grenon/Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Thursday that walking away from a deal with Yahoo remained one of "three big options" the company is weighing and to expect an announcement shortly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither side would comment on whether they were seeking a last-minute deal before Microsoft makes good on its threat to turn its unsolicited bid, currently worth $42.4 billion, into a hostile takeover battle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Wall Street Journal reported late on Thursday that Microsoft appeared to be leaning toward going hostile in its pursuit of the Internet company, citing people familiar with the matter. An announcement could come on Friday, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in a sign that Yahoo continues to resist Microsoft's embrace, a source familiar with discussions between Yahoo and Google Inc (GOOG.O) said a partnership could come as early as next week. The non-exclusive partnership would involve Yahoo carrying Google advertising alongside Yahoo's Web search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a partnership would not preclude a deal with Microsoft, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer told employees during a regularly scheduled company Town Hall meeting that Yahoo is valuable as part of a strategy to beat Microsoft arch-rival Google, but there are limits on the price Microsoft is ready to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo's not a strategy, it's a part of a strategy," Ballmer declared. His remarks were first reported by Silicon Alley Insider, whose reporter said he monitored the internal conference call. A company spokesman confirmed the comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're interested to pay for it at some level and beyond that level we're not willing to pay for it. I know exactly what Yahoo is worth to me ... I won't go a dime above and I will go to what I think it's worth if that gets the deal done," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THREE OPTIONS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has promised this would be the week that it spells out its next moves if Yahoo allowed a deadline set for last Saturday to expire on its three-month-old offer to buy Yahoo for $31 per share in cash and stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seeking to force Yahoo to the negotiating table in early April, Ballmer wrote a letter to Yahoo's board of directors threatening to cut the bid and mount a proxy fight to remove the board if Yahoo did not reach a deal by April 26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer went further last week by saying Microsoft was considering walking away from the deal. But most Wall Street analysts dismiss this as a hardball negotiating tactic rather than a real threat to end its two-year-long pursuit of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, five days after Microsoft's deadline for reaching a negotiated deal expired, Ballmer told employees "we ought to announce something in very short order."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've got basically the three big options in front of us," Ballmer summarized. "There's the friendly deal, there's an unfriendly deal, (and the) third path is simply to walk away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies are in a standoff over price.

&lt;p&gt; By Anupreeta Das and Eric Auchard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO May 1 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Thursday that walking
away from a deal with Yahoo remained one of "three big options"
the company is weighing and to expect an announcement shortly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither side would comment on whether they were seeking a
last-minute deal before Microsoft makes good on its threat to

spells out its next moves if Yahoo allowed a deadline set for
last Saturday to expire on its three-month-old offer to buy
Yahoo for $31 per share in cash and stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seeking to force Yahoo to the negotiating table in early
April, Ballmer wrote a letter to Yahoo's board of directors

&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK (Reuters) - Shares in Esso (Thailand), a Thai unit of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), are expected to jump 30 percent on their debut on Tuesday as investors snap up a cheaply-valued IPO at a time when world oil prices have surged to record highs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A strong debut could lay the ground for what is expected to be a busy year for fund raising in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Esso (ESSO.BK) raised $294 million last month in Thailand's largest initial public offering so far this year, selling about 27 percent of the firm at 10 baht ($0.32) a share, near the lower end of an indicative range of 9.0-13.0 baht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sale, valuing the company at about $1.1 billion, pegged it at 5.7 times 2008 estimated profit, versus 7.5 for top refiner Thai Oil (TOP.BK), and 8 for Singapore Petroleum&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPCS.SI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It should go as high as 13 baht, the high end of the IPO price range, but the stock will be volatile," said KTB Securities strategist Supakorn Sujirattanavimol.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies due to list include utility Thai Tap Water, which is set to raise $142 million in an IPO this month and Star Petroleum Refining Co of Chevron (CVX.N) and PTT PCL (PTT.BK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The main Thai stock index .SETI has fallen 2.4 percent this year but is still Southeast Asia's best performing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proceeds from the Esso Thai IPO were lower than the previously announced $350 million because the Finance Ministry, which owns 12.5 percent of Esso, decided to sell only 5 percent in the IPO instead of its entire stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The country's second-biggest mobile operator Total Access Communication (DTAC.BK) raised $257 million in Thailand's largest IPO in 2007, but regulatory worries dampened its debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surging oil prices helped Esso's net profit quadruple in 2007, but analysts expect profits to drop this year as the industry heads into a downward cycle in the second half when new capacity hits the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Esso earnings this year should not be exciting. Last year, its refining margin was quite high compared with a very low base in 2006," said Vichitr Kuladejkhuna of DBS Vickers Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Refining margins at Asian complex refineries averaged $6.95 a barrel in January-March dipping from $7.73 in the previous quarter, according to Reuters data. Esso's 2007 refining margin rose to $7.29 a barrel from $3.38 in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Thai Oil and PTTAR PTTAR.BK, Esso, which refines 177,000 barrels per day (bpd), or 16 percent of Thailand's total, has no major capacity expansion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 31.70 Baht)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Wilawan Pongpitak; Editing by Anshuman Daga)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Roy Bostock, Chairman of Yahoo! Inc. (Nasdaq:YHOO), a leading
global Internet company issued the following statement today in
response to Microsoft Corporation's announcement that it has withdrawn
its proposal to acquire Yahoo!:

   "We remain focused on maximizing shareholder value and pursuing
strategic opportunities that position Yahoo! for success and
leadership in its markets. From the beginning of this process, our
independent board and our management have been steadfast in our belief
that Microsoft's offer undervalued the company and we are pleased that
so many of our shareholders joined us in expressing that view. Yahoo!
is profitable, growing, and executing well on its strategic plan to
capture the large opportunities in the relatively young online
advertising market. Our solid results for the first quarter of 2008
and increased full year 2008 operating cash flow outlook reflect the
progress the company is making. Today, Yahoo! has:

   --  a refined strategic focus to drive enhanced volume and yield;

   --  reorganized to focus its efforts on its most promising
        products and services;

   --  invested in innovations designed to revolutionize display
        advertising and facilitate closing the competitive gap in
        search; and

   --  enhanced expense and resource management to support improved
        profitability."

   Jerry Yang, co-founder and chief executive officer, Yahoo! Inc.
added, "I am incredibly proud of the way our team has come together
over the last three months. This process has underscored our unique
and valuable strategic position. With the distraction of Microsoft's
unsolicited proposal now behind us, we will be able to focus all of
our energies on executing the most important transition in our history
so that we can maximize our potential to the benefit of our
shareholders, employees, partners and users."

&lt;p&gt;"We can only speculate how deep and how long the recession in the United States will really be and how that in turn will impact banks," James Dimon told "Welt am Sonntag".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But we are not done with the crisis for a long time," Dimon said, adding that it was not the company's job to make bets on the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Imagine we would need to walk up to our shareholders one day and say, sorry but the recession in the USA is so bad, we're broke. We need to be able to rule out at all times that it will not come to that," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said last month it was on the lookout for regional banks to take over but Dimon said in the report the bank was not interested in purchasing the German consumer lending business of Citigroup Inc. (C.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From my point of view today a takeover like that would be a waste of time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan announced in March it is buying investment bank Bear Stearns BSC.N, once the fifth-largest investment bank, which collapsed after a run on the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon hopes the transaction to be concluded by June 30, earlier than expected, the report quoted him as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nicola Leske)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Yang e-mail)  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michele Gershberg and Anupreeta Das&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO May 4 (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc
(YHOO.O) faced growing pressure on Sunday to find an
alternative strategy to Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $47.5 billion
takeover offer after the software maker walked away over a
disagreement on price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares could fall by more than 30 percent on Monday
over the breakdown of talks, but that drop could be softened if
Wall Street believes Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang has
another strategy up his sleeve, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is likely to push for an advertising partnership with
Web search leader Google Inc (GOOG.O), sources familiar with
the matter said. A tie-up with Google, seen as a big winner
from the end of Microsoft-Yahoo talks, should help boost
Yahoo's operating performance in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's time to get a move on with Google," said Jeffrey
Lindsay, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. "Let's hope they
weren't bluffing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is also still considering a deal with another
Internet media and advertising major, such as Time Warner Inc's
(TWX.N) AOL, people familiar with the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Yang and the company he helped create could face a
flood of shareholder lawsuits or other actions if nothing
materializes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are two things that could support the stock: the
potential for Microsoft to return and the potential to do a
Google deal," said Clayton Moran, analyst at Stanford Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moran said Yahoo shares could fall to the mid- to low-$20
range on Monday from their $28.67 close last week. Other
analysts said it could slip closer to $19.18, where it closed
on Jan. 31, a day before Microsoft made its offer public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares are likely to rise on Monday, with its
investors relieved that Chief Executive Steve Ballmer didn't
shell out billions more for Yahoo, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft on Saturday sweetened its initial $31-per-share
offer for Yahoo to $33, but then withdrew from the talks when
Yang dug in for a price of $37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang maintains that even the higher offer did not value
Yahoo properly for its investment in search technology, its
prominence in online display advertising and other assets. On
Sunday, he sought to shore up that sentiment among employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have a spirit and a culture that is uniquely Yahoo,"
Yang said in an email to staff that was viewed by Reuters.
"Staying true to who we are has helped us pull through the
recent uncertainty we've faced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHAREHOLDER CHALLENGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While some Yahoo investors hoped it could wrest a price of
$35 per share from Microsoft, a dissident shareholder said he
would challenge Yang and the board over the collapse of talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Shareholders didn't even get a chance to vote on the deal,
but the board negotiated on our behalf and not in good faith,"
Eric Jackson, who leads a group of investors who collectively
own 2 million Yahoo shares, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said he would urge shareholders to withhold votes from
the company's directors this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernstein's Lindsay estimates Yahoo could be worth up to
$35 per share with a Google deal, and even $37 with more job
cuts, but that drops to $25 per share if no partnerships are in
the offing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo has conducted tests with Google to outsource some of
its search listings to its arch-rival. It has also held talks
in tandem with AOL and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source familiar with the matter said on Sunday that the
News Corp talks had cooled in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It increasingly appears like Yahoo will pursue a Google
search partnership," said Moran, who said he still favored a
Microsoft buyout. "Given Google's position (in the market), a
partnership with them cedes control and limits the long-term
value creation for Yahoo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BALLMER'S WARNING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer portrayed Yahoo's options as particularly stark in
a letter to Yang detailing his reasons for pulling back, and
suggested any Google tie-up would preclude a Microsoft deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and Google are increasingly competing on the same
turf, such as Web-based applications, email and messaging. The
proposed Yahoo purchase was meant to create a fiercer rival to
Google and challenge its hold on Internet advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The real winner in all of this seems to be Google," said
Canaccord Adams analyst Colin Gillis. "There's going to be no
powerful number two" in the Web market, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gillis rated Yahoo a "buy" with a $35 price target before
the deal talks with Microsoft collapsed. "We were very clear
that was not based on fundamentals," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer also warned Yahoo that it would give up its
relationship with advertisers by coordinating with Google and
could lose some of its best engineering talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts disputed that idea, saying Yahoo's operating
results would certainly benefit from a Google partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other Google partners, including IAC/InterActiveCorp's
(IACI.O) Ask.com, have structured deals that keep them in
control of their advertiser ties, Bernstein's Lindsay said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc faced growing pressure on Sunday to find an alternative strategy to Microsoft Corp's $47.5 billion takeover offer after the software maker walked away over a disagreement on price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares could fall by more than 30 percent on Monday over the breakdown of talks, but that drop could be softened if Wall Street believes Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang has another strategy up his sleeve, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is likely to push for an advertising partnership with Web search leader Google Inc, sources familiar with the matter said. A tie-up with Google, seen as a big winner from the end of Microsoft-Yahoo talks, should help boost Yahoo's operating performance in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's time to get a move on with Google," said Jeffrey Lindsay, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. "Let's hope they weren't bluffing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is also still considering a deal with another Internet media and advertising major, such as Time Warner Inc's AOL, people familiar with the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Yang and the company he helped create could face a flood of shareholder lawsuits or other actions if nothing materializes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are two things that could support the stock: the potential for Microsoft to return and the potential to do a Google deal," said Clayton Moran, analyst at Stanford Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moran said Yahoo shares could fall to the mid- to low-$20 range on Monday from their $28.67 close last week. Other analysts said it could slip closer to $19.18, where it closed on January 31, a day before Microsoft made its offer public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares are likely to rise on Monday, with its investors relieved that Chief Executive Steve Ballmer didn't shell out billions more for Yahoo, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Saturday sweetened its initial $31-per-share offer for Yahoo to $33, but then withdrew from the talks when Yang dug in for a price of $37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHAREHOLDER CHALLENGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While some Yahoo investors hoped it could wrest a price closer to $35 per share from Microsoft, a dissident shareholder said he would challenge Yang and the board over the collapse of talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shareholders didn't even get a chance to vote on the deal, but the board negotiated on our behalf and not in good faith," Eric Jackson, who leads a group of investors who collectively own 2 million Yahoo shares, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he would urge shareholders to withhold votes from the company's directors this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo officials were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bernstein's Lindsay estimates Yahoo could be worth up to $35 per share with a Google deal, and even $37 with more job cuts, but that drops to $25 per share if no partnerships are in the offing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has conducted tests with Google to outsource some of its search listings to its arch-rival. It has also held talks in tandem with AOL and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the matter said on Sunday that the News Corp talks had cooled in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It increasingly appears like Yahoo will pursue a Google search partnership," said Moran, who said he still favored a Microsoft buyout. "Given Google's position (in the market), a partnership with them cedes control and limits the long-term value creation for Yahoo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BALLMER'S WARNING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer portrayed Yahoo's options as particularly stark in a letter to Yang detailing his reasons for pulling back, and suggested any Google tie-up would preclude a Microsoft deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Google are increasingly competing on the same turf, such as Web-based applications, email and messaging. The proposed Yahoo purchase was meant to create a fiercer rival to Google and challenge its hold on Internet advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The real winner in all of this seems to be Google," said Canaccord Adams analyst Colin Gillis. "There's going to be no powerful number two" in the Web market, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillis rated Yahoo a "buy" with a $35 price target before the deal talks with Microsoft collapsed.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds dissident shareholder, analyst, SAN FRANCISCO dateline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michele Gershberg and Anupreeta Das&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO May 4 (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc
(YHOO.O) faced growing pressure on Sunday to find an
alternative strategy to Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $47.5 billion
takeover offer after the software maker walked away over a
disagreement on price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares could fall by more than 30 percent on Monday
over the breakdown of talks, but that drop could be softened if
Wall Street believes Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang has
another strategy up his sleeve, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is likely to push for an advertising partnership with
Web search leader Google Inc (GOOG.O), sources familiar with
the matter said. A tie-up with Google, seen as a big winner
from the end of Microsoft-Yahoo talks, should help boost
Yahoo's operating performance in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's time to get a move on with Google," said Jeffrey
Lindsay, analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein. "Let's hope they
weren't bluffing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is also still considering a deal with another
Internet media and advertising major, such as Time Warner Inc's
(TWX.N) AOL, people familiar with the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Yang and the company he helped create could face a
flood of shareholder lawsuits or other actions if nothing
materializes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are two things that could support the stock: the
potential for Microsoft to return and the potential to do a
Google deal," said Clayton Moran, analyst at Stanford Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moran said Yahoo shares could fall to the mid- to low-$20
range on Monday from their $28.67 close last week. Other
analysts said it could slip closer to $19.18, where it closed
on Jan. 31, a day before Microsoft made its offer public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares are likely to rise on Monday, with its
investors relieved that Chief Executive Steve Ballmer didn't
shell out billions more for Yahoo, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft on Saturday sweetened its initial $31-per-share
offer for Yahoo to $33, but then withdrew from the talks when
Yang dug in for a price of $37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHAREHOLDER CHALLENGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While some Yahoo investors hoped it could wrest a price
closer to $35 per share from Microsoft, a dissident shareholder
said he would challenge Yang and the board over the collapse of
talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Shareholders didn't even get a chance to vote on the deal,
but the board negotiated on our behalf and not in good faith,"
Eric Jackson, who leads a group of investors who collectively
own 2 million Yahoo shares, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said he would urge shareholders to withhold votes from
the company's directors this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo officials were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bernstein's Lindsay estimates Yahoo could be worth up to
$35 per share with a Google deal, and even $37 with more job
cuts, but that drops to $25 per share if no partnerships are in
the offing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo has conducted tests with Google to outsource some of
its search listings to its arch-rival. It has also held talks
in tandem with AOL and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source familiar with the matter said on Sunday that the
News Corp talks had cooled in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It increasingly appears like Yahoo will pursue a Google
search partnership," said Moran, who said he still favored a
Microsoft buyout. "Given Google's position (in the market), a
partnership with them cedes control and limits the long-term
value creation for Yahoo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BALLMER'S WARNING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer portrayed Yahoo's options as particularly stark in
a letter to Yang detailing his reasons for pulling back, and
suggested any Google tie-up would preclude a Microsoft deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and Google are increasingly competing on the same
turf, such as Web-based applications, email and messaging. The
proposed Yahoo purchase was meant to create a fiercer rival to
Google and challenge its hold on Internet advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The real winner in all of this seems to be Google," said
Canaccord Adams analyst Colin Gillis. "There's going to be no

the deal talks with Microsoft collapsed. "We were very clear
that was not based on fundamentals," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer also warned Yahoo that it would give up its
relationship with advertisers by coordinating with Google and
could lose some of its best engineering talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts disputed that idea, saying Yahoo's operating
results would certainly benefit from a Google partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other Google partners, including IAC/InterActiveCorp's
(IACI.O) Ask.com, have structured deals that keep them in
control of their advertiser ties, Bernstein's Lindsay said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street could extend gains this week if financial results from market bellwethers such as Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and data suggest the U.S economic slowdown is not as dire as once feared.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, Saturday's decision by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to end its bid to buy Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) after the Internet company turned down its offer to raise the price by $5 billion to $47.5 billion could be a net positive for stocks on Monday, with the news expected to drive up heavily weighted Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo, which analysts said overplayed its hand, are likely to fall when trading resumes on Monday after rising nearly 7 percent to $28.67 on Friday on hopes of an agreement between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall, it's a modest positive for the market, because of Microsoft's weighting in the Nasdaq composite and the SP," said Fred Dickson, market strategist, director of retail research, D.A.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with comments, more details on Yahoo/Microsoft
development)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 4 (Reuters) - Wall Street could extend gains
this week if financial results from market bellwethers such as
Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) and data suggest the U.S  economic
slowdown is not as dire as once feared.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, Saturday's decision by Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to end
its bid to buy Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) after the Internet company
turned down its offer to raise the price by $5 billion to $47.5
billion could be a net positive for stocks on Monday, with the
news expected to drive up heavily weighted Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Yahoo, which analysts said overplayed its hand,
are likely to fall when trading resumes on Monday after rising
nearly 7 percent to $28.67 on Friday on hopes of an agreement
between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Overall, it's a modest positive for the market, because of
Microsoft's weighting in the Nasdaq composite and the SP,"
said Fred Dickson, market strategist, director of retail
research, D.A. Davidson  Co. Lake Oswego, Oregon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are enough skeptics out in Wall Street land that
were really questioning Microsoft's strategy, and they will
applaud Microsoft for basically holding firm to fact they had a
price in mind, and they're not going to overpay."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also this week, economic reports are expected to shed light
on the vast services sector, housing and productivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also high on the agenda will be a speech on Monday by
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on mortgage delinquencies
and foreclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors will have a batch of earnings reports to sift
through as they also gauge the outlook for an economy battered
by a housing slump and record oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There needs to be more proof, either in economic data or
continued strong earnings reports, to be able to move us
significantly higher," said Michael James, senior trader at
regional investment bank Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recent reports, including Friday's government release on
April payrolls, helped calm worries about the economy's slump,
sending major indexes to levels last seen in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market also moved upward on another rate cut by the Fed
on Wednesday, a pullback in commodity prices and a rebound by
the dollar. But how long this bullish scenario will play is

will be a topic of discussion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our analyst's estimate is he wouldn't be surprised to see
Yahoo drop $10 on the walkout, and Microsoft go up $2 or $3,"
he said. In the Nasdaq composite, Microsoft has roughly six
times the weighting that Yahoo does.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Web search leader Google Inc (GOOG.O) could also see a
boost, as the news may decrease the chances of Yahoo
strengthening, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP TOPS 1,400&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week the SP 500 .SPX rose above the psychologically
important 1,400 and the Dow surpassed 13,000 as investors
snapped up financial and technology shares, two of the
worst-hit areas previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a sign of investors' skittishness, Friday's trading
started with big gains that later faded on a slide in shares of

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) -Microsoft Corp dropped its bid to buy Yahoo Inc after the Internet company rejected its offer to raise the price by $5 billion to $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is a statement from Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock on Saturday in response to Microsoft's move:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We remain focused on maximizing shareholder value and pursuing strategic opportunities that position Yahoo! for success and leadership in its markets. From the beginning of this process, our independent board and our management have been steadfast in our belief that Microsoft's offer undervalued the company and we are pleased that so many of our shareholders joined us in expressing that view. Yahoo! is profitable, growing, and executing well on its strategic plan to capture the large opportunities in the relatively young online advertising market. Our solid results for the first quarter of 2008 and increased full year 2008 operating cash flow outlook reflect the progress the company is making. Today, Yahoo! has:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- a refined strategic focus to drive enhanced volume and yield;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- reorganized to focus its efforts on its most promising&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;products and services;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- invested in innovations designed to revolutionize display advertising and facilitate closing the competitive gap in search; and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- enhanced expense and resource management to support improved profitability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo Co-founder and Chief Executive Officer Jerry Yang said:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am incredibly proud of the way our team has come together over the last three months. This process has underscored our unique and valuable strategic position. With the distraction of Microsoft's unsolicited proposal now behind us, we will be able to focus all of our energies on executing the most important transition in our history so that we can maximize our potential to the benefit of our shareholders, employees, partners and users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Tiffany Wu and Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 4 (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) faced
growing pressure on Sunday to find an alternative strategy to a
$47.5 billion takeover offer from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) after
the software maker walked away over a major disagreement on
price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yahoo was likely to push for an advertising partnership
with Web search leader Google Inc (GOOG.O) that should help
boost its operating performance in the near term, sources
familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is also still pursuing a deal with another Internet
media and advertising major, such as Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N)
AOL, people familiar with the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The expectation that Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang has
another strategy up his sleeve could help mitigate a steep
descent for the company's shares on Monday, but he will face
angry questions from shareholders if nothing materializes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are two things that could support the stock: the
potential for Microsoft to return and the potential to do a
Google deal," said Clayton Moran, analyst at Stanford Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moran said Yahoo shares could fall to the mid- to low-$20
range on Monday from their $28.67 close last week. That's still
higher than Yahoo's close of $19.18 on Jan. 31, the day before
Microsoft announced its offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft on Saturday sweetened its initial $31-per-share
offer for Yahoo to $33, but then withdrew from the talks when
Yang sought a price of $37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo has been conducting tests with Google to outsource
some of its search listings to its arch-rival. It has also held
talks in tandem with AOL and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp
NWSa.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source familiar with the matter said on Sunday that the
News Corp talks had cooled in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It increasingly appears like Yahoo will pursue a Google
search partnership," said Moran, who said he still favored a
Microsoft buyout. "Given Google's position (in the market), a
partnership with them cedes control and limits the long-term
value creation for Yahoo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BALLMER'S WARNING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer portrayed Yahoo's
options as particularly stark in a letter to Yang, suggesting
any tie-up with Google would preclude a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also warned Yahoo that it would give up its relationship
with advertisers by coordinating with Google and could lose
some of its best engineering talent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts disputed that idea, saying Yahoo's operating
results would certainly benefit from a Google partnership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other Google partners, including IAC/InterActiveCorp's
(IACI.O) Ask.com, have structured deals that keep them in
control of their advertiser ties, said Jeffrey Lindsay of
Sanford C. Bernstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If they operated as an exchange, Yahoo would at least keep
the part that it sold," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lindsay estimates Yahoo could be worth up to $35 per share
if it forges a Google deal, and could nudge that higher to $37
per share with additional job cuts. But if there are no
partnerships in the offing, that value drops to $25 per share,
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's time to get a move on with Google," he said. "Let's
hope they weren't bluffing."

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) does not 
expect the U.S. financial crisis to end soon and will remain 
very cautious, its top executive said in comments published by 
a German weekly on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We can only speculate how deep and how long the recession 
in the United States will really be and how that in turn will 
impact banks," James Dimon told "Welt am Sonntag."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But we are not done with the crisis for a long time," 
Dimon said, adding that it was not the company's job to make 
bets on the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Imagine we would need to walk up to our shareholders one 
day and say, sorry but the recession in the USA is so bad, 
we're broke. We need to be able to rule out at all times that 
it will not come to that," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said last month it was on the lookout for regional 
banks to take over but Dimon said in the report the bank was 
not interested in purchasing the German consumer lending 
business of Citigroup Inc. (C.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From my point of view today a takeover like that would be 
a waste of time," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan announced in March it is buying investment bank 
Bear Stearns BSC.N, once the fifth-largest investment bank, 
which collapsed after a run on the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon hopes the transaction to be concluded by June 30, 
earlier than expected, the report quoted him as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Nicola Leske)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) walked away from
its bid to buy Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) on Saturday after the
Internet company turned down its offer to raise the price by $5
billion to $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following are some key facts about Microsoft:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 1968: Eighth-grader William "Bill" Gates first introduced
to computers and programming languages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Gates and schoolmate, Paul Allen, were inspired by an
article in Popular Electronics magazine about the first
personal computer, the Altair 8800, to develop a version of the
Basic programming language for the PC.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 1973: Gates goes to Harvard University, where he lived
down the hall from Steve Ballmer, now Microsoft's chief
executive officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 1975: 19-year-old Gates drops out of Harvard and
co-founds Microsoft with Allen. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 1980: International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N)
chooses Microsoft to write the operating system for the IBM
personal computer, introduced in 1981.      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 1985: Microsoft launches Windows 1.0, the first version
of the popular operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 1986: Microsoft goes public on March 13 at $21 per
share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 1986: Microsoft moves to corporate campus in Redmond,
Washington.      &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 1989: Microsoft introduces the earliest version of its
Office software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Gates founds stock photography house Corbis, which he
controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 1994: Gates marries Melinda French.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 1994: The Justice Department files suit against
Microsoft, alleging it engaged in anti-competitive marketing
practices. The suit is ended by a 1995 consent decree. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 1997: Microsoft acquires Hotmail, a free Web-based e-mail
service co-founded by Sabeer Bhatia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 1997: The Justice Department again sues Microsoft, this
time alleging contempt of the 1995 consent decree. A lengthy
legal battle over marketing practices results in a 2002
consent decree creating federal government oversight that
expired in November 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 2000: Gates and wife found the Bill and Melinda Gates
Foundation, a charitable organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 2001: Microsoft enters the gaming market in November with
the North American release of its gaming console the Xbox and
competes with Nintendo Co Ltd's 7974.OS Wii and Sony Corp's
(6758.T) PlayStation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 2002: Microsoft and partners launch the tablet PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 2003: The company starts paying dividends in January,
with its first dividend at 8 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 2004: Microsoft said it plans to return up to $75 billion
to shareholders in dividends and stock buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 2004: The European Commission found that Microsoft abused
its dominance and ordered a change in business practices. It
fines the company 497 million euros ($685.4 million), then in
2006 imposes an extra penalty of 280.5 million euros for not
complying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 2005: The South Korean Fair Trade Commission fines
Microsoft $32 million for blocking competition and orders it to
separate its instant messaging system from Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 2006: Gates says will transition out of a day-to-day role
in the company in July 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 2006: Microsoft launches Zune portable music player in
November -- the first Microsoft-designed device in a market
dominated by Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 2007: Launches Windows Vista, the latest version of its
operating system in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * 2007: Acquires aQuantive for $6 billion in May at a time

&lt;p&gt; (Repeating item that initially moved late Saturday with no
changes to text or headline)
 (Adds comments from Yahoo, investor, analyst)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Anupreeta Das&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO May 4 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
walked away from its bid to buy Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) on Saturday
after the Internet company turned down its offer to raise the
price by $5 billion to $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's offer was for $33 a share, but Yahoo would not
lower its demand below $37, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer said. The software company initially bid $31 per share
for Yahoo more than three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the economics demanded by Yahoo do not make
sense for us, and it is in the best interests of Microsoft
stockholders, employees and other stakeholders to withdraw our
proposal," Ballmer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say Yahoo has overplayed its hand and they expect
the Web pioneer's shares to fall as much as 30 percent to $20
levels when Nasdaq trading resumes on Monday. The stock rose
nearly 7 percent to $28.67 on Friday on hopes of an agreement
between Microsoft and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Wow. I'm shocked Yahoo wasn't more reasonable. The stock
will probably go down at least $5 on Monday. It is surprising
that Ballmer walked away instead of trying a hostile bid at
$33," said Walter Price, a senior portfolio manager at RCM fund
management company in San Francisco, which had 21 million
Microsoft shares and 2 million Yahoo shares as of the end of
December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laura Martin, a senior analyst at Soleil Securities, said
she expected a number of shareholder lawsuits against Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Yahoo guys want too much money for their company. We
think $33 a share is fair in the context of the weakening
economic environment and adverse advertising trends," she said.
"They've prioritized employees over shareholders in the hopes
that someday they can create more than $8 billion of value,
even if they have no track record of doing so," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some Wall Street analysts also have said Microsoft could
pull its bid as a negotiating strategy aimed at putting
pressure on Yahoo to eventually accept a future offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOOGLE DEAL NEXT?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock said in a statement the company
believed from the beginning that Microsoft's offer undervalued
it, and the board was "pleased that so many of our shareholders
joined us in expressing that view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Yahoo was pursuing "strategic opportunities" but
gave no details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo has courted possible deals with Time Warner Inc's
(TWX.N) AOL Internet division or News Corp's NWSa.N MySpace
online social network, and tested a search advertising
partnership with Google Inc (GOOG.O). A partnership with Google
may be announced as early as next week, a person with knowledge
of discussions told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With the distraction of Microsoft's unsolicited proposal
now behind us, we will be able to focus all of our energies on
executing the most important transition in our history so that
we can maximize our potential to the benefit of our
shareholders, employees, partners and users," Yahoo co-founder
and Chief Executive Jerry Yang said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jordan Rohan, founder of digital media advisory company
Clearmeadow Partners, said Yahoo could name Time Warner as a
partner or buy AOL to put a positive spin on the situation, but
neither option would give as good a payoff to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yahoo management and board overplayed its hand.
Shareholders were cheated out of a victory," Rohan said. "I
think Yahoo forgot what it felt like to have a share price
under $20. They may be reminded soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer cited Yahoo's Google plans as one reason Microsoft
was walking away rather than mounting a hostile offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We regard with particular concern your apparent planning
to respond to a 'hostile' bid by pursuing a new arrangement
that would involve or lead to the outsourcing to Google of key
paid Internet search terms offered by Yahoo today," Ballmer
said in a letter to Yang, made public on Saturday. "In our
view, such an arrangement with the dominant search provider
would make an acquisition of Yahoo undesirable to us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REALLY WALKING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft wants to buy Yahoo to gain a stronger foothold in
its battle with Google, which is expanding rapidly into the
software maker's own turf with new Web-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology analysts say Microsoft may not really walk away
from Yahoo, and Saturday's move could parallel Oracle Corp's
ORCL.O strategy in winning over BEA Systems Inc BEAS.O.
Oracle pulled its offer in October 2007, leading BEA shares to
fall 6 percent. Despite the tough talk, the companies reached
an agreement in January this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Microsoft has not succeeded in sealing a deal,
tough talk by Ballmer has already brought Yahoo to the
negotiating table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a person familiar with Microsoft's thinking,
Yahoo's advisers said initially it would not negotiate with
Microsoft for anything less than $40 a share. But amid threats
by Microsoft to launch a hostile takeover, Yang suggested a
price of $38 a share, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Saturday, Yang and Yahoo co-founder David Filo met
Ballmer and Microsoft's Platforms  Services Division President
Kevin Johnson in Seattle, where they communicated that Yahoo's
board was willing to cut a deal at $37 a share, although the
two co-founders remained committed to a dollar more per share,
the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Price was not the only stumbling block, another person
familiar with the discussions said. Microsoft had also failed
to respond adequately to antitrust regulatory concerns that
Yahoo raised at several meetings, said the source who was not
authorized to speak on the record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo also wanted "value-certainty" assurances the value of
Microsoft's offer would remain the same when the deal, if it
did get done, closed, the person said.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - After three months of waiting, the end of Microsoft Corp's pursuit of Yahoo Inc ended in a rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flurry of last-minute talks between the heads of the software and Internet giants preceded Saturday's decision by Microsoft to end its effort to buy Yahoo, said three people familiar with the talks, who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo co-founders Jerry Yang and David Filo flew to Seattle to meet Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and his lieutenant Kevin Johnson on Saturday morning, where they indicated Yahoo could do a deal at $37 a share, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the last face-to-face meeting of a busy week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's deadline to Yahoo to reach a deal or prepare to face a hostile takeover passed without incident a week ago on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the following Tuesday, Yang and Roy Bostock, the chairman of Yahoo's board, called Ballmer twice, urging the Microsoft CEO not to make good on his threat to go hostile or walk away, a person familiar with Microsoft's thinking said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, Wednesday Apr 30, Ballmer flew to Palo Alto, Calif., for a meeting with Yang near Yahoo's Sunnyvale headquarters, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang had long said that Microsoft's cash-and-stock offer, originally worth $31, was not enough. On Wednesday he informally told Ballmer that Yahoo could go for less than $40 a share, a price previously tossed out as a possibility -- but never formally quoted -- in meetings between advisers on both sides, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo indicated that "below $40, there could be a lot of debate," one person close to the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But price wasn't the only stumbling block, two people familiar with the negotiations said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an Apr 15 meeting in Portland, Oregon, Yahoo had also raised regulatory concerns about a potential merger, and pressed for "value-certainty" -- assurances that the value of Microsoft's offer would remain the same when the deal, if it did get done, closed, one of the two people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent days, Microsoft had indicated the possibility it could raise its offer by a "couple of dollars", but did not formally make a higher offer to Yahoo, one of the people involved in the discussions said. Neither did it address Yahoo's concerns adequately, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite harsh talk in public letters over the last few months, the two sides were cordial in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It didn't end with any acrimony," the source said. "Ballmer knew there was only one way to acquire Yahoo, and that was on a friendly basis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News that talks had heightened leaked on Friday evening, but both sides were being careful about what they promised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo insiders were also debating what price would be acceptable. Yang and Filo personally felt they could not go below $38, but the board Yang led was ready to sell the shop for $1-a-share less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the two men flew to Seattle on Saturday morning, they gave the board's price, and their own reservations, two people briefed on the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer finally came out with his raised offer -- $33 a share, compared with the initial offer worth $31 a share and about $29 a share at the end of last week. "Today for the first time Ballmer said $33," the source said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer and Johnson, Microsoft's Platforms  Services Division President, failed to reach a deal with Yang and Filo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filo and Yang flew back to California, expecting a counter-offer to their $37 price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Ballmer called Yang to inform him Microsoft was withdrawing its offer, and followed up with an official letter sent on Saturday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sides made the best of the circumstances, arguing they could do well without the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without the distraction of Microsoft's unsolicited proposal now behind us, we will be able to focus all of our energies on executing the most important transition in our history," Yang said in a public statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the acquisition of Yahoo would have accelerated our ability to deliver on our strategy in advertising and online services, I remain confident that we can achieve our goals without Yahoo," Ballmer said in a letter to employees, obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between the two companies could still resume if circumstances change, said one person familiar with the negotiations. But that won't be soon, the person added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Todd Eastham and Louise Heavens)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp walked away from its bid to buy Yahoo Inc on Saturday after the Internet company turned down its offer to raise the price by $5 billion to $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is the letter from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer ending talks. It was released by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 3, 2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jerry Yang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO and Chief Yahoo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;701 First Avenue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunnyvale, CA 94089&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Jerry:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After over three months, we have reached the conclusion of the process regarding a possible combination of Microsoft and Yahoo!.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first want to convey my personal thanks to you, your management team, and Yahoo!'s Board of Directors for your consideration of our proposal. I appreciate the time and attention all of you have given to this matter, and I especially appreciate the time that you have invested personally. I feel that our discussions this week have been particularly useful, providing me for the first time with real clarity on what is and is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am disappointed that Yahoo! has not moved towards accepting our offer. I first called you with our offer on January 31 because I believed that a combination of our two companies would have created real value for our respective shareholders and would have provided consumers, publishers, and advertisers with greater innovation and choice in the marketplace. Our decision to offer a 62 percent premium at that time reflected the strength of these convictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our conversations this week, we conveyed our willingness to raise our offer to $33.00 per share, reflecting again our belief in this collective opportunity. This increase would have added approximately another $5 billion of value to your shareholders, compared to the current value of our initial offer. It also would have reflected a premium of over 70 percent compared to the price at which your stock closed on January 31. Yet it has proven insufficient, as your final position insisted on Microsoft paying yet another $5 billion or more, or at least another $4 per share above our $33.00 offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, after giving this week's conversations further thought, it is clear to me that it is not sensible for Microsoft to take our offer directly to your shareholders. This approach would necessarily involve a protracted proxy contest and eventually an exchange offer. Our discussions with you have led us to conclude that, in the interim, you would take steps that would make Yahoo! undesirable as an acquisition for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We regard with particular concern your apparent planning to respond to a "hostile" bid by pursuing a new arrangement that would involve or lead to the outsourcing to Google of key paid Internet search terms offered by Yahoo! today. In our view, such an arrangement with the dominant search provider would make an acquisition of Yahoo! undesirable to us for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- First, it would fundamentally undermine Yahoo!'s own strategy and long-term viability by encouraging advertisers to use Google as opposed to your Panama paid search system. This would also fragment your search advertising and display advertising strategies and the ecosystem surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would undermine the reliance on your display advertising business to fuel future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Given this, it would impair Yahoo's ability to retain the talented engineers working on advertising systems that are important to our interest in a combination of our companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- In addition, it would raise a host of regulatory and legal problems that no acquirer, including Microsoft, would want to inherit. Among other things, this would consolidate market share with the already-dominant paid search provider in a manner that would reduce competition and choice in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- This would also effectively enable Google to set the prices for key search terms on both their and your search platforms and, in the process, raise prices charged to advertisers on Yahoo. In addition to whatever resulting legal problems, this seems unwise from a business perspective unless in fact one simply wishes to use this as a vehicle to exit the paid search business in favor of Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- It could foreclose any chance of a combination with any other search provider that is not already relying on Google's search services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, your apparent plan to pursue such an arrangement in the event of a proxy contest or exchange offer leads me to the firm decision not to pursue such a path. Instead, I hereby formally withdraw Microsoft's proposal to acquire Yahoo!.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will move forward and will continue to innovate and grow our business at Microsoft with the talented team we have in place and potentially through strategic transactions with other business partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still believe even today that our offer remains the only alternative put forward that provides your stockholders full and fair value for their shares. By failing to reach an agreement with us, you and your stockholders have left significant value on the table. But clearly a deal is not to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for the time we have spent together discussing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely yours,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;/s/ Steven A. Ballmer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven A. Ballmer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corporation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments from Yahoo, investor, analyst)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Anupreeta Das&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO May 3 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
walked away from its bid to buy Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) on Saturday
after the Internet company turned down its offer to raise the
price by $5 billion to $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's offer was for $33 a share but Yahoo would not
lower its demand below $37, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer said. The software company initially bid $31 per share
for Yahoo more than three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the economics demanded by Yahoo do not make
sense for us, and it is in the best interests of Microsoft
stockholders, employees and other stakeholders to withdraw our
proposal," Ballmer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say Yahoo has overplayed its hand and they expect
the Web pioneer's shares to fall as much as 30 percent to $20
levels when Nasdaq trading resumes on Monday. The stock rose
nearly 7 percent to $28.67 on Friday on hopes of an agreement
between Microsoft and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Wow. I'm shocked Yahoo wasn't more reasonable. The stock
will probably go down at least $5 on Monday. It is surprising
that Ballmer walked away instead of trying a hostile bid at
$33," said Walter Price, a senior portfolio manager at RCM fund
management company in San Francisco, which had 21 million
Microsoft shares and 2 million Yahoo shares as of the end of
December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laura Martin, a senior analyst at Soleil Securities, said
she expected a number of shareholder lawsuits against Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Yahoo guys want too much money for their company. We
think $33 a share is fair in the context of the weakening
economic environment and adverse advertising trends," she said.
"They've prioritized employees over shareholders in the hopes
that someday they can create more than $8 billion of value,
even if they have no track record of doing so," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some Wall Street analysts also have said Microsoft could
pull its bid as a negotiating strategy aimed at putting
pressure on Yahoo to eventually accept a future offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOOGLE DEAL NEXT WEEK?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock said in a statement the company
believed from the beginning that Microsoft's offer undervalued
it, and the board was "pleased that so many of our shareholders
joined us in expressing that view."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Yahoo was pursuing "strategic opportunities" but
gave no details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo has courted possible deals with Time Warner Inc's
(TWX.N) AOL Internet division or News Corp's NWSa.N MySpace
online social network, and tested a search advertising
partnership with Google Inc (GOOG.O). A partnership with Google
may be announced as early as next week, a person with knowledge
of discussions told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With the distraction of Microsoft's unsolicited proposal
now behind us, we will be able to focus all of our energies on
executing the most important transition in our history so that
we can maximize our potential to the benefit of our
shareholders, employees, partners and users," Yahoo co-founder
and Chief Executive Jerry Yang said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jordan Rohan, founder of digital media advisory firm
Clearmeadow Partners, said Yahoo could name Time Warner as a
partner or buy AOL to put a positive spin on the situation, but
neither option would give as good a payoff to shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yahoo management and board overplayed its hand.
Shareholders were cheated out of a victory," Rohan said. "I
think Yahoo forgot what it felt like to have a share price
under $20. They may be reminded soon."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer cited Yahoo's Google plans as one reason Microsoft
was walking away rather than mounting a hostile offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We regard with particular concern your apparent planning
to respond to a 'hostile' bid by pursuing a new arrangement
that would involve or lead to the outsourcing to Google of key
paid Internet search terms offered by Yahoo today," Ballmer
said in a letter to Yang, made public on Saturday. "In our
view, such an arrangement with the dominant search provider
would make an acquisition of Yahoo undesirable to us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REALLY WALKING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft wants to buy Yahoo to gain a stronger foothold in
its battle with Google, which is expanding rapidly into the
software maker's own turf with new Web-based applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology analysts say Microsoft may not really walk away
from Yahoo, and Saturday's move could parallel Oracle Corp's
ORCL.O strategy in winning over BEA Systems Inc BEAS.O.
Oracle pulled its offer in October 2007, leading BEA shares to
fall 6 percent. Despite the tough talk, the companies reached
an agreement in January this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Microsoft has not succeeded in sealing a deal,
tough talk by Ballmer has already brought Yahoo to the
negotiating table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a person familiar with Microsoft's thinking,
Yahoo's advisers said initially it would not negotiate with
Microsoft for anything less than $40 a share. But amid threats
by Microsoft to launch a hostile takeover, Yang suggested a
price of $38 a share, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Saturday, Yang and Yahoo co-founder David Filo met
Ballmer and Microsoft's Platforms  Services Division President
Kevin Johnson in Seattle, where they communicated that Yahoo's
board was willing to cut a deal at $37 a share, although the
two co-founders remained committed to a dollar more per share,
the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Price was not the only stumbling block, another person
familiar with the discussions said. Microsoft had also failed
to respond adequately to antitrust regulatory concerns that
Yahoo raised at several meetings, said the source who was not
authorized to speak on the record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo also wanted "value-certainty" assurances the value of
Microsoft's offer would remain the same when the deal, if it
did get done, closed, the person said.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING May 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) broke
ground on Tuesday on a $280 million research centre that is to
become the software giant's largest research centre outside of
the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft plans to double the number of full-time Microsoft
research employees to 3,000 by 2010, in addition to about 1,500
current project-based researchers in China, and the energy
efficient campus will eventually be home to 5,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Through investments such as this, we are building on our

Zhang Yaqin, the company's mainland China chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is growing rapidly in China and expects that
shipments to the mainland of handsets loaded with its software
will again double this fiscal year. Long-delayed third generation
(3G) wireless services are expected to be launched later this
year and could help boost demand.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds investor comment, Google details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michele Gershberg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 5 (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc chief Jerry Yang
signaled a more open stance towards Microsoft Corp on Monday,
saying he had been seeking common ground when the software
maker abruptly ended deal talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang told Reuters in an interview that he had "mixed
feelings" about the weekend outcome, after investors showed
their disappointment over the break-up of negotiations by
sending Yahoo shares down 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We were negotiating a way to find common ground and then
on Saturday they chose to walk away," said the 39-year-old
co-founder of the pioneering Internet company. "They started it
and they walked away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked if Yahoo would still leave a door open for Microsoft
to return, Yang said: "If they have anything new to say, we
would be open. ... I am more than willing to listen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After three months of negotiations, Microsoft CEO Steve
Ballmer raised his offer for Yahoo to $33 per share from an
initial $31, for a total deal value of about $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang held out for $37 per share, saying that even the
sweetened offer did not value Yahoo properly for its Web search
advertising technology, its prominence in selling display ads
and its lucrative overseas holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But its two largest shareholders independently told The New
York Times they would have sold for as little as $34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am extremely angry at Jerry Yang and at the so-called
independent board," Gordon Crawford, portfolio manager for
Capital Research Global Investors, the largest Yahoo
shareholder with some 16 percent of stock, told the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts said Yahoo shares, which dropped $4.30 to end
at $24.37 on Monday, could have fallen 30 percent to closer to
$19.18, its price before Microsoft made its bid public on Feb.
1. But the descent was cushioned by investors who are betting
Microsoft will eventually come back to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is going to play out over the next several months and
there is still a chance Microsoft will buy the company for
somewhere around $33 a share," said Todd Dagres, general
partner at venture capital fund Spark Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A GOOGLE VICTORY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft rose initially on investor relief that
it was not paying billions more for Yahoo, though the stock
ended down slightly amid concerns about how the software maker
would develop its Web strategy in the face of a dominant Google
Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft courted Yahoo to capitalize on the rapidly
growing market for Internet advertising, one that has long been
served by Yahoo's search, e-mail and Web communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is also trying to fend off the expansion of Google,
which has made inroads into Microsoft's home turf with a
portfolio of Web based-applications, e-mail and messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But now that a deal has fallen apart, Google has emerged as
the key beneficiary. Shares in the company rose 2.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Google has just kept their foot on the accelerator," said
Derek Brown, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "Neither Yahoo nor
Microsoft in their current state seems to be a material
competitive threat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is likely to press alternative strategies in coming
weeks, including a search advertising partnership with Google
and a deal for Time Warner Inc's AOL Internet unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Google deal would boost Yahoo's operating performance in
the near term, but runs the risk of regulatory scrutiny over an
alliance between the Internet's top two players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google and Yahoo are hammering out the intricacies of a
potential deal and also are sharing their plans with antitrust
regulators, a person close to Google who was not authorized to
speak publicly on the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a letter to Yang over the weekend, Ballmer warned that
any deal between Yahoo and Google would be difficult to unravel
and would preclude an agreement with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang told Reuters the company would take care to structure
any new efforts to "preserve as much (as possible) long-term
flexibility for Yahoo, both operationally and strategically."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHAREHOLDER PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect a flurry of shareholder lawsuits against
Yahoo, and say it may even face direct pressure on its board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Already, some Yahoo shareholders have started to question
how talks were handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bill Miller, a portfolio manager for Legg Mason, Yahoo's
second-largest shareholder, told the New York Times in a Sunday
interview that he would have considered selling to Microsoft
for $34 or $35 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While that was more than Microsoft's offer, it was less
than the $37 per share Yahoo's board had insisted on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capital Research's Crawford also said investors generally
were looking for Yahoo to sell at $34. He hoped shareholders
pushed Yahoo to revisit the issue but was not optimistic, he
told the newspaper. The company owns about 16 percent of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang, who owns about 4 percent of the company, was expected
to hold a meeting with employees on Tuesday in an effort to
reassure staff in the wake of the Microsoft talks ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang said in a post on the company's blog on Sunday night:
"No one is celebrating about the outcome of these past three
months ... and no one should. We live and work in a competitive
world and the Web is only going to get more competitive.
Executing on our strategic plan is what matters most."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Consumer Support Best Practices Shared at Service and Support Professionals Association Conference

   Awards Given for Technologies that Enable the Essential Elements
of Support
SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
The Service &amp; Support Professionals Association (SSPA), the
largest and most influential association for technology services and
support professionals, today named the winners and finalists of the
Spring 2008 SSPA Recognized Innovator program. Technology and services
vendors were recognized for improving the way companies provide
service and support to their customers in categories representing
three of today's most relevant concerns for services organizations -
Root Cause Analysis, Voice of the Customer, and Usability.

   The Spring 2008 SSPA Recognized Innovators are:

   Innovation in Root Cause Analysis

   --  Winner: InQuira

   --  Finalist: NextNine

   Innovation in Voice of the Customer

   --  Winner: IBM

   --  Finalist: Clarabridge

   Innovation in Usability

   --  Winner: Microsoft

   --  Finalist: InQuira

   The honorees were selected by a panel of judges that included
industry experts, SSPA members and SSPA Vice President of Technology
Research John Ragsdale, and were honored today at the SSPA Best
Practices 2008 Conference in Santa Clara, California.

   "While all of the nominees were stellar, we ultimately identified
these six solutions as the embodiment of innovation and for uniquely
and successfully advancing services delivery in each of the three
categories that reflect areas in which our members are looking for new
approaches," said Ragsdale.

   "It is a pleasure to honor organizations that are creating
innovative solutions for customer service and support. With such focus
in our industry today on consolidation, examples of true innovation
are few and far between," he added.

   The SSPA Spring 2008 Recognized Innovator Awards were evaluated on
the following categories:

   Innovation in Root Cause Analysis - Identifying the root cause of
a hardware or software problem not only shortcuts downtime for the
customer, but can eliminate reoccurrences of the problem.
Historically, root cause analysis required manual detective work on
the part of agents and support management, and often happened only
after multiple reoccurrences in order for enough information to be
available for analysis. Today, with more structured and unstructured
data captured, and more intelligent analytic tools available,
companies can identify patterns in customer incidents faster and
streamline root cause analysis. This award recognizes an SSPA partner
that helps member companies more quickly identify the true failing
component at the heart of one or a series of support incidents so a
fix or workaround can be crafted.

   Innovation in Voice of the Customer - Customer-focused
organizations succeed by listening to customer input at every stage of
the customer life cycle, producing products, services and support
offerings that exactly fit the needs of consumer or business
customers. Many SSPA members have Voice of the Customer initiatives
underway, to proactively capture customer feedback and integrate the
input into product planning and creation of support and training
programs. This award recognizes an SSPA partner that enables member
companies to better solicit, capture and analyze customer feedback,
ideas and experiences, and present the findings in an actionable way
to the support organization, as well as across the enterprise.

   Innovation in Usability - One of the primary reasons new
technology implementations fail to achieve the desired return on
investment is lack of employee or customer adoption, and application
usability is key to high user adoption. As support applications have
evolved from green screens to client/server to Web applications,
usability often appears to be an afterthought. The best support
applications are highly intuitive, so little training is required to
master the software, with visual cues provided so agents, or customers
performing self-service, can quickly complete a process without having
to think about the next sequential step. This award recognizes an SSPA
partner who consistently delivers extremely usable applications,
leveraging innovative technology and controls to offer a
differentiating user experience.

   The honorees are being showcased today at the SSPA Best Practices
2008 Conference, with an awards ceremony as well as tours of the
winners' booths in the SSPA's Technology Services Expo, led by
Ragsdale. More information on the conference and previous Recognized
Innovator Awards can be found at www.thesspa.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp said on Monday it plans to spend more than $100 million to test a technology that could allow it to affordably remove carbon dioxide and  other substances from natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company said it is building a commercial demonstration plant near LaBarge, Wyoming, to test its "Controlled Freeze Zone" (CFZ) technology -- a process to freeze out and remove components in gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process can remove not only carbon dioxide, but also hydrogen sulfide, which is found in "sour" gas, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After it is removed, the carbon dioxide could be used for enhanced oilfield recovery or injected into underground storage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If successful, the technology could reduce the cost of producing gas from sour gas fields, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon will begin building the plant this summer, and it expects operations to start in late 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It plans to test the plant, which will process about 14 million cubic feet of gas per day, for one to two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc's shares tumbled on Monday as investors punished the company for rejecting Microsoft Corp's $47.5 billion bid, though the fall was cushioned by hopes a deal may still be possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo fell as much as 20 percent in early Nasdaq trading before recovering some to trade at $24.47, still down 14 percent and far below the $33-per-share Microsoft offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think at $24, the stock's overvalued as a standalone Yahoo," said Mike Binger, a fund manager at Thrivent Financial, which owned both Yahoo and Microsoft shares. "I think $33 was fairly generous for Yahoo and if Yahoo won't accept it, they (Microsoft) did the right thing in walking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer withdrew the bid on Saturday after talks collapsed, with Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang demanding $37 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft rose 0.5 percent on investor relief that it was not overpaying for Yahoo, though concerns remained about how the software maker would develop its Web strategy in the face of a dominant Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did like the idea of the Yahoo acquisition in the long run for Microsoft, but we did have reservations about how high a price they were willing to pay," said Dan Davidowitz, a portfolio manager at Polen Capital Management, which owns Microsoft and Google shares. "I'm not necessarily certain that the Yahoo deal is completely off the table."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One clear winner from the collapse of Microsoft-Yahoo talks is Google, whose shares rose 2 percent. A deal would have been one of the biggest mergers in the technology sector and may have threatened Google's steady expansion on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The terminated Microsoft-Yahoo negotiations eliminate the risk for now of a stronger online advertising competitor to Google," Stifel Nicolaus analysts George Askew and Scott Devitt wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHAREHOLDER PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect a flurry of shareholder lawsuits against Yahoo, even as the Web pioneer pursues possible deals with other Internet media and advertising companies, such as Time Warner Inc's AOL Internet division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Yahoo's share fall was not as steep as the 30 percent plunge anticipated by some analysts, indicating there was still an "acquisition premium" built into the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At $24.47, the stock is comfortably above its January 31 close of $19.18, before Microsoft disclosed its unsolicited offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is going to play out over the next several months and there is still a chance Microsoft will buy the company for somewhere around $33 a share," said Todd Dagres, general partner at venture capital fund Spark Capital. "What Microsoft is hoping is that Yahoo shareholders get militant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is likely to push for a search advertising deal with Google, sources familiar with the matter said. That should boost Yahoo's operating performance in the near term, but runs the risk of regulatory scrutiny over an alliance between the Internet's top two players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, some Yahoo shareholders have started to make their discontent public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Miller, a portfolio manager for Legg Mason, Yahoo's second-largest shareholder, told the New York Times in a Sunday interview that he would have considered selling to Microsoft for $34 or $35 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that was more than Microsoft's offer, it was less than the $37 per share Yahoo's board insisted on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang, a Yahoo co-founder who owns about 4 percent of the company, was expected to hold a meeting with employees on Tuesday in an effort to reassure staff in the wake of the Microsoft talks ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang said in a post on the company's blog on Sunday night: "No one is celebrating about the outcome of these past three months ... and no one should. We live and work in a competitive world and the Web is only going to get more competitive. Executing on our strategic plan is what matters most."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Muralikumar Anantharaman in Boston; Editing by Derek Caney and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO May 5 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O)
decision to walk away from a proposal to buy Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O)
caught options traders off guard on Monday, with many of them
positioning for a deal to get done.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; But die-hards are refusing to give up the ghost and have
replaced their near-term bets with options that expire in the
summer months on hopes that Microsoft could re-approach Yahoo,
traders and analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After three months of public negotiations, Microsoft
withdrew a sweetened $33-per-share offer on Saturday after
talks collapsed, with Yahoo demanding $37 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The takeover dream has not died yet," said William
Lefkowitz, options strategist at brokerage firm vFinance
Investments, pointing to the buying of June calls and the fact
that Yahoo shares bounced off their opening lows on Monday,
closing 15 percent lower on the day at $24.37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Traders are also talking about a potential alliance with
Google (GOOG.O) or Time Warner (TWX.N)," said Pete Najarian,
co-founder of Web information site optionmonster.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Particularly notable were the June and July calls, allowing
investors to buy Yahoo shares for between $27.50 and $32.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reports late last week of Microsoft and Yahoo stepping up
their efforts to strike a deal had boosted options activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There was a sense that the deal would go through, albeit
closer to Microsoft's original $31-per-share offer than very
much higher," said Rebecca Engmann Darst, equity options
analyst at Interactive Brokers Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That created a great deal of speculative activity in the
May $30 calls, which were by far the most active contract on
Friday with roughly 160,000 lots changed hands, data from
option analytics firm Trade Alert showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Trading was particularly heavy in that strike during the
last hour of trading (on Friday) as most people thought that
the Microsoft bid for Yahoo was a done deal," said Joe Kinahan,
chief derivatives strategist at online brokerage thinkorswim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lot of volume seemed to be made up of spreads as traders
bought May $30 calls and sold the higher $32.50 strikes. While
traders wanted the May $30 calls, the spread trade suggested
they did not expect a sweetened bid or Yahoo shares to go much
higher than $32.50. Yahoo shares closed at $28.67 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Anybody betting on the deal closing took a hit," said
Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lot of Yahoo option traders also played it safe by
accumulating puts, giving them the right to sell the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For the past week, the contracts outstanding on the put
side in Yahoo was growing, indicating that traders were uneasy
about the deal," said Randy Frederick, director of derivatives
at Charles Schwab  Co Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The amount of open interest in the May $25 put strike
suggests that savvy traders may have hedged their bets on
Friday on the deal falling apart," Trade Alert's Schwartz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Option traders are still looking for more price risk to
Yahoo shares over the next 30 days. In all, roughly 958,000
calls and 400,000 puts changed hands in Yahoo on Monday, five
times the normal volume, according to Trade Alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With calls far outpacing puts, Darst noted traders did not
appear to think Yahoo shares would plunge into the mid-teens,
though plenty of speculative two-way traffic was seen at
strikes $22.50 and $25 in the May contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders were also selling May $30 calls, implying
Microsoft's bid was as good as it would get for Yahoo shares,
Darst said. There was also buying interest in June $22.50
calls, which traded for as much as $3.35 cents each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If another bid happens, it would occur after May
expiration," Schwab's Frederick said. "There are some people
who believe that Yahoo shares will flounder for a while and
then Microsoft will make a second bid at a later time."

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Two of IBM's (IBM.N) most senior executives, technology strategy chief Nick Donofrio and hardware chief Bill Zeitler, will retire later this year, an IBM memo showed on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Sam Palmisano announced the retirements in an email to employees obtained by Reuters. Bob Moffat will take Zeitler's job as Senior Vice President and Group Executive, Systems and Technology, overseeing computer and microchips and keep is current role focused on IBM's supply chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A variety of executives will take on roles from Donofrio, whose title is Executive Vice President, Innovation and Technology, Palmisano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesman Ed Barbini confirmed the moves and said the change was normal as, traditionally, executives retire around age 60. Zeitler would be 61 and Donofrio 63 when they retired, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Peter Henderson; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp could seek a variety of deals after walking away from Yahoo Inc, but few would be comprehensive enough to let it challenge Google Inc's domination of online advertising.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer called off talks with Yahoo on Saturday after the Web company rejected his $47.5 billion offer, he gave up what he and investors saw as the fastest way to grow quickly in advertising and online services to take on market leader Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, our goal is to build the industry-leading business in search, online advertising, media, and social networking," Ballmer wrote in a Saturday letter to employees, obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the acquisition of Yahoo would have accelerated our ability to deliver on our strategy in advertising and online services, I remain confident that we can achieve our goals without Yahoo," Ballmer wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said Microsoft could go it alone, but a likelier scenario would be to use some of the cash it dangled in front of Yahoo to make smaller acquisitions or strike up partnerships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It could form a tie-up with Time Warner Inc's AOL unit or News Corp's Fox Interactive Media unit, which includes MySpace, to draw advertising to its own Web properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AOL executives contacted Microsoft about a possible tie-up last month after Ballmer set a three-week deadline for Yahoo to agree to a deal or face a hostile battle, a person briefed on those discussions said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News Corp has also reached out to Microsoft in recent weeks to explore possibilities, including bidding for Yahoo jointly, sources previously told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An AOL official was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A partnership with or acquisition of News Corp's Internet activities or AOL would be a start" in leapfrogging Google, said Peter Misek, an analyst who follows Microsoft for Canaccord Adams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google sites had about 590 million unique visitors in December, while Microsoft sites had 540 million and Yahoo's had 485 million, comScore data show. By comparison, Time Warner properties, including AOL, had only 274 million visitors, and Fox Interactive Media sites had 158 million visitors. Arguably, a Microsoft partnership with AOL or FIM would not bring the same numbers as a Microsoft-Yahoo combine would.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOTS OF LITTLE BUYS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft could also go on a shopping spree, buying start-ups that build sophisticated search and online advertising platforms to cobble together a challenge to Google, said Peter Falvey, a banker at Revolution Partners, a technology-focused investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They could buy a lot of interesting start-ups and use their marketing muscle," Falvey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But none of these options would provide Microsoft the scale it needs to compete effectively against Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Little things like buying Digg would not move the needle for Microsoft," said Todd Greenwald, an analyst at Nollenberger Capital Partners, referring to a Web site that lets people submit and share news stories, videos and other files online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greenwald said Microsoft could afford to buy Facebook, in which it invested $240 million last year, and use the social network's popularity to drive traffic to its Web properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it would still not bring the global benefits and brand awareness that a merger with Yahoo would, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Scale and speed to market are what Ballmer needs, and he can't get it by building it organically," said one person involved in the negotiations between Microsoft and Yahoo, who wasn't authorized to speak on the record because the negotiations were confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STILL A CHANCE FOR MICROHOO?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft is under less pressure to come up with an alternative deal than Yahoo is, analysts said. Microsoft could choose to sit it out and wait for an opportune time to make another Yahoo bid, since that makes the most strategic sense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect Microsoft's stock to rise modestly when the market opens on Monday, indicating that investors are willing to be patient with Ballmer. Some might hope he has the sense to keep on walking, even if Yahoo tries to call him back.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are enough skeptics out in Wall Street land that were really questioning Microsoft's strategy, and they will applaud Microsoft for holding firm to the fact that they had a price in mind and they're not going to overpay," said Fred Dickson, a market strategist at D.A. Davidson  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Kenneth Li and Caroline Valetkevitch in New York; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil to Build Commercial Demonstration Plant to Remove Carbon Dioxide from Natural Gas

  Technology Could Enable Commercialization of Higher Carbon Dioxide
                          Content Natural Gas
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil announced today it is committing more than $100 million
to complete development and testing of an improved natural gas
treating technology which could make carbon capture and storage more
affordable and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

   The company plans to build a commercial demonstration plant near
LaBarge, Wyoming, where it will use ExxonMobil's Controlled Freeze
Zone(TM) technology, known as CFZ(TM). CFZ(TM) is a single-step
cryogenic separation process that freezes out and then melts the
carbon dioxide and removes other components including hydrogen
sulfide, which is found in so-called sour gas. If successful, the
process will reduce the cost of carbon dioxide removal from produced
natural gas.

   "This technology will assist in the development of additional gas
resources to meet the world's growing demand for energy and facilitate
the application of carbon capture and storage, to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions," said Mark Albers, senior vice president of Exxon Mobil
Corporation (NYSE:XOM).

   Using the CFZ(TM) process, the carbon dioxide and other components
are discharged as a high-pressure liquid stream for injection into
underground storage or for use in reservoir management to enhance oil
recovery. Besides reducing the cost of separation, transportation and
reinjection, the CFZ(TM) process can eliminate the use of solvents,
sulfur plants and carbon dioxide venting in processing of the natural
gas.

   The new demonstration plant will advance the CFZ(TM) technology to
commercial application, and be located at ExxonMobil's Shute Creek
Treating Facility. It will process about 14 million cubic feet of gas
per day for injection and test a wide range of gas compositions to
evaluate the extent of its applicability to the world's undeveloped
gas resources.

   Construction will commence this summer for operational startup in
late 2009. Testing is expected to occur over one to two years. The
detailed engineering, procurement, and construction management will be
provided by URS Washington Division.

   CFZ(TM) was developed by ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company and
has undergone significant improvements since the 1980s, when, in an
industry first, it proved the concept of freezing carbon dioxide in
natural gas separation with a CFZ(TM) pilot plant.

   ExxonMobil has more than 50 years of large-scale sour gas
production experience, which includes design and operation of the two
largest carbon dioxide and hydrogen sulfide injection projects in the
world. The company has developed industry-leading expertise in
managing safety, reliability and technical challenges associated with
highly sour oil and gas developments.

   ExxonMobil is a world leader in carbon management technologies and
has researched and developed carbon-handling technologies for more
than 30 years. In addition to our in-house research programs,
ExxonMobil supports carbon capture and storage research at the
International Energy Agency's Greenhouse Gas Research &amp; Development
Program, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Georgia Tech, the
University of Texas and Stanford University. The company participates
in the U.S. Department of Energy's Southeast Regional Carbon
Sequestration Partnership and is working with the European Commission
and other companies on the CO2ReMoVe project to evaluate a range of
carbon injection and storage technologies in Norway, Algeria and
Germany.

   The resulting technologies, including CFZ(TM), could play an
important role in future widespread use of carbon capture and storage
to significantly reduce the release of greenhouse gases into the
atmosphere.

   CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Plans and projections in this release are
forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including the
impact of new technologies, could differ materially due to factors
including changes in long-term oil or gas prices or other market
conditions affecting the oil and gas industries; changes in law or
government regulation; technical difficulties; future technological
developments by ExxonMobil or others; and other factors discussed
under the heading "Factors Affecting Future Results" in the
"Investors" section of our website at www.exxonmobil.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), whose shares fell as much as 20 percent on Monday after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) dropped its $47.5 billion bid for the Web company, is likely to face pressure and possibly a proxy battle from activist hedge funds looking to revive the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With billions of dollars in financial muscle, some activist hedge funds are already laying the groundwork for a campaign after the three-month talks between Microsoft and Yahoo collapsed last weekend. Microsoft walked away, saying it would not bid more than $33 per share for Yahoo, while Yahoo wanted $4 a share more to agree to the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say it would likely take one or more substantial, seasoned activists to buy a large stake in Yahoo and finance a credible multimillion-dollar proxy campaign. But at least one small firm, Ironfire Capital, is talking to other firms about running a director slate, according to Eric Jackson, who heads the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm mad," said Jackson, who was involved in a successful campaign last year to have former Yahoo Chief Executive Terry Semel replaced. "Yahoo's rejection was not in the best interests of shareholders, and the board needs to be held accountable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson's Naples, Florida-based firm has a minuscule holding in Yahoo, just 96 shares. But if other, larger hedge funds line up and buy at least 5 percent of the company's now-discounted stock and run a slate of director candidates that would favor a sale to Microsoft, the move could gain traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 1.25 billion Yahoo shares outstanding, a stake of 62 million shares, or around 5 percent, could cost more than $1.5 billion at today's price of around $24 per share. That leaves such a campaign likely only for the largest activists, such as Carl Icahn, William Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, Nelson Peltz' Trian Partners, Jana Partners and a handful of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are not a lot of activists who can invest $1 billion," said Manny Pearlman, CEO of hedge fund Liberation Investment Group and veteran of numerous, smaller proxy battles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn, who led a high-profile campaign against Time Warner two years ago and has invested over $1 billion in Motorola in a current proxy campaign, is not currently a Yahoo investor and has no immediate plans to run a campaign, a person close to Icahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts said the billionaire New York financier could be in a prime position to put pressure on Yahoo to revive talks with Microsoft, since he was successful last year in negotiations to get Oracle Corp ORCL.O to return to the table to buy BEA Systems BEAS.O after Oracle walked away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a clear path to victory for someone willing to buy the stock and deliver the company to Microsoft at $33 a share," said a senior executive at one multi-billion dollar activist hedge fund who asked for anonymity. "You need a lead dog that runs the campaign, however."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all proxy campaigns, timing is critical, and in this case, it favors investor activists. Since Yahoo has yet to set the date for its annual meeting, expected in July, activists still have time this year to submit candidates for the board, rather than being forced to wait until next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, by that time, Microsoft's interest in Yahoo may have cooled, leaving activists to demand other more speculative routes for Yahoo. If such a campaign collapses altogether and a fund has invested a large part of their assets in the hopes of a deal, "You have a real business franchise risk," said one hedge fund manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Yang's blog, investor quote, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tiffany Wu and Michele Gershberg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 5 (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) shares
tumbled on Monday as investors punished the company for
rejecting Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $47.5 billion bid, though
the fall was cushioned by hopes a deal may still be possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Yahoo fell as much as 20 percent in early Nasdaq
trading before recovering some to trade at $24.47, still down
14 percent and far below the $33-per-share Microsoft offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think at $24, the stock's overvalued as a standalone
Yahoo," said Mike Binger, a fund manager at Thrivent Financial,
which owned both Yahoo and Microsoft shares. "I think $33 was
fairly generous for Yahoo and if Yahoo won't accept it, they
(Microsoft) did the right thing in walking."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer withdrew the bid on
Saturday after talks collapsed, with Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang
demanding $37 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft rose 0.5 percent on investor relief
that it was not overpaying for Yahoo, though concerns remained
about how the software maker would develop its Web strategy in
the face of a dominant Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We did like the idea of the Yahoo acquisition in the long
run for Microsoft, but we did have reservations about how high
a price they were willing to pay," said Dan Davidowitz, a
portfolio manager at Polen Capital Management, which owns
Microsoft and Google shares. "I'm not necessarily certain that
the Yahoo deal is completely off the table."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One clear winner from the collapse of Microsoft-Yahoo talks
is Google, whose shares rose 2 percent. A deal would have been
one of the biggest mergers in the technology sector and may
have threatened Google's steady expansion on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The terminated Microsoft-Yahoo negotiations eliminate the
risk for now of a stronger online advertising competitor to
Google," Stifel Nicolaus analysts George Askew and Scott Devitt
wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHAREHOLDER PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect a flurry of shareholder lawsuits against
Yahoo, even as the Web pioneer pursues possible deals with
other Internet media and advertising companies, such as Time
Warner Inc's (TWX.N) AOL Internet division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Yahoo's share fall was not as steep as the 30 percent
plunge anticipated by some analysts, indicating there was still
an "acquisition premium" built into the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At $24.47, the stock is comfortably above its Jan. 31 close
of $19.18, before Microsoft disclosed its unsolicited offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is going to play out over the next several months and
there is still a chance Microsoft will buy the company for
somewhere around $33 a share," said Todd Dagres, general
partner at venture capital fund Spark Capital. "What Microsoft
is hoping is that Yahoo shareholders get militant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is likely to push for a search advertising deal with
Google, sources familiar with the matter said. That should
boost Yahoo's operating performance in the near term, but runs
the risk of regulatory scrutiny over an alliance between the
Internet's top two players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Already, some Yahoo shareholders have started to make their
discontent public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bill Miller, a portfolio manager for Legg Mason, Yahoo's
second-largest shareholder, told the New York Times in a Sunday
interview that he would have considered selling to Microsoft
for $34 or $35 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While that was more than Microsoft's offer, it was less
than the $37 per share Yahoo's board insisted on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang, a Yahoo co-founder who owns about 4 percent of the
company, was expected to hold a meeting with employees on
Tuesday in an effort to reassure staff in the wake of the
Microsoft talks ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang said in a post on the company's blog on Sunday night:
"No one is celebrating about the outcome of these past three
months ... and no one should. We live and work in a competitive
world and the Web is only going to get more competitive.
Executing on our strategic plan is what matters most."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Beats Google, Facebook, Others as Best Web 2.0 Developer Program According to Users

SANTA CRUZ, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Software developers active in Web 2.0 development ranked
Microsoft's MSN/Live Windows Developer Program higher than developer
programs offered by Google, eBay, Yahoo, Facebook, or PayPal in the
2008 Evans Data Corp. Web 2.0 Developer Programs Users' Choice survey
announced today and conducted in March of this year.

   Only users of each developer site rated the corresponding
developer program, which saw Microsoft's site edging past Google's in
developer user satisfaction. The seven leading Web 2.0 sites were
rated by their program users across 13 different developer program
categories, including API functionality, blogs, marketing assistance,
documentation, forums, ongoing communications/RSS, support,
tools/SDKs, and Web Services.

   "Microsoft has devoted a lot of effort to enhancing the MSN/Live
Windows program over the last year," said John Andrews, president and
CEO of Evans Data Corp. "And those efforts have paid off in a
decidedly higher level of user satisfaction than we saw last year.
Google, as well as eBay, Yahoo! and others have several areas of
strength for developers, but Microsoft has much more experience in
developer programs and it shows. Cultivating a development community
is strategic as Web 2.0 moves from consumer-facing social applications
to a business-to-business strategy for many companies."

   Evans Data provides its Users' Choice reports to the IT community
free of charge as a public service. Users' Choice reports cover
several areas of satisfaction and interest to developers and IT
managers, such as IDEs, application lifecycle and source control
management, application servers, scripting languages and more.

&lt;p&gt;Aras Delivers Version 9 of Advanced Model-Based SOA for Enerprise PLM on the Microsoft Platform

     Major Release Provides Multilanguage Capabilities for Global
  Collaboration and Support for Microsoft SQL Server 2008 and Windows
                              Server 2008
ANDOVER, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Aras(R), leading Microsoft enterprise open source software
solution provider, today announced the immediate availability of
Version 9 of the Aras Innovator(R) suite of model-based
service-oriented architecture (SOA) solutions for enterprise Product
Lifecycle Management (PLM). Version 9 delivers the first model-based
SOA for PLM and includes single-instance multi-language capabilities
and support for the latest Microsoft platform products; Microsoft SQL
Server 2008, Microsoft Windows Server 2008, and Microsoft Visual
Studio 2008. Additional information and enterprise solution download
available at http://www.aras.com.

   "Service-oriented architectures (SOA) represent a significant
advancement in enterprise PLM because of the reduced complexity and
improved flexibility," said Marc Halpern, Research Director at
Gartner. "Using an SOA, enterprises are able to complement and extend
existing systems through Web services to incrementally automate
complicated business processes much more quickly and easily than
previously possible."

   "By delivering an advanced model-based SOA exclusively on the
Microsoft platform in an enterprise open source format, Aras is
unleashing the extensive power of SQL Server 2008 to provide global
enterprises with a trusted, productive, and intelligent data
platform," said Kim Saunders, senior director for SQL Server Marketing
at Microsoft Corp. "The innovation advantage that the Microsoft
platform provides for partners is compelling, and we are committed to
enabling Microsoft partners such as Aras as they create ever greater
value for customers."

a significant innovation in enterprise SOA software for PLM.

   Real-time Solution Customization - The Aras Innovator model-based
SOA solutions enable complex object model, data schema, business rule,
and workflow changes on-the-fly with no programming required and no
downtime making solution customization fast and easy.

   No Impact Upgrades - The model-based SOA separates the solutions
and related solution modifications from the underlying SOA making even
highly customized enterprise solutions easy to upgrade in days without
impacting the customizations.

   "Aras makes extremely powerful enterprise software solutions easy
to implement and use," said Peter Schroer, President of Aras
Corporation. "The Microsoft open approach provides practical solution
innovations that deliver results because they come directly from our
corporate community members worldwide."

   Multilanguage Internationalization - Global Collaboration

   Aras Innovator Version 9 includes single-system multi-language

Internationalization and localization are integral to the Version 9
model-based SOA and are stored as data in Microsoft SQL Server. This
simplifies the development and sharing of language packs by
eliminating external resource files and getting rid of the need to
compile code before using translated solutions. Highlights include:

   One Installation, Many Languages - An unlimited number of user
languages are simultaneously supported by a single system running one
application server. Version 9 supports the entire ISO/IEC 10646
Unicode character and script set representing over 500 written
languages including double byte support for the Chinese, Japanese, and
Korean ideographs.

   --  Multi-language support includes both the solution screens and
        all end user data

   --  For example, users in the USA see the Part Master in English,
        users in Germany see the data in German, and users in China
        see Chinese

   --  Sorting of user search results occurs in the native language
        (collating sequence)

   Global Corporate Clock - A single system installation used
simultaneously by people all over the world provides each user with
local time zone display, yet the system records a user's actions in
one defined corporate time zone for synchronization of time &amp; date
sensitive activities.

   --  Coordinates global date and time complexity for collaborative
        processes such as electronic workflow signatures, program
        scheduling deadlines, and product release effectivity

   Language localization packages are openly developed by Aras
corporate community members worldwide. Mandarin Chinese and Simplified
Chinese are available now, and other language translations are under
way for Russian, Portuguese, Spanish, German, and French. Aras is
currently recruiting volunteers for translation activates.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 5 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded
Commercial Vehicle Group Inc (CVGI.O) to "overweight" from
"neutral," saying the automotive component maker should benefit
from an upcoming rebound in the North American heavy truck
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We should start to see a rebound in the second half of
2008 in anticipation of a 2009 pre-buy ahead of the more
stringent 2010 emission standards," analyst Stephen Volkmann
said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beyond 2009, the pent-up replacement demand for heavy
trucks purchased in 2004 to 2006 will still be significant,
Volkmann said, adding that Commercial Vehicle's stock was the
cheapest in his coverage of the machinery sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volkman said the company missed Wall Street consensus in
three out of four quarters in 2007, as it struggled with a
number of issues, many of which were one time in nature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Despite beating the Street for the past two (quarters), we
believe expectations moving forward are still fairly low -
particularly given the negative sentiment right now around
North American heavy truck (market)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were up more than 8 percent at $13.52
in morning trade on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) shares tumbled as much as 20 percent on Monday after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) withdrew its $47.5 billion takeover offer, wiping about $7.6 billion off the Internet company's market capitalization and piling pressure on its leadership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the aftermath, Internet search leader Google Inc (GOOG.O) seemed poised to reap the gains of the missed deal, which would have been one of the biggest mergers in the technology sector and may have threatened Google's steady expansion on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 2.6 percent on relief that it was not willing to overpay for Yahoo, while Google rose 2.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The terminated Microsoft/Yahoo negotiations eliminate the risk for now of a stronger online advertising competitor to Google," Stifel Nicolaus analysts George Askew and Scott Devitt wrote in a research note. They raised their price target on Google to $675 from $610.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo has been testing an advertising partnership that would give arch-rival Google part of its search listings. While some on Wall Street see this is a potential way out for Yahoo, it also represents a new fringe benefit to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The collapse of talks between Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang prompted Wall Street brokerages to cut their ratings and price targets on Yahoo, which held out for a $37 per share value despite a sweetened off from Microsoft for $33 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares closed at $19.18 on January 31, the day before Microsoft made its unsolicited offer for Yahoo. Yang, one of Yahoo's founders, owns about 4 percent of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect a flurry of shareholder lawsuits against Yahoo management, even as the Web pioneer pursues possible deals with other Internet media and advertising companies, such as Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) AOL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is also likely to push for the Google partnership, sources familiar with the matter said. That should boost Yahoo's operating performance in the near term, but runs the risk of regulatory scrutiny over an alliance between the Internet's top two players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo's execution remains the problem, as the company has not been able to execute better targeting and measurement on its own site effectively enough over the past 15 years," UBS analyst Heather Bellini wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bellini said she would not give Yahoo "the benefit of the doubt that they can make meaningful improvement over the next three years," especially as the break up of talks creates an even more competitive backdrop for Yahoo, Microsoft and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of Yahoo's shareholders have already started to make their discontent public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Miller, a portfolio manager for Legg Mason, Yahoo's second-largest shareholder, told the New York Times on Sunday that he would have considered selling to Microsoft for $34 or $35 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that was more than Microsoft's offer, it was less than the $37 per share Yahoo's board insisted on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is going to be a lot of pressure on Yahoo's management to deliver in the next year or two," Miller said, according to the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares fell 15 percent, or $4.43, to $24.24 after initially falling as low as $22.97. Google shares rose $12.99 to $594.28, while Microsoft shares jumped 57 cents to $29.81 on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today convened an inaugural summit titled  "America's
Competitiveness: Hispanic Participation in Technology Careers,"  an effort
to bring together leaders in business, education, government, and community
organizations to find ways to increase the number of Hispanic students pursuing
careers in science, technology, engineering and math in the United States.

    The effort is aimed at a looming problem resulting from the significant
decline in
the numbers of Hispanic students pursuing careers in science, technology,
engineering and mathematics (or STEM). This decline could affect America's
competitiveness in the increasingly global market. Demographic data show that
the
Hispanic community is expected to constitute 25 percent of the overall U.S.
population by mid-century, making the U.S. home to the largest Hispanic
population in the world.  Meanwhile, Hispanic students dropping out of high
school
are at a 24 percent rate.

    To address the issue, IBM along with ExxonMobil, Lockheed Martin and
Univision, and 150 other leaders will meet on May 5 and 6 in New York, to
examine the ways the Hispanic community can improve their participation in
STEM.

    "The Hispanic community is one of the fastest growing in the country and
young Latinos are rapidly joining our workforce," said U.S. Senator Robert
Menendez. "It is important that they have the option to pursue careers in
science, technology, engineering and math, not only so they can fully develop
their potential, but also so they can become professionals in areas that are
vital to our economy, our security, our future as a nation. I salute IBM
for this important initiative and hope this summit will open up new roads to
success for our Hispanic youth."

    The magnitude of the nation's STEM career gap is most apparent in the
fieldof engineering where the need for talent is increasing at three times the
rate of other professions. This demand is countered by trends that demonstrate
few American students are entering STEM-related studies.

    "IBM is deeply committed to galvanizing the U.S. corporate sector and
otherstakeholders in addressing the serious shortage of professionals in STEM
careers, particularly in the Hispanic community," stated Nicholas M.
Donofrio, Executive Vice President, Innovation and Technology.  "This summit is
a call to action to challenge business leaders to address an issue that
could undermine the country's leadership in today's global economy."

    Participants of this strategic gathering will be presented with newly
released
reports commissioned by the IBM International Foundation from respected
research organizations like The Tomas Rivera Policy Institute and Public
Agenda, which outline the challenges and opportunities to the nation's
Hispanic community and their partners as regards the pursuit of STEM careers.

    Among the key findings of The Public Agenda study, "A Matter of Trust,"
released
today in conjunction with the conference, reveals a deep-seated anxiety within
the
Hispanic Community about attaining a college education despite it being a
requirement for a decent job and middle-class life in nine of ten young
Hispanic adult households. The reasons identified in the study are:

--  Nearly half of Hispanic parents say it is a serious problem that
    students are not taught enough math and science.
--  Hispanic parents are more likely to support making sure U.S. standards
    match those in Europe and Japan.
--  Less than half of Hispanic young adults believe that qualified
    students can find a way to pay for college.
    

    
"Education and higher education in particular are even more
highly-prizedand respected among Hispanic parents than among parents in general,
despitesome erroneous conventional wisdom to the contrary," state authors Paul
Gasbarra and Jean Johnson, of the Public Agenda.  "Overall... far too many
Hispanic families are underserved by public education  -- and to a significantly
greater degree than the general population."

    As a means of enabling Spanish-language-only parents to better communicate
with
teachers-- one of the needs outlined in the Public Agenda study -- IBM is today
announcing that it will provide its automatic two-way, English-Spanish, e-mail
translation and web translation software called !TraduceloAhora! to all U.S.
schools at no cost to them.

    Additionally, schools and nonprofit organizations will be given unlimited
use of
the !TraduceloAhora! software.  And Hispanic older adults and those with
disabilities can access the free translation software along with other free
software called AccessibilityWorks that helps them view web pages in a
customized format for easier and more effective reading and navigation on
the web.

    And, according to The Tomas Rivera Policy Institute (TRPI), which also today
released the report, "STEM Professions: Opportunities and Challenges for
Latinos,"
the fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S. also suffers from a worse gender
gap
in STEM careers compared with Asians and African Americans.

    The TRPI report, however, noted some signs of optimism: "As the youngest and
fastest growing ethnic group in the U.S. today," state the authors, Maria Teresa
V. Taningco, Ann Bessie Mathew and Harry Pachon. "Latinos have a unique
opportunity to aim high and to strive for STEM careers, given the high demand
in these fields."

    In response to the need to provide mentors for Hispanic students, IBM
commits
to expanding the MentorPlace program to focus on school districts in the U.S.
with
a significant number of Hispanic students, and matching them with IBM employees
who can serve as their online mentors.


--  Additionally, IBM will expand its cascade mentoring program -
    currently at the University of Arizona at Tucson - to at least 3
    universities in California, New York and Texas.
--  The cascading mentoring program is an internet based system that
    enables professional mentors, university students, and K-12 students to
    engage in a three-way mentoring relationship through secure online
    discussions.  These discussions focus on past academic experiences and
    exploration of what could be in terms of future goals and opportunities.
--  This program completed its third year in Tucson, Arizona and involved
    IBM employees, the University of Arizona SHPE (Society for Hispanic
    Professional Engineers) Student Chapter, and students from two high
    schools.
    

    
In addition, IBM is making further commitments aimed at bolstering
earlyeducation resources with innovative technology tools for the classroom:


--  IBM also will make a donation of 1,000 KidSmart units at early
    childhood centers in Chicago, Dallas, Los Angeles, Miami and New York - in
    neighborhoods that support the Hispanic community.
--  IBM commits to expanding the Reading Companion grant program - a web-
    based, voice recognition technology that helps adults and children gain
    literacy skills - to any school district in the U.S. that is interested,
    with a special focus on school districts with a significant number of
    Hispanics.
    

    
Key moderators and facilitators will lead attendees in highly focused
workgroups designed to encourage dialogue and develop actionable strategies to
increase Hispanic participation in STEM-related curriculum. Confirmed moderators
include Tom Luce, Chief Executive Officer, National Math and Science
Initiative, Inc. (former Assistant Secretary, Office of Planning, Evaluation and
Policy Development); Irving Wladawsky-Berger, Chairman Emeritus, IBM Academy of
Technology and Visiting Professor of Engineering Systems, MIT; Stanley Litow,
President of the IBM International Foundation and Vice President, Corporate
Citizenship &amp; Corporate Affairs, IBM Corporation; and Adalio Sanchez, Vice
President of Corporate Strategy, IBM Corporation.

    The issue of skills and the need for America to produce more graduates
withdegrees in math, science, engineering and technology also will be addressed.

    "The shift to a digital economy in the last 10 years requires that young
people
be prepared to enter the workforce with '21st Century skills,'" said AMD
Chairman and CEO Hector Ruiz. "Fostering STEM skills is critically important in
developing an adept workforce to fill the jobs of this expanding digital
economy."

    In keeping with its commitment to the development of STEM professionals
forthe future, IBM has been in collaboration with over 5,000 premier
universities
and over 100,000 business partners globally to prepare students with 21st
century
skills for jobs in the new IT workforce.

    In the U.S. alone, IBM has trained faculty at over 3,150 institutions on
software skills and over 150 on mainframe skills. Students and future STEM
professionals can also access the IBM Academic Initiative which includes
anonline portal that provides access to FREE software and hardware as well
astraining and course materials. Also through the web, IBM offers hundreds
ofresources for integration into college curricula to help teach students
howto master the fast-growing market of open technologies. Perhaps most
significantly, IBM is working with more than 150 leading universities to
promote the global adoption of a new academic discipline, Service Science
Management and Engineering (SSME).

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Buffett remarks about recession, Countrywide shares
falling, updates prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jennifer Coogan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks looked set to open
lower on Monday after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) dropped its bid
for Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), clouding the outlook for mergers and
acquisitions and sending Yahoo shares down more than 21
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall Street's outlook was further dimmed after Warren
Buffett said the U.S. economy was in a recession and banks will
face more pain. Buffett, chairman and chief executive of
investment and insurance company Berkshire Hathaway Inc
(BRKa.N) (BRKb.N), made the remarks in a news conference after
the company's annual meeting on Saturday. For details, see
[ID:nN04342877].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo fell to $22.50 before the market's open from a Friday
closing price of $28.67 after software maker Microsoft offered
to increase its bid to $47.5 billion on Saturday, but that
still wasn't enough for the Internet company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in a more promising deal, Sprint Nextel's (S.N) shares
rose 10.3 percent to $8.70 after media reports said Deutsche
Telekom (DTEGn.DE) may purchase the No. 3 U.S. mobile
operator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft initially offered $31 per share for Yahoo, then
$33, but Microsoft withdrew from the talks when Yahoo Chief
Executive Jerry Yang dug in for a price of $37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft showing discipline about price may be a sign
there's a limit to the MA activity," said Peter Boockvar,
equity  strategist at Miller Tabak  Co in New York. "There may
still be activity among companies but only at the right
price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose 5.9 percent to $30.96 on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 were down 6.4 points, below fair
value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking
into account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration
on the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 fell 48 points,
and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures dropped 6.25 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Google Inc (GOOG.O), a competitor of both Yahoo
and Microsoft, rose on expectations the company could benefit
from the failure of the Microsoft-Yahoo talks. Yahoo was likely
to push for an advertising partnership with the Web search
company, sources familiar with the matter said. Google rose 3.8
percent to $603.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Countrywide Financial CFC.N fell before the
bell on Monday after brokerage Friedman, Billings and Ramsey
said Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) is likely to renegotiate its
deal to buy the mortgage lender or walk away from it. For
details see [ID:nBNG173851]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Countrywide shares dropped 10 percent to $5.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An index of the huge U.S. services sector in April is due
at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT) from the Institute for Supply Management.
Economists in a Reuters survey forecast a PMI reading of 49.1
versus 49.6 in March. A reading below 50 indicates contraction
in the sector.

&lt;p&gt;IBM Platform Integration Dramatically Increases the Power of VAI's S2K Enterprise Resource Planning Software Suite

  IBM Power Systems unifies the System i and the System p to enhance
                              performance
RONKONKOMA, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
VAI (Vormittag Associates, Inc.) (http://www.vai.net), a leader in
enterprise solutions for the distribution, manufacturing, retail and
service industries, and an IBM Premier Business Partner, today
announced that IBM's integration of the System i and System p
enterprise platforms into the Power Systems product portfolio gives
VAI's S2K Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Software Suite a
significant power boosting benefit.

   The IBM Power(TM) Systems unifies the IBM System i, with the UNIX
operating system platform, IBM System p. Customers that previously
operated the System i can now enhance performance and energy
efficiency, by transferring essential data to the new systems, while
continuing to run operating systems to which they have become
accustomed.

   For VAI, the Power Systems launch enhances the processing power of
its S2K product line. In particular, the company's e-Commerce and
analysis applications will benefit from the increased speed and
precision of the unified platforms. VAI's S2K Enterprise Resource
Planning (ERP) Software Suite maximizes productivity and profitability
by centralizing company data and helping businesses make well-informed
decisions -- crucial to successfully competing on the international
market. With the integration of the System i and the System p, VAI's
already robust software package will offer customers the flexibility
to add features and functions at a competitive price.

   "The System i and System p unification is a logical decision by
IBM that reflects the growing needs businesses have for accurate
information that is available quickly and reliably," said Kevin
Beasley, CIO, VAI. "VAI is excited to offer our customers the
additional capabilities secured with the Power Systems integration.
This move fits perfectly with VAI's corporate vision, where addressing
the full spectrum of customer needs is our number one concern."

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, May 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Titus Labs, a leading provider of email and document classification
software today announced the release of the latest version of its
classification offering designed to support Microsoft Outlook Web Access.
 Titus Labs Message Classification (TMC) Web Access 1.6 is the most
advanced OWA classification tool on the market that enables organizations
to share sensitive information securely over a browser. The solution will
restrict the type of information viewed by employees using Web mail to
help prevent leakage of sensitive or confidential information.  IT
administrators are able to deliver information to employees with mobile
email access, while setting parameters for any email or attachments that
may not be appropriate to view outside the confines of the organization's
firewall.

    Users are increasingly mobile and are demanding the capability of being
able to access email from remote locations and through standard Web
browsers. For many organizations, particularly in the military,
government and aerospace industries, this represents a particular
challenge given the highly sensitive nature of much of the information
sent over email or contained in attachments.   The TMC Web Access Edition
was designed knowing that many people are using Microsoft Outlook Web
Access to review emails and documents; TMC Web Access 1.6 enables
organizations to deliver Web mail capabilities while extending the
security requirements of the organization beyond the perimeter.

    "All organizations, particularly the government and military are trying
to find a way to balance the need for mobile access to email with the
need to ensure the security and integrity of these communications," said
Mark Bodley, Messaging Architect, Fujitsu Services. "The Titus Labs OWA
offering enables organizations to carefully control how email is handled
outside of the organization, thereby meeting user needs and the
organization's security and privacy requirements."

    TMC Web Access 1.6 is designed to enable organizations to ensure all
emails are classified and labeled regardless of the physical location of
the sender. The OWA Prevent(TM) feature enables IT administrators to
restrict users from viewing messages that have been classified as
confidential or sensitive, as well as prevent them from viewing emails
that contain confidential attachments.  The Message Classification for
Web Access product is now supported on both the Exchange 2003 and
Exchange 2007 platforms.

    "When organizations provide Web access to email, they often overlook the
need to extend existing email security policies to cover how this
information should be handled," said Tim Upton, President, Titus Labs.
"Organizations need to consistently apply their policies including
classification and labeling to all emails. Titus Labs Message
Classification Web Access enables them to enforce the proper handling of
sensitive information on all email and reduce the likelihood of
inadvertent data leakage."

    Pricing and Availability

    Titus Message Classification OWA 1.6 is currently available, with pricing
including server fee $5995 USD + Client License $11 USD/user with volume
discounts.

    The offering is available through Titus Labs and its authorized reseller
partners.

should have the conversation with for both brand and direct response messages,"
says Dr. Plummer.

&lt;p&gt;Aveksa Enterprise Access Governance Platform Receives ''Ready for IBM Tivoli Software'' Validation

   Integration Enables Enterprises Using IBM Tivoli Identity Manager
to Ensure Corporate Security Policies and Access Compliance Objectives
                             are Being Met
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Aveksa, Inc. (www.aveksa.com), the market-leading provider of
enterprise access governance solutions, today announced that it has
been validated as "Ready for IBM Tivoli Software" for its integration
of the Aveksa 3 Access Governance Platform with IBM Tivoli Identity
Manager. Aveksa enables enterprises to easily unify and certify user
roles and user accounts controlled by IBM Tivoli Identity Manager with
identity, entitlement and role information from other sources. Using
Aveksa, organizations can implement an automated process for access
change requests and remediation of access rights violations that
result from a certification. Organizations using Tivoli Identity
Manager can now eliminate previously manual and error-prone processes
through Aveksa's automated access certifications, remediation and
reporting to achieve sustainable compliance and reduce access risk
across the enterprise.

   "As a customer of both companies, we believe the integration
between Aveksa and IBM Tivoli Identity Manager would enable access
governance to be tied directly to access enforcement in our
environment. This would benefit CIGNA's deployment of these two
technologies by simplifying access change management while enabling
the remediation of access rights violations and the validation of such
remediation through a closed-loop system," said Alyson Ruff,
information protection and security operations manager at CIGNA.

   Thousands of organizations have successfully implemented IBM
Tivoli Identity Manager to leverage its automated provisioning
capabilities for enterprise application administration and access
control. However, the process of determining whether corporate-wide
security policies and compliance objectives are being met requires
significant manual labor, is prone to errors and exposes companies to
risk. Aveksa addresses these challenges for enterprises through
integration with Tivoli Identity Manager in the following key areas:

   --  Identity, Entitlement and Role Collection - gathers
        information based on user and account and role attributes
        within Tivoli Identity Manager and correlates it with other
        application and access enforcement infrastructure, resulting
        in a unified view of all entitlements and roles across the
        enterprise.

   --  Business Policy Validation - allows business and IT teams to
        easily define business rules that automate exception-based
        monitoring or roles collected from IBM Tivoli Identity Manager
        to detect compliance exceptions such as Segregation of Duties
        violations.

   --  Role Management - defines and mines roles based on user and
        account attribute information collected from Tivoli Identity
        Manager. Aveksa can also add business context information to
        these roles and export the definitions back into Tivoli
        Identity Manager.

   --  Reporting - offers multiple options for detailing
        entitlements, accounts, account attributes and roles, both
        within Tivoli Identity Manager and across other enterprise
        systems and applications.

   "IBM Tivoli Identity Manager is one of the most widely deployed
user provisioning systems in the market, and its users face a
universal challenge as they spend excessive hours manually tracking
and tracing entitlement requests, conducting access certifications and
monitoring compliance," said Deepak Taneja, founder, president and CTO
of Aveksa. "Through the integration with IBM Tivoli Identity Manager,
Aveksa will dramatically simplify and streamline these tasks for
customers. Aveksa adds value to an organization's investment in Tivoli
Identity Manager by reducing resource overhead and access related
risks while ensuring that compliance is sustainable."

comprehensive solution for access governance, risk and compliance
management. It is comprised of the Aveksa Compliance Manager, which

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) -Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) dropped its bid to buy Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) after the Internet company rejected its offer to raise the price by $5 billion to $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is a statement from Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock on Saturday in response to Microsoft's move:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We remain focused on maximizing shareholder value and pursuing strategic opportunities that position Yahoo! for success and leadership in its markets. From the beginning of this process, our independent board and our management have been steadfast in our belief that Microsoft's offer undervalued the company and we are pleased that so many of our shareholders joined us in expressing that view.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) walked away from its bid to buy Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) on Saturday after the Internet company turned down its offer to raise the price by $5 billion to $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is the letter from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer ending talks. It was released by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 3, 2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mr. Jerry Yang&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CEO and Chief Yahoo&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo! Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;701 First Avenue&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sunnyvale, CA 94089&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dear Jerry:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After over three months, we have reached the conclusion of the process regarding a possible combination of Microsoft and Yahoo!.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I first want to convey my personal thanks to you, your management team, and Yahoo!'s Board of Directors for your consideration of our proposal. I appreciate the time and attention all of you have given to this matter, and I especially appreciate the time that you have invested personally. I feel that our discussions this week have been particularly useful, providing me for the first time with real clarity on what is and is not possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I am disappointed that Yahoo! has not moved towards accepting our offer. I first called you with our offer on January 31 because I believed that a combination of our two companies would have created real value for our respective shareholders and would have provided consumers, publishers, and advertisers with greater innovation and choice in the marketplace. Our decision to offer a 62 percent premium at that time reflected the strength of these convictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our conversations this week, we conveyed our willingness to raise our offer to $33.00 per share, reflecting again our belief in this collective opportunity. This increase would have added approximately another $5 billion of value to your shareholders, compared to the current value of our initial offer. It also would have reflected a premium of over 70 percent compared to the price at which your stock closed on January 31. Yet it has proven insufficient, as your final position insisted on Microsoft paying yet another $5 billion or more, or at least another $4 per share above our $33.00 offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also, after giving this week's conversations further thought, it is clear to me that it is not sensible for Microsoft to take our offer directly to your shareholders. This approach would necessarily involve a protracted proxy contest and eventually an exchange offer. Our discussions with you have led us to conclude that, in the interim, you would take steps that would make Yahoo! undesirable as an acquisition for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We regard with particular concern your apparent planning to respond to a "hostile" bid by pursuing a new arrangement that would involve or lead to the outsourcing to Google of key paid Internet search terms offered by Yahoo! today. In our view, such an arrangement with the dominant search provider would make an acquisition of Yahoo! undesirable to us for a number of reasons:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- First, it would fundamentally undermine Yahoo!'s own strategy and long-term viability by encouraging advertisers to use Google as opposed to your Panama paid search system. This would also fragment your search advertising and display advertising strategies and the ecosystem surrounding them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would undermine the reliance on your display advertising business to fuel future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Given this, it would impair Yahoo's ability to retain the talented engineers working on advertising systems that are important to our interest in a combination of our companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- In addition, it would raise a host of regulatory and legal problems that no acquirer, including Microsoft, would want to inherit. Among other things, this would consolidate market share with the already-dominant paid search provider in a manner that would reduce competition and choice in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- This would also effectively enable Google to set the prices for key search terms on both their and your search platforms and, in the process, raise prices charged to advertisers on Yahoo. In addition to whatever resulting legal problems, this seems unwise from a business perspective unless in fact one simply wishes to use this as a vehicle to exit the paid search business in favor of Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- It could foreclose any chance of a combination with any other search provider that is not already relying on Google's search services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, your apparent plan to pursue such an arrangement in the event of a proxy contest or exchange offer leads me to the firm decision not to pursue such a path. Instead, I hereby formally withdraw Microsoft's proposal to acquire Yahoo!.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We will move forward and will continue to innovate and grow our business at Microsoft with the talented team we have in place and potentially through strategic transactions with other business partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I still believe even today that our offer remains the only alternative put forward that provides your stockholders full and fair value for their shares. By failing to reach an agreement with us, you and your stockholders have left significant value on the table. But clearly a deal is not to be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you again for the time we have spent together discussing this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely yours,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;/s/ Steven A. Ballmer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steven A. Ballmer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Officer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corporation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - After three months of waiting, the end of Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) pursuit of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) ended in a rush.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flurry of last-minute talks between the heads of the software and Internet giants preceded Saturday's decision by Microsoft to end its effort to buy Yahoo, said three people familiar with the talks, who were not authorized to speak publicly about them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo co-founders Jerry Yang and David Filo flew to Seattle to meet Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer and his lieutenant Kevin Johnson on Saturday morning, where they indicated Yahoo could do a deal at $37 a share, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was the last face-to-face meeting of a busy week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's deadline to Yahoo to reach a deal or prepare to face a hostile takeover passed without incident a week ago on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the following Tuesday, Yang and Roy Bostock, the chairman of Yahoo's board, called Ballmer twice, urging the Microsoft CEO not to make good on his threat to go hostile or walk away, a person familiar with Microsoft's thinking said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The next day, Wednesday Apr 30, Ballmer flew to Palo Alto, Calif., for a meeting with Yang near Yahoo's Sunnyvale headquarters, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang had long said that Microsoft's cash-and-stock offer, originally worth $31, was not enough. On Wednesday he informally told Ballmer that Yahoo could go for less than $40 a share, a price previously tossed out as a possibility -- but never formally quoted -- in meetings between advisers on both sides, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo indicated that "below $40, there could be a lot of debate," one person close to the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But price wasn't the only stumbling block, two people familiar with the negotiations said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At an Apr 15 meeting in Portland, Oregon, Yahoo had also raised regulatory concerns about a potential merger, and pressed for "value-certainty" -- assurances that the value of Microsoft's offer would remain the same when the deal, if it did get done, closed, one of the two people said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent days, Microsoft had indicated the possibility it could raise its offer by a "couple of dollars", but did not formally make a higher offer to Yahoo, one of the people involved in the discussions said. Neither did it address Yahoo's concerns adequately, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite harsh talk in public letters over the last few months, the two sides were cordial in recent days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It didn't end with any acrimony," the source said. "Ballmer knew there was only one way to acquire Yahoo, and that was on a friendly basis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News that talks had heightened leaked on Friday evening, but both sides were being careful about what they promised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo insiders were also debating what price would be acceptable. Yang and Filo personally felt they could not go below $38, but the board Yang led was ready to sell the shop for $1-a-share less.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the two men flew to Seattle on Saturday morning, they gave the board's price, and their own reservations, two people briefed on the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer finally came out with his raised offer -- $33 a share, compared with the initial offer worth $31 a share and about $29 a share at the end of last week. "Today for the first time Ballmer said $33," the source said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer and Johnson, Microsoft's Platforms  Services Division President, failed to reach a deal with Yang and Filo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filo and Yang flew back to California, expecting a counter-offer to their $37 price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, Ballmer called Yang to inform him Microsoft was withdrawing its offer, and followed up with an official letter sent on Saturday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both sides made the best of the circumstances, arguing they could do well without the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without the distraction of Microsoft's unsolicited proposal now behind us, we will be able to focus all of our energies on executing the most important transition in our history," Yang said in a public statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the acquisition of Yahoo would have accelerated our ability to deliver on our strategy in advertising and online services, I remain confident that we can achieve our goals without Yahoo," Ballmer said in a letter to employees, obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between the two companies could still resume if circumstances change, said one person familiar with the negotiations. But that won't be soon, the person added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Todd Eastham and Louise Heavens)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Saturday ended a three-month public effort to buy Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Following is a timeline of key events in the corporate courtship, beginning with private talks held before the software company announced its offer for the Web pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late 2006/early 2007 - Microsoft and Yahoo discuss various partnerships, including a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 2007 - Yahoo tells Microsoft it is not the right time to discuss a takeover as Yahoo board sees great potential from new advertising technology, internal changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 31 - Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer makes $44.6 billion, $31-per-share cash-and-stock takeover offer to Yahoo board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 1 - Microsoft makes the offer public. Its shares fall 6.6 percent to $30.45; Yahoo shares rise 48 percent to $28.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 11 - Yahoo rejects Microsoft offer as too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 13 - MySpace owner News Corp NWSa.N and Yahoo discuss tie-up, according to a source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 18 - Yahoo gives financial forecasts for next two years, in effort to prove it is worth more than Microsoft bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 4 - People familiar with the matter say Microsoft is evaluating its bid for Yahoo because the Internet company may have lost value since Microsoft first made its offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 5 - Microsoft sets three-week deadline for Yahoo to negotiate and reach a deal or face a proxy fight and possible cut to the bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 7 - Yahoo again rejects Microsoft and says it is open to a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 9 - Yahoo says it will test Google Inc (GOOG.O) search ads on its site, which could be more lucrative than selling its own search ads. Sources say Yahoo and Time Warner (TWX.N) are in parallel talks to join Time Warner's AOL and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 26 - Microsoft deadline to Yahoo passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 30 - Ballmer flies to California for talks with Yahoo CEO Jerry Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 3 - Yang meets Ballmer in Seattle. Microsoft raises offer to $33 per share, or $47.5 billion. That is about $5 billion over value of the previous offer at the time; Yahoo wants $37 per share, or about $5 billion more. Late in the day, Ballmer calls off the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources: Microsoft letter to Yahoo; Reuters stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Peter Henderson; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Sprint Nextel share price in Frankfurt)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT May 5 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures
pointed to a weaker opening on Wall Street on Monday, with Yahoo
Inc (YHOO.O) in focus after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) walked away
from its $47.5 billion bid for the Internet search company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 1021 GMT Dow Jones futures DJc1 were down 0.4 percent,
SP 500 futures SPc1 were down 0.5 percent and Nasdaq futures
NDc1 0.5 percent lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft on Saturday sweetened its initial $31-per-share
offer for Yahoo to $33, but then withdrew from the talks when
Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang dug in for a price of $37.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares fell 18.9 percent to 14.68 euros in Frankfurt
by 1022 GMT, while Microsoft (MSFT.F) rose 3.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares closed at $28.67 on Friday on Wall Street.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yang is certainly under a lot of pressure now," said Roland
Hirschmueller, an equities trader at German brokerage Baader.
"His days are numbered if he doesn't manage to come with an
alternative strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Google (GOOG.O) could be the big winner from the end of
Microsoft-Yahoo talks as sources familiar with the matter said
Yahoo was likely to push for an advertising partnership with the
Web search leader. A tie-up with Google should help boost
Yahoo's operating performance in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google shares (GOOGa.F) rose 2.1 percent in Frankfurt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is also still considering a deal with other Internet
media and advertising majors such as Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N)
AOL, people familiar with the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elsewhere on the merger and acquisition front shares in
Sprint Nextel (S.N) S.F rose 11 percent in Frankfurt after
media reports said Deutsche Telekom (DTEGn.DE) was looking at a
possible purchase of the U.S. wireless company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, traders expressed some scepticism that such a deal
was politically feasible. Deutsche Telekom shares dipped 0.8
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later in the session the Institute for Supply Management is
due to release its April non-manufacturing index at 1400 GMT.
Economists in a Reuters survey forecast a PMI reading of 49.1
versus 49.6 in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Friday U.S. stocks made modest gains after jobs data that
offered fresh evidence the economic slowdown is not as severe as
feared, but technology shares faded on a surprise loss from Sun
Microsystems Inc JAVA.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended the session up
0.4 percent, the Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 0.3

&lt;p&gt;Portland General Electric Reports First Quarter 2008 Earnings Results; on Target to Achieve Annual Guidance

   Financial and Operating Highlights

   --  PGE is reaffirming full-year 2008 earnings guidance of $1.75
        to $1.85 per diluted share.

   --  Achieved net income of $28 million, or $0.44 per diluted
        share, for the first quarter of 2008 compared to $55 million,
        or $0.88 per diluted share, in 2007. Results in 2007 included
        a one-time, positive $18 million, or $0.28 per diluted share,
        related to the Boardman deferral and the California
        settlement.

   --  Added approximately 4,000 new customers in the first quarter,
        resulting in more than 808,000 customers served at quarter
        end. Weather adjusted retail energy deliveries increased 1
        percent from the first quarter of 2007.

   --  Effectively operated and managed the utility system with
        excellent plant operations, high system reliability and strong
        overall customer service ratings.

   --  Both Port Westward and Biglow Canyon Phase I have been
        included in customer prices and are operating well, with
        availability of approximately 95 percent and 91 percent,
        respectively.
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Portland General Electric Company (NYSE:POR) today reported net
income of $28 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, for the three
months ended March 31, 2008, compared to $55 million, or $0.88 per
diluted share, for 2007. Results for 2008 as compared to 2007 were
driven primarily by increased retail energy deliveries, excellent
plant operations and the inclusion of Port Westward and Biglow Canyon
Phase I in prices. The primary offset to these positive results was
reduced hydro generation and the resulting increase in replacement
power costs. Reduced hydro generation was due to colder than normal
weather, which has delayed snow melt. Also offsetting these positive
results was a reduction in income from non-qualified benefit plan
assets.

   "We're focused on moving significant projects forward to meet the
growing energy needs of our customers," said Peggy Fowler, CEO and
president of Portland General Electric (PGE). "We announced that
Portland General Electric executed agreements to buy 141 turbines from
Siemens Power Generation, Inc., in order to complete construction of
our nearly 450 megawatt Biglow Canyon Wind Farm. The project helps
secure Oregon's future energy supply and delivers value to both
customers and shareholders."

   2008 Earnings Guidance

   PGE is reaffirming full-year 2008 earnings guidance of $1.75 to
$1.85 per diluted share. Guidance assumes normal hydro conditions and
plant operations. PGE is also reaffirming its long-term annual
earnings growth expectation of 6 to 8 percent beginning with 2008.

   Biglow Canyon Wind Farm

   In the first quarter of 2008, PGE entered into purchase agreements
for 141 wind turbines for Phases II and III of the project. The
estimated total cost of Phases II and III is $740 million to $780
million, including allowance for funds used during construction (AFDC)
of approximately $42 million, with Phases II and III expected to be
completed by the end of 2009 and 2010, respectively.

   Integrated Resource Plan

   In its review of PGE's June 2007 Integrated Resource Plan (IRP),
the Public Utility Commission of Oregon (OPUC) has stated that the
Company's proposed Biglow Canyon Phases II and III, and the additional
218 MWa of renewable energy resources, are reasonable. Accordingly,
the Company has issued a Request for Proposals for renewable
resources. The OPUC has requested that PGE prepare additional
long-term analysis to address resource decisions beyond 2012, which
the Company plans to include in a revised IRP to be filed by October
2009. As a foundation for future resource planning, PGE expects the
updated and revised IRP to further define the Company's future energy
and capacity needs.

   2009 General Rate Case

   Regulatory review of the Company's general rate case and proposed
tariffs, filed with the OPUC in late February 2008, is continuing
under a procedural schedule that currently provides for new rates to
become effective on January 1, 2009. The proposed 8.9 percent average
price increase is the result of higher purchased power and fuel costs,
increased investment in utility plant, and higher general expenses
including the rising cost of materials and supplies, compliance with
government regulation, hydro relicensing improvements, and labor and
healthcare benefits. The requested revenue requirement includes a
return on common equity of 10.75 percent, based on an expected capital
structure of 50 percent equity and 50 percent debt, and an overall
weighted average cost of capital of 8.66 percent.

   Capital Expenditures

   Capital expenditures in 2008 are estimated to be $394 million.
This includes $223 million for ongoing production, transmission and
distribution facilities, $90 million for Phases II and III of the
Biglow Canyon Wind Farm, $56 million for hydro relicensing projects,
$23 million for AMI and $2 million for Boardman emissions controls.

   First Quarter 2008 Results Compared to First Quarter 2007

   --  Total customers served increased 1.5 percent to approximately
        808,000 as of March 31, 2008, compared to approximately
        796,000 as of March 31, 2007.

   --  Total revenues increased by $35 million due primarily to the
        net effect of the following key factors:

-0-
*T
    -- A 4.0 percent increase in total retail energy deliveries,
        primarily from an increase in the average number of customers
        served and cooler weather in the first quarter of 2008
        compared to the first quarter of 2007.

    -- A 2.8 percent price increase for cost recovery of Port
        Westward, effective in June 2007.

    -- A 0.6 percent price increase for cost recovery of Biglow Canyon
        Phase I, effective January 1, 2008.

    -- A 0.3 percent price decrease, effective January 1, 2008, for
        changes in forecasted 2008 power and fuel costs.

    -- An $11 million increase in wholesale revenues due to a 68
        percent increase in the average power price partially offset
        by a 21 percent reduction in wholesale energy sales. The price
        increase was driven by both higher natural gas prices and
        lower hydro availability.
*T

   --  Purchased power and fuel expense increased by $47 million due
        primarily to the net effect of the following key factors:

-0-
*T
    --  A $74 million increase resulting from an increase in the cost
         of thermal (primarily natural gas-fired) production, due to
         increased generation output and higher natural gas prices, as
         well as the settlement of natural gas agreements. A portion
         of the increase in the cost of thermal generation was the
         result of a 14 percent decrease in hydro production because
         of colder than normal weather, which delayed snow melt.

    --  A $55 million decrease resulting from a 31 percent reduction
         in electricity purchases, related primarily to an increase in
         thermal generation.

    --  One-time items recorded in the first quarter of 2007
         consisting of a $20 million credit related to the deferral of
         excess Boardman power costs and a $6 million credit due to a
         reduction in the Company's wholesale credit reserve, related
         to a settlement with certain California parties.
*T

   --  Production and distribution expense increased by $7 million
        due primarily to a $5 million increase in operating costs at
        the Company's generating facilities, including Port Westward,
        which was completed in June 2007, and Biglow Canyon Phase I,
        which was completed in December 2007. The remaining increase
        was due to higher distribution-related labor costs, including
        those related to line repair and restoration activities.

   --  Depreciation and amortization expense increased by $5 million
        primarily due to increased depreciation from the completion of
        Port Westward and Biglow Canyon Phase I.

   --  Other income (expense) decreased by $10 million primarily due
        to the following:

-0-
*T
    -- A $5 million decrease in income from non-qualified benefit plan
        trust assets;

    -- A $3 million decrease in AFDC equity, which resulted from a
        lower construction work in progress (CWIP) balance during the
        first quarter of 2008; and

    -- A $2 million decrease in interest income on regulatory assets.
*T

   --  Interest expense increased by $6 million primarily due to a
        higher level of outstanding long-term debt and lower AFDC debt
        resulting from a lower CWIP balance.

   --  Income taxes decreased by $16 million and the effective tax
        rate decreased to 28 percent. These decreases are primarily
        the result of lower taxable income and an increase of $2
        million in federal energy tax credits generated from the
        operation of Biglow Canyon Phase I in the first quarter of
        2008.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Shares in China's leading e-commerce firm Alibaba.com 1688.HK slid 6 percent on Monday after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) dropped a bid for Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), Alibaba's key investor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo owns 39 percent of Alibaba's parent, Alibaba Group, and Microsoft's failure to win Yahoo means potential business opportunities Alibaba might have had with Microsoft, such as in advertising or online trading, would not now likely materialize.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock fall was largely expected as Microsoft dropped its bid for Yahoo, and there will be no news for Alibaba in the short term," said Antony Mak, sales director at DBS Vickers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Alibaba, due to post quarterly earnings on Tuesday, closed down 5.9 percent at HK$15.24, their biggest drop in four weeks, underperforming the Hang Seng Index .HSI, which eased 0.22 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a highly volatile stock, and is driven by sentiment," said Francis Cheung, analyst at CLSA. "The news may have affected sentiment but has very little to do with what the company can do in terms of earnings."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said the withdrawal of Microsoft's $33 per share bid for Yahoo would help remove some uncertainty as Alibaba Group had been touted as seeking investors to buy Yahoo's stake in a move to stop Microsoft getting access to Alibaba stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The news is not so negative, but obviously investors are using this as an excuse to sell after a sharp rally last week," said Linus Yip, strategist at First Shanghai Securities Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba shares had jumped 12.5 percent to a 4-week high on Friday amid talk that Microsoft, the world's biggest software maker, may raise its Yahoo bid. But Microsoft gave up the chase on Saturday after failing to meet Yahoo's $47.5 billion price tag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SLOWING ECONOMY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba declined to comment on Microsoft's decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is an issue for our parent company only. Three months ago when this issue was first raised, we didn't have any comment, and we don't have any comment now," CEO David Wei told reporters after a shareholder meeting in Hong Kong on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba shares, listed in Hong Kong in November and ranked as the city's most popular IPO last year, have slumped 45 percent this year amid a global share sell-off, underperforming a 5.9 percent fall on the blue chip Hang Seng.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock, which trades at 58 times forecast earnings, nearly tripled on its debut from an IPO price of HK$13.50 that had valued the company at more than 106 times forecast earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is expected to report a strong first quarter net profit of 263-290 million yuan ($37.6-$41.4 million) as margins improved, according to two analysts polled by Reuters. It earned 295 million yuan for the first six months of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns about Alibaba's premium membership growth and the impact of a firmer yuan and a slowing U.S. economy on its customer renewal rate, could continue to overhang the stock, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Alibaba mainly caters to external trade, and I think external trading is going to slow," Cheung said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alibaba, looking to serve small- to medium-sized businesses, shrugged off the threat of a  slowing global economy, saying this could instead be an opportunity for it and its customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"E-commerce helps small- and medium-sized companies to control costs, to source better and make better profits -- it could enable them to survive," Wei said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=6.994 Yuan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ken Wills  Ian Geoghegan)&lt;/p&gt;

background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT May 5 (Reuters) - Shares in Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O)
fell almost 20 percent in Frankfurt on Monday after Microsoft
Corp (MSFT.O) walked away from its bid for the Internet company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares (YHOO.F) were down 19.7 percent in Frankfurt at
14.55 euros ($22.50) at 0820 GMT, while Microsoft (MSFT.F) rose
3.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft on Saturday sweetened its initial $31 per share
offer for Yahoo to $33, but then withdrew from the talks when
Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang dug in for a price of $37.
Yahoo shares closed at $28.67 on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo now faces growing pressure to find an alternative
strategy to Microsoft's $47.5 billion takeover offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is likely to push for an advertising partnership with Web
search leader Google Inc (GOOG.O), sources familiar with the
matter said on Sunday. A tie-up with Google, seen as a big
winner from the end of Microsoft-Yahoo talks, should help boost
Yahoo's operating performance in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google shares (GOOGa.F) rose 3.4 percent in Frankfurt on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo is also still considering a deal with another Internet
media and advertising major, such as Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N)
AOL, people familiar with the discussions said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yang is certainly under a lot of pressure now," said Roland
Hirschmueller, an equities trader at German brokerage Baader.
"His days are numbered, if he doesn't manage to come with an
alternative strategy," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a news story, double click on [ID:nN04344963]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For an analysis on the matter, double click on

of Retalix. "The expansion of our existing technology partnership and reseller
agreements underscores the increased value Retalix and IBM bring to customers by
delivering tailored software solutions on IBM hardware with support from IBM

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) executives
will dominate the ranks of investment banking in North and
South America following its takeover of Bear Stearns Cos
BSC.N, according to an internal memo obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; With more half of nearly 14,000 Bear Stearns employees
facing layoffs, JPMorgan is slowly setting up the leadership
team for the combined investment banks. In the latest moves,
announced internally on Thursday, just two out of 14 executives
currently work for Bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is expected to complete its fire-sale takeover of
Bear Stearns, which nearly collapsed in March, by June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fortunate two are Jeff Urwin, named head of investment
banking coverage for the Americas in an earlier announcement,
and Ben Berinstein, who along with Morgan's Chris Harvey will
lead a business advising companies on capital structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have added world-class talent to our team, expanded our
client roster and added new and important capabilities to our
platform that will enable us to be even more relevant to
clients," said Doug Braunstein, the bank's head of Americas
investment banking and origination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among those who reporting to Braunstein will be Jimmy
Elliott, to be global head of MA, and Nicolas "Gucho" Aguzin,
head of investment banking in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said Kevin Willsey will be head of equity
underwriting for the Americas and jointly lead the global
business with Viswas Raghavan. Therese Esperdy will be global
head of debt underwriting as well as co-head of business in
Europe, the Middle East in Africa with Raghavan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeff Woods will be chief operating officer for Americas
investment banking, while Kelly Coffey will serve as corporate
derivatives marketing head.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One Morgan executive displaced by the merger is Chris
Linneman, who along with Jim Casey and Andy O'Brien was a
co-head of syndicated and leveraged finance. Under the new
structure, Casey and O'Brien will continue those roles while
Linneman seeks a new role at the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Likewise David Topper, who will continue serving as vice
chairman of equity capital markets, will explore other jobs at
the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) posted a 
better-than-expected 22 percent rise in profit as its movie 
studio scored hits with "National Treasure: Book of Secrets" 
and "Enchanted" and a weak U.S. economy failed to dampen theme 
park attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney's media networks also saw a double-digit rise in 
second-quarter operating income due mainly to affiliate and ad 
rate increases and subscriber growth at sports channel ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broadcasting shook off a Hollywood writers' strike that 
ended halfway through the quarter to post a 17 percent rise in 
operating income, propelled by international sales of ABC 
Studios scripted shows like "Lost" and "Gray's Anatomy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney joined other major U.S. media companies in 
outperforming expectations in the quarter, and investors 
rewarded the outsized results on Tuesday by boosting Disney 
shares by 1.6 percent in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you didn't know that the consumer was under tremendous 
pressure you would think we were in a boom if you looked at 
their results," said Larry Haverty, associate portfolio manager 
at Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All of the big media companies are doing fundamentally 
very well and the market just refuses to acknowledge it," 
Haverty added.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'FANTASTIC QUARTER'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income in the fiscal second quarter ended March 29 was 
$1.1 billion, or 58 cents per share, compared with $931 
million, or 44 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose nearly 10 percent to $8.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 50 cents per 
share and revenue of $8.5 billion, according to Reuters 
Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was a fantastic quarter. Not only are theme parks doing 
better ... but the vast majority of the company aside from 
theme parks exceeded investors' expectations, particularly the 
media networks," said Rich Greenfield, analyst with Pali 
Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney also cheered investors by predicting that its theme 
parks -- seen by some as a bellwether of consumer spending 
because of the need to plan vacations -- would stay "resilient" 
despite rising gasoline prices and air fares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Domestic room reservations for the rest of fiscal 2008 were 
trending slightly ahead of last year, though the third quarter 
faces a tough comparison versus last year, which had included 
the Easter holiday, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe we are much better positioned in a difficult 
economic cycle than we were in the past," Chief Executive Bob 
Iger said on a conference call with analysts. "We believe this 
segment can sustain success for many years to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said its ABC television network was seeing "healthy" 
double-digit growth in spot ad sales in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs predicted, however, that ABC would have fewer 
scripted shows to sell into international markets in the third 
quarter as a result of the writers' strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Disney Studios, the upcoming "Prince Caspian" and 
Disney-Pixar's "Wall-E" would be "swing factors" in the latter 
half of the year, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Consumer Products, which saw second-quarter profit 
drop due to lower minimum guarantees from retailers, expects 
costs from video game development and its repurchase of 220 
Disney retail stores from The Children's Place to cut in to 
profits for the rest of the fiscal year, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMH Capital analyst David Miller said the mostly upbeat 
forecast showed Disney had managed to insulate itself somewhat 
against consumer whims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm not saying it's recession proof and I'm not even 
saying it's recession resistant," Miller said. "Disney had this 
reputation of being such a consumer-focused media company that 
was so highly tethered to the economy (but) it's less so than 
it used to be five or seven years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares rose 1.6 percent to $34.26 in after-hours 
trade following a 1.3 percent rise in regular trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Sue Zeidler; Editing by Braden

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Shares in Yahoo Japan (4689.T), owned one-third by Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), fell as much as 3.5 percent on Wednesday after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) withdrew a $47.5 billion offer for the U.S. Internet company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in Yahoo Japan, in which Japanese telecoms and Internet group Softbank Corp (9984.T) has a 41 percent stake, were down 2.4 percent at 46,100 yen as of 0210 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the first chance for the Japanese market to react to the news after it was closed on Monday and Tuesday for national holidays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Saturday sweetened its initial $31 per share offer for Yahoo Inc to $33, but then withdrew from talks when Yahoo Chief Executive Jerry Yang dug in for a price of $37. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said a successful Microsoft bid for Yahoo could slow the growth of their common rival Google Inc (GOOG.O) in Asia, where the world's biggest search engine still lags local players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The failed deal leaves the online advertising market wide open to Google's expansion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's money and pool of researchers were huge attractions for cash-strapped Softbank and Yahoo Japan, which shares some of Yahoo Inc's search technology, as they seek to cement Yahoo Japan's dominant position in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While wary of Microsoft control in locally managed businesses, Yahoo Japan could have taken advantage of Microsoft's scale to lower marketing costs and help it tap Microsoft's resources to make searches faster, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Softbank, which also owns a 3.9 percent stake in Yahoo Inc, were flat at 2,130 yen, while the benchmark Nikkei average .N225 was up 0.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sachi Izumi; Editing by Chris Gallagher)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA May 7 (Reuters) - JPMorgan said on Wednesday it

its target price to 5,200 rupiah a share from 6,800 rupiah.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said the government's plan to raise

decision.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Oil could shoot up to $200 within the 
next two years as part of a "super-spike" driven by poor growth 
in oil supplies, investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said in a 
research note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We believe the current energy crisis may be coming to a 
head, as a lack of adequate supply growth is becoming 
apparent," Goldman said in the note made available to Reuters 
on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil hit a new record near $121 a barrel on Tuesday, 
continuing an advance which has seen it double over the past 12 
months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The possibility of $150-$200 per barrel seems increasingly 
likely over the next 6-24 months, though predicting the 
ultimate peak in oil prices as well as the remaining duration 
of the upcycle remains a major uncertainty," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which was one of the first to point to a triple 
digit oil price more than two years ago, said it believed the 
market was approaching the crunch in the "super-spike."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "super-spike" theory argues that a lack of adequate 
supply growth along with price-insulated demand growth in 
non-OECD countries will lead to a dramatic and continuous rise 
in oil prices that will ultimately lead to a sharp correction 
in oil demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman analysts said the underlying drivers of the rise in 
oil prices remained firmly in place, noting poor growth in 
non-OPEC supplies, low OPEC spare capacity, restriction on 
foreign investment in key oil producing nations and healthy 
demand growth in non-OECD economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In our view, a gradual rally in prices is likely to be 
longer lasting than a sharp, sudden spike," the note written by 
U.S.-based analyst Arjun Murti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it had raised its spot oil price forecasts for 
U.S. WTI crude for 2008 through to 2011 to $108 rising to $110 
and $120 a barrel, up from $96 rising to $105 and $110 
respectively in its earlier forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see risk to our 2008 and 2009 forecasts as distinctly 
to the upside," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Santosh Menon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks rose on Tuesday as Fannie Mae's FNM.N reassuring comments about the credit and housing markets buoyed financial shares, while record crude oil prices lifted shares of energy companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speculation that Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) could resume takeover talks with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) fed a rebound in technology shares. Yahoo gained 5.5 percent, while Microsoft rose 2.1 percent, leading the SP 500's advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After an early retreat, the session turned positive when top executives of Fannie Mae, the largest U.S. home finance company, said the worst of the credit market turmoil erupting from the real estate slowdown may have passed. That mitigated earlier concern about its huge quarterly loss, and propelled a broad rally in financial stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fannie Mae climbed almost 9 percent, and smaller rival Freddie Mac FRE.N gained 7.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil struck above $122 a barrel for the first time, carrying energy shares higher with it and outweighing a retreat in sectors sensitive to high fuel costs, such as airlines and retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When I came to work today, we thought Fannie Mae's stock will be trading south of $25, but somehow the investing public got news that they had a pretty positive conference call," said Angel Mata, managing director of listed equity trading at Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of people that are eyeing the financials right now, so if you're going to play the financials, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have to be among them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average finished up 51.29 points, or 0.40 percent, at 13,020.83. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index ended up 10.77 points, or 0.77 percent, at 1,418.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed up 19.19 points, or 0.78 percent, at 2,483.31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Immediately after the closing bell, there was more encouraging news that could help stocks extend their advance. Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) posted a stronger-than-expected quarterly profit, sending its shares up more than 3 percent in after-hours trade from their close at $33.73 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, one of the world's largest media companies and owner of the ABC television network, ESPN all-sports cable TV network and Disney theme parks in Florida and southern California, is seen as a bellwether of consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cisco Systems Inc's (CSCO.O) shares jumped more than 2 percent after the bell from their Nasdaq close of $26.33 as the network equipment maker also posted a profit that topped estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the regular session, Fannie Mae shares finished at $30.81, while Freddie Mac shares closed at $27.33.

Horton Inc (DHI.N), the largest U.S. home builder, jumped 5.5 percent to $16.85 even as the company posted a quarterly loss of $1.3 billion and halved its dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy shares rose after U.S. crude oil hit a record above $122 a barrel. A stronger-than-expected profit from independent oil and gas company Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) also buoyed the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon Mobil shares rose 0.6 percent to $90.07, while ConocoPhillips (COP.N) climbed 1.8 percent to $88.74 and Chevron Corp's (CVX.N) shares gained 1.3 percent to $96.87, while Anadarko shares climbed 9.4 percent to $74.53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of oil services company Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N) jumped 2 percent to $103.58. The oil index shot up 3.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said in a research note that the price of oil could shoot up to $200 a barrel within the next two years as part of a "super-spike" driven by poor growth in oil supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Energy prices are going to stay high until -- a) we get some production on line, which there's none that I know of -- or b) until we have a serious recession," said Sasha Kostadinov, portfolio manager at Shaker Investments in Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) were both among the Nasdaq's top five advancers as speculation continued that pressure from Yahoo's shareholders would revive takeover talks. Shares of Microsoft, which abandoned its bid for Yahoo at the weekend, ended at $29.70, while Yahoo closed at $25.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But higher energy costs threatened to crimp consumer spending. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the world's biggest retailer, was the top drag on the Dow. Wal-Mart's stock fell1.1 percent to $56.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June crude settled at $121.84 a barrel, up $1.87, or a gain of 1.56 percent for the session.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc may not be celebrating the end of takeover talks with Microsoft Corp, but their mutual rival Google Inc should feel free to pop the champagne cork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rift between Microsoft and Yahoo leaves the online advertising market wide open to Google's expansion. What's more, it puts Google in the coveted position of deciding the fate of its closest rival, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft withdrew a $47.5 billion offer for Yahoo on Saturday after the Internet company dug in for a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo investors see only two viable options -- returning to negotiations or letting Google serve up some of its search listings since it makes more money off the ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft holding firm for now, that leaves Google in the driver's seat when it comes to determining Yahoo's fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's good news for Google. They will continue to grow their dominant share," said Jane Snorek, senior technology analyst at First American Funds. "In the long run, I just think the Yahoo customer would go directly to Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Yahoo are still working out the details of a potential search deal and are sharing the plans with antitrust regulators to dispel concerns, a person close to Google said on Monday. But no final agreement has been reached yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal be would icing on the cake for Google, adding about $1 billion in annual revenue and about $1 to earnings per share, assuming a 50-50 split on ad revenue, Snorek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Google doesn't need the partnership on its own account, it may have a defensive interest in reaching a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're doing it more as a favor," she said. "Google can't let Yahoo fall to $15 again because they can't have Microsoft buying Yahoo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ad deal with Google could add as much as $6 a share to Yahoo's stock price, based on the results of a test between the two companies, a person involved in the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THERE GOES THE COMPETITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, however, is now viewed in need of a deal to prop up its value after rejecting a $33-per-share offer from Microsoft. Chief Executive Jerry Yang insisted the company is worth $37 per share, but Wall Street doubts it can get there alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google last month waved off fears that it would suffer from a U.S. economic downturn, reporting 42 percent gross revenue growth in the first quarter. Yahoo posed a 9 percent rise for the period, or 14 percent excluding payments to ad affiliates, and expects 3 percent to 15 percent growth for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay estimates Yahoo's stand-alone value at closer to $25 per share, leaving out any deal with Microsoft or Google. Yahoo shares closed at $25.72 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it turns out that Google was just being used to thwart Microsoft, I think the investor reaction will be very negative," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Google is by far the leader in search, a combined Microsoft and Yahoo could have presented a challenge in new frontiers of online advertising, from Web video to messaging and mobile Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's where there is open territory for anybody to win. Google stands to continue to further distance themselves from the pack," said Dan Davidowitz, portfolio manager at Polen Capital Management which owns shares in Microsoft and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, a Yahoo-Google alliance is widely expected to draw regulatory scrutiny for combining the Internet's two largest players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Fay, CEO at media buyer Aegis Media North America, said a combination of the two would be the closest thing yet to a monopoly in the online advertising space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Google is missing now is true depth of offering in display, e-mail and instant messaging, and those are areas where Yahoo is very strong," she said. "It feels a bit like too many eggs in one basket."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derek Brown, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said Yahoo should still think twice before it gives up even a segment of its search after investing to upgrade its technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If part of Yahoo's mission is to become a one-stop shop for people looking to buy all types of online ads, then outsourcing search ... seems like a step backwards," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Yahoo's ultimate aim was to avoid Microsoft's embrace, a long-term Google deal could buy it time to advance elsewhere while warding off the unwanted suitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more of a poison pill if they don't have an out clause ... and it's multi-year," said Todd Dagres, general partner at venture firm Spark Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Anupreeta Das in San Francisco; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Updates close with volume and advance/decline figures)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as
Fannie Mae's FNM.N reassuring comments about the credit and
housing markets buoyed financial shares, while record crude
oil prices lifted shares of energy companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speculation that Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) could resume
takeover talks with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) fed a rebound in
technology shares. Yahoo gained 5.5 percent, while Microsoft
rose 2.1 percent, leading the SP 500's advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After an early retreat, the session turned positive when
top executives of Fannie Mae, the largest U.S. home finance
company, said the worst of the credit market turmoil erupting
from the real estate slowdown may have passed. That mitigated
earlier concern about its huge quarterly loss, and propelled a
broad rally in financial stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fannie Mae climbed almost 9 percent, and smaller rival
Freddie Mac FRE.N gained 7.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil struck above $122 a barrel for the first time,
carrying energy shares higher with it and outweighing a
retreat in sectors sensitive to high fuel costs, such as
airlines and retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When I came to work today, we thought Fannie Mae's stock
will be trading south of $25, but somehow the investing public
got news that they had a pretty positive conference call,"
said Angel Mata, managing director of listed equity trading at
Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a lot of people that are eyeing the financials
right now, so if you're going to play the financials, Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac have to be among them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI finished up 51.29
points, or 0.40 percent, at 13,020.83. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX ended up 10.77 points, or 0.77 percent, at
1,418.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC closed up 19.19
points, or 0.78 percent, at 2,483.31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Immediately after the closing bell, there was more
encouraging news that could help stocks extend their advance.
Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) posted a stronger-than-expected
quarterly profit, sending its shares up more than 3 percent in
after-hours trade from their close at $33.73 on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney, one of the world's largest media companies and
owner of the ABC television network, ESPN all-sports cable TV
network and Disney theme parks in Florida and southern
California, is seen as a bellwether of consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisco Systems Inc's (CSCO.O) shares jumped more than 2
percent after the bell from their Nasdaq close of $26.33 as
the network equipment maker also posted a profit that topped
estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the regular session, Fannie Mae shares finished at
$30.81, while Freddie Mac shares closed at $27.33. Other
financial standouts were insurer American International Group
Inc (AIG.N), which rose 2.1 percent to $48.40, and JPMorgan
Chase  Co (JPM.N), the No. 3 U.S. bank, whose stock added 0.4
percent to $48.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The optimism from Fannie Mae's comments also contributed
to a rise in the shares of home builders, with the Dow Jones
home construction index .DJUSHB up 2 percent for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N), the largest U.S. home
builder, jumped 5.5 percent to $16.85 even as the company
posted a quarterly loss of $1.3 billion and halved its
dividend. For details, see [ID:nN06454667]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy shares rose after U.S. crude oil hit a record above
$122 a barrel. A stronger-than-expected profit from
independent oil and gas company Anadarko Petroleum Corp
(APC.N) also buoyed the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil shares rose 0.6 percent to $90.07, while
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) climbed 1.8 percent to $88.74 and
Chevron Corp's (CVX.N)  shares gained 1.3 percent to $96.87,
while Anadarko shares climbed 9.4 percent to $74.53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of oil services company Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N)
jumped 2 percent to $103.58. The oil index .OIX shot up 3.3
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said in a research
note that the price of oil could shoot up to $200 a barrel
within the next two years as part of a "super-spike" driven by
poor growth in oil supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Energy prices are going to stay high until -- a) we get
some production on line, which there's none that I know of --
or b) until we have a serious recession," said Sasha
Kostadinov, portfolio manager at Shaker Investments in
Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) were both
among the Nasdaq's top five advancers as speculation continued
that pressure from Yahoo's shareholders would revive takeover
talks. Shares of Microsoft, which abandoned its bid for Yahoo
at the weekend, ended at $29.70, while Yahoo closed at
$25.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But higher energy costs threatened to crimp consumer
spending. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the world's biggest
retailer, was the top drag on the Dow. Wal-Mart's stock
fell1.1 percent to $56.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June crude CLM8
settled at $121.84 a barrel, up $1.87, or a gain of 1.56
percent for the session. Earlier, NYMEX June crude climbed as
high as a record $122.73 a barrel, which eclipsed Monday's
intraday record of $120.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Compared with a year ago, U.S. crude oil futures prices
are up $59.91 a barrel -- or almost 97 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was modest, with
about 1.23 billion shares changing hands, below last year's
estimated daily average of 1.90 billion. On the Nasdaq, about
2.21 billion shares traded, above last year's daily average of
2.17 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advancers outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by a ratio of
almost 2 to 1, while on the Nasdaq, about three stocks rose
for every two that fell.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms J.P. Morgan's commercial mortgage
pass-through certificates, series 2004-CIBC9, as follows:

   --$24 million class A-1 at 'AAA';

   --$146 million class A-2 at 'AAA';

   --$103.7 million class A-3 at 'AAA';

   --$466.3 million class A-4 at 'AAA';

   --$161.1 million class A-1A at 'AAA';

   --Interest-only class X at 'AAA';

   --$27.5 million class B at 'AA';

   --$13.8 million class C at 'AA-';

   --$20.7 million class D at 'A';

   --$11 million class E at 'A-';

   --$15.2 million class F at 'BBB+';

   --$9.6 million class G at 'BBB';

   --$17.9 million class H at 'BBB-';

   --$2.8 million class J at 'BB+';

   --$4.1 million class K at 'BB';

   --$5.5 million class L at 'BB-';

   --$5.5 million class M at 'B+';

   --$2.8 million class N at 'B';

   --$2.8 million class P at 'B-'.

   Fitch does not rate the $13.8 million class NR.

   The affirmations reflect stable pool performance and limited
paydown (4.4%) since issuance. As of the April 2008 distribution date,
the pool's aggregate principal balance is $1.05 billion compared to
$1.10 billion at issuance. Loans with full or partial interest-only
periods comprise approximately 32.6% of the transaction.

   Currently, there are two loans in special servicing (4.8%), one of
which (0.5%) is expected to incur losses. The loan is secured by three
industrial properties in Portage, MI and is 90+ days delinquent. The
loan transferred to special servicing in April 2006 due to
delinquency. Fitch-projected losses on the specially serviced loan are
expected to be absorbed by the nonrated class NR. The second loan
being specially serviced (4.3%) is secured by a retail mall located in
Sacramento, CA. The loan transferred in March of 2008 and the special
servicer is in the process of gathering more details on the loan. At
this time, the loan remains current. Fitch will closely monitor the
progression of this loan as more details regarding its resolution
become available.

   Fitch reviewed the shadow ratings of both the Centro Retail
Portfolio II (13.5%) and Grace Building (11.0%). Both loans maintain
investment-grade shadow ratings.

   The Centro Retail Portfolio is secured by seven,
cross-collateralized anchored retail properties in northern and
southern California. Performance for the portfolio has improved
slightly from issuance and occupancy remains strong at 99% as of
year-end (YE) 2007.

   The Grace Building is secured by a 1,518,210 square foot office
building located in New York, NY. Only the A-1 note is included in the
trust; the pari-passu A-2 and A-3 notes and a subordinate B-note are
held outside the trust. The interest-only period of the loan has
expired and the borrower is now making principal and interest
payments. Servicer provided occupancy as of YE 2007 is 97.2%.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
Published ratings, criteria and methodologies are available from this
site, at all times. Fitch's code of conduct, confidentiality,
conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance and other
relevant policies and procedures are also available from the 'Code of

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
CWALT Pass-Through Trust 2008-IO/PO is rated by Fitch Ratings as
follows:

   --$7,453,297,811 (notional) class IO-FM 'AAA';

   --$24,146,691,259 (notional) class IO-FS 'AAA';

   --$22,780,141 class PO-FM 'AAA';

   --$30,884,905 class PO-FS 'AAA'.

   Class IO-FM of this transaction is a resecuritization of 40
interest-only senior residential mortgage pass-through certificates
(securities listed in Exhibit A) which represents beneficial ownership
interest in a pool of primarily one- to four-family, first lien
residential mortgage loans. As a resecuritization, the certificates
will receive their cash-flow from the underlying classes of
certificates.

   Class IO-FS of this transaction is a resecuritization of 108
interest-only senior residential mortgage pass-through certificates
(securities listed in Exhibit B) which represents beneficial ownership
interest in a pool of primarily one- to four-family, first lien
residential mortgage loans. As a resecuritization, the certificates
will receive their cash-flow from the underlying classes of
certificates.

   Class PO-FM of this transaction is a resecuritization of 18
principal-only senior residential mortgage pass-through certificates
(securities listed in Exhibit C) which represents beneficial ownership
interest in a pool of primarily one- to four-family, first lien
residential mortgage loans. As a resecuritization, the certificates
will receive their cash-flow from the underlying classes of
certificates.

   Class PO-FS of this transaction is a resecuritization of 31
principal-only senior residential mortgage pass-through certificates
(securities listed in Exhibit D) which represents beneficial ownership
interest in a pool of primarily one- to four-family, first lien
residential mortgage loans. As a resecuritization, the certificates
will receive their cash-flow from the underlying classes of
certificates.

   Interest-Only (IO) certificates are extremely sensitive to
voluntary and involuntary prepayments, which the rating on the
securities does not address. If voluntary and involuntary prepayments
are faster than anticipated, investors may fail to recover their
initial investment.

   Principal-Only (PO) certificates are extremely sensitive to
prepayments, which the rating on the securities does not address. If
prepayments are slower than anticipated, investors' yields may be
adversely affected. The rating on PO certificates only addresses the
return of the principal balances thereof.

   QUICK CRETE CREATES ECOCAST, THE NEW RECYCLED PRECAST CONCRETE MIX
FOR GREEN BUILDING INDUSTRY

   Innovative Formula Reduces Use of New Resources by 70%

   In the constantly evolving building industry, there is more
pressure than ever for builders to adhere to green-building standards
and to qualify for The Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design
(LEED) Green Building Rating System(TM) project points.

   To easily make at least one aspect of a builder's project
eco-friendly, Quick Crete Products Corp., a national leader in the
precast concrete industry, has created Ecocast, made from 70% post
consumer and industrial waste.

   The result of extensive research and development, Ecocast is a mix
of Recycled Aggregates and other green construction materials such as
pozzolans, meeting the strict standards required to help builders
achieve LEED project points.

   "We are absolutely committed to creating sustainable-building
solutions for our customers, as well as for the environment," said
Rick Crook, CEO of Quick Crete Products Corp.

   Utilizing a high quality Type 111 cement conforming to current
ASTM standard specifications, this formula produces an average
compressive strength of 5000 P.S.I. in 28 days. Grade 60 rebar, rated
at 80,900 P.S.I. tensile strength, reinforces each product.

   Ecocast can be used in a vast array of projects from luxury hotel
facades to perimeter security protection. Quick Crete's website,
www.quickcrete.com, has a detailed description of the resource-saving
mix and how it can benefit the environment.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to close)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 6 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday as
Fannie Mae's FNM.N reassuring comments about the credit and
housing markets buoyed financial shares, while record crude
oil prices lifted shares of energy companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speculation that Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) could resume
takeover talks with Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) fed a rebound in
technology shares. Yahoo gained 5.5 percent, while Microsoft
rose 2.1 percent, leading the SP 500's advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After an early retreat, the session turned positive when
top executives of Fannie Mae, the largest U.S. home finance
company, said the worst of the credit market turmoil erupting
from the real estate slowdown may have passed. That mitigated
earlier concern about its huge quarterly loss, and propelled a
broad rally in financial stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fannie Mae climbed almost 9 percent, and smaller rival
Freddie Mac FRE.N gained 7.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil struck above $122 a barrel for the first time,
carrying energy shares higher with it and outweighing a
retreat in sectors sensitive to high fuel costs, such as
airlines and retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When I came to work today, we thought Fannie Mae's stock
will be trading south of $25, but somehow the investing public
got news that they had a pretty positive conference call,"
said Angel Mata, managing director of listed equity trading at
Stifel Nicolaus Capital Markets in Baltimore, Maryland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a lot of people that are eyeing the financials
right now, so if you're going to play the financials, Fannie
Mae and Freddie Mac have to be among them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI finished up 51.29
points, or 0.40 percent, at 13,020.83. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX ended up 10.77 points, or 0.77 percent, at
1,418.26. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC closed up 19.19
points, or 0.78 percent, at 2,483.31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Immediately after the closing bell, there was more
encouraging news that could help stocks extend their advance.
Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) posted a stronger-than-expected
quarterly profit, sending its shares up more than 3 percent in
after-hours trade from their close at $33.73 on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney, one of the world's largest media companies and
owner of the ABC television network, ESPN all-sports cable TV
network and Disney theme parks in Florida and southern
California, is seen as a bellwether of consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisco Systems Inc's (CSCO.O) shares jumped more than 2
percent after the bell from their Nasdaq close of $26.33 as
the network equipment maker also posted a profit that topped
estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the regular session, Fannie Mae shares finished at
$30.81, while Freddie Mac shares closed at $27.33. Other
financial standouts were insurer American International Group
Inc (AIG.N), which rose 2.1 percent to $48.40, and JPMorgan
Chase  Co (JPM.N), the No. 3 U.S. bank, whose stock added 0.4
percent to $48.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The optimism from Fannie Mae's comments also contributed
to a rise in the shares of home builders, with the Dow Jones
home construction index .DJUSHB up 2 percent for the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of D.R. Horton Inc (DHI.N), the largest U.S. home
builder, jumped 5.5 percent to $16.85 even as the company
posted a quarterly loss of $1.3 billion and halved its
dividend. For details, see [ID:nN06454667]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy shares rose after U.S. crude oil hit a record above
$122 a barrel. A stronger-than-expected profit from
independent oil and gas company Anadarko Petroleum Corp
(APC.N) also buoyed the energy sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil shares rose 0.6 percent to $90.07, while
ConocoPhillips (COP.N) climbed 1.8 percent to $88.74 and
Chevron Corp's (CVX.N)  shares gained 1.3 percent to $96.87,
while Anadarko shares climbed 9.4 percent to $74.53.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of oil services company Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N)
jumped 2 percent to $103.58. The oil index .OIX shot up 3.3
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said in a research
note that the price of oil could shoot up to $200 a barrel
within the next two years as part of a "super-spike" driven by
poor growth in oil supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Energy prices are going to stay high until -- a) we get
some production on line, which there's none that I know of --
or b) until we have a serious recession," said Sasha
Kostadinov, portfolio manager at Shaker Investments in
Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) were both
among the Nasdaq's top five advancers as speculation continued
that pressure from Yahoo's shareholders would revive takeover
talks. Shares of Microsoft, which abandoned its bid for Yahoo
at the weekend, ended at $29.70, while Yahoo closed at
$25.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But higher energy costs threatened to crimp consumer
spending. Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N), the world's biggest
retailer, was the top drag on the Dow. Wal-Mart's stock fell1.1 percent to $56.35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the New York Mercantile Exchange, June crude CLM8
settled at $121.84 a barrel, up $1.87, or a gain of 1.56
percent for the session. Earlier, NYMEX June crude climbed as
high as a record $122.73 a barrel, which eclipsed Monday's
intraday record of $120.36.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Compared with a year ago, U.S. crude oil futures prices
are up $59.91 a barrel -- or almost 97 percent.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds close of U.S. markets)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Herbert Lash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 6 (Reuters) - Oil shot to a record over $122
a barrel on Tuesday, and U.S. stocks rose on energy-related
shares and a gain in Microsoft over speculation it would resume
takeover talks with Yahoo that fell apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crude oil extended a rally that has seen prices double over
the past year as Goldman Sachs forecast oil could hit $200 as
part of a "super-spike" driven by a lack of adequate supply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price of U.S. 10-year Treasury notes dipped, erasing
earlier gains, as reassuring comments from Fannie Mae FNM.N,
the largest provider of U.S. home financing, helped send stocks
higher and dimmed bonds' safe-haven appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fannie Mae executives were cautiously optimistic that the
worst of a credit crisis that erupted from a housing market
slump may have passed. That triggered a big rally in Fannie Mae
shares and supported a wider advance in U.S. stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar extended declines against the euro and other
major currencies for a second day, and U.S. gold futures ended
slightly higher after initially scaling a one-week high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stocks spent much of the morning underwater after
Fannie Mae reported a $2.5 billion loss -- its third quarterly
loss in a row. That renewed credit jitters and raised the
safe-haven appeal of government debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Fannie Mae shares shed early losses to turn higher as
the tone of company executives on a conference call reassured
investors, analysts said. Fannie Mae said it is improving its
mortgage portfolio and shareholder value with the housing
market in the middle of a down cycle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whatever comments they're making are making people more

requirements necessary to enter China and over 180 other countries. Every
element is updated in real-time allowing us to accommodate the new Chinese rules

trips like the Olympics," he said.

BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) today reported earnings for the
second fiscal quarter and six months ended March 29, 2008. Diluted
earnings per share (EPS) for the second quarter increased to $0.58,
compared to $0.44 in the prior-year quarter. Earnings per share from
continuing operations in the prior-year quarter totaled $0.43.

   For the six-month period, diluted EPS was $1.21. EPS for the
prior-year six-month period, which included gains on sales of our
interests in E! Entertainment and Us Weekly, income from the
discontinued operations of the ABC Radio business, and an equity-based
compensation plan modification charge, which were all recognized in
the first quarter of fiscal 2007, were $1.24. Excluding these items,
EPS for the six-month period increased 30% to $1.21 from $0.93 in the
prior-year six months.

   "We had an outstanding quarter financially and creatively at The
Walt Disney Company," said Robert A. Iger, president and chief
executive officer. "This performance demonstrates how The Disney
Difference gives us a critical and sustainable market advantage. That
difference centers on our proven ability to create high-quality
content across our wide-ranging distribution and promotional
platforms, allowing us to leverage our hits and grow our company."

*T

   Cable Networks

   Operating income at Cable Networks increased 14% to $1.1 billion
for the quarter primarily due to growth at ESPN and, to a lesser
extent, higher income from our cable equity investments. The growth at
ESPN was driven by higher affiliate revenue primarily due to
contractual rate increases and subscriber growth, and advertising
revenues driven by higher rates, partially offset by higher
programming, administrative and marketing costs. Higher programming
costs were driven by increased rights costs arising from college
basketball contract renewals. Growth from our cable equity investments
was primarily due to higher affiliate and advertising revenue at
Lifetime and A

   Broadcasting

   Operating income at Broadcasting increased 17% to $223 million for
the quarter primarily due to the strong performance of ABC Studios
productions in international markets, led by Grey's Anatomy and Lost.
This growth was partially offset by the impact of the Writer's Guild
of America strike which limited the airing of original scripted
programming in primetime on the ABC Television Network resulting in
lower ratings and advertising revenues. The negative impact of the
strike on advertising revenue was partially offset by higher
advertising rates and lower programming costs due to the reduction in
hours of original scripted programming.

   Parks and Resorts

   Parks and Resorts revenues for the quarter increased 11% to $2.7
billion and segment operating income increased 33% to $339 million.
Operating income growth was due to improved results in our domestic
businesses and at Disneyland Resort Paris, both of which were
favorably impacted by the shift of the Easter holiday from the third
quarter in fiscal 2007 to the second quarter in fiscal 2008.

   Domestic Resorts

   Operating income growth at the domestic businesses was primarily
due to increased guest spending and theme park attendance at the Walt
Disney World Resort and higher revenues at Disney Vacation Club,
partially offset by higher operating costs at the Walt Disney World
Resort. Increased guest spending was due to higher average daily hotel
room rates, higher average ticket prices and increased food and
beverage spending. Higher attendance was primarily driven by the
benefit of the shift of the Easter holiday. The increase in operating
costs was driven by labor cost inflation, new guest offerings and
volume-related expenses. The benefit from higher revenues at Disney
Vacation Club reflected extensions of the term of ownership on certain
existing vacation home properties and higher rentals of vacation club
units.

   International Resorts

   Operating income growth at Disneyland Resort Paris was primarily
due to increased attendance and higher guest spending, partially
offset by higher operating costs. Increased guest spending was driven
by higher average daily hotel room rates. Higher operating costs were
driven by volume-related expenses and labor cost inflation.

   Studio Entertainment

   Studio Entertainment revenues for the quarter increased 18% to
$1.8 billion and segment operating income increased 61% to $377
million. Segment operating income growth was primarily due to
increases in domestic home entertainment and worldwide theatrical
distribution.

   The growth in domestic home entertainment was driven by higher
unit sales reflecting the performance of current quarter titles, which
included Enchanted, Game Plan and No Country for Old Men as compared
to Peter Pan Platinum Release, The Guardian and The Prestige in the
prior-year quarter.

   The increase in worldwide theatrical distribution was driven by
lower distribution expenses due to significant marketing costs in the
prior-year quarter for Meet the Robinsons, which was released at the
end of March 2007, and the domestic performance of current quarter
titles led by the continued success of National Treasure 2: Book of
Secrets and the release of Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both
Worlds. In international markets, the improvement was primarily due to
the strong performance of Enchanted and National Treasure 2: Book of
Secrets.

   Consumer Products

   Consumer Products revenues for the quarter increased 10% to $551
million and segment operating income decreased 14% to $107 million.
Lower segment operating income for the quarter was primarily due to
lower recognition of minimum guarantee revenues at Merchandise
Licensing and decreased revenue from licensed product at Disney
Interactive Studios reflecting our continuing transition towards
self-published titles. These decreases were partially offset by higher
earned royalties at Merchandise Licensing and higher sales of
self-published titles at Disney Interactive Studios. Higher earned
royalties were driven by sales of Hannah Montana and High School
Musical merchandise and increased sales at Disney Interactive Studios
reflected the performance of Turok and High School Musical in the
current quarter compared to Meet the Robinsons and Spectrobes in the
prior-year quarter.

   OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

   Corporate and Unallocated Shared Expenses

   Corporate and unallocated shared expenses decreased from $130
million to $98 million for the quarter driven by an increase in the
allocation of costs to the business segments and the timing of
expenses in various corporate departments.

   Net Interest Expense

   The increase in interest expense for the quarter was primarily due
to higher average debt balances.

   Minority Interests

   Minority interest expense increased from $3 million to $50 million
for the quarter due to the impacts of decreased losses at Hong Kong
Disneyland and Disneyland Resort Paris and increased profits at ESPN.
The minority interest is determined on income after royalties,
financing costs and income taxes.

   (1) Free cash flow is not a financial measure defined by GAAP. See
the discussion of non-GAAP financial measures that follows below.

   Cash provided by operations increased by $567 million to $3.3
billion primarily due to higher segment operating income and the
timing of payments for accounts payable and accrued expenses,
partially offset by the timing of accounts receivable collections and
higher investments in Disney Vacation Club properties.

   (1) Net borrowings is a non-GAAP financial measure. See the

   The total borrowings shown above include $3,930 million and $3,583
million attributable to Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland as of
March 29, 2008 and September 29, 2007, respectively. Cash and cash
equivalents attributable to Euro Disney and Hong Kong Disneyland
totaled $594 million and $604 million as of March 29, 2008 and
September 29, 2007, respectively.

   In April 2008, the Company completed the redemption of its $1.3
billion of 2.125% convertible senior notes due 2023 (the Notes).
Substantially all of the Notes were converted into common stock based
on the conversion ratio of 33.9443 for each $1,000 of principal,
resulting in the issuance of 45 million shares of the Company's common
stock.

   Non-GAAP Financial Measures

   This earnings release presents earnings per share excluding
certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment
operating income, all of which are important financial measures for
the Company but are not financial measures defined by GAAP.

   These measures should be reviewed in conjunction with the relevant
GAAP financial measures and are not presented as alternative measures
of earnings per share, borrowings, cash flow or net income as
determined in accordance with GAAP. Earnings per share excluding
certain items, net borrowings, free cash flow, and aggregate segment
operating income as we have calculated them may not be comparable to
similarly titled measures reported by other companies.

   Earnings per share excluding certain items - The Company uses
earnings per share excluding certain items to evaluate the performance
of the Company's operations exclusive of certain items that impact the
comparability of results from period to period, including significant
dispositions and acquisitions. In the prior-year six months, these
items included gains on sales of equity investments in E!
Entertainment and Us Weekly, income from the discontinued ABC Radio
business and a charge related to a modification of equity-based
compensation plans in connection with the ABC Radio transaction. The
Company believes that information about earnings per share exclusive
of these impacts is useful to investors, particularly where the impact
of the excluded items is significant in relation to reported earnings,
because the measure allows for comparability between periods of the
operating performance of the Company's business and allows investors
to evaluate separately the impact of decisions regarding the sale and
acquisition of interests in businesses from the impact of the
operations of the business. The following table reconciles reported
earnings per share to earnings per share excluding certain items:

*T

   (1) Diluted EPS excluding certain items may not equal the sum of
the column due to rounding.

   Net borrowings - The Company believes that information about net
borrowings provides investors with a useful perspective on our
financial condition. Net borrowings reflect the subtraction of cash
and cash equivalents from total borrowings. Since we earn interest
income on our cash balances that offsets a portion of the interest
expense we pay on our borrowings, net borrowings can be used as a
measure to gauge net interest expense. In addition, a portion of our
cash and cash equivalents is available to repay outstanding
indebtedness when the indebtedness matures or when other circumstances
arise. However, we may not immediately apply cash and cash equivalents
to the reduction of debt, nor do we expect that we would use all of
our available cash and cash equivalents to repay debt in the ordinary
course of business.

   Free cash flow - The Company uses free cash flow (cash provided by
continuing operations less investments in parks, resorts and other
property), among other measures, to evaluate the ability of its
operations to generate cash that is available for purposes other than
capital expenditures. Management believes that information about free
cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash
available to service debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments
and pay dividends or repurchase shares.

   Aggregate segment operating income - The Company evaluates the
performance of its operating segments based on segment operating
income, and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a
measure of the performance of operating businesses separate from
non-operating factors. The Company believes that information about
aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them
to evaluate changes in the operating results of the Company's
portfolio of businesses separate from non-operational factors that
affect net income, thus providing separate insight into both
operations and the other factors that affect reported results.

   A reconciliation of segment operating income to net income is as

   (1) The calculation of diluted earnings per share assumes the
conversion of the Company's convertible senior notes issued in April
2003 and adds back interest expense (net of tax) of $6 million and $11
million for the quarter and six months ended March 29, 2008,
respectively, and $6 million and $11 million for the quarter and six
months ended March 31, 2007, respectively.

   (2) Earnings per share may not equal the sum of the column due to
rounding.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Pannell Kerr Forster of Texas, P.C. (PKF Texas), the only
Houston-based accounting and technology consulting firm specializing
in Microsoft Dynamics NAV, has attained Gold Certified Partner status
for the third year in a row. The Gold Certified Partner status was
awarded in the Microsoft Business Solutions (MBS) and Information
Worker competencies. As a Gold Certified Partner, PKF Texas has
demonstrated expertise with Microsoft technologies and proven ability
to meet customers' needs.

   The Gold Certified Partner Status is the highest level of
achievement a technology consulting firm can attain as a Microsoft
Certified Partner. Gold Certified Partner Status represents the
highest levels of technical expertise, strategic thinking, and
hands-on skills and is awarded to just 4 percent of all Microsoft
Partners. PKF Texas is one of the few that also specializes in MBS,
which is the family of Microsoft Dynamics financial applications,
including Dynamics NAV, GP, SL, and CRM.

   The Microsoft Gold Certified Partner Program provides a way for
customers to identify companies that have proven their commitment and
expertise in one or more specialized areas when delivering Microsoft
technologies. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners must meet a higher set
of criteria for each category, including enhanced certification and a
portfolio of customer references, and are thus identified as the most
skilled partners in specific solution areas.

   "I believe this award represents our continuing dedication to
being the best in Microsoft technologies," said Greg Price, Director,
Consulting Solutions. "From our involvement in the MBS Global
Development Team for Dynamics-NAV software to our ongoing commitment
to the highest standard of client service, we are devoted to bringing
sound accounting and technology solutions to companies. I want to
thank our clients and our Dynamics NAV team for all their hard work."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Oil could shoot up to $200 within the next two years as part of a "super-spike" driven by poor growth in oil supplies, investment bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe the current energy crisis may be coming to a head, as a lack of adequate supply growth is becoming apparent," Goldman said in the note made available to Reuters on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil hit a new record near $121 a barrel on Tuesday, continuing an advance which has seen it double over the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The possibility of $150-$200 per barrel seems increasingly likely over the next 6-24 months, though predicting the ultimate peak in oil prices as well as the remaining duration of the upcycle remains a major uncertainty," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, which was one of the first to point to a triple digit oil price more than two years ago, said it believed the market was approaching the crunch in the "super-spike".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "super-spike" theory argues that a lack of adequate supply growth along with price-insulated demand growth in non-OECD countries will lead to a dramatic and continuous rise in oil prices that will ultimately lead to a sharp correction in oil demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman analysts said the underlying drivers of the rise in oil prices remained firmly in place, noting poor growth in non-OPEC supplies, low OPEC spare capacity, restriction on foreign investment in key oil producing nations and healthy demand growth in non-OECD economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In our view, a gradual rally in prices is likely to be longer lasting than a sharp, sudden spike," the note written by U.S.-based analyst Arjun Murti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said it had raised its spot oil price forecasts for U.S. WTI crude for 2008 through to 2011 to $108 rising to $110 and $120 a barrel, up from  $96 rising to $105 and $110 respectively in its earlier forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see risk to our 2008 and 2009 forecasts as distinctly to the upside," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Santosh Menon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GREENWICH, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
Shift Control Media's series of original online games, developed
for Coca-Cola, have won a prestigious 2008 Webby Award in the category
of Interactive Advertising--Games and Applications. The entry also won
the Webby Awards' People's Voice Award in the same category. Open to
online fans around the world, who voted for their favorite Webby
nominees on a special web site, the People's Voice Awards were
sponsored by Nokia.

   Winners of the Webby's and the People's Voice Awards were
announced today, and will be honored at a gala in New York on June
10th. Dubbed "the Oscars of the Internet" by The New York Times, the
Webby's are the leading international award honoring excellence on the
Internet, including websites, interactive advertising, online film and
video and mobile websites. They're presented by the International
Academy of Digital Arts and Sciences.

   "This is a defining achievement for our company, which was founded
on the premise that games provide marketers with fresh, relevant and
engaging ways for consumers to interact with their brands," says Shift
Control President and CEO Tim Zuckert. "We're grateful to our
colleagues at AKQA, Coke's digital agency, and at Coca-Cola for the
opportunity to work with them on this project, and we're thrilled that
the result of this collaboration was honored by the Webby Awards
jury."

   The four original games created by Shift Control are incorporated
into Coca-Cola's "Happiness Factory" web site, www.coke.com/HF. The
agency built the site around Coke's "Happiness Factory" animated Super
Bowl TV spot, which first aired in 2007.

   AKQA's elaboration of the TV ad for interactive media envisioned a
world where applying for a job at the factory, and playing the part of
its fictitious workers comes to life for the enjoyment of Coca-Cola
consumers around the globe. Coca-Cola leveraged Shift Control's unique
blend of game industry and brand marketing expertise to develop
original high quality games which are a core component of the overall
digital experience. In the games, players are challenged with multiple
levels of console-quality gameplay as they assume the roles of
Chinoink, Capper, Kissy Puppy, and Mortar Man.

   To play the "Happiness Factory" games, go to
http://www.coca-cola.com/HF, enter the site and then click on 'Start
Working' once the Happiness Factory page loads.

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) -Microsoft Corp does not rule out partnerships with other companies but has nothing imminent, Chairman Bill Gates said on Tuesday, after the software company pulled a $47.5 billion bid for Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft walked away from its bid to buy Yahoo on Saturday, after the Internet company turned down its $33-per-share offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The key decisions on that will be made by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer, who took a look at Yahoo and decided that, on our own, he likes the stuff that we're doing," Gates said in response to a reporter's question about Microsoft's plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't rule out some partnerships but we don't have anything imminent there," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gates' comments were part of a media pool report. He spoke after meeting South Korean President Lee Myung-bak to discuss cooperation with South Korean companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft courted Yahoo to capitalize on the rapidly growing market for Internet advertising, which has long been served by Yahoo's search, e-mail and Web communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also trying to fend off the expansion of Google, which has made inroads into Microsoft's home turf with a portfolio of Web based-applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft now needs to convince investors it has a viable alternative to fix an online business that has racked up nine straight quarters of losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Marie-France Han and Rhee So-eui; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has come to the "end of the story" with Yahoo Inc and will now focus on its own, clear strategy of evolving as a leading provider of Internet services, the president of Microsoft International said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jean-Philippe Courtois told Reuters in an interview in London on Tuesday Microsoft had made a compelling offer but had decided to walk away after much discussion because the "stars just didn't align".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We decided to move on and basically withdraw our offer and continue (executing) on our strategy to become and evolve as a leading provider of Internet services in the online advertising world, media, social networking etc," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So that is what the company is going to focus on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if that was the end of the story with Yahoo, he replied: "Absolutely, that's the end of the story. We are moving on because our strategy is very clear."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo chief Jerry Yang told Reuters in an interview on Monday he had "mixed feelings" about events at the weekend, when talks broke down, but said Yahoo would still be open and more than willing to listen if Microsoft had anything new to say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Yahoo fell 15 percent on Monday and some analysts said the drop was cushioned by investors who were betting Microsoft would eventually come back to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kate Holton and Matt Cowan; Editing by David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 6 (Reuters) - Global economic growth remained
well below trend in April as manufacturers and service providers
faced tough market conditions while prices reached a 10-year
high, an all-industry indicator suggested on Tuesday.
 The Global Total Output index, produced by JP Morgan with
research and supply management organisations, dipped to 51.0 in
April from 51.9 in March, although remaining above the 50 mark
that divides growth from contraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The survey remained well above the low of 47.7 recorded at
the start of the year but JP Morgan's David Hensley did not
foresee an upturn soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "April data provided little evidence of a near-term
improvement in the rate of expansion of the global economy.
Companies are still facing a combination of weak market
conditions and rising inflationary pressures," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inflationary pressures rose further to 70.7, the highest
seen since the survey began in 1998, pushed up by soaring energy
and raw material prices and rising labour costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Global Services index fell to 51.0 in April from 52.1 in
March. The index combines data from countries including the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and
Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jonathan Cable; Editing by Ron Askew)

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced first-of-a-kind self checkout technology that
allows
consumers to shop for and check out purchases practically anywhere in a
store.  This new self checkout solution raises the bar for consumer self-service
options, giving retailers built-in flexibility, improved customer service and a
new tool for building customer advocacy for their brands.

    IBM also announced a new release of software to help speed the self checkout
process, a new state-of-the-art entry-level kiosk, and an extension of its
global self-service alliance program to reach new markets and industries.

    Designed for small businesses and large enterprise departments, the IBM
AnyPlace Checkout system is the next major step in self checkout innovation. It
combines the ultra-compact footprint of the market-leading IBM AnyPlace Kiosk
with the
robust capabilities of IBM self checkout software, giving clients the best of
both
worlds.

    According to a recent customer purchasing survey*, 10 percent of shoppers
who left
a store without making a purchase cited the wait to check out as a factor
in their decision  not to buy. More importantly, when forced to wait in line
for more than four minutes, customer satisfaction levels fall below 80 percent.

    Small to midsized retailers can now offer a fast, convenient checkout system
for
small orders, including those in specialty, drug and convenience store
environments.
Large retail operations can complement front-end self checkout with
stand-alone placement of these units within grocery areas such as deli, floral
or prepared foods, as well as departments of large stores and hospitality
retailers.

    "Today's market environment is tough and competitive, and there is huge
pressure on retailers to transform and innovate, all driven by a need to
change the shopping experience for consumers," said Steve Ladwig, General
Manager, Retail Store Solutions, IBM System &amp; Technology Group. "The IBM
AnyPlace Checkout allows us to help our clients serve their customers in
totally new ways, answering consumer demand for easy-to-use self service in more
places than ever before."

    According to an IHL Group 2007 market study on self checkout**, 98 percent
of
respondents have used self checkout, almost 50 percent have used it more than
five times in the previous years, and 72 percent have readily accepted the
technology in the marketplace. This study also reported that for 2008,
consumers will spend more than US $230.7 billion on self checkout transactions
at
retail stores, up 28 percent over 2007.

    "Self checkout not only continues to gain widespread acceptance with
consumers, but we are also seeing that self-service solutions are paying off for
retailers," said Greg Buzek, President, IHL Consulting Group. "Our research
shows that retailers that have embraced self-service technologies are
redeploying
labor to key profit areas, improving customer service with more lanes and
improving profitability by increasing the number of profitable transactions."

    The IBM AnyPlace Checkout system expands the proven and successful IBM
SelfCheckout family by extending the capability of when and where retailers
canoffer self-service transactions. This first-of-its-kind unit is the second
major
offering in an aggressive IBM consumer services campaign, and joins a
growing portfolio of IBM and Business Partner self-service offerings that span
multiple industries, including retail, hospitality, travel and transportation.

    IBM also announced today a new release of IBM Checkout Environment for
Consumer-Service (CHEC), self checkout software that delivers a robust
environment through a rich user experience, simple manageability and reliable
Point-of-Sale integration. The modular software platform also allows for IBM
Business Partners to tailor to a retailer's specific needs.

    A completely new self checkout design, the IBM AnyPlace Checkout system
offers
retailers new features and enhanced flexibility, making it easy for consumers
to scan and pay for their items quickly. This new self checkout unit offers a
variety of hardware and software enhancements that include:


--  Small Footprint: Designed with the IBM AnyPlace Kiosk at its core,
    this unit offers one of the smallest self checkout footprints available,
    making it attractive for grocers and other businesses that have limited
    floor space.

--  Customized Enclosures: Offers flexibility to utilize a variety of
    enclosures including customized designs by IBM Global Technology Services
    or third party vendors that match a retailer's "look and feel."

--  Cashless: These units offer credit/debit payment options only, which
    speeds transactions by eliminating the time it takes to accept and dispense
    bills and coins, as well as lowers the chance of shoppers forgetting their
    change.

--  Manageability: A component of IBM Store Integration Framework, the
    Remote Management Agent (RMA) enables retailers to achieve end-to-end store
    systems management of retail devices and applications along side
    traditional IT deployment.  Across the enterprise, retailers can configure
    and monitor the system remotely, distribute software, track assets and
    determine and diagnose problems.
    

    
New Entry-Level IBM AnyPlace Kiosk

    IBM also introduced an entry-level AnyPlace Kiosk that can be used for a
variety of kiosk applications or as a compact point-of-sale. This newest
AnyPlace Kiosk 15" model allows small independent businesses to use advanced
kiosk technology previously only available to large enterprises at a price
they can afford.  Additionally, the kiosk can be used by larger businesses for a
variety of kiosk applications including product locators, price checkers and
more.
This entry-level kiosk unit comes with an energy-efficient processor and
built-in power management capabilities that allow clients to reduce power
consumption and run essential applications quickly and reliably. It is geared
toward
specialty, food service, gas and convenience retail businesses and is also
tailored for use across multiple industries such as travel and transportation,
hospitality and healthcare.

    IBM Business Partner Alliance Program Momentum

    IBM also announced that approximately 100 Business Partners have joined
itsSelf-Service Alliance Program. Since its introduction last September in
conjunction with the IBM Consumer Services Initiative, Business Partners
representing 11 industries, 18 solution areas and 17 countries have signed up to
help develop, market and distribute IBM self-service solutions worldwide,
helping
extend IBM leadership in self service across multiple industries. In just eight
months, the IBM Self-Service Alliance program has grown into one of the
largest business partner ecosystem focused on self-service for multiple
industries, including pharmacy, banking, government and manufacturing. The
program
represents nine new countries, including Israel, Malaysia, Romania and
Guatemala.

    Pricing and Availability

    The IBM AnyPlace Checkout will be available May 23 and is approximately half
the price
of a traditional self checkout system.

&lt;p&gt;MONTERREY, Mexico--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has assigned a 'BBB+' rating to Grupo Televisa,
S.A.B.'s (Televisa) proposed US$500 million senior notes issuance.
Proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, repayment of
outstanding indebtedness and shares repurchase. In addition, Fitch has
affirmed Televisa's ratings as follows:

   --Local currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+';

   --Foreign currency IDR at 'BBB+';

   --National scale long-term rating at 'AAA(mex)'.

   Fitch affirmed the following ratings:

   --Outstanding balance of US$11.3 million of 8.0% Sr. Notes due
2011 (Originally US$300 million) at 'BBB+';

   --US$600 million 6.625% Sr. Notes due 2025 at 'BBB+';

   --US$300 million 8.5% Sr. Notes due 2032 at 'BBB+';

   --MXP 4,500 million 8.49% Sr. Notes due 2037 at 'BBB+' and
'AAA(mex)'.

   The Outlook for all ratings is Stable.

   Televisa's ratings are based in its strong business profile, solid
cash flow generation and ample liquidity. Televisa is the largest
media company in the Spanish-speaking world and the largest television
broadcasting company in Mexico. The company's track record of
successful production of content and programming has translated into
stable audience shares in the past years enabling Televisa to maintain
solid advertising revenues. The company's high-quality content has
proved to be attractive for Mexican and Latin American audiences and
is expanding to other regions in the world.

   In addition, the ratings for Televisa consider increased business
diversification of the company. For 2007, TV Broadcasting represented
50% of total sales and EBITDA, while DTH satellite service provider
Innova S. de R. L. (Innova or Sky) and cable television operator
Empresas Cablevision, S.A.B. de C.V. (Cablevision) represented 26% of
total revenues and 28% of EBITDA. However, Televisa faces increased
competition along its major business segments. The company plans to
continue expanding the pay television business lines to further
participate in the consolidation of the Mexican telecommunications
industry. In this sense, Televisa acquired a 50% stake in
Monterrey-based cable operator Television Internacional, S.A. de C.V.
and a 49% stake in national cable operator Cablemas, S.A. de C.V.,
pending anti-trust regulatory approval. In conjunction with these
companies, Cablevision acquired the majority of the assets of Bestel,
a national telecommunications service provider, which main asset is an
8.0 thousand kilometer fiber optic network.

   Televisa's financial profile remains strong. During the last
twelve months ended March 31, 2008 the company had EBITDA of $17.9
billion pesos and a consolidated EBITDA margin of 42.0%. TV
Broadcasting segment alone had a margin of 48.4% similar to the 50.5%
registered in 2006 which included special political and sports events.
EBITDA to gross interest expense was 8.1 times(x) compared to 8.5x in
2006 and total debt to EBITDA was 1.4x compared to 1.2x in 2006.
Televisa's liquidity is ample with cash and marketable securities
balance of $30.6 billion pesos and total debt (including satellite
operating leases) of $25.4 billion pesos. Short term debt represents
only 1.4% of total debt. During 2007, Televisa sold its shares in
Univision for a total amount of US$1.1 billion which in conjunction
with cash generated internally was used to fund acquisitions and
capex, as well as pay dividends and share repurchases of over US$760
million.

   Televisa is the largest media company in the Spanish-speaking
world. The company's main businesses are television broadcasting in
Mexico and the production of programming content. In addition,
Televisa controls the largest pay-TV operators in Mexico through its
stakes in cable TV operator Cablevision and DTH satellite provider
Innova (Sky). Televisa's other businesses include radio production and
broadcasting, as well as publishing and publishing distribution,
sports books and draw numbers. In the last twelve months ended in
March 31, 2008 Televisa generated net revenues and EBITDA of MXP42.6
billion and MXP17.9 billion, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;KUWAIT May 6 (Reuters) - OPEC-member Kuwait has yet to
conclude a deal with U.S. major Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) to
boost output of heavy crude, but still aims to sign the contract
by July, a top Kuwaiti oil official said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Raising heavy crude capacity is part of Kuwait's plan to
increase its output potential to 4 million barrels per day (bpd)
from around 2.8 million bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are still in the negotiations stage. Until now we have
not concluded (a deal)," Sami al-Rushaid, managing director of
Kuwait's state-run upstream oil unit, told reporters on the
sidelines of a company function.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We hope to reach it by then," he replied when asked if the
contract would still be signed by July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kuwait Oil Company (KOC) and Exxon announced in October the
preliminary deal for the U.S. firm to help explore and produce
oil from the Lower Fars oilfield in the north of the Gulf Arab
State. The two said then they hoped to reach the final deal by
July. Political turmoil in the country has led to concern that
new oil contract negotiations would be prolonged or delayed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any contract would have a performance-related bonus built
into it, said Rushaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "One of the standards included (in the contract) if we
reached a deal to be based on performance or production
criteria," he said, declining to be more specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kuwait is negotiating several service contracts with oil
majors to help meet its capacity expansion target. Majors prefer
deals that allow them a share of output, but Kuwait bans foreign
ownership of its oil and gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The performance-related clause in the new contracts it is
negotiating aims to keep the majors interested without the Gulf
Arab state signing away sovereign rights to its oil and gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kuwait, the world's seventh-largest oil producer, said last
year it aimed to produce 50,000 bpd of heavy oil by 2011 and
250,000 bpd by 2015 as part of its plans to boost oil output to
4 million bpd by 2020.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Target Corporation (Target; NYSE: TGT) has announced an agreement
to sell approximately 47% of the principal amount of its outstanding
receivables for cash proceeds of approximately $3.6 billion,
indicating an initial purchase discount of 7%. The transaction is
expected to close before the end of May.

   Fitch expects Target's credit profile to remain steady following
the transaction. In fiscal 2008 which ended Feb. 2, 2008, revenue
growth and steady operating profit margin have resulted in EBITDAR
coverage of interest and rents of 7.8 times (x) and total adjusted
debt/EBITDAR of 2.6x.

   Under the terms of the agreement, Target and JPMorgan Chase have
agreed to share the expected profits from this arrangement pro rata to
their respective ownership interests, subject to a cap, which is
initially set at an annualized yield of approximately 3.4% of the
principal amount of JPMorgan Chase's interest in the receivables and
will vary over time with changes in one-month LIBOR. JPMorgan Chase
will earn an additional return over the initial 5-year term of the
transaction as a result of accretion from the 7% discount. In
addition, the companies would each bear a pro rata share of net
portfolio losses, if any were to occur in the future. The transaction
is expected to provide Target with sufficient liquidity for its
financing needs, including previously announced capital investment and
share repurchase activity, without the need to access term debt
capital markets again this year.

   Fitch rates Target as follows:

   --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A';

   --Bank credit facility at 'A';

   --Senior Notes at 'A'.

   --Short-term IDR at 'F1';

   --Commercial paper at 'F1'.

   The Rating Outlook is Stable.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that independent analyst firm OSS Observer has
ranked IBM as the worldwide leader in telecommunications software revenue
for the overall service assurance market (1). This marks the first time OSS
Observer has ranked IBM as the overall leader for this market.

    Communications service providers rely on service assurance software to
monitor the reliability of their service delivery to customers, tracking such
key
areas as network compatibility, proactively identifying and fixing problems
before they happen and allocating additional resources to meet sudden spikes
in demand. The software works in tandem with other key business areas of
telecommunications, including customer service, billing and network management
systems, for example.

    IBM's strong growth was fueled by a dual strategy of growing IBM's
existingbusiness as well as quickly integrating and growing its strategic
acquisitions of
Micromuse and Vallent technology. Micromuse was acquired in February 2006
and Vallent in February 2007.

    The report states, "IBM has been able to successfully transition the
telecommunication software businesses it acquired into the Tivoli business unit
and still maintain its focus on the telecommunication market without much
disruption to the large existing Micromuse and Vallent customer base."

    According to the OSS Observer, service assurance spending is forecast to
grow from $2.3 billion in 2007 to $3.5 billion in 2012 at 9 percent CAGR. IBM
is the largest commercial supplier of service assurance solutions at 11
percent market penetration, said OSS Observer, and has a leading position in the
fault, performance, and service management segments.

    According to the firm, the main factors driving service assurance spending
are
competition in mature markets to assure a positive customer experience, support
of
complex access networks, IP enablement, and a focus on improving the efficiency
of
the field workforce.

    Also according to the report, IBM continued to outpace competitors to
claimthe number one spot in the segment of Fault and Event Management for
operations support systems (OSS) which includes fixed, mobile and
broadbandsegments. OSS Observer forecasts the fault and event management market
willgrow from $555 million in 2007 to $842 million in 2012, a CAGR of 9 percent.

    IBM also topped the Performance Monitoring market segment, which OSS
Observer
forecasts will grow from $323 million in 2007 to $497 million in 2012, a
CAGR of 9 percent. According to the firm, broadband, mobile access and backhaul
data services will generate strong demand for this market segment.

    "We expect IBM's market share to increase as a direct result of direct
selling
in emerging markets and expanding its base in accounts that it already
controls," said Patrick Kelly, partner and co-founder of OSS Observer. "IBM
also has a strong network equipment channel partnership. Further growth is
projected
from the IBM Global Services group which is expanding its managed services
business and acting as the prime integrator in major transformational projects
with
customers."

    IBM Tivoli Netcool software has been selected by more than 1,000 service
providers globally. The software helps service providers ensure service quality,
reduce operational costs and speed time to market. IBM software helps service
providers address emerging opportunities in next-generation network
transformation,
fixed/mobile convergence, and IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) deployment.

&lt;p&gt;Plans to Leverage Enhanced Training, Technical Resources To
                Benefit Financial Institution Customers
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Goldleaf Financial Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ:GFSI), a provider of
integrated technology-based solutions designed to improve the
performance of financial institutions, today announced that the
Company has achieved Gold Certified Partner status in Microsoft's
Partner Program. As a Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, Goldleaf has
demonstrated expertise with Microsoft technologies and proven ability
to meet its customers' needs. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners
receive a rich set of benefits, including access, training and support
with a goal of maximizing business potential for partners and their
customers.

   As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner
status, Goldleaf had to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft
Competencies are designed to help differentiate a partner's
capabilities with specific Microsoft technologies to customers looking
for a particular type of solution. Each competency has a unique set of
requirements and benefits, formulated to accurately represent the
specific skills and services that partners bring to the technology
industry. Goldleaf's Gold Certified Partner status was obtained with a
competency in ISV/Software Solutions, due to its commitment to the
Microsoft platform and its track record of developing robust and
reliable software products.

   "Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to
better enable ISVs (Independent Software Vendors) to meet customer
needs," said Sanjay Parthasarathy, corporate vice president of the
Developer and Platform Evangelism Group at Microsoft Corp. "They allow
ISVs to keep and win customers through their deep knowledge of
solutions-based Microsoft platform technologies. Microsoft has a long
history of working closely with ISV partners to help them deliver
compelling solutions and applications to our mutual customers, and the
Microsoft Competencies are an important step in continuing to enhance
vital relationships with ISVs worldwide."

&lt;p&gt;Strategy Companion Adds Business Intelligence Analytics to Microsoft Dynamics(TM) CRM 4.0

   Seamless Integration and Easy-To-Use Business Intelligence Enables

EL SEGUNDO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Strategy Companion Corporation announced today that its BI
Analytics for Dynamics CRM(TM) solution is now available on the new
Microsoft Dynamics(TM) CRM 4.0 platform, providing advanced Business
Intelligence (BI) reporting and analytics seamlessly integrated within
the Dynamics(TM) CRM (Customer Relationship Management) application.
Managers and employees can now gain a deeper understanding of the
marketing, sales, and service-related data residing in Dynamics(TM)
CRM 4.0, leading to faster, more informed, and better business
decisions. "With BI Analytics for Dynamics(TM) CRM, decision makers
can use and create easily understood reports and dashboards with key
information about their own part of the business," explains Bob
Abernethy, Strategy Companion VP of Customer and Partner Solutions.
"By integrating our BI Analytics solution with Microsoft Dynamics(TM)
CRM, organizations will reap the benefits of a deeper understanding of
their sales, marketing and service operations."

   "BI Analytics' Business Intelligence capabilities makes CRM users

reports open and running at one time. An automated installation

customer relationship management data, in less than twenty minutes.
There is no need to build a custom online analytical processing (OLAP)
cube.

   Extensive advanced analytics include dynamic reports, ad-hoc
queries, online analytical processing (MOLAP-ROLAP-HOLAP), advanced
analytical visualizations, and the ability to combine data, perform
drilling, slicing and dicing, ranking and sorting, calculation
creation, advanced time intelligence, exception highlighting, complex
graphing and more. Advanced visualizations include dozens of analytic
chart types in both 2D and 3D, 80/20 rules, Top/Bottom rules, data
bars, color gradients, icon sets, color themes, and more. Users have
complete control over the formatting of rows and columns and can
easily create conditional formatting to highlight exceptions.

profitability, leads analysis, opportunity analysis, opportunity
win/loss analysis, resource utilization, sales quota versus actual

&lt;p&gt;TEL AVIV May 6 (Reuters) - Israeli holding company Koor
Industries KOR.TA said on Tuesday it will sign another
agreement with Goldman Sachs in the coming days to expand the
amount of credit it can receive to invest in banking shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Koor's board has approved so far the investment of up to 1.5
billion shekels ($438.6 million) in shares of Credit Suisse
(CSGN.VX) and Barclays Bank (BARC.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the signing of the second agreement with Goldman Sachs
(GS.N), the amount of credit available to Koor will be $1.5
billion, of which $820 million would be a non-recourse loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Combined with the Koor's own capital, the company would have
up to $2.7 billion available to invest in shares, it said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Koor has already bought some shares in Barclays, but not in
significant amounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Koor is 49.5 percent held by Discount Investment Corp
(DISI.TA), a subsidiary of conglomerate IDB Development
(IDBD.TA). IDB also holds another 10 percent of Koor.

&lt;p&gt;WebMessenger Announces Commercial Availability of WebMessenger Mobile(TM) for Microsoft Office Communications Server

        WebMessenger Extends Unified Communications Platform to
                              BlackBerrys

   WebMessenger Mobile for Microsoft Office Communications Server to
 be Featured at the Wireless Enterprise Symposium in Orlando, May 13 -
                                  15
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
WebMessenger, a leader in enterprise mobile communications, today
announced the commercial availability of WebMessenger Mobile(TM) for
Microsoft Office Communications Server (OCS). The first-to-market
solution enables enterprises to extend their investments in the
popular Microsoft unified communications platform out to BlackBerry
mobile devices. WebMessenger Mobile for Microsoft OCS will be on
display in booth #831 at the Wireless Enterprise Symposium in Orlando,
Florida, May 13-15.

   "With today's announcement WebMessenger is seeking to capitalize
on two very fast-moving and high-growth industry trends," said Joe
Naylor, WebMessenger President. "First, adoption of Microsoft OCS in
the enterprise is increasing rapidly. Second, Research in Motion
continues to saturate the market with BlackBerry devices. At the
intersection of these trends is the critical need enterprises have to
mobilize Microsoft OCS out to BlackBerry units. WebMessenger currently
is the only vendor delivering a solution that fills this gap. We
expect demand for WebMessenger Mobile for Microsoft OCS to be
extraordinarily high in the coming months, as enterprise adoption of
Microsoft OCS and BlackBerrys continue to rise."

   "Mobility is a key driver and growth area in the multi-billion
dollar unified communications market," said Vanessa Alvarez, an
analyst in Yankee Group's Enterprise Research group. "Enterprises that
have invested heavily in desktop-based unified collaboration platforms
are looking to extend those benefits out to an increasingly mobile
workforce. As collaboration and the mobile device market proliferate
within the Anywhere Enterprise, the spoils will go to vendors offering
flexible and easy to deploy solutions that connect these technologies.
We see WebMessenger as a potentially disruptive player in this
emerging and valuable market."

   Microsoft OCS manages all real-time (synchronous) communications
including instant messaging, VoIP, audio and video conferencing. It
works with existing telecommunications systems, so business can deploy
advanced VoIP and conferencing without tearing out their legacy phone
networks. Microsoft OCS also powers presence, a key benefit of
Microsoft unified communications that unites all the contact
information stored in Active Directory with the ways people
communicate. With presence, business professionals can see at-a-glance
if someone is available and contact them with a click.

   WebMessenger Mobile for Microsoft OCS provides the mobile unified
communications tools that drive employee productivity, reduce
operational expenses and greatly increase workplace appeal to
tech-savvy, younger recruits. Each of these aspects contributes
significant operational and competitive advantages to companies that
deploy and encourage the use of Microsoft OCS and BlackBerrys
throughout their organizations. WebMessenger Mobile for Microsoft OCS
enables IT departments to maximize their return on investment in
Microsoft OCS by extending these capabilities out to their BlackBerry
user populations.

   WebMessenger Mobile for Microsoft OCS is deployed as an on-premise
enterprise solution and can be used by itself or in conjunction with
other WebMessenger Mobile solutions to federate leading IM networks,
connect with enterprise voice IP PBX platforms, extend persistent
group chat solutions, or leverage existing auditing and compliance
tracking solutions. Pricing for WebMessenger Mobile for Microsoft OCS
starts at $72 per seat. For additional information on enterprise
solutions and pricing, email sales@webmessenger.com.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said it will start offering television shows for its Zune portable media device, more than two years after Apple Inc introduced the feature for its iPod player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Zune has one thing that Apple's market-defining iPod and accompanying iTunes store does not -- TV programs from General Electric's NBC Universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those shows and more than 800 TV episodes including Comedy Central's "South Park" and MTV's "The Hills" will be available at the Zune store starting on Tuesday for the equivalent of $1.99 in Microsoft points that must be purchased in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Apple split with NBC, removing the network's television shows from iTunes. Microsoft will carry NBC shows like "The Office" and "Heroes" for playback on the Zune, which has failed to dent the dominant market share of Apple's iPod since its 2006 debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Zunes have video playback capability, but content available for the devices has been limited to music videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Quentin Bryar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK May 6 (Reuters) - Shares in Esso (Thailand)
(ESSO.BK), a Thai unit of Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), disappointed
investors with a smaller-than-expected 5 percent rise on their
debut as concerns over refining margins outweighed surging
global oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the weak debut, analysts expect this year to be a
busy year for fund raising in the Thai market, Southeast Asia's
best performer, as improving sentiment, boosted by recovering
economy, should attract more firms to go public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think it should have impact on other upcoming
IPOs. Esso is less attractive compared to rival like Thai Oil,
which is bigger and has more diversified businesses," said
Poranee Thongyen, head of research at Asia Plus Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil refiner and retailer Esso, 67.5 percent owned by Exxon
group, raised $294 million last month in the country's largest
IPO so far this year. Analysts had expected the stock to rise
about 30 percent on debut after the offer was priced near the
lower end of an indicative range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Falling refining margins raise concerns about the outlook
of the sector and it should be on downtrend in the second
half," UOB Kay Hian Securities senior analyst Kosin Sripaiboon
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Refining margins REF/MARGIN1 at Asian complex refineries
were at $3.02 a barrel on Tuesday, down from average $8.17 in
the last five days, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, shares in Esso were traded at 10.50 baht
($0.34), up 5 percent from the IPO price of 10 baht, after
opening at 10.90 baht, and hitting a high of 11 baht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The overall Thai stock market index .SETI edged up 0.3
percent. So far this year, it has fallen 1.4 percent, but still
Southeast Asia's best performer. Esso's turnover accounted for
about 11 percent of trade on the benchmark index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expected most oil refiners to post weaker refining
margins in the first quarter after top refiner Thai Oil
(TOP.BK) reported a worst-than-expected 35 percent fall in net
profit for the January-March period. [ID:nBKK166428]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thai Oil shares lost 2.7 percent to 71 baht on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valued at $1.12 billion at current market prices, Esso
ranks Thailand's third largest refiner after Thai Oil, worth
$4.7 billion, and PTT Aromatics PTTAR.BK, which is valued at
$3.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Esso refines 177,000 barrel per day (bpd), or 16 percent of
Thailand's total. It also runs 583 service stations, a 17
percent share of the Thai retail market, ranking it second
behind PTT PCL (PTT.BK).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 10.50 baht per share, the refiner trades at about 6
times 2008 earnings, versus 7.17 times for Thai Oil and 8.1 for
Singapore Petroleum SPCS.SI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Surging oil prices helped Esso's net profit quadruple in
2007, but analysts expect profits to drop this year as the
industry heads into a downward cycle in the second half when
new capacity hits the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike Thai Oil and PTTAR, Esso has no major plans to
expand capacity, meaning it has no major catalyst for earnings
growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Esso uses its proceed mainly to repay short term debt,
which is not attractive to investors in terms of growth
outlook, although it plans to pay an interim dividend of one
baht each," said Viwat Techapoonpol, strategist at Tisco
Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the closing prices, Esso offered a yield of 9.5 percent,
higher than 3.59 percent of the overall market.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Now that Microsoft Corp has shelved its bid for Yahoo Inc, it must convince investors it has a viable "Plan B" to fix an online business that has racked up nine straight quarters of losses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That may be difficult for investors with long memories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six months ago, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told a who's who of Silicon Valley that the software company was prepared to take an "independent" path in its challenge of Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said at the Web 2.0 summit in San Francisco that while a combination with Yahoo might make sense in the future, Microsoft believed the independent steps it was taking -- capital investment, research and development and smaller acquisitions -- would, ultimately, lead to success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Microsoft then offered $44.6 billion for Yahoo a few months later, and said it had been pursuing Yahoo for more than a year, many wondered whether Microsoft ever believed its "go it alone" strategy. After ending talks with Yahoo over the weekend, that strategy's viability could be tested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is imperative that in relatively short order Microsoft's management articulates a viable and credible new strategy for the online services business in the absence of Yahoo," Bernstein Research analyst Charles Di Bona wrote in a note to clients on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the caveat that returning to the prior, pre-Yahoo plan is likely to be neither credible nor well received."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's online unit, which accounts for 5 percent of revenue, is central to the company's future. It expects online advertising generated by the business to one day rival its bread-and-butter licensing revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The division will also guide Microsoft's transition in offering software that is delivered over the Web as a service instead of running locally on a computer's hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, the first trading day after it yanked its $47.5 billion offer for Yahoo, Microsoft shares fell 16 cents, or 0.55 percent, to $29.08. The stock rose 3 percent in early trading before giving back those gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts attributed the fall to a view that Microsoft was playing hardball with Yahoo and the deal was not actually dead, but others suggested the collapse of the Yahoo deal shed light on the challenges facing its online business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WINDOWS LIVE VS. MSN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far, Microsoft's rebranded Windows Live platform of Web services including e-mail and online photos has left some users confused about how it fits with existing MSN properties. Its Web search continues to lose market share to Google, even after a revamp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A future without Yahoo is a negative for Microsoft's online unit, as we have long believed that Microsoft needs to get more aggressive in order to close the gap with Google," FBR Capital Markets analyst David Hilal said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, in an e-mail to employees, Ballmer argued that Microsoft can achieve its goals without Yahoo. "We have a strategy in place to do so and we will continue to expand on this strategy and accelerate our progress."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In advocating the Yahoo deal, Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates and Ballmer had said Yahoo was the best and fastest way to gain the necessary scale for its online business to compete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last few years, Microsoft has worked to build and refine a Web search engine of its own, creating a new search advertising system called adCenter. More recently, it bought aQuantive, an online ad company, for $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those steps have yet to deliver significant progress toward its goal, building an advertising powerhouse to rival Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company was prepared to spend as much as $47.5 billion on Yahoo and it may choose to use that money to go on an Internet shopping spree instead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Time Warner Inc's AOL unit could give Microsoft a stronger position in online display advertising, while social networking sites like Facebook and MySpace, owned by News Corp, may supply a large and loyal audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But putting all those pieces together would require focused execution on a clear vision, something Microsoft's online business unit hasn't demonstrated in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the start of 2006, Microsoft's Web business has racked up losses totaling nearly $1.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, it has spent billions of dollars on massive data centers to provide the computing and storage infrastructure for services ranging from free e-mail to hosting business management software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft has tried for a long time and it hasn't really gotten anywhere with its online initiatives," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran. "If it's going to catch Google, it's got to get big, quick. Every day, Google gets stronger and stronger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc, whose shares fell as much as 20 percent on Monday after Microsoft Corp dropped its $47.5 billion bid for the Web company, is likely to face pressure and possibly a proxy battle from activist hedge funds looking to revive the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With billions of dollars in financial muscle, some activist hedge funds are already laying the groundwork for a campaign after the three-month talks between Microsoft and Yahoo collapsed last weekend. Microsoft walked away, saying it would not bid more than $33 per share for Yahoo, while Yahoo wanted $4 a share more to agree to the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say it would likely take one or more substantial, seasoned activists to buy a large stake in Yahoo and finance a credible multimillion-dollar proxy campaign. But at least one small firm, Ironfire Capital, is talking to other firms about running a director slate, according to Eric Jackson, who heads the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm mad," said Jackson, who was involved in a successful campaign last year to have former Yahoo Chief Executive Terry Semel replaced. "Yahoo's rejection was not in the best interests of shareholders, and the board needs to be held accountable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jackson's Naples, Florida-based firm has a minuscule holding in Yahoo, just 96 shares. But if other, larger hedge funds line up and buy at least 5 percent of the company's now-discounted stock and run a slate of director candidates that would favor a sale to Microsoft, the move could gain traction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With 1.25 billion Yahoo shares outstanding, a stake of 62 million shares, or around 5 percent, could cost more than $1.5 billion at today's price of around $24 per share. That leaves such a campaign likely only for the largest activists, such as Carl Icahn, William Ackman of Pershing Square Capital, Nelson Peltz' Trian Partners, Jana Partners and a handful of others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are not a lot of activists who can invest $1 billion," said Manny Pearlman, CEO of hedge fund Liberation Investment Group and veteran of numerous, smaller proxy battles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn, who led a high-profile campaign against Time Warner two years ago and has invested over $1 billion in Motorola in a current proxy campaign, is not currently a Yahoo investor and has no immediate plans to run a campaign, a person close to Icahn said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But experts said the billionaire New York financier could be in a prime position to put pressure on Yahoo to revive talks with Microsoft, since he was successful last year in negotiations to get Oracle Corp to return to the table to buy BEA Systems after Oracle walked away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a clear path to victory for someone willing to buy the stock and deliver the company to Microsoft at $33 a share," said a senior executive at one multi-billion dollar activist hedge fund who asked for anonymity. "You need a lead dog that runs the campaign, however."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In all proxy campaigns, timing is critical, and in this case, it favors investor activists. Since Yahoo has yet to set the date for its annual meeting, expected in July, activists still have time this year to submit candidates for the board, rather than being forced to wait until next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, by that time, Microsoft's interest in Yahoo may have cooled, leaving activists to demand other more speculative routes for Yahoo. If such a campaign collapses altogether and a fund has invested a large part of their assets in the hopes of a deal, "You have a real business franchise risk," said one hedge fund manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and South Korea's top carmaker Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) have agreed to build a music and information system to debut in cars sold in North America in 2010, the companies said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The companies did not reveal financial terms but South Korea's presidential Blue House said Microsoft and Hyundai Motor Group will invest $113 million and $166 million, respectively, in the "Automotive IT Innovation Center" they will set up jointly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is visiting Seoul to sign the agreement with Hyundai. Gates also met South Korean President Lee Myung-bak on Tuesday to discuss cooperation with South Korean companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first product under the partnership would be a voice-controlled system linking mobile devices to car stereo systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later versions are expected to include multimedia and navigation-related features, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal will add a new competitor to Ford Motor Co's (F.N) Sync system, which allows a driver to use voice commands to control a system linking the car's audio system with a mobile phone and the iPod from Apple Inc (AAPL.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a twist that promises to make the car-based system similar to the desktop computer market, the Hyundai data and entertainment device will be able to take on new features with software updates, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product deal marks a win for Microsoft, which has been working to open up the driver's seat as a new market for its software beyond its dominance in the office and living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for car-based information and data systems is expected to grow sharply in coming years, and automakers such as BMW AG (BMWG.DE) and Chrysler LLC CBS.UL have projects in the works to bring regular Internet access to vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Hyundai, and its affiliate brand Kia Motors Corp (000270.KS), have struggled to shake a reputation for building vehicles in the U.S. market that compete more on price than styling or technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sync, which Ford developed in partnership with Microsoft, has been a surprise hit for Ford. It was introduced first on Ford's entry-level Focus sedan and has been credited with helping to lift sales of that car and to help the struggling U.S. carmaker connect with younger car buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the Ford deal, Microsoft Auto also provides the software system used in Fiat FIA.MI vehicles sold in Europe and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Microsoft also agreed on Tuesday to invest in a gaming support centre in South Korea, which will help small companies gain access to global gaming markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will invest $23 million in the gaming project, according to the Blue House. It said Microsoft's investment in South Korean automotive IT, game and education industries would reach a total of $147 million in the next five years.&lt;/p&gt;

Korea's top carmaker Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS) have agreed to
build a music and information system to debut in cars sold in
North America in 2010, the companies said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies did not reveal financial terms but South
Korea's presidential Blue House said Microsoft and Hyundai Motor
Group will invest $113 million and $166 million, respectively, in
the "Automotive IT Innovation Center" they will set up jointly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates is visiting Seoul to sign the
agreement with Hyundai. Gates also met South Korean President Lee
Myung-bak on Tuesday to discuss cooperation with South Korean
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first product under the partnership would be a
voice-controlled system linking mobile devices to car stereo
systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Later versions are expected to include multimedia and
navigation-related features, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal will add a new competitor to Ford Motor Co's (F.N)
Sync system, which allows a driver to use voice commands to
control a system linking the car's audio system with a mobile
phone and the iPod from Apple Inc (AAPL.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a twist that promises to make the car-based system similar
to the desktop computer market, the Hyundai data and
entertainment device will be able to take on new features with
software updates, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The product deal marks a win for Microsoft, which has been
working to open up the driver's seat as a new market for its
software beyond its dominance in the office and living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market for car-based information and data systems is
expected to grow sharply in coming years, and automakers such as
BMW AG (BMWG.DE) and Chrysler LLC [CBS.UL] have projects in the
works to bring regular Internet access to vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its part, Hyundai, and its affiliate brand Kia Motors
Corp (000270.KS), have struggled to shake a reputation for
building vehicles in the U.S. market that compete more on price
than styling or technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sync, which Ford developed in partnership with Microsoft, has
been a surprise hit for Ford. It was introduced first on Ford's
entry-level Focus sedan and has been credited with helping to
lift sales of that car and to help the struggling U.S. carmaker
connect with younger car buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to the Ford deal, Microsoft Auto also provides
the software system used in Fiat FIA.MI vehicles sold in Europe
and Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Microsoft also agreed on Tuesday to invest in a
gaming support centre in South Korea, which will help small
companies gain access to global gaming markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft will invest $23 million in the gaming project,
according to the Blue House. It said Microsoft's investment in
South Korean automotive IT, game and education industries would
reach a total of $147 million in the next five years.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with Shell shut-in, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS May 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) has returned
its oil output in Nigeria to normal operating levels after an
eight-day strike while Shell (RDSa.L) said it would start partly
resuming production shut by militant attacks "within days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strike by members of the PENGASSAN managers union shut
down virtually all Exxon's 800,000-barrels a day output in
Africa's largest oil producer and drove the company to declare a
force majeure on its shipments at the start of last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A company spokeswoman could not immediately say whether
Exxon had now lifted the force majeure following the end of the
strike on Thursday. Exxon continues to negotiate with the union
on a salary increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are pleased to report that production operated by
ExxonMobil upstream affiliates in Nigeria has been restored to
pre-shut in levels," the company statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, a spokesman for Shell said its production in
Nigeria was still down by about 164,000 barrels a day due to
recent militant attacks but it would start to partly restore
that "within days."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An attack by Niger Delta rebels on Saturday which blew up an
oil flowstation in the southern state of Bayelsa was "not a
severe incident" and had little impact on production, the
spokesman said.

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - Pfizer (PFE.N) has decided not to take NicOx's (NCOX.PA) experimental glaucoma drug PF-03187207 into final Phase III tests after a mid-stage study failed to met its primary endpoint, sending NicOx shares tumbling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news is a major blow for NicOx, which has been working on developing eye treatments with Pfizer for four years, and shares in the French biotechnology company dived 30 percent to 10.10 euros by 3:20 a.m. EDT (0720 GMT) on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the setback, however, Pfizer said it was not abandoning the collaboration with NicOx altogether.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the study did not meet its primary clinical endpoint and our criteria for launching a global Phase III program for this compound, we remain committed to our joint research program with NicOx, where the follow-up compounds to PF-03187207 have produced encouraging results," said Pfizer executive David Eveleth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a Phase II clinical trial, PF-03187207 did not show a statistically significantly improvement over Pfizer's existing drug Xalatan. The new drug was tested on patients with primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NicOx specializes in developing nitric oxide-releasing versions of drugs that offer therapeutic advantages over traditional formulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tim Hepher and Ben Hirschler; Editing by Quentin Bryar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background in paragraphs 5-8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING May 6 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) broke
ground on Tuesday on a $280 million research centre that is to
become the software giant's largest research facility outside
of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft plans to double the number of full-time Microsoft
research employees to 3,000 by 2010, in addition to about 1,500
current project-based researchers in China, and the energy
efficient campus will eventually be home to 5,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Through investments such as this, we are building on our
capabilities as one of Microsoft's key global RD centres,"
said Zhang Yaqin, the company's mainland China chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is growing rapidly in China and expects that
shipments to the mainland of handsets loaded with its software
will again double this fiscal year. Long-delayed third
generation (3G) wireless services are expected to be launched
later this year and could help boost demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is not alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. power company AES Corp (AES.N) said earlier this year
that China would be its centre for engineering and procurement,
and where the company's global projects will be developed and
power plants designed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AES reckons China, the largest energy consumer after the
United States, is well positioned to become a major exporter of
coal, wind and nuclear technology and expertise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two main buildings that make up Microsoft's facility
will feature new technologies -- such as double skin facades,
solar water heating and a system to reuse rain water -- some of
which will be used by Microsoft for the first time.

&lt;p&gt;Dori Media Sells an Output Deal for US$7.2 Million to Grupo Televisa, S.A. with Contractual Options of US$2.3 Million Expected to Increase the Value of the Deal to Approximately US$9.5 Million.

LONDON--(Business Wire)--


Dori Media Group ("Dori Media" or "DMG"), the international media company active
in the field of television, with a focus on production, distribution,
broadcasting and merchandising of Telenovela, announces that DMG has sold
various Telenovela titles and signed a 5 year output deal with Grupo Televisa
S.A. ("Televisa"). Televisa is the largest media company in the Spanish world
and a major player in the international entertainment business. The deal has
been signed for a consideration of approximately US$7.2 Million with contractual
options of US$2.3 Million expected to increase the value of the deal to
approximately US$9.5 Million. 50% of the contractual options, if exercised, are
expected to be exercised in the very near future. The deal includes immediate
licensing of broadcasting and format rights in Latin America and Europe to
various Telenovelas worth US$3.45 million with contractual options expected to
increase the value of the deal to US$5.75 million. In addition to this, both
parties have committed to an output deal for 5 years worth US$3.75 million.

As part of the 5 year output deal, Televisa will purchase five Dori Media
titles, with a title being delivered to Televisa each year between 2009 and
2013. During the 5 years Televisa will also be given first refusal to the rights
of DMG titles in Mexico. This deal is the first of a series of deals that Dori
Media is expecting to close following its appearance at the recent MIPTV
audiovisual and digital content conference in Cannes, France.

Nadav Palti, CEO &amp; President of DMG, commented: "We are delighted to announce
this very important deal with Televisa. Strategically, this is a very
significant deal for Dori Media Group and it marks the continuation and
strengthening of the partnership with Televisa. The deal presents DMG also with
high potential of Ancillary revenues and the opportunity to further strengthen
its position in key Latin American Telenovela markets and Europe, proving that
there continues to be an extremely strong demand for DMG titles in the region.
We look forward to updating the market on further deals closed at the recent
MIPTV event, where our belief in the increasing global demand for Telenovelas
was vindicated once again."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc chief Jerry Yang signaled a more open stance towards Microsoft Corp on Monday, saying he had been seeking common ground when the software maker abruptly ended deal talks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yang told Reuters in an interview that he had "mixed feelings" about the weekend outcome, after investors showed their disappointment over the break-up of negotiations by sending Yahoo shares down 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were negotiating a way to find common ground and then on Saturday they chose to walk away," said the 39-year-old co-founder of the pioneering Internet company. "They started it and they walked away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if Yahoo would still leave a door open for Microsoft to return, Yang said: "If they have anything new to say, we would be open. ... I am more than willing to listen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After three months of negotiations, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer raised his offer for Yahoo to $33 per share from an initial $31, for a total deal value of about $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang held out for $37 per share, saying that even the sweetened offer did not value Yahoo properly for its Web search advertising technology, its prominence in selling display ads and its lucrative overseas holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its two largest shareholders independently told The New York Times they would have sold for as little as $34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am extremely angry at Jerry Yang and at the so-called independent board," Gordon Crawford, portfolio manager for Capital Research Global Investors, the largest Yahoo shareholder with some 16 percent of stock, told the newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said Yahoo shares, which dropped $4.30 to end at $24.37 on Monday, could have fallen 30 percent to closer to $19.18, its price before Microsoft made its bid public on February 1. But the descent was cushioned by investors who are betting Microsoft will eventually come back to the table.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is going to play out over the next several months and there is still a chance Microsoft will buy the company for somewhere around $33 a share," said Todd Dagres, general partner at venture capital fund Spark Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A GOOGLE VICTORY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft rose initially on investor relief that it was not paying billions more for Yahoo, though the stock ended down slightly amid concerns about how the software maker would develop its Web strategy in the face of a dominant Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft courted Yahoo to capitalize on the rapidly growing market for Internet advertising, one that has long been served by Yahoo's search, e-mail and Web communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also trying to fend off the expansion of Google, which has made inroads into Microsoft's home turf with a portfolio of Web based-applications, e-mail and messaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But now that a deal has fallen apart, Google has emerged as the key beneficiary. Shares in the company rose 2.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google has just kept their foot on the accelerator," said Derek Brown, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald. "Neither Yahoo nor Microsoft in their current state seems to be a material competitive threat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is likely to press alternative strategies in coming weeks, including a search advertising partnership with Google and a deal for Time Warner Inc's AOL Internet unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Google deal would boost Yahoo's operating performance in the near term, but runs the risk of regulatory scrutiny over an alliance between the Internet's top two players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Yahoo are hammering out the intricacies of a potential deal and also are sharing their plans with antitrust regulators, a person close to Google who was not authorized to speak publicly on the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Yang over the weekend, Ballmer warned that any deal between Yahoo and Google would be difficult to unravel and would preclude an agreement with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang told Reuters the company would take care to structure any new efforts to "preserve as much (as possible) long-term flexibility for Yahoo, both operationally and strategically."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHAREHOLDER PRESSURE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts expect a flurry of shareholder lawsuits against Yahoo, and say it may even face direct pressure on its board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Already, some Yahoo shareholders have started to question how talks were handled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Miller, a portfolio manager for Legg Mason, Yahoo's second-largest shareholder, told the New York Times in a Sunday interview that he would have considered selling to Microsoft for $34 or $35 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While that was more than Microsoft's offer, it was less than the $37 per share Yahoo's board had insisted on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capital Research's Crawford also said investors generally were looking for Yahoo to sell at $34. He hoped shareholders pushed Yahoo to revisit the issue but was not optimistic, he told the newspaper. The company owns about 16 percent of Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang, who owns about 4 percent of the company, was expected to hold a meeting with employees on Tuesday in an effort to reassure staff in the wake of the Microsoft talks ending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang said in a post on the company's blog on Sunday night: "No one is celebrating about the outcome of these past three months ... and no one should. We live and work in a competitive world and the Web is only going to get more competitive. Executing on our strategic plan is what matters most."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tiffany Wu in New York, Muralikumar Anantharaman in Boston, Anupreeta Das in San Francisco and Peter Henderson in Los Angeles; Editing by Derek Caney, Braden Reddall, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co posted a 
better-than-expected 22 percent rise in profit as its movie 
studio scored hits with "National Treasure: Book of Secrets" 
and "Enchanted" and a weak U.S. economy failed to dampen theme 
park attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney's media networks also saw a double-digit rise in 
second-quarter operating income due mainly to affiliate and ad 
rate increases and subscriber growth at sports channel ESPN.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broadcasting shook off a Hollywood writers' strike that 
ended halfway through the quarter to post a 17 percent rise in 
operating income, propelled by international sales of ABC 
Studios scripted shows like "Lost" and "Gray's Anatomy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney joined other major U.S. media companies in 
outperforming expectations in the quarter, and investors 
rewarded the outsized results on Tuesday by boosting Disney 
shares by 1.6 percent in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you didn't know that the consumer was under tremendous 
pressure you would think we were in a boom if you looked at 
their results," said Larry Haverty, associate portfolio manager 
at Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All of the big media companies are doing fundamentally 
very well and the market just refuses to acknowledge it," 
Haverty added.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'FANTASTIC QUARTER'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income in the fiscal second quarter ended March 29 was 
$1.1 billion, or 58 cents per share, compared with $931 
million, or 44 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose nearly 10 percent to $8.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 50 cents per 
share and revenue of $8.5 billion, according to Reuters 
Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was a fantastic quarter. Not only are theme parks doing 
better ... but the vast majority of the company aside from 
theme parks exceeded investors' expectations, particularly the 
media networks," said Rich Greenfield, analyst with Pali 
Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney also cheered investors by predicting that its theme 
parks -- seen by some as a bellwether of consumer spending 
because of the need to plan vacations -- would stay "resilient" 
despite rising gasoline prices and air fares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Domestic room reservations for the rest of fiscal 2008 were 
trending slightly ahead of last year, though the third quarter 
faces a tough comparison versus last year, which had included 
the Easter holiday, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe we are much better positioned in a difficult 
economic cycle than we were in the past," Chief Executive Bob 
Iger said on a conference call with analysts. "We believe this 
segment can sustain success for many years to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said its ABC television network was seeing "healthy" 
double-digit growth in spot ad sales in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs predicted, however, that ABC would have fewer 
scripted shows to sell into international markets in the third 
quarter as a result of the writers' strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Disney Studios, the upcoming "Prince Caspian" and 
Disney-Pixar's "Wall-E" would be "swing factors" in the latter 
half of the year, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Consumer Products, which saw second-quarter profit 
drop due to lower minimum guarantees from retailers, expects 
costs from video game development and its repurchase of 220 
Disney retail stores from The Children's Place to cut in to 
profits for the rest of the fiscal year, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMH Capital analyst David Miller said the mostly upbeat 
forecast showed Disney had managed to insulate itself somewhat 
against consumer whims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm not saying it's recession proof and I'm not even 
saying it's recession resistant," Miller said. "Disney had this 
reputation of being such a consumer-focused media company that 
was so highly tethered to the economy (but) it's less so than 
it used to be five or seven years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares rose 1.6 percent to $34.26 in after-hours 
trade following a 1.3 percent rise in regular trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Sue Zeidler; Editing by Braden

outperforming expectations in the quarter, and investors 
rewarded the outsized results on Tuesday by boosting Disney 
shares by 1.6 percent in after-hours trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you didn't know that the consumer was under tremendous 
pressure you would think we were in a boom if you looked at 
their results," said Larry Haverty, associate portfolio manager 
at Gabelli Global Multimedia Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All of the big media companies are doing fundamentally 
very well and the market just refuses to acknowledge it," 
Haverty added.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'FANTASTIC QUARTER'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Net income in the fiscal second quarter ended March 29 was 
$1.1 billion, or 58 cents per share, compared with $931 
million, or 44 cents per share, in the same quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue rose nearly 10 percent to $8.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, had expected earnings of 50 cents per 
share and revenue of $8.5 billion, according to Reuters 
Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was a fantastic quarter. Not only are theme parks doing 
better ... but the vast majority of the company aside from 
theme parks exceeded investors' expectations, particularly the 
media networks," said Rich Greenfield, analyst with Pali 
Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney also cheered investors by predicting that its theme 
parks -- seen by some as a bellwether of consumer spending 
because of the need to plan vacations -- would stay "resilient" 
despite rising gasoline prices and air fares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Domestic room reservations for the rest of fiscal 2008 were 
trending slightly ahead of last year, though the third quarter 
faces a tough comparison versus last year, which had included 
the Easter holiday, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe we are much better positioned in a difficult 
economic cycle than we were in the past," Chief Executive Bob 
Iger said on a conference call with analysts. "We believe this 
segment can sustain success for many years to come."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs said its ABC television network was seeing "healthy" 
double-digit growth in spot ad sales in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs predicted, however, that ABC would have fewer 
scripted shows to sell into international markets in the third 
quarter as a result of the writers' strike.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Disney Studios, the upcoming "Prince Caspian" and 
Disney-Pixar's "Wall-E" would be "swing factors" in the latter 
half of the year, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Consumer Products, which saw second-quarter profit 
drop due to lower minimum guarantees from retailers, expects 
costs from video game development and its repurchase of 220 
Disney retail stores from The Children's Place to cut in to 
profits for the rest of the fiscal year, Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SMH Capital analyst David Miller said the mostly upbeat 
forecast showed Disney had managed to insulate itself somewhat 
against consumer whims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm not saying it's recession proof and I'm not even 
saying it's recession resistant," Miller said. "Disney had this 
reputation of being such a consumer-focused media company that 
was so highly tethered to the economy (but) it's less so than 
it used to be five or seven years ago."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares rose 1.6 percent to $34.26 in after-hours 
trade following a 1.3 percent rise in regular trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Sue Zeidler; Editing by Braden

&lt;p&gt;Fitch Rates Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.'s $275MM Floating- Rate Notes 'A'; Outlook Stable

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch has assigned an 'A' rating to Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc.'s
(NYSE:CCE) $275 million floating-rate senior unsecured notes due May
6, 2011. The notes' coupon will be based on 3-month LIBOR plus 60
basis points. Fitch's ratings for CCE and its subsidiaries are as
follows:

   Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.:

   --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A';

   --Bank credit facility 'A';

   --Senior unsecured debt 'A';

   --Short-term IDR 'F1';

   --CP 'F1'.

   Coca-Cola Enterprises Finance LT 1 Commandite S.C.A.:

   --Long-term IDR 'A';

   --Senior unsecured debt 'A'.

   Bottling Holdings (Luxembourg) Commandite S.C.A.:

   --Short-term IDR 'F1';

   --CP 'F1'.

   The Ratings Outlook is Stable.

   CCE plans to use the issuance proceeds to refinance a portion of
its commercial paper. Any remaining proceeds are to be used for
general corporate purposes. The notes are being issued under the
company's existing indenture dated July 30, 2007. Significant
covenants include, but are not limited to, limitations on liens and
restrictions on sale-leaseback transactions. At March 28, 2008, CCE's
total debt was approximately $9.7 billion.

   The ratings reflects CCE's continued importance within the
Coca-Cola bottling system, its ongoing debt reduction and its
strengthening non-carbonated beverage line-up. Given the prominence of
carbonated soft drinks (CSDs) in CCE's beverage portfolio, the ratings
acknowledge the declining CSD volumes in the U.S. and modest CSD
growth in CCE's European territories. Despite a difficult commodity
cost environment, which is negatively impacting the company's margins,
CCE continues to generate substantial discretionary cash flow.

   For the last twelve months ended March 28, 2007, the company's
credit statistics were in line with Fitch's expectations. Total
debt-to-operating earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization(EBITDA) was 3.7 times (x), operating EBITDA-to-gross
interest expense was 4.2x, and the funds from operations (FFO) fixed
charge coverage was 2.8x. While CCE's credit metrics are weaker than
similarly rated food and beverage companies, CCE's ratings are
reflective of the credit metrics of the Coca-Cola system and CCE's
relative importance in the Coca-Cola system, which comprises the
Coca-Cola Company and its significant and/or strategic bottlers. For
the year ended Dec. 31, 2007, total debt-to-operating EBITDA on an
aggregated basis was 1.8x for the Coca-Cola system. The system's FFO
fixed charge coverage on an aggregated basis was 6.8x.

   CCE is the Coca-Cola Company's largest bottler, accounting for 18%
of the Coca-Cola Company's volume in 2007. CCE's North American
bottling territory includes 46 U.S. states, the District of Columbia,
the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the ten provinces of Canada. As of
December 31, 2007, the company's bottling agreements covered a
population of approximately 267 million people comprising 79% of the
population of the U.S. and 98% of Canada. CCE's European bottling
agreements govern the following territory: Belgium, continental
France, Great Britain, Luxembourg, Monaco, and the Netherlands. As of
December 31, 2007, CCE's European bottling agreements covered a
population of approximately 147 million people. During 2007, North
American operations contributed 70% of the company's revenues and
European operations accounted for 30%.

are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said it will start 
offering television shows for its Zune portable media device, 
more than two years after Apple Inc introduced the feature for 
its iPod player.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's Zune has one thing that Apple's market-defining 
iPod and accompanying iTunes store does not -- TV programs from 
General Electric's NBC Universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those shows and more than 800 TV episodes including Comedy 
Central's "South Park" and MTV's "The Hills" will be available 
at the Zune store starting on Tuesday for the equivalent of 
$1.99 in Microsoft points that must be purchased in advance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, Apple split with NBC, removing the network's 
television shows from iTunes. Microsoft will carry NBC shows 
like "The Office" and "Heroes" for playback on the Zune, which 
has failed to dent the dominant market share of Apple's iPod 
since its 2006 debut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Zunes have video playback capability, but content 
available for the devices has been limited to music videos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Quentin

&lt;p&gt;--  Reduced greenhouse gas emissions and adopted climate change
        policy principles

   --  Increased portfolio of renewable energy research partnerships

   --  Invested $119 million in community initiatives around the
        world
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
increased its number of renewable energy research partnerships and
invested approximately $119 million in communities around the world,
according to the company's 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report,
issued today.

   "By operating in ways that reflect our values, we create
partnerships based on ingenuity, collaboration and trust to develop
energy that stimulates economic growth and social progress," said Dave
O'Reilly, Chevron chairman and CEO. "These relationships advance our
ability to find and produce energy safely, reliably and responsibly
around the world."

   Chevron's sixth report, published annually, provides descriptions,
data and perspective on the company's community engagement, health,
safety and environmental performance for 2007. Highlights include:

   Climate Change and Energy Efficiency

   Chevron reduced GHG emissions from its global operations by
approximately 800,000 tons of CO2 equivalent. As a result, the company
outperformed its GHG emissions goal in 2007, emitting 60.7 million
metric tons compared with a target of 63.5 million metric tons.
Chevron also adopted seven climate change policy principles during
2007 to guide the company's engagement in the development of flexible
and economically sound public policy.

   Renewable and Alternative Energy

   The company expects to spend approximately $2.5 billion from 2007
through 2009 in alternative and renewable energy technologies. Chevron
and Weyerhaeuser Co., one of the nation's largest forest-products
companies, signed a letter of intent in 2007 and announced a 50-50
joint venture in early 2008 to develop the next generation of
renewable transportation fuels from nonfood sources.

   The company formed new alliances with Texas A University and the
Colorado Center for Biorefining and Biofuels in 2007 to research and
develop new technologies for converting nonfood sources into biofuels.
The company began its second research project with the U.S. Department
of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory to develop technology
to produce transportation fuels from algae.

   Chevron consolidated its position as the world's largest private
producer of geothermal power with the startup of the 110-megawatt
Darajat Unit III in West Java, Indonesia. Through geothermal
operations in Indonesia and the Philippines, Chevron is providing
clean, renewable energy to meet the needs of 16 million people.

   Community Engagement

   Chevron invested approximately $119 million in communities around
the world in 2007, a nearly $30 million increase over 2006, to help
build the human and institutional capacity of communities where it
operates. Approximately 68 percent was targeted to basic human needs,
education and training, and support for local businesses.

   In late 2007, Chevron became the first Corporate Champion of the
Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. The commitment,
announced in January 2008, will allocate $30 million over three years
to help combat these diseases by applying the company's experience
working with local communities.

   Chevron's Energy for Learning education initiative invested more
than $10 million in 23 Mississippi and Louisiana school districts as
part of a three-year, $18 million program to help communities affected
by hurricanes Katrina and Rita.

   Health and Safety

   Overall safety performance improved last year, with the total rate
of recordable incidents decreasing by 17 percent compared with 2006.

   Also, two new corporate standards were adopted to further reduce
injuries and illness among Chevron's workforce - Fitness for Duty and
Occupational Hygiene - and a cardiovascular health program was
initiated.

   Human Rights

   Early in 2008, Chevron incorporated its Human Rights Statement,
adopted two years prior, into its Business Conduct &amp; Ethics Code. All
employees are required to read and acknowledge that they will abide by
the code, which is available in 12 languages and serves as a guide for
actions and conduct.

   Stakeholder Engagement

   Chevron's Environmental, Social and Health Impact Assessment
(ESHIA) process was launched in 2007 to identify, analyze and develop
measures that enhance benefits and mitigate environmental, social and
health impacts of major capital projects. By early 2008, ESHIA was
being applied to nearly 20 capital projects worldwide.

   The full 2007 Corporate Responsibility Report is available at
www.chevron.com/cr-2007.

   Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated
energy companies, with subsidiaries that conduct business across the
globe. The company's success is driven by the ingenuity and commitment
of approximately 59,000 employees who operate across the energy
spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude oil and
natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and
other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;
generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides energy
efficiency solutions; and develops and commercializes the energy
resources of the future, including biofuels and other renewables.
Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron
is available at www.chevron.com.

between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news came a few days after Microsoft dropped its
unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo for $47.5 billion. The aim of
that proposal was to build an online advertising powerhouse to
rival Google Inc. (GOOG.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook, founded in 2004 by Harvard student Mark
Zuckerberg, has become one of the hottest properties on the
Internet because of its rapid growth and the loyalty of its
users. Facebook has more than 70 million active users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the past, Zuckerberg has resisted selling the entire
company, opting to work toward an initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft were up 5 cents at $29.75 in afternoon
Nasdaq trade.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Exxon comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/LAGOS May 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) has
lifted a force majeure on its crude oil exports from Nigeria,
traders said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of Exxon's oil production in Nigeria, which averaged
800,000 barrels per day last year, were disrupted by a union
workers' strike late in April. Output has since resumed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokeswoman declined to confirm, but said the
company was looking to minimize the impact of the supply
disruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have notified the relevant authorities in Nigeria that
the events that led to the force majeure have been resolved,"
the spokeswoman said. "We are working with our customers to
minimise any supply impact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both parties say negotiations continue over workers' pay.
The talks being held in Lagos are to resume on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The supply disruption helped boost oil prices to record
highs above $120 a barrel.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)

 May 7 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded Syniverse
Technologies Inc SVR.N to "overweight" from "neutral," saying
the data explosion and seasonality could provide a breakout for
the stock.

 At least three other brokerages, including Lehman Brothers,
raised their price targets on Syniverse shares, which were up
about 24 percent in midday trade.

 JP Morgan said the exploding growth in consumer wireless
data usage was accelerating organic revenue for the provider of
technology services to wireless telecom companies.

 "This should finally provide the momentum the stock needs
to break out of the $13-$18 range as we head into the
seasonally strongest part of the year that will be bolstered by
a new 3G iPhone and lower roaming rates in Europe," the
brokerage wrote in a note to investors.

 JP Morgan said June and September are usually the good
quarters with vacation driving increased roaming (clearing)
revenue for Syniverse, which recently acquired the wireless
business of Britain's Billing Services Group Plc .

 Syniverse shares were up $3.98 at $20.64 on the New York
Stock Exchange. They hit a 52-week high of $20.75 earlier in
the session.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), which is buying Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N, expects to regain business from Bear clients who stopped doing business with the troubled investment bank, JPMorgan's co-chief executive of investment banking said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bill Winters, speaking on a webcast conducted by Deutsche Bank Securities Inc, also said both banks will cut investment banking jobs in light of tight capital markets and an economy and housing prices that have not "rounded the bend."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You couldn't create a worse backdrop for an investment banking merger," Winters said. "We would have been downsizing right now. Bear would have been downsizing right now. By virtue of the combination, we certainly will be downsizing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winters said new business activity at Bear has been "severely reduced," but there is "every indication" that clients will return after the merger closes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed in March to buy Bear for $10 per share, in a purchase brokered in part by the U.S. Federal Reserve. The central bank agreed to back $29 billion of Bear's assets. The merger is expected to close this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates to early morning)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jennifer Coogan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were little changed
 on Wednesday as energy shares retreated from Tuesday's steep
gains, while higher-than-expected earnings from Walt Disney Co
(DIS.N) helped lift the entertainment and media sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market got a lift before the opening bell when
government data showed higher-than-expected productivity gains
and a lower-than-expected rise in unit labor costs, quelling
inflation fears after crude oil set a record high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But stocks showed little reaction to news pending home
sales fell as expected in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's little conviction among investors about how long
the economy stays weak," said Joseph Battipaglia, market
strategist at Stifel Nicolaus, Yardley, Pennsylvania. "If
you're not convinced we'll come roaring out of this in the
second half, you're going to be hesitant to commit more capital
to the market, and that's why you'll trade in a range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 9.77
points, or 0.08 percent, at 13,011.06. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX was down 1.37 points, or 0.10 percent, at
1,416.89. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up 6.21
points, or 0.25 percent, at 2,489.52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares were the biggest percentage gainer on the
Dow, up 2.9 percent at $34.70 after the company posted a 22
percent rise in quarterly profit late on Tuesday. For details,
see [ID:nN06510312].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But energy shares fell after government data showed a
higher-than-expected rise in crude inventories, sending oil
futures down 59 cents to $121.21 a barrel. Chevron, the second
largest U.S. oil company, fell 1.6 percent at $95.33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, with oil not far from Tuesday's record $122.73 a
barrel, investors fretted over the impact on business activity
and consumers'  pocketbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An index of oil services companies .OSX was off 0.6
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) posted  stronger-than-forecast
earnings on high demand for networking equipment, but the stock
fell 0.6 percent to $26.20 after chief executive John Chambers
gave a cautious outlook for the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ATT (T.N) and Verizon Co (VZ.N) were among the top drags
on the SP 500 after Sprint Nextel (S.N) and Clearwire Corp
CLWR.O announced a joint venture with investments from 
cable companies aimed a better competing against the two top  
U.S. telecom companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of ATT were down 1.4 percent at $39.01 and Verizon
stock fell 1.5 percent to $38.31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sprint stock was up 4 percent to $9.56 and Clearwire shares
rose 8.1 percent to $17.79.

&lt;p&gt;  MADRID, SPAIN and SAN JOSE, CA, May 07 (MARKET WIRE)
-- 
 (NYSE: IBM) -- At the IEEE International Magnetics Conference today in Madrid,
IBM
Fellow Stuart Parkin received the Daniel E. Noble Award for his fundamental
contributions to the development of magneto-resistive devices for
non-volatile, high density, random access memory. Dr. Parkin's innovations in
memory technologies led to the revolution of the hard disk drive industry and
are found in nearly every disk drive on the market today.

    Dr. Parkin, who received this award jointly with Jim Daughton and Saied
Tehrani, was also elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences on April
29
and received an honorary doctorate from the University of Eindhoven in
the Netherlands on April 25, both this year.

    Most recently, Dr. Parkin, of the IBM Almaden Research Center in San Jose,
CA, has been in the news because of new developments with his latest work,
Racetrack Memory. Racetrack Memory, an entirely new way to store digital
information, could lead to computer memory that combines the high performance
and reliability of flash with the low cost and high capacity of the hard disk
drive.

    Racetrack Memory is the latest evolution in the field of spintronics,
which uses the spin, rather than the charge, of an electron to create
electronic devices. Within the next ten years, Racetrack Memory, so named
because
the data "races" around a nano-wire "track," could lead to solid state
electronicdevices -- with no moving parts, and therefore more durable -- capable
of
holding far more data in the same amount of space than is possible today.

    For example, this technology could enable a handheld device such as an mp3
player to store around 500,000 songs or around 3,500 movies -- 100 times more
than is possible today -- with far lower cost and power consumption. The devices
would
not only store vastly more information in the same space, but also require much
less power and generate much less heat, and be practically unbreakable; the
result: massive amounts of personal storage that could run on a single battery
for weeks at a time and last for decades.

    In 2005, IBM Fellow David Harame received the Daniel E. Noble award for
thedevelopment of the world's first successful silicon germanium technology for
analog
and communications circuits used in wireless communications equipment, optical
network
interfaces, GPS and cellular telephones.

    About the IEEE Daniel E. Noble Award

    The IEEE Daniel E. Noble Award was established by the IEEE Board of
Directors in 2000 for outstanding contributions to emerging technologies
recognized
within recent years.

    The award is named in honor of Dr. Daniel E. Noble, Executive Vice
Chairmanof the Board emeritus of Motorola. Dr. Noble is significantly known for
thedesign and installation of the nation's first statewide two-way radio
communications system. The system was the first in the world to use FM
technology.

    About The National Academy of Sciences

    Election to the Academy recognizes distinguished and continuing achievements
in
original research and is one of the highest honors that can be accorded a
United States scientist or engineer.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 7 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures were
little changed on Wednesday after higher-than-expected earnings
from Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) and Cisco Systems Inc (CSCO.O) was
offset by oil at near-record highs, keeping investors on edge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Economic reports for Wednesday could show more erosion in
the housing sector, a smaller rise in worker productivity and
rising labor costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares were up 2.3 percent to $34.50 before the
opening bell after the media and entertainment company posted
 stronger-than-expected quarterly profit late on Tuesday. For
details, see [ID:nN06510312].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cisco stock rose 2.4 percent to $26.96 after it posted
profit that topped estimates as rising Internet traffic fueled
demand for its networking equipment. [ID:nN06305666].Chief
Executive John Chambers, however, gave a cautious outlook for
the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices were little changed but down from Tuesday's
record high of $122.73 a barrel, threatening to slow business
activity and strain consumers' pocketbooks. Weekly U.S.
government supply figures are set for release at 10:30 a.m.
(1430 GMT) and are expected to show higher inventories of crude
for the third straight week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Productivity will be in the mind of investors as oil's
reaching record highs," said Peter Cardillo, chief market
economist at Avalon Partners in New York. "If you have slower
productivity and you have higher oil prices, that just
accelerates the fear of inflation, and that would be troubling
for the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 were down 2.9 points, but slightly
above fair value, a mathematical formula that evaluates pricing
by taking into account interest rates, dividends and time to
expiration on the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 fell 13 points,
and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures lost 6.25 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The string of record peaks in oil prices have hammered
energy-dependent sectors, such as airline stocks, while
boosting shares of oil producers and the companies that serve
them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Government data on productivity and unit labor costs for
the first quarter are due at 8:30 a.m. (1230 GMT). An index of
pending home sales for March is due at 10 a.m. (1400 GMT).
March pending home sales data, set for release at 10 a.m.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sprint Nextel Corp (S.N) and Clearwire Corp CLWR.O shares
rose before the bell after the companies said they would
combine their wireless broadband businesses to form a new $14.5
billion communications company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sprint shares were up 5.5 percent at $9.70 before the
opening bell and Clearwire shares jumped 12 percent to $18.40.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI
finished up 0.4 percent, at 13,020.83, the Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX ended up 0.8 percent, at 1,418.26, and the
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC closed up 0.8 percent, at
2,483.31.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: EnCana (NYSE: ECA), MannKind
(Nasdaq: MNKD), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) and Novo
Nordisk (NYSE: NVO).

   See the latest posts to the Analyst Blog:

   http://www.zacks.com/blog/post_info.html?g=6

   Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:

   EnCana Stock Already Pumped Up

   EnCana's (NYSE: ECA) robust first-quarter 2008 results were driven
by strong production growth as well as higher commodity prices.
Natural gas production was up 10% to 3.7 Bcf/d, strongly positioning
the company to achieve full-year guidance. Cash flow per share jumped
41%, while operating earnings went up 28% year-over-year.

   We continue to like the company's sustainable low-risk business
model comprising an industry-leading inventory of long-lived
unconventional oil and gas assets. However, we maintain our Hold
recommendation as we believe these positives are already reflected in
current valuation, especially following the stock's recent strong run
up.

   Given the substantial resource potential of its attractive
unconventional asset base, we consider net asset values to be a better
measure of EnCana's value compared to conventional valuation metrics.
Keeping in view the company's year-end 2007 proved reserves and upside
potential from unbooked resources, our per share net asset value
estimate comes to $79.34.

   Sell MannKind Down to $1.50

   MannKind's (Nasdaq: MNKD) lead drug, Technosphere Insulin (TI), is
an inhaled insulin product and is in large phase III trials for the
treatment of diabetes. The inhaled insulin market has witnessed a
major upheaval in recent times with Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Eli Lilly
(NYSE: LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE: NVO) withdrawing their late-stage
candidates citing lack of market prospectus for this class of drugs.

   Occurrence of lung cancer in diabetic patients treated with
Exubera has further cast a shadow over the future of TI. The company's
cash burn is a matter of grave concern and the lack of any late-stage
or approved product adds to the company's woes. Hence, we maintain our
target price of $1.50.

   Even if TI makes it through the approval process, we do not expect
the drug to reach the market before 2011. Considering the $1.1 billion
in cash burn incurred so far, coupled with the high SG costs
necessitated to strategically position and distinguish the drug from
other therapies, we do not expect the company to achieve profitability
without TI achieving blockbuster status a status seemingly out of
reach in the current market scenario.

   We do believe that opportunity exists in adversity and given the
current exodus of all late-stage competition in the inhaled insulin
market, successful commercialization of TI may enable MannKind to reap
benefits of the magnitude which earlier were not possible because of
the competitive landscape. However, until the company is able to
navigate through these tough times, we maintain our Sell rating.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds another recent Goldman hire and relocation of metals
marketing head)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Flaherty&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG May 7 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
has hired former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) banker Oral Dawe as
managing director and CEO of its Asia Pacific Commodities group
as it steps up its commodities coverage in the resource-rich
region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based JPMorgan has hired more than a dozen new
bankers in Asia recently to oversee its expansion in areas such
as energy and metals trading and marketing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move comes amid a broad push by investment banks to
increase commodity coverage as prices of natural resources
hover at record highs, with Asia a key focus of the build-up
given the resources found across the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dawe would be responsible for all aspects of JPMorgan's
commodity business in the region including sales, trading and
principal investing, the company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dawe was at Goldman Sachs for 10 years, where most recently
he was co-head of Asia Commodities and president of the
Singapore office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He will remain based in Singapore and will report to Blythe
Masters, JPMorgan's global head of commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Organic growth, combined with the complementary
capabilities of Bear Stearns' energy business, has created a
world-class commodities platform and we are attracting the
industry's most exceptional people," said Masters, referring to
the bank's commodities expansion across Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has agreed to purchase Bear Stearns BSC.N after
Bear nearly collapsed from exposure to markets hit hard by the
global credit crunch and investors' concerns it did not have
enough capital to weather the storm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said that last year alone it added more than 50
sales, trading and structuring professionals to its global
commodities business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan recently hired Ouyang Xiuzhang, a managing
director from Goldman Sachs, to head its Asia energy trading.
The bank has also relocated its global head of Global Metal
Marketing, Tim Wilson, from the UK to Singapore to focus on
building out its Asia metals trading and marketing capability.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc may not be celebrating the end of takeover talks with Microsoft Corp, but their mutual rival Google Inc should feel free to pop the champagne cork.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rift between Microsoft and Yahoo leaves the online advertising market wide open to Google's expansion. What's more, it puts Google in the coveted position of deciding the fate of its closest rival, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft withdrew a $47.5 billion offer for Yahoo on Saturday after the Internet company dug in for a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo investors see only two viable options -- returning to negotiations or letting Google serve up some of its search listings since it makes more money off the ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft holding firm for now, that leaves Google in the driver's seat when it comes to determining Yahoo's fate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's good news for Google. They will continue to grow their dominant share," said Jane Snorek, senior technology analyst at First American Funds. "In the long run, I just think the Yahoo customer would go directly to Google."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google and Yahoo are still working out the details of a potential search deal and are sharing the plans with antitrust regulators to dispel concerns, a person close to Google said on Monday. But no final agreement has been reached yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal be would icing on the cake for Google, adding about $1 billion in annual revenue and about $1 to earnings per share, assuming a 50-50 split on ad revenue, Snorek said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Google doesn't need the partnership on its own account, it may have a defensive interest in reaching a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're doing it more as a favor," she said. "Google can't let Yahoo fall to $15 again because they can't have Microsoft buying Yahoo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An ad deal with Google could add as much as $6 a share to Yahoo's stock price, based on the results of a test between the two companies, a person involved in the discussions said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THERE GOES THE COMPETITION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo, however, is now viewed in need of a deal to prop up its value after rejecting a $33-per-share offer from Microsoft. Chief Executive Jerry Yang insisted the company is worth $37 per share, but Wall Street doubts it can get there alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google last month waved off fears that it would suffer from a U.S. economic downturn, reporting 42 percent gross revenue growth in the first quarter. Yahoo posed a 9 percent rise for the period, or 14 percent excluding payments to ad affiliates, and expects 3 percent to 15 percent growth for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay estimates Yahoo's stand-alone value at closer to $25 per share, leaving out any deal with Microsoft or Google. Yahoo shares closed at $25.72 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it turns out that Google was just being used to thwart Microsoft, I think the investor reaction will be very negative," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Google is by far the leader in search, a combined Microsoft and Yahoo could have presented a challenge in new frontiers of online advertising, from Web video to messaging and mobile Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's where there is open territory for anybody to win. Google stands to continue to further distance themselves from the pack," said Dan Davidowitz, portfolio manager at Polen Capital Management which owns shares in Microsoft and Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, a Yahoo-Google alliance is widely expected to draw regulatory scrutiny for combining the Internet's two largest players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sarah Fay, CEO at media buyer Aegis Media North America, said a combination of the two would be the closest thing yet to a monopoly in the online advertising space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What Google is missing now is true depth of offering in display, e-mail and instant messaging, and those are areas where Yahoo is very strong," she said. "It feels a bit like too many eggs in one basket."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Derek Brown, analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, said Yahoo should still think twice before it gives up even a segment of its search after investing to upgrade its technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If part of Yahoo's mission is to become a one-stop shop for people looking to buy all types of online ads, then outsourcing search ... seems like a step backwards," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if Yahoo's ultimate aim was to avoid Microsoft's embrace, a long-term Google deal could buy it time to advance elsewhere while warding off the unwanted suitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's more of a poison pill if they don't have an out clause ... and it's multi-year," said Todd Dagres, general partner at venture firm Spark Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Anupreeta Das in San Francisco; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has 
released the nominees on its rival slate from their commitment 
to stand for election to Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) board in the 
event of a proxy fight, a source familiar with the situation 
said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The move indicates Microsoft remains firm in its commitment 
to stay away from Yahoo, days after it abandoned a $47.5 
billion offer for the Internet company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said this week the software 
giant will go it alone as it figures out how to compete with 
Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By releasing the rival slate, Microsoft frees up the 10 
nominees to sign up for other slates that may be assembled by 
Yahoo shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, Yahoo set July 3 as the date for its 
annual stockholder meeting, and said any nominations for a 
rival slate must be made before May 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "May 15, which is next week, is not enough time for some 
other investor group besides Microsoft to put together a slate 
of directors," said Shirley Westcott, a managing director of 
policy at Proxy Governance, an independent proxy advisory firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shareholders have signaled their discontent with the 
board's negotiations on Microsoft's buyout offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am extremely angry at (co-founder and chief executive) 
Jerry Yang and the so-called independent board," Gordon 
Crawford, portfolio manager for Capital Research Global 
Investors, the largest Yahoo shareholder, told the New York 
Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which initially offered Yahoo $31 a share, 
sweetened its bid last week to $33 a share, but Yahoo's board 
refused to go below $37 a share, causing talks to fall through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that 
Microsoft seriously entertained mounting a proxy campaign 
before deciding to withdraw its offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Microsoft never filed its proxy slate with 
regulators, another source told Reuters it had assembled a 
slate of 10 nominees to oppose Yahoo's board, which comes up 
for re-election every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former Nextel Partners CEO John Chapple, former Grey Global 
Group CEO Edward Meyer and Jaynie Studenmund, former chief 
operating officer of Overture Services, which was acquired by

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has released the nominees on its rival slate from their commitment to stand for election to Yahoo Inc's board in the event of a proxy fight, a source familiar with the situation said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move indicates Microsoft remains firm in its commitment to stay away from Yahoo, days after it abandoned a $47.5 billion offer for the Internet company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said this week the software giant will go it alone as it figures out how to compete with Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By releasing the rival slate, Microsoft frees up the 10 nominees to sign up for other slates that may be assembled by Yahoo shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, Yahoo set July 3 as the date for its annual stockholder meeting, and said any nominations for a rival slate must be made before May 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"May 15, which is next week, is not enough time for some other investor group besides Microsoft to put together a slate of directors," said Shirley Westcott, a managing director of policy at Proxy Governance, an independent proxy advisory firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shareholders have signaled their discontent with the board's negotiations on Microsoft's buyout offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am extremely angry at (co-founder and chief executive) Jerry Yang and the so-called independent board," Gordon Crawford, portfolio manager for Capital Research Global Investors, the largest Yahoo shareholder, told the New York Times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which initially offered Yahoo $31 a share, sweetened its bid last week to $33 a share, but Yahoo's board refused to go below $37 a share, causing talks to fall through.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources familiar with the matter have told Reuters that Microsoft seriously entertained mounting a proxy campaign before deciding to withdraw its offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft never filed its proxy slate with regulators, another source told Reuters it had assembled a slate of 10 nominees to oppose Yahoo's board, which comes up for re-election every year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Nextel Partners CEO John Chapple, former Grey Global Group CEO Edward Meyer and Jaynie Studenmund, former chief operating officer of Overture Services, which was acquired by Yahoo, were among the nominees, according to press reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by John Wallace/Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has no plans to make another approach for Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) after it pulled its $47.5 billion bid earlier this month, Microsoft's Chief Research and Strategy Officer Craig Mundie said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The market may wish that the Yahoo deal may come back together, but Microsoft at least at this point assumes it's over," Mundie told Reuters in an interview in the Indonesian capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know what we thought it's economic limits were and that didn't come together, so we've moved on and we will go back and implement plan B that we've been on in any case," he added, referring to the company's online strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft walked away from its bid to buy Yahoo last Saturday after the Internet company turned down its offer to raise the price by $5 billion to $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's offer was for $33 a share but Yahoo would not lower its demand below $37, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said. The software company initially bid $31 per share for Yahoo more than three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo could always come back again and say please buy us for $33 (a share) and I'm sure we might reconsider it but we're not assuming that's going to happen," added Mundie, who took over as Microsoft's lead visionary on technology from co-founder Bill Gates in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mundie also said he felt the long-term position for the Seattle-based firm on sustaining improvements in the battle against piracy was intact, even if there were blips in the trend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said after releasing its March quarterly results in late April that emerging markets saw an increase in the number of PCs sold without licensed software -- often a sign that pirated software will later be installed on the machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think anything's fundamentally changed. Each of these countries has their ups and downs as a function of changes in government, you know individual regulators, law enforcement priorities etc," said Mundie, who was in Jakarta for a conference on government leaders in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mundie cited China as an example of a country where the piracy rate was very high but the situation had improved after the top levels of government brought in regulatory changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm personally optimistic about that. I don't see a reason for alarm," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Jean Yoon)&lt;/p&gt;

which quit subprime mortgage lending last year, on Thursday

&lt;p&gt;IT Service Firm's Arizona and Southern California Offices
                     Recognized by Software Giant
TEMPE, Ariz.--(Business Wire)--
Ensynch Inc., the Southwest's leading provider of IT
infrastructure services, IT staffing and managed hosting services,
today announced that it has won three Partner awards from Microsoft.
Ensynch's Irvine, Calif. office was awarded the "General Manager"
award at Microsoft's Southern California partner briefing event, while
the Tempe, Ariz. office claimed the "Winning on Value" and "Marketing
Excellence" awards at the Phoenix briefing event.

   Ensynch is one of the top Microsoft Gold Certified Partners for IT
infrastructure services and Unified Communications and Collaboration
among approximately 2,000 total Microsoft partners serving Arizona.
Ensynch expanded into Southern California in mid 2006, opening offices
in Irvine, Los Angeles and San Diego, Calif.

   These following awards are significant because in addition to
highlighting Ensynch's expertise and Southern California growth, they
truly showcase customer recognition of business value provided by
well-implemented Microsoft technologies.

   --  The Microsoft "General Manager" award (So. Calif.) recognizes
        a partner for going above and beyond in all areas of
        partnering with Microsoft. Ensynch's win highlighted a
        messaging migration the company deployed for a regional
        hospital system in California.

   --  The "Winning on Value" award (Ariz.) was based on executing an
        Exchange 2007 migration project for a major foods distributor
        with more than 27,000 employees.

   --  The "Marketing Excellence" award (Ariz.) was for Ensynch's
        "Simplify with Unified Communications" campaign which promoted
        Microsoft's customer solution to thousands of prospective
        customers through multiple channels including educating
        customers at 18 targeted events over the last year.

   "We're pleased to be recognized by Microsoft, and specifically
noteworthy is the recognition in Southern California with the General
Manager award given it's the newest market for Ensynch, and in a short
time we have built a reputation with customers that we're really proud
of," said Scott Johnson, VP of Partnership and Alliances for Ensynch.
"We've built a strong foothold in that region among mid-size and
enterprise organizations, and those customer success stories position
us as an even stronger Microsoft partner across Southern California."

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Pierre Avignon is no pirate, but he does not believe in paying for software. His computer is filled with programs like Symphony -- a free suite that he downloaded from an International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) website (symphony.lotus.com).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It performs work for which he used to rely on Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Word word processor, Excel spreadsheet and PowerPoint presentation builder, all components of the Microsoft Office software suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is free. It is a great deal," says Avignon, a 43-year-old graphics designer from West Newbury, Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Free software was once almost exclusively borne of a grass-roots effort -- with an anti-Microsoft bent -- seeking alternatives to paid software. The movement produced myriad programs, but only a handful of widely used titles such as the Linux operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft says Office has 500 million users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth in the availability of broadband Internet access has spawned a new type of free software -- programs that its developers host on their own servers and have designed to foster collaboration among users by making documents easy to share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Inc (GOOG.O) and smaller Internet companies such as privately held Zoho offer free office suites over the Web. (docs.google.com and www.zoho.com).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Users don't have to install the programs or even keep documents on their own PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can't set up mass mailings or run sophisticated data analysis using most free, Web-based software, says Rebecca Wettemann, an analyst with Nucleus Research. But she says few people actually use such features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Docs and other free programs are looking increasingly attractive to businesses, she said, as they seek ways to keep down their information technology budgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's entry-level business version of Office costs $325 at Amazon.com (AMZN.O), about triple the price of its version targeted at home users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ninety percent of the users don't need all the functionality that Office provides," Wettemann said. "Ninety percent of people basically just use Excel to make lists."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More demanding users who don't want to pay may look to Symphony and its cousin, OpenOffice, a package developed by a nonprofit group that also includes a database program and drawing software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rob Tidrow, a computer programmer who has written several guides to using Microsoft Office, says that Symphony does not lack many features that even power users of Office need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tidrow, who just finished writing "IBM Lotus Symphony for Dummies," said he installed the IBM program on computers that his two children use, but it is also robust enough to meet the needs of churches, schools and small businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can save hundreds, perhaps thousands, of dollars by using free software," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kirk Gregersen, a Microsoft product manager, says that cost is generally not a prime deciding factor for Office customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Surveys show that price is generally the eighth most important factor, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And "free" has its setbacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As soon as you say it's free, (people) feel less comfortable," says Avignon, who has encouraged friends to try Symphony but has won few converts. "They say 'What's the catch?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even so, Microsoft is closely watching these products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We take the competition super-seriously," says Gregersen. "We have to, or we wouldn't be doing the right thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the long-term and short-term Issuer
Default Rating (IDR) for JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM) at 'AA-' and
'F1+', respectively. The Rating Outlook is Stable. In addition, the
debt, preferred stock and deposit ratings of various subsidiaries and
affiliates have been affirmed. A complete list of ratings is shown at
the end of this release.

   JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.

   --Long-term IDR 'AA-';

   --Short-term IDR 'F1+';

   --Individual 'B';

   --Support '5'

   --Support Rating Floor 'NF'.

   In the midst of severe market stress, JPM's diversified revenue
mix and emphasis on strong balance sheet fundamentals have largely
offset market headwinds in the credit and capital markets. JPM's
comparatively limited exposure to many structured products has clearly
benefited the firm and distinguished it from many of its large bank
peers. Partially offsetting this advantage, JPM's exposure to the U.S.
consumer through its mortgage, home equity, credit card and auto
businesses is considerable and likely to continue to pressure earnings
in the near term.

   JPM holds leading market positions in a number of high-margin
institutional businesses, including M advisory, syndicated loans,
and credit derivatives. Its consumer business continues to gain
breadth and depth through both acquisitions and organic development.
As a result, the company's retail operation is second in national
deposit market share, second in home equity originations, and fourth
in mortgage servicing.

   JPM's growing derivatives portfolio is noteworthy. On a notional
basis, the total credit derivative protection bought and sold was
$77.3 trillion at Dec. 31, 2007, with about 82% supported by
collateral arrangements. On a mark-to-market basis, derivative
receivables (net of all collateral) were $67 billion, with more than
86% of net exposure being investment grade. Notwithstanding a strong
ratings profile, collateral agreements, and descending maturity
ladder, this growing exposure is highly dynamic, and adds potential
volatility to earnings period to period.

   Fiscal 2007 was the third full operating year of combined JPM and
BankOne operations, and the second consecutive year of record revenues
and net income. Net income totaled $15.4 billion, up 6% from the prior
year. First-quarter 2008 results were solid, but down compared to the
linked quarter.

   Prudent liquidity management remains a strength of the
organization. Capital is efficiently managed. Credit metrics are solid
but face increasing pressure in this weak credit environment.

   On March 17, 2008 Fitch affirmed JPM's ratings in light of its
proposed acquisition of The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc. (BSC). The
affirmation reflects Fitch's belief that the transaction as structured
does not significantly increase JPM's risk profile nor impair its
capital structure or liquidity position. The purchase is expected to
be immediately accretive to JPM's earnings.

   The present ratings will accommodate continued favorable
performance as well as moderate deterioration in asset quality.
Adverse rating changes may be dictated by a number of factors,
including: significantly higher VaR levels, outsized principal
investments or contingent exposures, excessive leverage, or a
meaningful reversal of positive earnings trends.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Leads the Way in Green Construction by Opening the First LEED Gold Certified Building in Louisiana

ST. TAMMANY PARISH, La.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) today announced the opening of the
company's first LEED certified building and the first gold certified
LEED building in the state of Louisiana. LEED is an acronym for
Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, a certification program
of the United States Green Building Council. LEED has a rating system
for new buildings that are constructed to have less of an impact on
the environment and are healthier for those who work in them.

   Chevron's new building, Northpark, is located in St. Tammany
Parish and will serve as headquarters for Chevron North America
Exploration and Production Company's Gulf of Mexico Business Unit
(GOMBU). GOMBU manages Chevron's offshore exploration and production
of crude oil and natural gas located off the coasts of Louisiana,
Texas and Alabama.

   "Northpark is LEED-ing the way for Chevron as the company's first
commercial LEED registered building, and we are proud that it is
certified gold," said Melody B. Meyer, vice president, GOMBU.
"Northpark is highly technology enabled to support real-time
operations for our Gulf of Mexico shelf and deepwater production
centers."

   Chevron's new building supports the company's long-standing
commitment to the Gulf Coast and the state of Louisiana. Northpark is
located in a parklike setting, and the 300,000-square foot office
building provides a safe, healthy and productive workplace for up to
750 people. Northpark includes 18 technology-enabled team rooms and
Asset Decision Environments that link Chevron's offshore and onshore
personnel in order to enhance innovation, concentration and
collaboration. The building has an open work environment (including
outdoor work areas), a pavilion, an energy center with state-of
the-art conference center, fitness center and a cafeteria.

   Chevron has approximately 3,000 employees and contractors in the
Gulf of Mexico and is one of the largest producers of crude oil and
natural gas on the Gulf of Mexico shelf. The company also has
facilities in Lafayette, Venice, Leeville, and Intracoastal City, La.,
and in Picayune, Miss.

   About Chevron

   Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated
energy companies, with subsidiaries that conduct business across the
globe. The company's success is driven by the ingenuity and commitment
of approximately 59,000 employees who operate across the energy
spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude oil and
natural gas; refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and
other energy products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products;

efficiency solutions; and develops and commercializes the energy
resources of the future, including biofuels and other renewables.

Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007: Hands-On, both offer
exercises and activities designed to provide participants with

project managers or individuals working with projects whose
organizations have adopted SharePoint and who wish to learn the best
practices to adapt it for project management. Administering Microsoft
Office SharePoint Server 2007: Hands-On is valuable for those involved
in managing an existing SharePoint environment, including system and

*IMPORTANT NOTES

1.  Calculation of Net Asset Value

This estimated valuation of the Company's net asset value, which has been
prepared in good faith by the Company's administrator, is for information only.
Save as set forth below, it is determined based upon the latest available
valuations (or estimated valuations) provided, directly or indirectly, by the
investment managers ("Advisors") selected by the Company's investment manager
(the "Investment Manager").  The above estimates do not take into account
certain adjustments yet to be made in relation to performance fee calculations
following a repurchase or sale from treasury of the Company's stock.


2.  Calculation of Performance Data

Set out above are the estimated week to date ("WTD"), estimated month to date
("MTD") and estimated calendar year to date ("YTD") performance figures. The WTD
performance figure is calculated by reference to the previously published
estimated NAV. The MTD performance figure is calculated by reference to the
previous month's estimated NAV as published or, if published, the previous
month's final NAV. The YTD performance figure is calculated by reference to the
NAV at the end of the last calendar year.


3.  ERISA

The articles of association of the Company prohibit any purchase or acquisition
of shares by or on behalf of or for the benefit of an ERISA plan or benefit plan
investor subject to similar laws (a "Plan Investor"), and incorporate provisions
whereby purported purchases of shares by or on behalf of or for the benefit of
an ERISA plan or Plan Investor will not operate to confer any interest or rights
whatsoever in such shares in favour of an ERISA plan or Plan Investor, but
instead will take effect as a trust for redemption in favour of the Company and
the Company will subsequently purchase or redeem such shares, which purchase or
redemption may take place at an amount per share which is less than the price
paid by an ERISA plan or Plan Investor on the purported acquisition.


4.  For the Attention of United States Residents

The shares may not be offered or sold within the United States or to, or for the
account or benefit of, US Persons (as defined in the Regulation S under the
Securities Act of 1933 or any person who would be considered a US person under
Rule 4.7 of the United States Commodity Exchange Act).


5.   Investment Policy

In seeking to achieve its investment objective, the Company will (directly or
indirectly) allocate its assets to a relatively concentrated portfolio of
Advisors (or entities managed by them) selected by the Investment Manager. It is
expected that such Advisors will employ a broad range of alternative investment
strategies, which will include both core strategies (i.e., event driven,
tactical trading, equity long/short and relative value strategies) as well as
other niche strategies. There can be no assurance that the Company will achieve
its investment objective or that it will be able to implement its investment
policy, or that the portfolio design, risk monitoring and hedging strategies of
the Company will be successful.

6.  Notes on Estimated Valuation

Certain securities or other assets in which the Advisors invest may not have a
readily ascertainable market price or may otherwise be difficult to value and
will be priced by the Advisors.

The Company may not have received valuations (or estimated valuations) from
Advisors on a timely or current basis, and may not have received valuations at
all. In order to arrive at the net asset value, the Company will generally use
the latest available valuations (or estimated valuations) provided, directly or
indirectly, by the Advisors.  Valuations (or estimated valuations) received by
the Company may be unaudited or may be subject to little verification or other
due diligence and may not comply with generally accepted accounting practices or
other valuation principles.

In addition, neither the Company's administrator nor the Investment Manager will
generally have sufficient information to be able to independently confirm or
review the completeness, genuineness or accuracy of the Advisors' valuations (or
estimated valuations).  In certain circumstances as set out in the Company's
prospectus, including if the Investment Manager determines, in its sole
discretion, that a valuation is inaccurate or incomplete, the Investment Manager
may, in its sole discretion, determine the fair value of the Company's interests
independently of the Advisor's valuations based on information available to, and
factors deemed relevant (at its sole discretion) by, the Investment Manager at
the time of such valuation.  As stated in the prospectus, no reliance should be
placed on any weekly valuations.

Other risk factors which may be relevant to this estimated valuation are set out
in the Company's prospectus dated 7 July 2006.

As a result of these factors, the actual value of the Company's assets may be
materially different from this published estimated value.  In the event that an

&lt;p&gt;New Visa Club Card Provides Unlimited Access To Jet Charters,
  Luxury Residences And Exotic Automobiles Under A Single Membership
BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Elite Shares Club, (www.elitesharesclub.com) an exclusive
luxury amenity club offering jet charters, luxury residences, and
exotic automobiles under a single membership, today announced a new
branded Visa debit card providing unlimited member access to all club
amenities. The new Visa debit card, offered through Bank of America,
allows club members to use the exclusive card for jet charters, luxury
vacation residences, exotic automobiles and additional amenities under
a single membership.

   "People seeking to join a fractional jet or destination club are
already quite familiar with the prepaid card concept," stated Michael
Friedman, President of Elite Shares Club. Members pay an upfront fee,
in most cases over six figures or $200,000 to $500,000, to some of
these clubs and get only jet hours or four weeks of stay in a
residence in a destination club. With the Elite Shares Club membership
Visa card, you get everything under one membership, access to private
jets, luxury residences, exotic automobiles and many other amenities,
without having to join three or more clubs, and pay several membership
fees or deal with the hassle of ownership. For an annual membership
fee of $12,000 or $1,000 a month, you can load your debit card with
travel funds and can live the millionaire lifestyle of private jets,
luxury residences and exotic cars where cost matches use."

   About Elite Shares Club, Inc.

luxury amenity membership club to provide high-net worth individuals
and corporate executives with unlimited access to our portfolio of
destination properties, private jet charters and exotic automobiles
under a single membership. Unlike most fractional ownership clubs
specializing in either destination properties, private jet charters or
exotic automobiles alone, an Elite Shares Club membership will provide
total access to all the above luxury amenities and more through our
strategic partnerships with the top vendors in the luxury fractional
industry. Annual membership fees are $12,000, and the club offers a
pre-paid luxury visa debit card for full access to all amenities
including jet charters, luxury residences, exotic automobiles and VIP
concierge services. Why pay for three or more memberships when all you
need is one? Call The Elite Shares Club at 310.651.3030 to speak to a
membership representative today.

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Russian parliament on Thursday granted the president the power temporarily to ease immigration rules, opening the way for thousands of British soccer fans to enter Russia for the Champions League final without a visa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The State Duma, the lower house of parliament, changed an existing law to allow new President Dmitry Medvedev to relax or even suspend visa requirements for events drawing large numbers of foreign visitors "in the country's national interest."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Duma minister told the news agency RIA the law was for the Sochi winter Olympics in 2014, but its quick adoption ahead of the May 21 soccer match between English clubs Manchester United and Chelsea proved the government reacted to situations fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nearly 40,000 foreign citizens should be coming to the given game, that's the minimum," said MP Mikhail Grishakov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Chris Baldwin, editing by Tim Pearce)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Award made under GSA SmartPay(R) 2 Master Contract
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The U.S. Department of the Commerce (DOC) has selected JPMorgan as
its provider for charge card services, the firm announced today. The
task order award is part of the U.S. General Services Administration's
(GSA) SmartPay(R) 2 program, the largest government charge card
program in the world.

   The DOC awarded JPMorgan a four-year task order to provide
purchase, travel and fleet card services. The annual volume of the
card program is expected to exceed $220 million with over 23,000
MasterCard-branded cards serviced.

   Six other Federal agencies and organizations chose to tag onto the
DOC task order: The U.S. Office of Personnel Management and the
Smithsonian Institution will use JPMorgan's purchase, travel and fleet
card programs; the Appalachian Regional Commission, Library of
Congress and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, which will use
purchase and travel card programs; and the U.S. Social Security
Administration, which will use JPMorgan's fleet card program.

   "The Department is interested in expanding the use of purchase
cards as a payment mechanism in future contracts and as a payment
solution to low dollar and high volume transactions," said David
Carter, SmartPay(R) 2 Project Manager, DOC.

   W. Stephen Kouns, executive project manager with JPMorgan Federal
Card Solutions, said: "We look forward to working with the DOC and the
other agencies and organizations that are included in the contract and
to delivering the superior levels of service that consistently earn us
high customer service ratings."

   "MasterCard is excited to be working with JPMorgan and the U.S.
Department of Commerce. With the transition to SmartPay(R) 2,
MasterCard looks forward to continuing the advancement of government
payments to new levels of convenience, security, and efficiency," said
Eva Robinson, U.S. Executive, Public Sector, MasterCard Worldwide.

   The GSA SmartPay(R) program, implemented in 1998, handled more
than $27 billion in sales and over 91 million transactions in 2007.
The program is used by federal agencies and organizations to obtain
purchase, travel, fleet and integrated charge card services.

   JPMorgan has been a GSA SmartPay(R) card provider since the

&lt;p&gt;Chevron and Keenan Inaugurate $100 Million Utility Plant at National Interagency Biodefense Campus

    Public-Private Partnership to Deliver Reliable Power and Other
               Utilities to Key U.S. Biodefense Facility
FREDERICK, Md.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Energy Solutions and Keenan Development today announced
the commercial operation of a $100 million central utility plant to
provide efficient and reliable power, chilled water, and steam to the
National Interagency Biodefense Campus (NIBC) at the U.S. Army's Fort
Detrick in Frederick, Maryland.

   The central utility plant's design provides for continuous steam,
chilled water, electricity and standby emergency power to reliably
meet the needs of the NIBC's laboratory and biodefense research work.
Chevron Energy Solutions, a unit of Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX)
that designed and built the plant on schedule and on budget, is
operating the facility, while Keenan Development owns the plant and is
leasing the project land from Fort Detrick.

   "This plant will help ensure continued progress in biomedical
research and other critical defense work at Fort Detrick," said
Colonel Gina Deutsch, garrison commander at Fort Detrick. "In
supporting our nation's biodefense laboratories, this project is
supporting the security of our country."

   "Through creative applied technology, this energy-efficient plant
is safely meeting the needs of the National Interagency Biodefense
Campus," said Jim Davis, president of Chevron Energy Solutions. "We
are proud to have been part of such a meaningful partnership that will
enable the facility to carry out its important work."

   "From the outset of this project, it was clear the U.S. Army was
seeking the most efficient, cost effective and reliable means to
provide power and other utilities in support of its research efforts,"
said John Hill, Keenan Development principal. "We are very pleased
that we have achieved the Army's goals through the comprehensive
solutions that we are providing."

   The new facility is designed to support some of the highest-level
biosafety containment laboratories in the world: the National
Institute of Health's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious
Diseases Integrated Research Facility, the Department of Homeland
Security's National Biodefense Analysis and Countermeasures Center,
Fort Detrick's Steam Sterilization Plant, and the U.S. Army Medical
Research Institute of Infectious Diseases.

   The central utility plant is the first energy project established
through the Department of Defense's enhanced-use lease authority,
which allows private companies to develop non-essential military
property for commercial use.

   Chevron Energy Solutions partners with institutions and businesses
to improve facilities, increase efficiency, reduce energy consumption
and costs, and ensure reliable, high-quality energy for critical
operations. Through contracts with the U.S. Department of Defense and
the U.S. Department of Energy, the company has engineered and
installed improvements at military bases that are expected to save
U.S. taxpayers approximately $240 million in total. At mail facilities
throughout Northern California, the company has completed upgrades
that are saving the U.S. Postal Service more than $2 million per year
in energy costs. For more information about Chevron Energy Solutions,
visit its Web site at www.chevronenergy.com.

   Keenan Development has developed, financed, and design-built
projects for the public sector for more than two decades. Its projects
range from moderately-sized design-build administrative offices to
large, high-tech laboratory and research facilities as well as
preservation of historic facilities and new construction on college
campuses and military installations. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;Award made under GSA SmartPay(R) 2 Master Contract
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


The U.S. Department of the Commerce (DOC) has selected JPMorgan as its provider
for charge card services, the firm announced today. The task order award is part
of the U.S. General Services Administration's (GSA) SmartPay(R) 2 program, the
largest government charge card program in the world.

The DOC awarded JPMorgan a four-year task order to provide purchase, travel and
fleet card services. The annual volume of the card program is expected to exceed
$220 million with over 23,000 MasterCard-branded cards serviced.

Six other Federal agencies and organizations chose to tag onto the DOC task
order: The U.S. Office of Personnel Management and the Smithsonian Institution
will use JPMorgan's purchase, travel and fleet card programs; the Appalachian
Regional Commission, Library of Congress and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum,
which will use purchase and travel card programs; and the U.S. Social Security
Administration, which will use JPMorgan's fleet card program.

"The Department is interested in expanding the use of purchase cards as a
payment mechanism in future contracts and as a payment solution to low dollar
and high volume transactions," said David Carter, SmartPay(R) 2 Project Manager,
DOC.

W. Stephen Kouns, executive project manager with JPMorgan Federal Card
Solutions, said: "We look forward to working with the DOC and the other agencies
and organizations that are included in the contract and to delivering the
superior levels of service that consistently earn us high customer service
ratings."

"MasterCard is excited to be working with JPMorgan and the U.S. Department of
Commerce. With the transition to SmartPay(R) 2, MasterCard looks forward to
continuing the advancement of government payments to new levels of convenience,
security, and efficiency," said Eva Robinson, U.S. Executive, Public Sector,
MasterCard Worldwide.

The GSA SmartPay(R) program, implemented in 1998, handled more than $27 billion
in sales and over 91 million transactions in 2007. The program is used by
federal agencies and organizations to obtain purchase, travel, fleet and
integrated charge card services.

JPMorgan has been a GSA SmartPay(R) card provider since the original master
contract, providing card services to public sector clients for over 20 years.
The firm is also listed on multiple GSA Schedules, including: GSA Schedule 520 -
Financial and Business Solutions (FABS), GSA Schedule 36 - Office Imaging and
Document Solutions and GSA Schedule 874 - Mission Oriented Business Integrated
Services (MOBIS). This allows Federal agencies to contract directly with
JPMorgan for these services. JPMorgan also provides treasury solutions to over

&lt;p&gt;NAIROBI May 8 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola (KO.N) will invest $50
million in capital expenditure in Kenya, with most of the money
earmarked to fund the expansion and scaling up of bottling lines
in the East African country, the firm said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The investment, one of the largest made by Coca-Cola in
Kenya in any single year, reflected the drinks company's
confidence in the Kenyan economy, a senior official said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our business in Kenya was adversely affected by the post
election violence. However, we are pleased that we can now see
progressive stability in our operating landscape," Adeola
Adetunji, general manager of East Africa Franchise Coca-Cola
East and Central Africa Ltd, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see Kenya as a viable investment destination and more
particularly in the long term, and are confident that our
investments will yield positive returns," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kenya's economy is slowly recovering after President Mwai
Kibaki's disputed December re-election triggered violence that
killed at least 1,200 people and hurt major sectors such as
tourism, tea and transport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As a result, the government was forced to revise its GDP
growth estimates for this year to between 4 and 6 percent from
an earlier projection of 7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola has bottling plants in Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu,
Kisii and Eldoret.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by Katie Nguyen)

                          INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT



Robert Walters plc is today publishing its Interim Management Statement for the
four month period from 1 January 2008 to 30 April 2008 and this statement is
being read by Philip Aiken, Chairman, at the Company's Annual General Meeting,
which commences at 9.30am today:



"There has been little change to trading conditions since our last announcement
at our annual results at the end of February 2008. Trading in the first 4 months
of 2008 has been in line with expectations and the Group's international spread
of business has, as expected, enabled it to offset the adverse conditions
affecting the UK, especially in the financial sector.  We have also benefited
from higher overseas earnings due to the recent weakness of Sterling.



We have experienced a shortage of candidates in the majority of our markets,
whilst certain banking sector clients have demonstrated greater caution in
hiring for permanent placements.



Net fee income for the first four months of the year was 19% above that achieved
in the same period in 2007 (12% on a constant currency basis).



We are satisfied with the outcome for the first four months of the year, with
the Group benefitting from its diversified geographical nature and stronger
trading conditions in Europe and Asia Pacific relative to the UK.   Accordingly
the Board's expectations for the full year remain unchanged subject to no
significant deterioration in current market conditions.



During the period, the Company has purchased 4,150,000 shares at an average
price of &#163;1.64, totalling &#163;6.8m."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) gauged 
Facebook's interest in a possible acquisition after the 
software giant's failed takeover attempt of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), 
the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The newspaper reported on its Web site that Microsoft's 
bankers put out subtle signals to Facebook, the social 
networking Web site, to see if it would be open to a full 
acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The talks were first reported by Web site All Things 
Digital, owned by Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook spokeswoman Brandee Barker declined to comment on 
the report. Microsoft officials were not immediately available 
for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In October, Microsoft took a $240 million stake in 
Facebook, which valued the start-up at $15 billion. Citing an 
unnamed source, the report said there are no active discussions 
between the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news came a few days after Microsoft dropped its 
unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo for $47.5 billion. The aim of 
that proposal was to build an online advertising powerhouse to 
rival Google Inc. (GOOG.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Facebook, founded in 2004 by Harvard student Mark 
Zuckerberg, has become one of the hottest properties on the 
Internet because of its rapid growth and the loyalty of its 
users. Facebook has more than 70 million active users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the past, Zuckerberg has resisted selling the entire 
company, opting to work toward an initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft were up 5 cents at $29.75 in afternoon 
Nasdaq trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi and Anupreeta Das in San

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Rupert Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N has opted out of the current round of Internet consolidation for now, even as Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) investors pine for a white knight after Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) dropped its bid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media conglomerate is not in deal talks with Yahoo, Microsoft or Time Warner Inc's (TWX.N) AOL, top News Corp executives said on Wednesday, though they did not rule out approaches down the line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will always look at strategic options, but we feel very comfortable with our current positioning on the Web," News Corp Chief Operating Officer Peter Chernin said on a quarterly earnings call. "We are not in discussions with Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if News Corp was holding ongoing discussions with Yahoo or AOL, Chernin said, "I have not had a conversation with Yahoo or AOL in a couple of weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Nor have I," added Murdoch, News Corp's chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The comments appear to eliminate News Corp as an immediate suitor for Yahoo, which is under pressure to come up with alternatives after Microsoft stunned the market by abruptly abandoning a $47.5 billion bid to buy the Web pioneer on Saturday. Microsoft balked at Yahoo's asking price of $37 per share and was only willing to go up to $33 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo plunged 15 percent on Monday, but have since rallied on hopes the two sides could return to the negotiating table and on expectations that Yahoo could announce a search advertising deal with Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fallout of the Microsoft bid is seen making AOL a more attractive partner for either Yahoo or Microsoft, analysts say. Some even speculate that News Corp may want to combine MySpace with AOL, as Internet companies jostle to take on dominant Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources familiar with the matter said in April that News Corp was considering joining Microsoft's bid for Yahoo, as well as talking to Yahoo by itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEWSDAY DEAL "IN HAND"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Murdoch did not appear to be actively pursuing Internet deals, he said he was confident his company would win the bidding for Tribune Co's Newsday newspaper, which serves the Long Island region of New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;News Corp bid $580 million to buy Newsday, similar to that of Daily News owner Mortimer Zuckerman, but less than the $650 million bid from cable operator Cablevision Systems Corp (CVC.N), sources familiar with the matter say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think Cablevision will prevail," Murdoch said, responding to a question about why he has not raised his bid, which he characterized as "competitively priced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Just be patient for a couple of days ... We're certainly not in the business of getting into an auction here," he said, adding that Newsday would add about $100 million in annual cash flow to News Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're hoping to wrap it up within the next week. We think everything is in hand," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 77-year-old media tycoon, who built News Corp from a pair of Australian newspapers into a global news and entertainment empire, realized a career-long ambition to buy Wall Street Journal publisher Dow Jones  Co last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the Newsday acquisition is successful, Murdoch envisioned keeping Newsday apart from his other New York region paper, the New York Post, as separate papers that share printing and distribution resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot we can do together," Murdoch said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

                               ROBERT WALTERS PLC

                      ("Robert Walters" or "the Company")

                          INTERIM MANAGEMENT STATEMENT



Robert Walters plc is today publishing its Interim Management Statement for the
four month period from 1 January 2008 to 30 April 2008 and this statement is
being read by Philip Aiken, Chairman, at the Company's Annual General Meeting,
which commences at 9.30am today:



"There has been little change to trading conditions since our last announcement
at our annual results at the end of February 2008. Trading in the first 4 months
of 2008 has been in line with expectations and the Group's international spread
of business has, as expected, enabled it to offset the adverse conditions
affecting the UK, especially in the financial sector.  We have also benefited
from higher overseas earnings due to the recent weakness of Sterling.



We have experienced a shortage of candidates in the majority of our markets,
whilst certain banking sector clients have demonstrated greater caution in
hiring for permanent placements.



Net fee income for the first four months of the year was 19% above that achieved
in the same period in 2007 (12% on a constant currency basis).



We are satisfied with the outcome for the first four months of the year, with
the Group benefitting from its diversified geographical nature and stronger
trading conditions in Europe and Asia Pacific relative to the UK.   Accordingly
the Board's expectations for the full year remain unchanged subject to no
significant deterioration in current market conditions.



During the period, the Company has purchased 4,150,000 shares at an average
price of &#163;1.64, totalling &#163;6.8m."

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has no plans to re-submit its $47.5 billion bid for Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), which was pulled earlier this month, Microsoft's Chief Research and Strategy Officer Craig Mundie told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Our view is that we made our best offer," Mundie said in an interview in the Indonesian capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So the market may wish that the Yahoo deal may come back together, but Microsoft at least at this point assumes it's over," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo could always come back again and say please buy us for $33 (a share) and I'm sure we might reconsider it but we're not assuming that's going to happen," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ed Davies and Harry Suhartono, editing by Kim Coghill)&lt;/p&gt;

               RESULTS FOR THE THREE MONTHS 28 MARCH 2008 (IFRS)

            Solid results amidst uncertain global economic conditions



-   Volume of 429 million unit cases, 7% above 2007. Net revenue rose to
    &#8364;1,373 million, 9% above 2007

-   Strong operating profit (EBIT) momentum to &#8364;67 million, 10% above prior 
    year.

-   Net profit of &#8364;28 million, 11% above prior year, and earnings per share of 
    &#8364;0.08, 14% above prior year.

-   Full year 2008 guidance remains unchanged: volume growth of approximately 
    7%, EBIT growth of 11-13% and EPS of &#8364;1.46-&#8364;1.49, an increase of 12-15%.


Doros Constantinou, Managing Director of Coca-Cola Hellenic, commented:

'I am pleased to report a solid start to the year with volume growth across all
our market segments and product categories during the first quarter of 2008.
Solid organic volume growth was supported by the launch of Coca-Coca Zero across
a further 11 countries of operation and significant new product innovation
across other beverage categories.

I am particularly encouraged by the continued business momentum in key markets
and our ability to manage our diverse country and brand portfolio to deliver
balanced growth. Realisation of planned price increases and growth in our
profitable single-serve packages helped offset persisting raw material cost
pressures and higher investments in sales and marketing costs to support our new
product launches. While the first quarter is typically a small one for our
business and the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain, the solid start to
the year and confidence in our plans provides us comfort in achieving our full
year guidance.'

Group Operational Review





Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. ('Coca-Cola Hellenic' or the 'Company'
or the 'Group') delivered a strong operating performance in the first quarter of
2008 with EBIT growth of 10% driven by solid organic volume growth, the
implementation of planned pricing initiatives and positive mix benefits. This
contributed to a 70 basis point increase in gross margins and stable operating
margins, despite the impact of ongoing commodity cost pressures and higher
marketing spend to support the roll-out of significant product innovation
introduced in the first quarter.



Volume grew by 7% in the first quarter, cycling a strong first quarter last
year, with growth achieved across all reporting segments and beverage
categories. This result was achieved through strong field execution of planned
marketing initiatives and the introduction of new products across most beverage
categories. Sparkling beverages volume grew 3% in the quarter, supported by the
launch of Coca-Cola Zero in 11 additional markets, including the 8 remaining
countries within our developing market segment, Serbia and Montenegro in our
emerging market segment and Cyprus in our established market segment. Coca-Cola
Zero is now being sold in 19 of our 28 countries of operation and continues to
support growth of the Coca-Cola Trademark and sparkling beverages under our
three-cola strategy. Following the success of the 'Zero' brand proposition and
in order to enhance consistency across our portfolio of light sparkling
beverages, we have rebranded Fanta Light to Fanta Zero in Switzerland, Italy and
Romania. During the quarter, we also launched Fanta Verdia in Greece, a
low-calorie apple and green tea flavoured beverage with mild carbonation levels,
aimed at broadening the appeal of Fanta towards the more health-oriented
consumer.



Volume in the still and water product categories grew by double digits in the
first quarter, supported by product innovation and strong market place
execution. We continue to balance our beverage portfolio through product
innovation to meet the growing consumer preference for health and wellness
products. During the quarter, we launched Lilia Emotion (a range of enhanced
waters) in the profitable single-serve package in Italy.  We also continued to
broaden our ready-to-drink tea range with the roll-out of Nestea Vitao in five
additional countries and launched Powerade Fit in Greece, a low-calorie
grapefruit flavoured sport drink, primarily targeted at the female population
group. In the juice category, we launched a range of higher-value chilled
functional juices and fruit smoothies under the Amita trademark in Greece, and
relaunched Cappy in Poland in attractive new packaging, supported by a
fully-integrated marketing campaign.



During the quarter we continued to make progress towards our strategic corporate
social responsibility goals through the implementation of our 'ECO driving'
project in Poland, an educational driving programme aimed at reducing fuel
consumption, greenhouse gas emissions and accident rates.  Additionally, in
Greece, we supported a drive to increase public awareness of water conservation,
recycling and energy saving through the development of our 'It's so easy being
Green' integrated marketing campaign for our Avra water brand - comprising above
the line advertising, distinct packaging and point of sale material.  Further
details of our social responsibility activities are available at
www.cchellenic.com, where a copy of our 2007 Social Responsibility report will
be published in mid-May.


Operational Review by Reporting Segments


Established markets

                                              First quarter   % change
                                           2008        2007

Volume (million unit cases)               149.5       144.2         4%
Net sales revenue                         588.8       567.8         4%
Operating profit (EBIT)                    48.5        39.4        23%



-  Unit case volume was 150 million in the first quarter of 2008, 4%
above the prior year.  Sparkling beverages volume grew by low single digits,
still beverages by middle single digits and water by low double digits.



-  Mid-single digit total volume gains in Italy and Greece led the
strong segmental performance as both markets achieved low-single digit sparkling
beverages growth and benefited from significant innovation in still beverages.
In Italy, strong growth was achieved across the range of Fonti del Vulture water
brands as we expanded product availability in the more profitable immediate
consumption channels.



-  Volume grew by low single digits in Austria led by strong growth in
sparkling beverages, while Ireland remained stable compared with the prior year
quarter. In Switzerland, a volume decline of 1% was largely due to a price
increase taken in January 2008, although price and product mix improvements
resulted in mid-single digit revenue growth.



-  Established markets contributed &#8364;49 million to the Group's EBIT for
the first quarter of 2008, 23% above the prior year. This strong profit result
was primarily driven by planned pricing and product mix benefits as well as
lower operating costs as we cycle last year's route-to-market investments in
Austria and Switzerland and increased marketing support related to the launch of
Coke Zero in most of our established countries.



Developing markets


                                              First quarter   % change
                                           2008        2007

Volume (million unit cases)                77.1        74.1         4%
Net sales revenue                         245.1       216.4        13%
Operating profit (EBIT)                   (1.8)         2.8        n/a



-   Unit case volume grew 4% in the first quarter of 2008, cycling strong
comparable growth of 18% last year. Sparkling beverages volume growth of 3% for
the quarter comprised mid-single digit growth in our premium brands, partly
offset by a planned volume decline in our Lift value brand (in Poland and Czech
Republic) as we seek to focus consumers towards our premium brands. The launch
of Coca-Cola Zero in the 8 remaining countries within our developing market
segment supported growth in trademark Coca-Cola of 7%, while still beverages
also grew 11%, with ready-to-drink tea being the largest contributor to growth.



-   Poland led the segmental performance with volume growth in the low
double digits driven by solid growth in both sparkling and still beverage
categories. The ongoing execution of our profitable volume strategy resulted in
our higher margin single-serve packages growing faster than our multi-serve
packages during the quarter in Poland.



-   Developing markets incurred a loss of &#8364;1.8 million during the
quarter, compared with a profit of &#8364;2.8 million last year. In the Czech Republic
and Slovakia, we piloted the introduction of our fully integrated sales order
and distribution system (SAP) and faced some challenges in fulfilling customer
sales orders early in the quarter. This contributed to a one-off volume and
profit loss in this segment, which combined with marketing support costs related
to the Cola-Cola Zero launches in 8 markets, more than offset improvements in
price and product mix.



Emerging markets


                                              First quarter   % change
                                           2008        2007

Volume (million unit cases)               202.2       184.0        10%
Net sales revenue                         538.8       471.2        14%
Operating profit (EBIT)                    19.8        18.0        10%


-   Unit case volume grew 10% in the quarter, successfully cycling 21%
growth in the prior year quarter.  We witnessed a positive trading environment
in this segment with Bulgaria, Romania, Russia, Serbia and Ukraine being the
largest contributors of volume growth during the quarter.



-   In Russia, investment in new products, packaging innovation and
strong marketing support behind our core brands supported low-double digit
volume growth during the quarter. High double-digit growth in still and water
beverages was driven by strong outlet activation in the key account channel,
high growth of our single-serve packages and above the line support across our
Bonaqua water, Nestea and Multon juice portfolio.



-   In Nigeria, volume increased 1% in the quarter with the sparkling
category comparable with last year while water grew by mid-single digits.
Despite a challenging start to the year, we continue to invest in the
marketplace through expanded cooler placement, new marketing campaigns for Coke,
Fanta and Sprite and planned innovation within the juice category. Profitability
in this country grew by double digits as we benefited from improved pricing and
operating cost efficiencies during the quarter.



-   Emerging markets contributed &#8364;20 million to the Group's EBIT for the
first quarter of 2008, representing a segment increase of 10% over the prior
year. Strong volume growth and effective revenue growth management contributed
to revenue growth of 14% for this segment. Despite strong revenue growth,
profitability was negatively impacted by higher commodity costs, particularly
juice costs related to our Multon business in Russia and Fresh &amp; Co. in Serbia.



-   Bulgaria and Romania led the improvement in profit during the quarter
driven by solid volume growth, realisation of planned price increases and
positive product mix development.


2008 Full Year Outlook


Coca-Cola Hellenic achieved strong operating results in the first quarter
supported by solid organic volume growth, pricing realisation in line with our
plans and the roll-out of significant new product innovation ahead of the key
summer selling period. This, combined with our ongoing investment in building
organisational capabilities and revenue growth initiatives, continues to
validate our profitable volume strategy.



Against a backdrop of uncertain global economic conditions and persisting
commodity cost pressures, we believe the strength of Coca-Cola Hellenic's unique
business model of a balanced country portfolio, diverse product range, superior
market execution and disciplined use of capital, will enable us to deliver
another year of profitable growth. As a result, we reiterate our full year
financial targets for 2008 as follows:



-        Volume growth of approximately 7%,

-        EBIT growth of approximately 11%-13%,

-        EPS of approximately &#8364;1.46-&#8364;1.49, an increase of 12%-15%,

-        ROIC increase of approximately 75 basis points.



As we continue to invest in growing our business, we expect recurring net
capital expenditure to be approximately &#8364;550 million. We are also planning to
invest an additional &#8364;130 million over the next three years in our SAP platform
across our markets to support further development of our front-end sales
capabilities and enhance customer service levels.

Net sales revenue



Net sales revenue increased by 9% during the first quarter of 2008 versus the
same period in 2007. Net sales revenue per unit case for the Group increased by
approximately 4.5% during the first quarter of 2008 versus the prior year
quarter, on a currency neutral basis. In terms of segments, this figure grew by
approximately 1% in the established markets, whilst growing by 4% and 10%
respectively in the developing and emerging markets driven by pricing
initiatives and product mix improvement.



Cost of goods sold



Cost of goods sold increased by 8% during the first quarter of 2008 on volume
growth of 7% versus the prior year. On a per unit case basis, cost of goods sold
increased by approximately 3.5% on a currency neutral basis, driven by raw
material cost increases mainly in PET and juices.



Gross profit



Gross profit margin increased from 38.8% in the first quarter last year to 39.5%
in the first quarter of 2008. Margin improvement was driven by revenue growth
initiatives as well as our continued focus on cost efficiency programmes.



Operating expenses



Total operating expenses increased by 11% in first quarter versus the same
period in 2007 which translates to a 5% increase on a per unit case basis,
driven by additional early marketing and sales initiatives coupled with new
product launches primarily in our developing and emerging markets.




Operating profit (EBIT)



Operating profit (EBIT) increased by 10% for first quarter from &#8364;60 million last
year to &#8364;67 million as a result of positive volume and revenue growth, gross
margin improvements and effective cost control.



Tax



Coca-Cola Hellenic's effective tax rate was approximately 27% for the first
quarter of 2008 versus 31% in the prior year. The effective tax rate for the
Company varies on a quarterly basis as a result of the mix of taxable profits
and deductible expenses across our territories.



Net profit



Net profit for the first quarter of 2008 increased by 11% from &#8364;25 million last
year to &#8364;28 million due to strong operating profit growth and lower tax costs
partially offset by higher finance costs.



Cash flow



Cash flow generated from operating activities decreased by &#8364;36 million from &#8364;115
million last year to &#8364;79 million in 2008. Including the impact of net capital
expenditure, operating cash flow was negative &#8364;59 million during the first
quarter of 2008, compared to positive &#8364;12 million in the same period in the
previous year. This was primarily driven by increases in working capital due to
growth in net sales revenue and cost of goods sold, the timing of Catholic
Easter and increased capital expenditure.



Capital expenditure



Coca-Cola Hellenic's capital expenditure, net of receipts from disposal of
assets and including principal repayments of finance lease obligations, amounted
to &#8364;138 million for the first quarter of 2008 (10% of net sales revenue),
compared to &#8364;103 million (8% of net sales revenue)  in 2007.

SPECIAL NOTE REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS



This document contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and
uncertainties. These statements may generally, but not always, be identified by
the use of words such as 'believe', 'outlook', 'guidance', 'intend', 'expect', '
anticipate', 'plan', 'target' and similar expressions to identify
forward-looking statements.  All statements other than statements of historical
facts, including, among others, statements regarding our future financial
position and results, our outlook for 2008 and future years, business strategy
and the effects of our recent acquisitions, and restructuring initiatives on our
business and financial condition, our future dealings with The Coca-Cola
Company, budgets, projected levels of consumption and production, projected raw
material and other costs, estimates of capital expenditure and plans and
objectives of management for future operations, are forward-looking statements.
You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.  By
their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because
they reflect our current expectations and assumptions as to future events and
circumstances that may not prove accurate.  Our actual results could differ
materially from those anticipated in the forward-looking statements for many
reasons, including the risks described in our annual report on Form 20-F filed
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (File No 1-31466).



Although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward-looking
statements are reasonable, we cannot assure you that our future results, level
of activity, performance or achievements will meet these expectations.
Moreover, neither we nor any other person assumes responsibility for the
accuracy and completeness of the forward-looking statements. Unless we are
required by law to update these statements, we will not necessarily update any
of these statements after the date of the consolidated financial statements
included here, either to conform them to actual results or to changes in our
expectations.

1.       Accounting policies



The accounting policies used in the preparation of these financial statements
are consistent with those used in the annual financial statements for the year
ended 31 December 2007, as described in those annual financial statements.



Operating results for the three months ended 28 March 2008 are not indicative of
the results that may be expected for the year ended 31 December 2008 because of
business seasonality. Business seasonality results from a combination of higher
unit sales of the Company's products in the warmer months of the year and the
methods of accounting for fixed costs such as depreciation and interest expense
that are not significantly affected by business seasonality.



Costs that are incurred unevenly during the financial year are anticipated or
deferred in the interim report only if it would also be appropriate to
anticipate or defer such costs at the end of the financial year.



These condensed consolidated financial statements have been prepared in
accordance with IFRS as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board
('IASB') and IFRS as adopted by the European Union ('EU') applicable to Interim
Financial Reporting ('IAS 34'). IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in certain
respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. However, the differences have no
impact on the Group's condensed consolidated financial statements for the
periods presented. These condensed consolidated financial statements should be
read in conjunction with the 2007 annual financial statements, which include a
full description of the accounting policies of Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling
Company S.A.
('Coca-Cola Hellenic' or the 'Company' or the 'Group').



Certain comparative figures have been reclassified to conform with changes in
presentation in the current period.



2.         Exchange rates



For Coca-Cola Hellenic, we believe that the euro is the most appropriate
reporting currency, as it is the currency most closely aligned to the operating
currencies of the Group.
Coca-Cola Hellenic translates the income statements of subsidiary operations to
the euro at average exchange rates and the balance sheet at the closing exchange
rate for the period.



The principal exchange rates used for transaction and translation purposes in
respect of one euro were:

5.         Tax



The effective tax rate for the Company differs from the 2008 Greek statutory
rate of 25% as a consequence of a number of factors, the most significant of
which are the non-deductibility of certain expenses and the fact that the tax
rates in the countries in which the Company operates differ materially from the
Greek statutory tax rate. The statutory tax rates applicable to the country
operations of the Company range from 0%-31%.



The effective tax rate for the Company varies on a quarterly basis as a result
of the mix of taxable profits and deductible expenses across territories and as
a consequence of tax adjustments arising during the year, which do not
necessarily refer to the current period's operations.



The effective tax rate (excluding the adjustments to intangible assets) is
approximately 27% for the first quarter of 2008 (2007: 31%). This rate is quoted
before any tax credit is recognised for the current recognition of acquired and
previously unrecognised accumulated tax benefits.




6.                  Earnings per share



Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable
to shareholders of the Group by the weighted average number of shares in issue
during the period (2008:       363,832,088 shares; 2007: 363,101,874 shares).
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average
number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all dilutive
potential ordinary shares arising from exercising employee stock options.



The 2007 comparatives have been adjusted for the bonus share issue in 2007.

9.                  Share capital



On 28 February 2008, Coca-Cola Hellenic's Board of Directors resolved to
increase the share capital of the Company by 824,832 new ordinary shares,
following the exercise of stock options by option holders pursuant to the
Company's stock option plan. Proceeds from the issue of the shares were &#8364;11.6
million.



After the above increase, the share capital amounts to &#8364;182.3 million and is
divided into 364,563,189 shares with a nominal value of &#8364;0.50 each.





10.              Dividends



The directors propose a dividend of &#8364;0.25 per share (totalling &#8364;91.1 million)

formal approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 23 June 2008.



Under Greek corporate legislation, companies are annually required to declare
dividends of at least 35% of unconsolidated adjusted after-tax IFRS profits. The
statutory minimum dividend recognised for 2007 amounted to &#8364;42.2 million and was
recorded as liability under 'Other current liabilities' in the condensed
consolidated balance sheet. The remaining estimated dividend of &#8364;48.9 million
will be accounted for in shareholders' equity as an appropriation of retained
earnings in the year ending 31 December 2008.

&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY (Hollywood Reporter) - A crime reporter at 
Mexican broadcaster Televisa is reported missing, raising fear 
that he may be the latest journalist to come under attack amid 
an increase in drug-related violence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Reporter Jorge Carrasco disappeared April 30 in Mexico 
City. According to a statement Friday from Paris-based 
Reporters Without Borders, there is no hard evidence that his 
disappearance is linked to his work. However, an anonymous 
caller told federal authorities that Carrasco was forced into a 
pickup truck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With about 30 reporters murdered since 2000, Mexico is the 
most dangerous nation for journalists in the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 9 (Reuters) - U.S. environment group The Nature
Conservancy said on Friday it will appoint Goldman Sachs' (GS.N)
green guru as its new president and chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mark Tercek, the head of the investment bank's environmental
markets center, as well as its environment strategy group, will head
the Conservancy starting in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move is the latest example of green groups working more
closely with financial companies to tackle environmental problems
like climate change and deforestation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Mark is opening innovative possibilities for aligning economic
forces with conservation," Gretchen Daily, a biology professor at
Stanford University and a Nature Conservancy board member, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tercek worked with Daily on advancing finance and policy
mechanisms for valuing forest systems for the roles they play in
supporting human health, thereby creating alternatives to rainforest
destruction, the Conservancy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was also an advisor in the 2007 buyout of utility TXU Corp by
a group, including private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co,
in which the power generator agreed to halt plans to build several
coal-fired power plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He has made a significant contribution to our own environmental
efforts and, before that, to our banking franchise," Lloyd
Blankfein, Goldman's chairman and CEO said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Nature Conservancy is working to achieve its 2015 goal of
conserving 10 percent of all natural habitats on the planet.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs economists expect a total of $500 billion in residential mortgage credit losses, a renewed slowdown in economic activity after the near-term boost from fiscal stimulus, and no monetary policy tightening in 2008 or 2009, according to a research note from the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite a setback in recent days, many financial market indicators have recovered substantially since the Bear Stearns/JPMorgan Chase  Co deal in mid-March, Goldman Sachs chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, "we think that overall mortgage credit losses will end up being larger than generally believed," Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Excess supply in the housing market is still growing; home prices are already falling at rates that are very rapid by the standards of previous housing downturns around the world; and U.S. loan-to-value ratios are much higher than in those previous downturns," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, a painful adjustment needs to take place, certainly in the housing and credit markets and likely in the broader economy as well," Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if the shock is moderate, it can have large multiplier effects if it reduces the equity capital of highly leveraged financial institutions that mark their balance sheets to market, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BAD NEWS, GOOD NEWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the leveraged losses story sounds dire, its implications for the U.S. economic outlook are actually somewhat encouraging at present, Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reduced selling pressure or outright purchases of beaten-down assets will eventually support asset prices, this will push down leverage, and the resulting balance sheet relaxation will facilitate further asset purchases, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This means that good news can continue to feed on itself," he said, with "positive spillover effects on sentiment and activity in the broader economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the increase in mortgage credit defaults is large and has further to go and the "locus of pain" tied to losses related to further mortgage credit defaults is likely to shift away from subprime mortgages, where the markets are already discounting very large losses, to other residential mortgage debt, including prime mortgages, Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one reason why we expect a renewed slowdown in economic activity after the stimulus-fueled bounce in mid- to late 2008," Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That "makes us fairly confident that Fed officials will not start tightening policy at that time, as markets now seem to believe," he said. "If anything, they may come under pressure to ease further, though at present this is not our base case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) said on Friday it was appealing against a record 899 million euro ($1.39 billion) fine imposed by the European Commission for using high prices to discourage software competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft today filed to the (EU) Court of First Instance an application to annul the European Commission decision of February 27," the U.S. software giant said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are filing this appeal in a constructive effort to seek clarity from the court," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Union's executive Commission, which has been locked in a long-running battle over fair-competition issues with Microsoft, said in response that it was confident the fine was "legally sound".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission had said it was imposing the fine because the U.S. software group had defied a 2004 order from Brussels to provide information to competitors on reasonable terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has been fined a total of 1.68 billion euros by the EU for abusing its 95 percent dominance of PC operating systems through its Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 899 million euro fine was the biggest ever imposed on a company by the EU executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission had initially fined Microsoft 497 million euros in March 2004 for withholding interoperability information for "work group server" software and for deliberately damaging rivals by tying its Windows Media Player to its Windows system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft unsuccessfully appealed against that penalty and was also later fined 280.5 million euros by the Commission for non-compliance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest fine picked up from where the 280.5 million euro penalty left off, covering the period from June 21, 2006 until October 21, 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Lawsky, writing by Darren Ennis, editing by&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dale Hudson)&lt;/p&gt;

   With this contract, consistent with the goals of the 2008-10
Strategic Plan, IBERDROLA RENEWABLES completes its turbine supply
program for its wind power program in the U.S., thus avoiding one of
the principal uncertainties in this business and guaranteeing the
installation of a major part of its projects in the short and medium
term.

   The agreement with General Electric follows the previous purchase
of 300 MW in turbine capacity from Mitsubishi in the context of a
framework agreement, scheduled for delivery in 2010 in the United
States, and acquisition last year from Suzlon Wind Energy Corporation
of turbines with a capacity of 700 MW, for delivery between 2008-2009.

   Also, in 2006, IBERDROLA RENEWABLES signed a contract with Gamesa
for the supply of 2,700 MW in turbine capacity for delivery between
2007 and 2009.

   Strengthened presence in the U.S.

   These supply contracts help IBERDROLA RENEWABLES to strengthen its
presence in the U.S. market, where it has become the second largest
wind power company by installed capacity. The Company had 2,392 MW(b)
in installed capacity there at the end of the first quarter of 2008
and a project pipeline of 22,138 MW -- more than half the total
pipeline -- in the United States.

   IBERDROLA RENEWABLES has accumulated a total installed capacity of
8,164 MW(b) at the end of the first quarter, an increase of 80%
compared to the 4,552 MW at the same period last year. Of this total,
7,822 MW(b) correspond to wind farms and 342 MW to mini hydro plants.

   The Company, which has consolidated its leadership in the world
wind power sector(a), now has 4,681 MW of installed capacity in Spain
and 3,483 MW(b) abroad. IBERDROLA RENEWABLES plans to invest EUR 8.6
billion between 2008-2010 to install 2,000 MW a year and reach 13,600
MW at the end of the period. Currently, it has 1,367 MW under
construction worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Invites People to 'Connect with the World over a Coke' in Celebration of the 2008 Olympic Games

        U.S. Program Enhances Olympic Games Experience for Fans
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
With three months to go until the Opening Ceremony for the 2008
Olympic Games in Beijing, Coca-Cola is inviting people in the U.S. to
celebrate the Olympic ideals of unity, optimism and inspiration. Long
before the first medals are awarded in August, Coca-Cola will build
excitement for the Olympic Games with the launch of a multi-faceted
Olympic-themed program in the U.S. Anchored by a group of high-profile
U.S. Olympians and Olympic hopefuls, limited edition Olympic-themed
packaging and online experiences, the program is designed to bring
fans together to celebrate the spirit and camaraderie associated with
the world's biggest sporting event.

   "Together, Coca-Cola and the Olympic Games have shared and
promoted the values of unity, optimism and inspiration for 80 years,"
said Hendrik Steckhan, president and general manager, Sparkling
Beverages, Coca-Cola North America. "For the 2008 Olympic Games in
Beijing, we're continuing that legacy of engaging the world. By
combining Coca-Cola cans in different languages with six amazing
athletes, we've created a program that celebrates global communities
coming together and the unifying spirit of the Olympic Games and
Coca-Cola."

   Connect With The World

   Beginning May 19, Coca-Cola will give Americans a 'taste' of how
Coke is enjoyed around the world with the release of limited edition,
Olympic-themed collectible cans and FridgePacks bearing the iconic
Coca-Cola logo in different languages, including Ethiopian, Russian,
Thai, Mandarin, and of course, English. This new packaging marks the
first appearance of the Coca-Cola script in different languages in the
United States, with new designs appearing every two to three weeks.

   Hitting stores simultaneously, 20-ounce Coca-Cola bottles will
feature labels with multiple languages including those of the U.S.,
Bangladesh, China, Egypt, Georgia, Israel, Korea, Nepal and Sri Lanka.

   "Six-Pack" of Athletes

   To connect U.S. consumers with the spirit and excitement of the
upcoming Games, a special Coca-Cola "Six Pack" of athletes will be
featured on collectible packaging and in-store materials. The "Six
Pack" includes gold medalists Natalie Coughlin (swimming), Steven
Lopez (taekwondo) and Sanya Richards (track &amp; field); Olympians LeBron
James (USA basketball) and Andy Potts (triathlon); and Olympic hopeful
Shawn Johnson (gymnastics). Leading by example, the athletes also are
serving as Coca-Cola "Ambassadors of Active Living" to help encourage
and inspire people to lead active, balanced lives.

   Advertising

   Today in New York, five of the Coca-Cola "Six Pack" of athletes"
are filming special NBC vignettes that will air during the summer to
raise awareness of the collectible Coca-Cola packaging. These
vignettes will join other Olympic-themed ads from Coca-Cola this
summer, including a commercial that celebrates the 80-year
relationship between Coca-Cola and the Olympic Games.

   Online Olympic Experience

   MyCoke.com will be the destination for teens looking to interact
with Coca-Cola and the Olympic Games in a fun, global way. Visitors
can design their own digital Coke bottle to share with others around
the world; learn about the Coca-Cola "Six Pack" of athletes; download
wallpaper and screen savers; and enter a sweepstakes for a
snowboarding trip with Olympic medalist Gretchen Bleiler to Vancouver,
the site of the 2010 Olympic Winter Games. The site also will feature

imposed on Microsoft (MSFT.O) is legally sound, a spokesman for
the EU executive said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 9 (Reuters) - RickMetric Group's ISS unit, which
offers corporate governance advice to large shareholders, has
recommended that U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) separate
its chairman and chief executive positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Members of the Rockefeller family have called on the company
to make governance changes and increase spending on alternative
fuels. John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil Co in 1870, and it
became a precursor to Exxon Mobil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fifteen descendants of the oil baron are involved in four
shareholder resolutions seeking changes at Exxon, including
dividing the CEO and chairmanship positions held by Rex
Tillerson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The decision by this advisory service to recommend that
investors vote for an independent chairman at ExxonMobil is a most
welcome development and adds considerable new momentum to this
shareholder resolution," said Peter O'Neill, a great-great
grandson of Rockefeller, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separating the two positions will enable CEO Rex Tillerson to
focus on delivering positive results, while empowering the
chairman and the board to objectively analyze the long term
challenges and opportunities facing the company, O'Neill said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, which is having its annual meeting on May 28, has asked
shareholders not to support the proposal and said it believes the
most effective leadership structure for the company is for
Tillerson to serve as both chairman and CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is unclear how many shares the Rockefeller family controls.
Exxon was able to identify 12 of the 15 Rockefellers associated
with the shareholder resolution and said they collectively own
around 332,000 of the company's 5.4 billion shares -- or about
0.006 percent of outstanding shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ISS report notes that the Rockefeller family still owns a
substantial, but undisclosed, minority stake in Exxon Mobil.

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil, Employees, Retirees Donate More Than $2.5 Million to Louisiana Colleges and Universities

    19 Louisiana Institutions to Receive Educational Matching Gift
                                 Grant
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil announced today that more than $2.5 million has been
donated to 19 colleges and universities in Louisiana through the
ExxonMobil Foundation's 2007 Educational Matching Gift Program.

   ExxonMobil employees, retirees, surviving spouses and directors
contributed more than $900,000 to Louisiana institutions of higher
education in 2007, which was matched by the ExxonMobil Foundation with
$1.6 million in unrestricted educational grants.

   The Educational Matching Gift Program is one of the most generous
of its kind in the United States, matching gifts to affiliated higher
education institutions by employees and retirees on a 3-to-1 basis.
Since its inception in 1962, the program has provided more than $372
million to higher education in the United States.

   ExxonMobil Foundation funds math and science programs to respond
to the nation's growing need to produce more engineers and scientists
and to develop more highly qualified math and science teachers. To
assist with these efforts, the Foundation is encouraging college and
university presidents to allocate a portion of the unrestricted
matching funds to existing or new programs which provide teachers with
professional development opportunities, train new math and science
teachers, and support women and minority science and engineering
programs.

   "For more than 40 years ExxonMobil's employees and retirees have
demonstrated their commitment to institutions of higher education
through their generous contributions through the Educational Matching
Gift Program," said Kenneth P. Cohen, vice president for public
affairs, Exxon Mobil Corporation, and chairman, ExxonMobil Foundation.
"These donations provide universities throughout the nation an
opportunity to enhance their current educational programs and to
achieve new levels of excellence."

   Under the Educational Matching Gift Program, ExxonMobil provides
the 3-1 matching funding for donations of up to $7,500 a year to
colleges and universities with which employees or retirees are
affiliated. The affiliation requirement is waived for gifts to the
United Negro College Fund, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund and the
American Indian College Fund.

   About ExxonMobil Foundation

   ExxonMobil Foundation is the primary philanthropic arm of the
Exxon Mobil Corporation in the United States. The Foundation and the
Corporation engage in a range of philanthropic activities that advance
education, health and science in the communities where ExxonMobil has
significant operations. In the United States, ExxonMobil supports
initiatives to improve math and science education at the K-12 and
higher education levels. Globally, ExxonMobil provides funding to
improve basic education and combat malaria and other infectious
diseases in developing countries. In 2007, together with its employees
and retirees, Exxon Mobil Corporation, its divisions and affiliates,
and ExxonMobil Foundation provided $207 million in contributions
worldwide, of which $70 million was dedicated to education. Additional
information on ExxonMobil's community partnerships and contributions
programs is available at www.exxonmobil.com/community.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 9 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded Cascade
Microtech Inc (CSCD.O) to "neutral" from "overweight," saying
it is cautious about the chip-testing equipment maker's outlook
for the second half of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Near-term outlook for engineering probe stations is
uninspiring as semiconductor customers continue to delay
discretionary purchases for research and development until the
macro outlook improves, the brokerage said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan also said it does not anticipate probe station
market conditions to improve until the first half of 2009 at
the earliest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company, which have fallen nearly 42 percent
in the last 12 months, closed at $7.53 Thursday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pointing at a slew of job cuts, Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said in a regulatory filing that about 1,100 employees were eligible for severance payments, after it implemented a restructuring plan in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Severance payments for about 300 staffers, mostly outside the United States, had already been made as of March 31, the second largest U.S. oil company said in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A majority of job cuts are expected to occur in 2008, and the program is expected to be completed by the end of 2009, Chevron said in the filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron posted a rise in first-quarter earnings earlier this month as record oil prices outweighed weak profits from gasoline production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Aarthi Sivaraman; editing by Rory Channing)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) -  Financial institutions are closer
to reducing their borrowings to levels that regulators and
markets want, JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chairman and Chief
Executive Jamie Dimon said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Under pressure to reduce the risk to their balance sheets,
Wall Street banks have been cutting borrowing relative to
assets in a bid to shore up capital amid the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The de-leveraging process is well on its way. I don't know
if it's half or 60 or 70 percent done. That will take another
minimum six months," Dimon told delegates at an Investment
Company Institute conference in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That process, which can entail shedding assets, issuing
equity or paying off debt, has been painful for many banks and
brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said leverage has contributed to the problems in the
capital markets and said Bear Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N, hedge
funds and banks had taken more risk than they thought they did.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attention on funding at the biggest U.S. investment banks
has intensified since Bear Stearns nearly collapsed after its
liquidity almost evaporated in March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which
supervises the top investment banks, including Bear Stearns, is
planning to require the firms to publicly disclose their
current liquidity and capital positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BALANCED REGULATION NEEDED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global banking regulators are trying to close gaps that let
banks harbor risks out of regulatory sight and are pushing for
higher capital charges for handling asset-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. lawmakers are pushing for stricter oversight of the
investment banks because they were given emergency access to
the Federal Reserve's discount borrowing window in March, as
the credit crisis deepened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I do think it's completely legitimate for regulators to go
back and say, okay, since we had to do that, we would look back
at the things we should change and make sure the system doesn't
have to go through that kind of thing again," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banks are less regulated than commercial banks,
which do have access to the central bank's discount window and
are supervised by the Fed for safety and soundness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We can't have the discount window open so that people can
take bigger bets," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon, however, warned against too much regulation and said
it could force investors to seek out more private investments
such as private equity and hedge funds that are typically not
transparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon also said JPMorgan hopes to close on its acquisition
of Bear Stearns around June 1. JPMorgan is offering $10 a share
for Bear, up from an initial offer of around $2 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I've been through a lot of mergers, but I've never been
through one like this," he added. "I got that call on Thursday
night. If I ever get a call like that again, I'm going to say,
wrong number."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said there was a lot of talent at Bear that JPMorgan
would benefit from.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect to get the benefits we told our shareholders
about," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK (Reuters) - Western aid experts in Bangkok will have to wait at least four more days to get into Myanmar to help cyclone victims because the Myanmar embassy in the Thai capital has taken a local holiday on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.N. officials and travel agents said they had been told by the Myanmar embassy that any visa applications would not be processed until Monday or Tuesday, adding to the frustration of&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;western relief workers eager to help the 1.5 million victims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a four-day wait which just should not happen," said Paul Risley, spokesman for the U.N. World Food Programme. "This is too long to wait for people whose lives are at such a precarious balance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thailand is observing an annual ancient Brahminical rite, or ploughing ceremony, dating back around 700 years heralding the start of the new rice-growing season. Friday was a holiday for civil servants but financial markets and businesses were open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly a week after a disaster that diplomats and aid experts believe may have killed 100,000 people, relief workers were still in the dark about visas, which are tightly guarded by the ruling military deeply suspicious of the outside world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Myanmar Embassy in Bangkok usually does not accept phone calls and there was no response on Friday. A travel agent was told the embassy was closed and visa applications would not be processed until Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Myanmar has allowed a handful of cargo flights from several Asian countries and two U.N. flights to land in the former capital Yangon and unload emergency supplies, but has responded slowly to allowing westerners to enter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.N. humanitarian agency officials said 30 to 40 "critical" U.N. and other aid agency staff were in the visa queue, most of them in Bangkok.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United Nations estimated that 1.5 million people have been "severely affected" by Cyclone Nargis that struck last Saturday followed by huge waves that virtually destroyed villages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool; Editing by Bill Tarrant)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs economists expect a 
total of $500 billion in residential mortgage credit losses, a 
renewed slowdown in economic activity after the near-term boost 
from fiscal stimulus, and no monetary policy tightening in 2008 
or 2009, according to a research note from the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Despite a setback in recent days, many financial market 
indicators have recovered substantially since the Bear 
Stearns/JPMorgan Chase  Co deal in mid-March, Goldman Sachs 
chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, "we think that overall mortgage credit losses will 
end up being larger than generally believed," Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Excess supply in the housing market is still growing; home 
prices are already falling at rates that are very rapid by the 
standards of previous housing downturns around the world; and 
U.S. loan-to-value ratios are much higher than in those 
previous downturns," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Ultimately, a painful adjustment needs to take place, 
certainly in the housing and credit markets and likely in the 
broader economy as well," Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if the shock is moderate, it can have large multiplier 
effects if it reduces the equity capital of highly leveraged 
financial institutions that mark their balance sheets to 
market, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BAD NEWS, GOOD NEWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the leveraged losses story sounds dire, its 
implications for the U.S. economic outlook are actually 
somewhat encouraging at present, Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reduced selling pressure or outright purchases of 
beaten-down assets will eventually support asset prices, this 
will push down leverage, and the resulting balance sheet 
relaxation will facilitate further asset purchases, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This means that good news can continue to feed on itself," 
he said, with "positive spillover effects on sentiment and 
activity in the broader economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the increase in mortgage credit defaults is large 
and has further to go and the "locus of pain" tied to losses 
related to further mortgage credit defaults is likely to shift 
away from subprime mortgages, where the markets are already 
discounting very large losses, to other residential mortgage 
debt, including prime mortgages, Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is one reason why we expect a renewed slowdown in 
economic activity after the stimulus-fueled bounce in mid- to 
late 2008," Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That "makes us fairly confident that Fed officials will not 
start tightening policy at that time, as markets now seem to 
believe," he said. "If anything, they may come under pressure 
to ease further, though at present this is not our base case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 11 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) was
restarting a 118,000-barrel-per-day gasoline-producing fluidic
catalytic cracking unit at its 349,000-bpd Beaumont, Texas,
refinery over the weekend, according to a notice filed Saturday
with state pollution regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A carbon monoxide boiler on the cat cracker shut down and
was restarted Saturday while work to restart the FCC was
underway, according to the notice, filed with Texas Commission

on March 13 and had said in regulatory filings the work could
last through May 15.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs economists expect a 
total of $500 billion in residential mortgage credit losses, a 
renewed slowdown in economic activity after the near-term boost 
from fiscal stimulus, and no monetary policy tightening in 2008 
or 2009, according to a research note from the firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Despite a setback in recent days, many financial market 
indicators have recovered substantially since the Bear 
Stearns/JPMorgan Chase  Co deal in mid-March, Goldman Sachs 
chief U.S. economist Jan Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, "we think that overall mortgage credit losses will 
end up being larger than generally believed," Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Excess supply in the housing market is still growing; home 
prices are already falling at rates that are very rapid by the 
standards of previous housing downturns around the world; and 
U.S. loan-to-value ratios are much higher than in those 
previous downturns," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Ultimately, a painful adjustment needs to take place, 
certainly in the housing and credit markets and likely in the 
broader economy as well," Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if the shock is moderate, it can have large multiplier 
effects if it reduces the equity capital of highly leveraged 
financial institutions that mark their balance sheets to 
market, he said.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BAD NEWS, GOOD NEWS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the leveraged losses story sounds dire, its 
implications for the U.S. economic outlook are actually 
somewhat encouraging at present, Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reduced selling pressure or outright purchases of 
beaten-down assets will eventually support asset prices, this 
will push down leverage, and the resulting balance sheet 
relaxation will facilitate further asset purchases, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This means that good news can continue to feed on itself," 
he said, with "positive spillover effects on sentiment and 
activity in the broader economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the increase in mortgage credit defaults is large 
and has further to go and the "locus of pain" tied to losses 
related to further mortgage credit defaults is likely to shift 
away from subprime mortgages, where the markets are already 
discounting very large losses, to other residential mortgage 
debt, including prime mortgages, Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is one reason why we expect a renewed slowdown in 
economic activity after the stimulus-fueled bounce in mid- to 
late 2008," Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That "makes us fairly confident that Fed officials will not 
start tightening policy at that time, as markets now seem to 
believe," he said. "If anything, they may come under pressure 
to ease further, though at present this is not our base case."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by James Dalgleish)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) is in talks to buy technology outsourcing company Electronic Data Systems Corp EDS.N for $12 billion to $13 billion in a deal which would vault it to a close second to IBM in technology services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The acquisition would be HP's biggest since its $19 billion acquisition of Compaq in 2002. Shares of EDS rose nearly 28 percent, taking its market value to about $12 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP shares fell nearly 5 percent amid some skepticism that slow-growing EDS, still considered in turnaround mode, would provide more than a one-time boost, and might not be worth a premium of as much as 37 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source briefed on the matter confirmed the talks to Reuters and said the plan was to announce a deal by the close of Tuesday. The Wall Street Journal first reported the discussions, and later HP and EDS both said they were in talks about a business combination but gave no details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While Hewlett-Packard has over time built up its own outsourcing practice, this clearly is a move by Mark Hurd to challenge IBM in the services area," said David Garrity, director of research at Dinosaur Securities, referring to HP's chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bigger HP could compete better against International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) in going after large clients and help it keep costs in line, analysts said. If HP completes the acquisition, it would be by far the largest under CEO Hurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It would put Hewlett-Packard in the sweet spot of an IT spending trend. It would definitely improve their position against IBM," said CRT Capital Group analyst Ashok Kumar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SKEPTICISM ABOUT TARGET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP has long considered an acquisition to beef up its tech services business, a sector that offers relatively stable income and high margins even in an economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide computer services revenue rose 10.5 percent to $748 billion in 2007, according to data released on Monday by market research firm Gartner Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM continued to be the leader, with 7.2 percent share. EDS weighed in at No. 2, with 3.0 percent of the market, while HP was No. 5, with 2.2 percent market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Together HP and EDS would have roughly $39.4 billion in services revenue, compared with IBM's $54.1 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"HP gains a very strong No. 2 position in total services market share and professional services market share behind IBM," said Gartner analyst Allie Young.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If EDS were to remain independent it would have a tough time holding on to its number 2 slot in IT services market, Young said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDS brings to HP a strong base in infrastructure outsourcing, Young said. But neither HP nor EDS is strong in high-end consulting, which is a strong suit for IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet there was some skepticism about HP's target, EDS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unless HP has some synergies where they can dramatically impact earnings growth of EDS, I'm not sure why they'd want to buy it," said Jim Huguet, co-chief executive at Great Companies LLC. He noted that EDS's earnings growth has averaged 2.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"EDS is trading at about half its historical PE, so they're obviously seeing it as a value, which it is if you can generate earnings growth at 15-20 percent. But my question is whether it will become a drain on Hewlett-Packard?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, EDS reported a 62 percent decline in first quarter profit, though the results had topped Wall Street expectations. Despite the beat, analysts said EDS faced intense competition from Indian rivals and saw little catalyst for growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides HP and IBM, EDS also competes with Accenture Ltd (ACN.N) and Computer Sciences Corp (CSC.N) in the United States, as well as Indian companies Infosys Technologies Ltd (INFY.BO), Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS.BO) and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (CTSH.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"EDS has been relatively stagnant over the past few years. HP has been trying to promote themselves as a major services organization over the past few years. This will certainly help them with that," said Chad Hersh, an analyst at Novarica.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDS has cut thousands of jobs to boost profits, and also is generating revenue from contracts including a lucrative deal last year with the U.S. Navy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that Hewlett would be acquiring a fairly clean book of business, at least one that has been well scrubbed. So there shouldn't be any untoward surprises," Garrity said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2000, HP pulled out of talks to buy the consulting business of PricewaterhouseCoopers for as much as $18 billion. IBM in October 2002 closed its $3.5 billion acquisition of PricewaterhouseCoopers' consulting division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jui Chakravorty, Tiffany Wu and Ritsuko Ando in New York, Jim Finkle in Boston, and Duncan Martell in San Francisco; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Carol Bishopric, Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon on Monday told bank investors that while the current credit market crunch may soon be over, the U.S. economy could still face a deep and extended recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The slump in mortgage and corporate loan markets could bottom out this year, said Dimon, whose bank largely side-stepped the losses and mark-downs that have hobbled rivals during the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the economy may face a longer-term challenge even as financial markets begin to function again, the "slower burn" of a recession that may rival the severity of the 1982 contraction, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These challenging conditions, marked by tighter bank credit, new rounds of mark-downs, further capital infusions and asset sales by banks, could last through next year and into 2010, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If that happens, Dimon warned that New York-based JPMorgan and its national consumer lending businesses would suffer some significant losses, such as home equity losses doubling to $900 million by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon further warned that the bank would have to continue boosting loan-loss reserves if economic conditions deteriorate, further eating into profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the current quarter, Dimon said subprime mortgage losses could rise to between $200 million and $250 million, with prime mortgages generating about $100 million in losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loss rates in JPMorgan Chase's massive credit card business are expected to reach 5 percent in the second quarter and rise to as high as 6 percent next year, while at the same time interest and fee revenue decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third-largest U.S. bank also expects to write down "several-hundred-million" dollars of auction rate securities, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) said on Monday that it received a notice from federal regulators indicating that one of its units may face an enforcement action related to "the bidding of various financial instruments associated with municipal securities."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N, which JPMorgan is buying, also got a notice from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission indicating possible civil charges, stemming from anti-competitive activity relating to bidding for municipal securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear whether there was any relationship between the two investigations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Christian Plumb; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) expects to
report a $1 billion second-quarter gain related to the Bear
Stearns Cos BSC.N takeover, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie
Dimon said on Monday, though some merger benefits will be less
than predicted while some losses will drag on results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Dimon also told a UBS investor conference that JPMorgan has
identified positions for 40 percent of Bear's nearly 14,000
employees. To date, 75 percent of people decisions from the
merger have been completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has already realized $200 million of losses
reflecting its 49.5 percent ownership of Bear since April 8,
Dimon said. He warned that JPMorgan expects about $200 million
of further Bear losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The projected $1 billion gain reflects the addition of Bear
Stearns capital, offset by roughly $9 billion of losses
reflecting asset sales, purchase accounting, restructuring,
litigation costs and Bear's second-quarter losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon also disclosed that JPMorgan now expects its total
equity to rise by $2 billion, substantially less than the $5
billion increase previously forecast. Dimon also projected $900
million in merger expenses through 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet Dimon remained upbeat about the deal, which was
orchestrated by Federal Reserve officials who worried Bear was
in danger of going bankrupt in mid-March. JPMorgan initially
agreed to pay just $2 a share for Bear, but later lifted that
to $10 a share, or roughly $1.5 billion in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the short run, integrating Bear's asset management and
brokerage businesses will reduce earnings through next year,
Dimon said. JPMorgan intends to close down "a big chunk" of
Bear's asset management, while the bigger bank was forced to
pay hefty bonuses to retain Bear's productive brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Longer term, Dimon said Bear's investment bank would
generate between $800 million and $1.13 billion of earnings for
JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan also disclosed that Bear's balance sheet has been
reduced substantially since JPMorgan announced its takeover in
mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total risk-weighted assets fell to $150 billion from $225
billion, led by reductions in mortgage and credit trading
positions, and that figure is expected to shrink further to $95
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prime brokerage assets, down 25 percent to $30 billion, are
expected to rebound to $50 billion, he said. Total Bear assets
of $410 billion fell by nearly half to $225 billion since March
17, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), acquiring rival investment bank Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N amid one of the worst market slumps ever, so far has extended jobs to about 6,000 out of Bear's nearly 14,000 employees, a person familiar with the situation said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier on Monday Chief Executive James Dimon said about three-fourths of people decisions have been completed so far, with 40 percent offered jobs..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The remaining roughly 3,500 employees will learn their fates in the next two weeks. These staffers, mostly in technology and operations, and will likely see a lower percentage of job offers, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The merger is expected to be completed June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fate of Bear's bankers and traders have been hanging in the balance since March 16, when the New York bank was forced into a merger with the bigger, stronger JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For weeks, JPMorgan officials denied they knew how many layoffs would result from the merger. There has been widespread speculation that about half of Bear's employees would be laid off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is under pressure to keep costs and combined headcount under control as the financial market slump continues to depress business. With Wall Street banks firing tens of thousands of employees, JPMorgan expects to cut from its own staff to make room for Bear Stearns employees deemed superior, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds company response, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is
lobbying investors to vote against proposals that advocate
separating its top leadership positions and giving shareholders
an advisory vote on executive pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said in a filing with regulators on Monday that
it is sending an e-mail to investors asking them to consider
its previously laid-out arguments against the proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded company in terms
of market capitalization, has come under fire this year to
separate its chairman and chief executive positions. Rex
Tillerson currently holds both jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Members of the Rockefeller family and proxy advisory group
ISS are in favor of the split.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company may also be feeling the heat on executive pay,
as investors holding 41.2 percent of the voted shares supported
a similar proposal last year. Shareholders with about 40
percent of the voted shares also backed splitting the chairman
and chief executive positions in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Exxon Mobil board believes that the decision as to who
should serve as chairman and chief executive officer is the
proper responsibility of the board," Exxon Secretary Henry
Hubble said in the e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Exxon Mobil board also believes that a shareholder
advisory vote on executive compensation is not warranted and
that clearer, more effective channels of communication between
shareholders and the board already exist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both proposals are nonbinding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spokesman Gantt Walton said the company sent the
e-mail to institutional investors to "highlight those proposals
we believe are of particular interest to shareholders and to
encourage thorough review of the Board's proxy responses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are 15 other shareholder proposals up for a vote at
Exxon's annual meeting on May 28, none of which the company
mentioned in its letter. It has recommended shareholders vote
against all the shareholder proposals that will be considered
at this year's meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil Co in 1870, and it
became a precursor to Exxon Mobil. Many descendants of the oil
baron have backed shareholder resolutions seeking governing
changes and increased spending on alternative energy.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 12 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is
lobbying investors to vote against proposals that advocate
separating its top leadership positions and giving shareholders
an advisory vote on executive pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company said in a filing with regulators on Monday that
it is sending an email to investors asking them to consider its
previously laid-out arguments against the proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded company in terms
of market capitalization, has come under fire this year to
separate its chairman and chief executive positions. Rex
Tillerson currently holds both jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Members of the Rockefeller family, who own shares, and
proxy advisory group ISS are in favor of the split.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company may also be feeling the heat on executive pay,
as investors holding 41.2 percent of the voted shares supported
a similar proposal last year. Shareholders with about 40
percent of the voted shares also backed splitting the chairman
and chief executive positions in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Exxon Mobil board believes that the decision as to who
should serve as chairman and chief executive officer is the
proper responsibility of the board," Exxon Secretary Henry
Hubble said in the email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Exxon Mobil board also believes that a shareholder
advisory vote on executive compensation is not warranted and
that clearer, more effective channels of communication between
shareholders and the board already exist."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both proposals are nonbinding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are 15 other shareholder proposals up for a vote at
Exxon's annual meeting on May 28, none of which the company
mentioned in its letter. It has recommended shareholders vote
against all the shareholder proposals that will be considered
at this year's meeting.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds adds transition date, quote, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE May 12 (Reuters) - The Bill  Melinda Gates
Foundation said on Monday that Jeff Raikes, a senior Microsoft
Corp (MSFT.O) executive, will be the next chief executive of
the world's largest charitable organization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raikes, 49, who spent more than 25 years at Microsoft and
built the company's Office software division into a $16 billion
business, will replace outgoing CEO Patty Stonesifer, also a
former Microsoft executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raikes announced his retirement from Microsoft in January.
He will be reunited with his former boss at Microsoft, company
co-founder Bill Gates, who will be shifting to work full-time
at the foundation instead of Microsoft in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The change in leadership will take place on Sept. 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The foundation has an endowment of $37.3 billion built
mostly from Gates' fortune. Warren Buffett, the world's richest
man, has also committed to donating a large chunk of his
fortune to the foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Warren Buffett said to us that in picking the next CEO, it
was very important to pick somebody that maximized both Bill
and me and the organization we had in place," Melinda Gates,
the Foundation's co-chair, said on a conference call with
reporters. "In Jeff, we think we found that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Gates Foundation focuses on development programs to
help the world's poor and hungry; global health initiatives to
prevent and cure diseases common in developing countries; and
projects aimed at improving education in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Stanford University graduate who was raised on a Nebraska
cattle ranch, Raikes was once seen as the No. 3 executive at
Microsoft behind only Gates and Chief Executive Steve Ballmer.
He is also a part owner of the Seattle Mariners baseball team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, Stonesifer said she planned to step down as
CEO while remaining at the foundation in an undefined role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Melinda Gates said the couple looked at more than 150
candidates from all over the world and interviewed numerous
candidates before settling on Raikes, who has a significant
personal fortune of his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As of September, Raikes owned nearly $150 million worth of
Microsoft stock.

automatically delivered to the smartphone. Customers can also choose to
receive their Windows Live Hotmail messages, along with messages from
other e-mail accounts, within a single inbox on their BlackBerry
smartphone

contact photos in emails

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)

 May 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs changed its ratings on
several U.S. property and casualty insurers, and said investors
will continue to avoid costly stocks in the face of weakening
fundamentals and only buy those trading at a discount to the
sector.

 The brokerage, which said valuation drives investment in
the insurance space, downgraded Markel Corp (MKL.N) and
Transatlantic Holdings Inc TRH.N to "sell" from "neutral" as
it saw better opportunities within the reinsurance segment for
higher-return, lower-valuation stocks.

 Goldman also cut HCC Insurance Holdings Inc (HCC.N) to
"neutral" from "buy" on concerns over the company's
professional liability and exposure to the subprime fallout.

 However, the brokerage added Aspen Insurance Holdings Ltd
(AHL.N) to its Americas investment buy list and upgraded the
stock to "buy" from "neutral," and said the market is severely
undervaluing Aspen's outlook for at least the next two years.

 Aspen's valuation is more reflective of a pure-play
property catastrophe writer instead of the solidly diversified,
international reinsurer into which the company has evolved over
the past two years, Goldman added.

 Goldman also raised Marsh  McLennan Cos (MMC.N) to
"neutral" from "sell," and said the company's first-quarter
earnings proved that brokerage margins may be improving and the
slowing economy may not hurt consulting revenues as much as
previously thought.

 The brokerage also changed its price targets on the
following stocks: STOCK                       PRICE TARGET

&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK (Reuters) - A furious rescue worker accused Myanmar's military junta on Monday of crimes against humanity for refusing to give visas to aid officials desperate to enter the country to help the 1.5 million survivors of Cyclone Nargis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"They say they will call, but it's always wait, wait, wait," Pierre Fouillant of the Comite de Secours Internationaux, a French disaster rescue agency, told Reuters after being turned away from the former Burma's embassy in the Thai capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've never seen delays like this, never," said Fouillant, a veteran of 10 humanitarian disasters. "It's a crime against humanity. It should be against the law. It's like they are taking a gun and shooting their own people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like dozens of others, Fouillant applied on Thursday for a business visa, his only option since the military-ruled and isolated southeast Asian nation has no such thing as an "emergency aid worker" visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The embassy was closed on Friday for a Thai holiday, and on Saturday and Sunday. It opened as normal on Monday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least 100,000 people are thought to have died in the May 2 cyclone and storm surge in the Irrawaddy delta, a death toll that could rise dramatically if survivors do not get access to food, clean water and medicine in the next few days, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters witnesses on the edges of the disaster zone say towns and villages are being swamped by huge numbers of cyclone refugees and cannot cope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is virtually no government assistance and food is running out. Some residents say they are afraid the desperate evacuees will be forced to turn to looting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRUSTRATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against this backdrop, small groups of rescue workers are having to wait outside the iron-spiked, grey walls of the embassy compound in Bangkok while their leaders and local visa agents try to see if their applications have got anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is very frustrating," said Australian firefighter Craig Allan, who dropped everything at home to get to Bangkok and apply for a visa on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His agency, part of Baptist World Aid, is called "Rescue 24" as it is meant to be able to put a team on the ground within 24 hours of any disaster anywhere in the world. In this case, it might be 24 days, he joked bleakly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.N. said its top representative in Myanmar had flown to Naypyidaw, the generals' new capital, on Monday to hand over in person a list of 60 "critical" U.N. and relief agency staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite this, U.N. officials said none of its staff in Bangkok had received any visas on Monday. They also said foreign staff inside the country were prevented from leaving Yangon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are limits, if not bans, on staff going to the delta," Terje Skavdal of the U.N.'s humanitarian arm told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patrick Michaudel, a French employee of medical services firm SOS International, with clinics in Yangon, was almost in tears as he left the embassy after a fruitless week-long visa wait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he got to the front of the queue, Michaudel was elated to see his passport open on the desk with a visa inside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He could only watch in horror as a female official then carefully peeled the visa sticker out of his passport and crudely covered up the partial stamp on the passport page with liquid paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"No reason, no reason. She just peeled it out," he said, with a shrug of the shoulders. "I've had enough of this. I'm going home."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Ed Cropley; Editing by Darren Schuettler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Corrects name of aid group in paragraph 17 to International SOS from SOS International) By Ed Cropley BANGKOK, May 12 (Reuters) - A furious rescue worker accused Myanmar's military junta on Monday of crimes against humanity for refusing to fast-track visas for aid officials desperate to enter the country to help the 1.5 million survivors of Cyclone Nargis. They say they will call, but it's always wait, wait, wait, Pierre Fouillant of the Comite de Secours Internationaux, a French disaster rescue agency, told Reuters after being turned awawy from the former Burma's embassy in the Thai capital. I've never seen delays like this, never, said Fouillant, a veteran of 10 humanitarian disasters. It's a crime against humanity. It should be against the law. It's like they are taking a gun and shooting their own people. Like dozens of others, Fouillant applied on Thursday for a business visa, his only option since the military-ruled and isolated southeast Asian nation has no such thing as an emergency aid visa. The embassy was closed on Friday for a Thai government holiday, and was locked shut on Saturday and Sunday. It opened as normal on Monday morning. At least 100,000 people are thought to have died in the May 2 cyclone and storm surge in the Irrawaddy delta, a death toll that could rise dramatically if survivors do not get access to food, clean water and medicine in the next few days, experts say. Reuters witnesses on the edges of the disaster zone say towns and villages are being swamped by huge numbers of cyclone refugees and cannot cope. There is virtually no government assistance and food is running out. Some residents say they are afraid the desperate evacuees will be forced to turn to looting. FRUSTRATION Against this backdrop, small groups of rescue workers are having to wait outside the iron-spiked, grey walls of the embassy compound in Bangkok while their leaders and local visa agents try to see if their applications have got anywhere. It is very frustrating, said Australian firefighter Craig Allan, who dropped everything at home to get to Bangkok and apply for a visa on Thursday. His agency, part of Baptist World Aid, is called Rescue 24 as it is meant to be able to put a team on the ground within 24 hours of any disaster anywhere in the world. In this case, it might be 24 days, he joked bleakly. The U.N. says it has been promised three World Food Programme visas to be issued on Monday evening, and a handful of aid workers are getting visas at Myanmar embassies elsewhere around the world. Some ordinary people are applying for tourist visas simply because they want to check on friends living in a country that still has an ability to cast a spell over visitors despite -- some might say because of -- its military government. I went there once as a tourist and fell in love with the place, said one American student who had flown in from Los Angeles. He said he had many Burmese friends from a year teaching English and learning Burmese in the former capital, Yangon. I just want to check my friends are OK and see what I can do, the student said. He did not want to give his name in case it jeopardised his application. They said come back in four days. I'll just keep my fingers crossed, he said. Before the cyclone struck, it took just 24 hours to process a tourist visa. Patrick Michaudel, a French employee of medical services company International SOS, with clinics in Yangon, was almost in tears as he left the embassy at the end of a fruitless week-long wait for a visa. When he got to the front of the queue, Michaudel was elated to see his passport open on the desk with a visa inside. He could only watch in horror as a female official then carefully peeled the visa sticker out of his passport and crudely covered up the partial stamp on the passport page with liquid paper. No reason, no reason. She just peeled it out, he said, with a shrug of the shoulders. I've had enough of this. I'm going home. ---------------------------------------------------------- For more stories on Myanmar cyclone click on [nSP152717] ----------------------------------------------------------  (Writing by Ed Cropley; Editing by Darren Schuettler)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) plans to buy technology outsourcing company Electronic Data Systems Corp EDS.N to better compete against IBM (IBM.N), but Wall Street questioned whether the $12.6 billion deal for a slow-growing company was overpriced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HP shares fell 5.28 percent after the deal was announced on Tuesday, on top of a 5 percent drop on Monday in anticipation of the news. The declines have wiped about $12 billion off HP's market value, taking it to $109 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owning EDS, one of the pioneers of the outsourcing of managed computer services, would vault HP to second place in the global technology services industry, behind International Business Machines Corp. Analysts said the merged company would be better-equipped to go after large clients and cap costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither EDS nor HP, however, are strong in the high-end consulting business that is a strong suit of IBM, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, said EDS gets half of its revenue from government and financial services customers, which are not high-growth clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What investors are worried about now is what happens over the next six months," he said. "I think there are still some concerns around extracting value out of the deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition would be HP's biggest since its $19 billion purchase of Compaq in 2002 and the most ambitious under Chief Executive Mark Hurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It values EDS at $25 per share, a 33 percent premium to its closing price on Friday. Including debt, the deal's enterprise value was $13.9 billion, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP said it would pay for the deal with a mixture of cash and debt, without giving the breakdown. HP ended its last fiscal quarter with nearly $10 billion in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say the deal, in my view, is a little pricey, but we'd have to look at the details," said Jeff Embersits, chief investment officer of Shareholder Value Management, which owns HP shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the key was how EDS would be integrated to make it a more profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mark's working with a five-year plan. So this will probably look a lot smarter in two or three years, but it could be a tough year," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP expects the deal to close in the second half of 2008 and boost its adjusted fiscal 2009 earnings and fiscal 2010 net earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also reported better-than-expected preliminary quarterly results on Tuesday and raised its fiscal 2008 outlook, which it said did not include any potential impact from the EDS deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would be aggressive buyers of (HP) shares on today's pullback," Citi analyst Richard Gardner wrote in a report, calling the share fall "a clear overreaction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The EDS acquisition was unexpected, but strategically and financially compelling, in our view," he said, adding there was minimal overlap between HP and EDS's service offerings and customers. "The deal should create cross-selling opportunities and boost confidence in EDS as a service provider."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LUCRATIVE SERVICES BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP has long considered an acquisition to beef up its tech services business, a sector that offers relatively stable income and high margins, even in an economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology services include specialization in consulting on how to build systems, providing computer and software resources for companies, which is broadly called outsourcing, and managing and maintaining technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide computer services revenue rose 10.5 percent to $748 billion in 2007, according to market research firm Gartner Inc. IBM led with a 7.2 percent market share, EDS was second with 3.0 percent, while HP was fifth with 2.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The acquisition is estimated to more than double HP's services business and creates a leading force in the global IT services industry," Hurd told analysts on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined company will have annual services revenue of more than $38 billion and 210,000 employees, HP said. That compared to IBM's $54.1 billion in services revenue last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said the deal would likely spark a round of consolidation as suddenly much-smaller rivals such as Infosys Technologies Ltd (INFY.BO), Tata Consultancy Services Ltd (TCS.BO), Wipro Ltd (WIPR.BO) (WIT.N) and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp (CTSH.O) scramble to stay competitive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDS also competes against U.S. companies such as Accenture Ltd (ACN.N), Computer Sciences Corp (CSC.N) and Affiliated Computer Services Inc (ACS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to start seeing more, I believe, of these strategic deals where it's not private equity coming, but it's big companies -- such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) trying to go after Yahoo (YHOO.O) -- who have cash on their books and see beaten- down stock prices," said Matt McCall, president of Penn Financial Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HP plans to form a new business group called EDS that will be headquartered at EDS's existing office in Plano, Texas, and led by EDS CEO Ronald Rittenmeyer, who will report to Hurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EDS shares ended up 1.08 percent at $24.34 after gaining nearly 28 percent on Monday in anticipation of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Tiffany Wu; Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando and Ellis Mnyandu; Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

playing field for all cable operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2006, Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX), the world's top
producer of Spanish-language content, invested $258 million in
notes of a company that holds 49 percent of Cablemas. With the
approval, the notes can now be converted into equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This means Televisa is increasing its reach in the video
market but this is no longer the only market (that matters),"
Eduardo Perez Motta, head of the CFC, said in a radio
interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The market is also telephony and Internet. This means that
we have a bigger player (Televisa) to compete with the
fixed-line phone operators and with broad band providers," he
added, referring to leader Telefonos de Mexico (Telmex), and
other rivals like Axtel and Alestra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Telmex TMX.N TELMEXL.MX is the biggest provider of
fixed-line phone services in Mexico and is owned by Carlos
Slim, one of the richest men in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Cablemas deal will help Televisa expand its services in
the so-called triple play market, where companies use broadband
links to carry television, phone and Internet simultaneously
and at cheaper prices than if purchased separately.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The undisputed leader in the broadcast television in
Mexico, Televisa has expanded outside its core market in recent
years, looking to boost revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's cable unit, Cablevision, has presented some of
the company's strongest sales increases in recent quarters but
it only operates in the Mexico City area, where it just
recently started offering phone services to its 551,000
subscribers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With nearly 800,000 clients, Cablemas is the biggest cable
operator in the northern and central states, covering more than
40 cities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa also owns TVI, another cable company based in the
northern city of Monterrey, one of the richest urban areas in
Mexico with much higher than average Mexican purchasing power.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) could cut
as many as 4,000 of its own employees worldwide as the bank
prepares to take on staff from Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N at the
same time it deals with turmoil in financial markets, people
familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In addition to roughly 2,000 JPMorgan employees who will be
replaced by counterparts acquired through its takeover of Bear
Stearns, the sources said that an additional 1,000 to 2,000
JPMorgan employees may lose their jobs because of the slowdown
in investment banking activity and credit market crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Final decisions dealing with specific employees have not
been made, though JPMorgan is expected to decide on
market-related cuts by early June, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, which expects to complete its takeover of Bear
Stearns around June 1, told investors on Monday the bank had
made decisions on about 10,000 of Bear's nearly 14,000
employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told investors the bank
had extended job offers to about 6,000 Bear staffers, leaving
decisions still to be made on the remaining 3,500 Bear
staffers. Most of these employees work in technology and
operations, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources also said that of 6,000 Bear staffers offered
jobs, a little more than half are regarded as "lift and drops,"
meaning employees who can be lifted from businesses where
JPMorgan is not strong, such as prime brokerage, clearing,
energy trading and some investment banking coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among 2,500 to 2,700 Bear staffers who have been offered
jobs, some will fill operations, finance and other roles
required in a larger company. But an unspecified number of
these staffers overlap with existing JPMorgan staffers, and
JPMorgan is expected to cut roughly 2,000 of its own employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a net basis, the Bear merger would boost JPMorgan's
total headcount by 4,000 to about 184,000 worldwide, the
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan came under fire in March after it acquired a
nearly-insolvent Bear with involvement of the Federal Reserve
and at a fire-sale price. Since then, Morgan executives have
worked carefully around personnel decisions, worried that
wholesale job cuts would generate more bad publicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Gary Hill, Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said it plans to seek more than $800 million in compensation from Alaska if the state follows through with its plan to void the company's leases at the Point Thomson gas and oil field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon raised the specter of a financial claim at the same time the company and its Point Thomson partners -- BP (BP.L), Chevron (CVX.N) and ConocoPhillips (COP.N) -- formally asked state Natural Resources Commissioner Tom Irwin to reconsider his rejection of the latest Point Thomson development plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The documents were filed Monday, the deadline for the reconsideration request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon said in a letter with the state Department of Natural Resources (DNR) that its group would be entitled to compensation for investments made in the field and damages from further delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These damages total well in excess of $800 million, and may be expected to increase in the future," the company said in the seven-page document outlining its prospective financial claims against the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Point Thomson partners would also be entitled to any proceeds received by the state if it puts the voided leases back up for sale, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon spokeswoman Margaret Ross said the company was not seeking to collect any damages at this time. She said the claim for damages was only procedural, and was made to preserve its rights to seek payment in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irwin's April 22 decision to reject the 23rd Point Thomson development plan was the latest official action taken by the state to revoke leases at the field where state leaders say oil company inaction justifies repossession of that state property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit, created in 1977 and containing leases that date back to the 1960s, holds 8 trillion to 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and hundreds of millions of barrels of condensates and oil, according to state officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No well has been drilled at Point Thomson since 1982. State officials consider Exxon, the operator of the unit, and the other Point Thomson partners to be in gross violation of lease obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the natural gas cannot be commercialized without a highly expensive and yet-to-be-built gas pipeline, state officials have long maintained that Point Thomson's liquids can be produced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State efforts to revoke the leases started in 2005, when the partners reneged on a 2001 pledge to drill development wells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In their 23rd development plan, the Point Thomson partners pledge a $1.3 billion investment to start production of 10,000 barrels a day by 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rejection of that plan will further delay development and will ultimately delay development of a long-desired natural gas pipeline, the partners said in their request for reconsideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead of accepting a careful and technically sound plan of development that commits to put the unit into production by 2014 ... termination of the unit will produce years of delay, and will virtually ensure that no one will be in a position to rely on Point Thomson gas in making shipping commitments in any open season on any schedule now proposed," the companies' reconsideration request said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The decision could thus delay for years any gas pipeline from the North Slope, as well as postponing production of liquids at Point Thomson itself," the document said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michael Erman in New York, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) $8 billion annual 
dividend now exceeds its earnings, a mismatch that may worsen 
once its Lipitor cholesterol pill goes generic by 2011, raising 
doubts about how long the industry-topping payout can survive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The Lipitor clock is ticking and getting louder in my 
ears, and I've begun thinking the dividend is probably not 
sustainable," said Eldene Doyle, an analyst for Optique Capital 
Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has held onto many investors with assurances it can 
sustain the dividend -- carrying a princely 6.4 percent yield 
-- even after the U.S. patent on $13 billion-a-year Lipitor 
lapses and sales of the world's top-selling drug crumble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Profit growth has already faltered and its stock has lost 
half its value since early 2004 due to generic competition for 
many of its other big medicines and a failure to produce enough 
new drugs to replace them, or at least buy a company that can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've been hoping they'd buy a drug pipeline and that 
hasn't happened," Doyle said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drugmaker has said it can continue the dividend with 
financial resources that include $33 billion in cash, $17 
billion in annual cash flow from operations, overseas profits 
that can be repatriated, and its ability to borrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although Pfizer has cut 20 percent of its sales force and 
forged several deals with small drugmakers in the past few 
years, Doyle said investors are growing impatient for 
"game-changing actions" from Chief Executive Jeffrey Kindler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer has $48 billion in revenue now, that will likely 
drop to $40 billion within a year after Lipitor goes generic," 
Moody's analyst Michael Levesque said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At that point, the dividend would represent 20 percent of 
company revenue -- two to three times the share that some rival 
U.S. drugmakers dedicate to their dividend, Levesque said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It means Pfizer would have to make pretty significant new 
cost cuts if they want to continue paying the dividend from 
their earnings and cash flow," Levesque said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The cash on hand is enough to fund four years of the 
dividend and keep shareholders appeased," said Levesque. But 
Pfizer's attractiveness and credit rating could suffer if it 
needs to borrow money to shore up the dividend, he added.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WAIT AND WATCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Viren Mehta, a principal of Mehta Partners, said he was 
willing to "wait and watch" how successfully Pfizer prepares 
for Lipitor's looming patent expiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There still is time for the company to reduce costs and 
find additional sources of revenue," Mehta said, adding that 
the longevity of the dividend could become a guessing game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mehta said Kindler realistically has two more years to 
strengthen Pfizer ahead of the Lipitor sales cliff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Kindler's honeymoon period is over now," Mehta said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler failed to whip up much enthusiasm at a company 
meeting with analysts and money managers in March, when he laid 
out his strategy of preparing for the Lipitor crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He was discussing small acquisitions and that Pfizer has 
huge cost-cutting in place," Optique's Doyle recalled. "That's 
all probably just not enough, and I think people were a little 
disappointed in him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chris Armbruster, an analyst with Al Frank Asset 
Management, said Pfizer is an attractive value stock -- in part 
because of its beaten-down price -- for patient investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have enough financial flexibility to go out and 
acquire a couple of mid-size companies that can fill up their 
drug portfolio so they can better withstand the Lipitor patent 
expiration," he said, mentioning U.S. rival Biogen Idec Inc 
(BIIB.O) and Britain's Shire Plc (SHP.L) as possibilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Frank D'Amelio, Pfizer's chief financial officer, said 
on Tuesday the company does not feel obliged to buy mid-sized 
drugmakers, in the $10 billion to $15 billion price range, 
ahead of Lipitor's decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't think we have to do them," D'Amelio said in an 
interview. "If they make good sense, we'll consider and 
possibly do them, but not 'have to' or 'need to."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer in recent years has focused instead on far smaller 
transactions, typically licensing deals for experimental drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Armbruster predicted the company can fund the dividend in 
coming years from cash flow, helped by continued sales growth 
of a few newer drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But if they end up borrowing to pay the dividend, that 
would be a red flag for us," he said. "It would change our 
investment opinion on Pfizer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  (Changes attribution, adds background and details from
report)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 13 (Reuters) - Proxy advisory firm Glass
Lewis has recommended Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) shareholders
vote in favor of separating the company's chairman and chief
executive positions, adding to a growing chorus of voices
calling for the split.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glass Lewis said in a report issued on Monday that an
independent chairman would be "better able to oversee the
executives of the company and set a pro-shareholder agenda
without the management conflicts that a CEO or other executive
insiders often face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rex Tillerson currently holds both jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposal to split the positions has drawn media
attention as many members of the Rockefeller family have
publicly supported the move. John D. Rockefeller founded
Standard Oil Co in 1870, and it became a precursor to Exxon
Mobil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top proxy advisory firm ISS, a unit of RiskMetrics Group,
has also recommended shareholders vote in favor of separating
 the positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has said that the board believes that the most
effective leadership structure for the company right now is for
Tillerson to serve as both chairman and CEO. It said it
believes the decision as to who should serve as chairman and
chief executive officer is the proper responsibility of the
board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company sent an e-mail to institutional investors on
Monday lobbying them to vote against the proposal, as well as
one that would give shareholders an advisory vote on executive
pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both proposals are nonbinding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company may be feeling the heat on executive pay, as
investors holding 41.2 percent of the voted shares supported a
similar proposal last year. Shareholders with about 40 percent
of the voted shares backed splitting the chairman and chief
executive positions in 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 13 (Reuters) - The chief financial officer of
Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on Tuesday said the company does not feel
obliged to buy mid-size drugmakers, in the $10 billion to $15
billion price range, before its Lipitor cholesterol drug loses
U.S. patent protection by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We don't think we have to do them," Frank D'Amelio said in
an interview when asked about assertions by some industry
analysts that Pfizer needs to make deals of that size in order
to obtain new medicines to offset expected lower sales of
Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If they make good sense, we'll consider and possibly do
them, but not 'have to' or 'need to,'" D'Amelio said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer in recent years has focused on far smaller
transactions, typically licensing deals for individual products
made by biotechnology companies that are not yet approved for
sale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many industry analysts have urged Pfizer to instead go
after bigger prey, including companies like Biogen Idec
(BIIB.O) that already have big-selling products on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Last year we did a series of smaller deals; this year
we've done some smaller deals," D'Amelio said, noting that

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Driven by growing commercial need in areas such as financial services,
digital media creation and medical imaging, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today expanded
its High Performance Computing (HPC) capabilities for businesses with the
introduction of the IBM(R) BladeCenter(R) QS22 -- a new, economical
supercomputing technology inspired by advanced scientific research facilities.

    The heart of the QS22 is a new processor compliant with the Cell Broadband
Engine(TM) (Cell/B.E.) Architecture, originally developed by IBM, Sony and
Toshiba to provide the computing power for cutting-edge gaming applications. And
for the most challenging arithmetic operations, this new processor, the IBM
PowerXCell(TM) 8i, offers five-times the speed of the original Cell/B.E.
processor.

    Coupled with additions like 16-times more memory (up to 32GB) than its
predecessors, the QS22 can handle workloads that previously required
dozensof servers. As an example, for a physician, that could mean finding and
diagnosing a tumor in seconds instead of hours.

    IBM has built a strong ecosystem around the new QS22 to address critical
real-time
analytic and imaging projects, with over 20 IBM business partners to enable key
solutions for the Cell/B.E. technology and 35 universities to provide
in-depth curriculum and resources. In total, these investments create an
environment
where HPC innovations can easily be introduced into the market, and a wider
spectrum of businesses can take advantage of its unique capabilities and
potential. Already, more than 50 customers worldwide are moving significant
workloads to the QS22.  For example:


--  Threshold Animation Studios, with the help of IBM, plans on changing
    the way animated movies and visual effects are made... forever. Today,
    creating visual effects and animation is a long and labor-intensive process
    where key creative decisions are often being made without a complete
    visualization of the final result. This in turn leads to multiple versions
    of a shot until a suitable result is achieved. Using the QS22 technology,
    Threshold's goal is to create a real-time visualization system that will
    show producers and directors a close approximation of the final product at
    nearly any stage of the production -- enabling efficiencies in the
    production pipeline that were once thought impossible.

--  Platform Computing's 'Symphony' offers a reliable and scalable HPC
    infrastructure for performing lightning-fast, pre- and post-trade
    analytics. Coupled with the new QS22, traders can run portfolio simulations
    much faster -- reducing time-to-results by up to 80 percent. In addition,
    this tightly integrated solution facilitates rapid and easy deployment of
    sophisticated analytical applications to mission-critical trading
    environments.

--  The ultra-high-speed communications capabilities of the new QS22 means
    Simudyne can create and run vastly improved visual, immersive, real-time
    simulations. These simulations offer significant potential benefits to
    companies in petroleum exploration and many other industries. Simudyne's
    simulation platform is specifically designed to assist in hydrocarbon
    exploration by growing algorithms that help speed up seismic surveys,
    optimize complex logistics networks and create software that improves
    according to the same principles that drive adaptation in natural systems.
    

    
The New Enterprise Data Center

    According to technology analyst firm Gartner, more than 70 percent of Global
1000 companies will need to dramatically change their data centers in the next
five years -- as they are running out of power and space, while managing
skyrocketing energy and cooling costs.  In response, IBM is helping clients
develop a new enterprise data center, which offers dramatic improvements in IT
efficiency and provides for rapid deployment of new IT services to support
future business growth. IBM is helping clients move to new enterprise data
centers by focusing on best practice around virtualization, highly efficient IT,
service management and cloud computing.

    The QS22 was designed from the ground-up as a key element of this new
enterprise data center initiative. For development, the QS22 boasts an
openenvironment, utilizing the flexibility of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as the
primary operating system and the open development environment of Eclipse. For
energy efficiency, it increases the performance-per-watt and better manages
power draw from the overall server chassis from previous generations, thanks to
some key built-in features:


--  The IBM Power Configurator helps systems managers understand the
    overall power requirements for operation.
--  The IBM Systems Director Active Energy Manager helps monitor, control
    and virtualize the system's power.
--  The IBM Rear Door Heat eXchanger reduces data center hot spots.
--  The IBM Data Center Energy Efficiency services optimize and future-
    proof a data center for maximum performance.
    

    
In addition, IBM has made available thousands of pages of technical
documentation on the Cell/B.E. Architecture to the public, including a
free, full-system simulator. IBM has released an upgrade to its Software
Development Kit (SDK) for Multicore Acceleration v3, providing
enhancementsand templates to enable clients to utilize the new features of QS22.

    The new QS22 complements all other IBM BladeCenter offerings, such as
thosebased on Intel(R) Xeon(R), AMD Opteron(TM) and IBM Power(TM) processors.
IBM
BladeCenter is the broadest portfolio of blade offerings in the industry,
designed to address a range of client environments like those for small and
medium business, telecommunications and -- with the QS22 in particular --
high performance computing. By utilizing the PowerXCell 8i processor, the
QS22 also allows IT managers to evaluate how much of an application would
need the supercomputing power of the Cell/B.E. Architecture and how much could
remain on a traditional system, providing the full range of options in the midst
of
other system priorities.

    "The QS22 is a technological leap over the physical limitations of
traditional processors that often dampen the ability of organizations to
reach their goals," said Jim Comfort, vice president, IBM Systems &amp;
Technology Group. "IBM has delivered on the promise of integrating HPC
intothe business world in a way that allows developers, clients and IT
departments to ramp up quickly and get results without delay."

    All in the HPC Family

    The QS22 is part of a robust family of HPC products at IBM, all designed
todeliver a holistic approach to computing that involves designing and
delivering the fastest, highly efficient, easily accessible technical solutions
to
clients. From the Cell Broadband Engine Architecture-based BladeCenter QS22 to
the Blue Gene
supercomputer, to products like IBM's Power Systems, industry standard clusters
and high-performance System Storage, the HPC family at IBM is the result of a
rich history of discovery and award-winning innovation.

    The QS22 will be available in early June, while the SDK for Multicore
Acceleration
v3 is available now.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Former National Football League running back Troy Hambrick was sentenced on Tuesday to five years in prison for trafficking crack cocaine in Florida.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hambrick, who played for the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals during a five-year professional career, was arrested for allegedly selling nearly 200 grams of crack for $5,600 to an undercover informant in three separate deals last September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deals took place near Hambrick's home in Lacoochee, Florida, where he made his name as a high school football star, and from his Lincoln Navigator at a gas station in nearby Dade City, northeast of Tampa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He entered a guilty plea on February 26 to one count of distributing cocaine. In return, prosecutors dropped two other counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hambrick, 31, played college football at the University of South Carolina and Savannah State University. He played four seasons with the Cowboys and one with the Cardinals in a career that ended following the 2004 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hambrick rushed for 2,179 yards and nine touchdowns during those five seasons, averaging 4.1 yards per carry. His best season was 2003, when he carried 275 times for 932 yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His brother, Darren Hambrick, also played in the NFL, with&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dallas, Cleveland and Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Loney, editing by Philip Barbara)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analysts' comments and updates share price movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 13 (Reuters) - McGraw-Hill Cos Inc MHP.N was added to
Goldman Sachs' conviction buy list and initiated with "buy" at
Jefferies  Co, with analysts at both brokerages citing strong
long-term fundamentals and valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We like McGraw-Hill's attractive collection of franchise
assets and find the long-term growth story compelling, despite
the near-term operating headwinds facing the company's Standard
 Poor's unit," said Goldman analyst Peter Appert, who raised
his price target on the stock to $51 from $48.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company, which also sells textbooks,
magazines, trade publications and financial data, were up more
than 6 percent to $44.10 in morning trade on the New York Stock
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the downturn in credit markets has already been
fully priced into shares, and expect McGraw-Hill shares to gain
momentum throughout 2008 in anticipation of liquidity returning
to credit markets," analyst Brian Shipman at Jefferies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGraw-Hill shares have fallen almost 40 percent since
peaking in June last year mainly on concerns about the outlook
for its ratings business. Ratings agencies have come under fire
from politicians, regulators and investors for being
excessively optimistic in assessing bonds' credit quality.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In terms of regulatory risk, the negative sentiment over
the subprime fallout has put more pressure on legislators than
in the past to correct the seeming impropriety between ratings
agencies and institutions that issue debt," Shipman noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, any regulatory change is likely to be compliance
related and have minimal financial impact on the firm, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shipman set a $49 target on the stock and said he expects
the company's education segment revenue to grow 6 percent in
2008 benefiting from strong textbook adoption this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the company said quarterly earnings fell 44
percent as business dropped at its Standard  Poor's ratings
agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's results beat average Wall Street estimates,
but McGraw-Hill forecast a decline in full-year earnings that
was worse than analysts had expected.

&lt;p&gt;Extractive Industries Transparency Initiatives Launches
                         Implementation Guide
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil today congratulated the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative on the launch of its Business Implementation
Guide, an important step in the progress of transparency and good
governance in natural resource development.

   "Revenue transparency and accountability in our industry's
relationships with host governments are critically important," said
Rich Kruger, president of ExxonMobil Production Company. "ExxonMobil
supports transparency and is committed to honest and ethical
behavior."

   Kruger commented at an industry event to launch the guide,
attended by Dr. Peter Eigen, founder of Transparency International and
chairman of the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a
global coalition for transparency in the extractive industries.

   Business and non-governmental organizations and a coalition of
companies, including ExxonMobil, developed the guide under the
leadership of the EITI Secretariat.

   Dr. Eigen invited Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive
of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), to co-author the guide's
forward in recognition of the significant contributions by ExxonMobil
to EITI since it was announced by former British Prime Minister Tony
Blair in September 2002.

   Kruger said the guide will assist international companies in
conveying expectations and appropriate roles to affiliates around the
world relating to the reporting of payments to governments for a
country's natural resources.

   "The primary purpose of EITI is to provide more information on
government revenues to help ensure they're used to benefit citizens of
the country," said Kruger. "But just as important is the culture of
accountability that is created when governments, companies,
non-governmental organizations, international financial institutions
and investor groups work together to improve disclosure and
transparency."

   According to EITI, 3.5 billion people live in countries rich in
oil, gas and minerals, which, if developed with good governance, can
generate revenues to foster growth and reduce poverty.

   ExxonMobil helped advise the UK's Department for International
Development regarding EITI implementation and was elected to the EITI
board in 2006 by the 15 international oil companies providing
financial support to EITI.

   ExxonMobil supports the Group of Eight (G-8) Transparency
Initiative and the United Nations Convention Against Corruption and
has played a leadership role in enhancing revenue transparency in
countries in which the company has significant investments, including
Chad, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Nigeria and Equatorial Guinea.

&lt;p&gt;  HYDERABAD, NEW DELHI and BANGALORE, INDIA, May 13
(MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) and the Indian School of Business (ISB) today announced the
signing of the first Open Collaborative Research agreement in Asia aimed at
improving the competitiveness of the services sector in the region. This
research aims to help companies who want to redesign their project
management structure, reduce attrition, and move high performance groups up the
value chain.

    The research will be led by the Centre for Global Logistics and
Manufacturing
Strategies (GLAMS) at the ISB and IBM's India Research Laboratory.  ISB is the
first Business School in Asia to work with IBM on this collaborative
research.

    The joint research will study mathematical modeling techniques and social
networks to enable organizations to improve the way people work. The team will
use tools such as innovative modeling and forecasting techniques, data mining,
social network analysis and stochastic optimization.

    Speaking on the necessity of research for the service sector, M Ram Mohan
Rao,
Dean, ISB, said, "The services sector contributes to over 50 percent of the GDP
of the Indian economy and is closely integrated with the agriculture and
manufacturing sector. Through our collaborative research with IBM, I hope we
will
be able to make substantial contributions towards making the Indian economic
growth more inclusive."

    Under IBM's Open Collaborative Research program, faculty and students can
freely conduct joint research without concern over Intellectual Property
management issues. The new OCR program will not only help advance the
stateof the art in services software but also serve as a great illustration of
the benefits of collaborative innovation within the open source community.

    "At IBM, we define innovation as the intersection of invention and
insight.Today, innovation is a dual-value proposition: a balanced foundation of
open
and proprietary collaborations. Innovation is needed to address the world's
greatest challenges and opportunities; and the responsibility must be shared
among industry, government and academia. The coming together of IBM and ISB
in an important step in this direction," said Dr. Guruduth Banavar, Director,
IBM
India Research Laboratory.

    An important benefit of this research is that its results will be openly
available for use by any and all universities, companies, and
institutions.The research collaboration is free from the constraints of the
usual
corporate-sponsored research at universities that typically involves lengthy
negotiations over intellectual property rights.

    Speaking on the diverse applicability of this research, Professor N
Viswanadham, Executive Director -- GLAMS, ISB, said, "IBM and ISB research teams
will develop new ways to improve the delivery of service, not just taking into
account how the service gets delivered to a client, but how that delivery can
be improved through better collaboration and communication of all the people
involved in the transaction.  The applications of this research will be
widespread; from medium or large IT company to a multi-billion B2B global
trader, all can benefit from this study."

    The Services Sector is the largest part of the economy of developed
countries and
the fastest growing sectors in developing countries. Services research is
multi-disciplinary and many variations exist today within the domains of
management, operations research, and economics to name a few. While most of
the existing work has focused on business-to-consumer services, the focus of
this research is
on business-to-business services.

&lt;p&gt;Interactive Intelligence Adds Contact Center and IP Telephony Capabilities to Microsoft Office Communications Server Environments

INDIANAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
Interactive Intelligence Inc. (Nasdaq: ININ) is releasing an
integrated solution that combines its all-in-one IP communications
software platform with Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007.
The integration is designed to help organizations communicate more
effectively by adding contact center and IP telephony functionality to
OCS environments.

   The Interactive Intelligence all-in-one IP communications software
platform adds features such as multi-channel skills-based routing,
call and screen recording, an operator console interface, workforce
management, and cradle-to-grave reporting. The integration also offers
the ability to exchange instant messages (IM) between the two systems
using OCS's secure IM engine through a common enterprise-wide user
directory.

   "We've gone beyond the basic integration of simply connecting
audio calls between systems," said Interactive Intelligence founder
and CEO, Dr. Donald E. Brown. "Combined with OCS, our solution
provides a broad set of contact center and IP telephony applications,
a common company directory, and simplified administration for user
provisioning.

   "The beauty of this combined solution is that all users can share
information and communicate with one another in real-time even though
they are running desktop software from two different vendors. For
instance, an engineer in California running an Office Communicator
Client using a PC as a soft phone can call or 'IM' a product manager
in New York running our Interaction Client(R). In addition, because
our integration to OCS uses a direct SIP connection, customers don't
have to purchase pricey gateways."

   "Interactive Intelligence has taken OCS integration a step forward
by enabling customers to more easily take advantage of both the
collaboration capabilities in OCS, and the contact center and IP
telephony functionality in CIC - all while giving users the choice of
which client to run at the desktop," said Yankee Group enterprise
research group analyst, Vanessa Alvarez. "From an industry
perspective, this move pushes unified communications forward, which
Yankee believes is critical for achieving the Anywhere Enterprise(TM)
where employees, customers, assets and partners can easily connect to
applications, information and services whenever and wherever they need
them."

   Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 manages real-time
communications, including instant messaging, voice over IP, audio and
video conferencing. It works with existing telecommunications systems
so businesses can deploy advanced VoIP and conferencing without
tearing out their legacy phone networks. Microsoft OCS also powers
presence, a key benefit of Microsoft unified communications that
unites all the contact information stored in Active Directory with the
ways people communicate.

   In 1997 Interactive Intelligence launched its first product based
on the company's all-in-one IP communications software platform called
Interaction Center Platform(R). This platform was designed to deliver
comprehensive applications minus the cost and complexity introduced by
multi-point products. Today it serves as the basis for all the
Interactive Intelligence products, including Customer Interaction
Center(R) (CIC) for contact center automation and Vonexus Enterprise
Interaction Center(TM) (Vonexus EIC) for enterprise IP telephony.

   The Interactive Intelligence integration to OCS is planned for
general availability in Q3 2008. It will be offered through the
Interactive Intelligence channel of approximately 300 value-added
resellers worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS May 13 (Reuters) -  A British government agency
has told the European Commission that Microsoft (MSFT.O) Office
works poorly with rival software used in British schools,
hurting the interests of learners, teachers and parents.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Software programmes must meet the same standards to work
together but the British agency said Microsoft offers only its
own "open standard" rather than effective support for Open
Document Format (ODF), which the agency said increases choice
for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stephen Lucey, executive director of the British Educational
Communications and Technology Agency (BECTA), said the damage
goes beyond hurting competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Such barriers can also damage the interests of education
and training organisations, learners, teachers and parents",
Lucey said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BECTA complained last year to Britain's Office of Fair
Trading and sent a copy to the European Commission this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These are issues we are already looking at in the context
of the interoperability investigation we opened in January
2008," said Jonathan Todd, a spokesman for the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said in a statement it was "deeply committed" to
making its own programmes work smoothly with others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have funded the development of tools to promote
interoperability between Office 2007 and products based on the
(Open Document Format) file format," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lucey disagreed. He said Microsoft compounded problems for
non-technical users, making it hard to use ODF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's ODF converters have "limited functionality ...
and are poorly integrated into the overall Microsoft user
interface, as compared with, for example, the integration and
functionality Microsoft offers for its own OOXML format."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ODF is a non-propriefty open file format whose full
specifications are available to all. It was originally developed
by Sun Microsystems Inc. JAVA.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Commission is examining whether Microsoft
exerted improper influence over the International Standards
Organisation to expand the number of standards from one to two,
to include both ODF and Microsoft's own competing OOXML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics say it makes no more sense to have two standards for
open software than it does to have two standards for railroad
gauges or for next-generation disc recordings, in which HD DVD
recently bowed to the Blue Ray standard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ECIS, a trade group which had filed the original, broad
complaint on interoperability against Microsoft, said the
company was trying to undermine the Open Document Format by
imposing its own standard, "with its serious interoperability
difficulties."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lucey said that the problem with Microsoft goes beyond
standards setting. BECTA has also complained to Britain's Office
of Fair Trading about the conditions under which Microsoft
licenses its software to schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week Microsoft appealed against an 899 million euro
fine imposed by the European Commission for failing to comply
with requirements, originally imposed in 2004, that it permit
interoperability with server software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Steven Scheer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM May 13 (Reuters) - The SP 500 index .SPX is
expected to track a near-term range of 1,300 to 1,400 before
improving to 1,500 by the end of the year, Goldman Sachs senior
global strategist Abby Joseph Cohen said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Share price gains in recent weeks appear sustainable since
U.S. economic data look set to improve in the second half of the
year, she told a news conference in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What's priced in the stock market is a mild recession with
some pressure on corporate profits," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 closed at 1,403.58 on Monday, versus its 52-week
high and low of 1,257 and 1,576, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joseph Cohen believes the market fell too far. Investors are
now realising the U.S. economy has hit bottom and that profits
will look better this year than last year when many firms had
large write-offs, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am not surprised in the increase in share prices," she
said. "The economy is showing signs of stability. We believe
that the weakest part of the economy is right now ... In the
second half of this year economic data will look a little
better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Areas like exports, growing at an annual rate of 8 percent,
and capital goods spending by companies are increasing, said
Joseph Cohen, who was recently succeeded by David Kostin as
Goldman's U.S. investment strategist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kostin's year-end target for the SP 500 is 1,328.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I believe that many export-related companies will show very
good profits," Joseph Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She believes that income tax rebates and a series of Federal
Reserve rate reductions will give a boost to the economy later
in 2008 and into 2009. "The second half of the year things will
be better but not robust," Joseph-Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that is enough for the market to stabilise and reduce
volatility, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One area of concern is very high oil prices, currently above
$120 a barrel, although Goldman uses a level of $100 as its base
estimate for market strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joseph Cohen said that despite surging energy costs, the
impact on the U.S. economy was constrained by the fact just 10
percent of business costs were related to commodities prices.
Labour costs, equal to two-thirds of business costs, were rising
at slightly above growth in productivity, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the sectors Joseph Cohen likes are those related to
information technology, since the United States is a leader, and
companies dealing with alternative energy, "greentech" and
health science technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the weak dollar is a problem and is priced "too low
against the euro and other senior currencies", it was having a
limited impact on the U.S. economy since U.S. exports, for the
most part, compete with countries that produce low-cost goods,
Joseph Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Most products for export are value added," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Rory Channing)

&lt;p&gt;Thunderhead and IBM Leverage ACORD Standards to Improve Agent and Customer Communications for Insurance Carriers

LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Thunderhead, a provider of enterprise communications solutions,
today announced a new collaborative insurance-correspondence
initiative that integrates Thunderhead NOW with IBM middleware and
supports ACORD insurance industry XML standards, simplifying
transactions while adding additional compliance and management
capabilities.

   The world's largest insurance member organization, ACORD has
provided industry standards for communication since 1981. It released
its first XML standards in 1999.

   ACORD XML standards allow data to be exchanged seamlessly across
applications and businesses, increasing efficiency and enabling
insurance and financial services firms to communicate electronically
with agents, brokers and other data partners in the industry. Prior to
adopting XML, ACORD members struggled with varying standards and
formats that threatened to delay transactions and corrupt data.

   Thunderhead's new Insurance Correspondence initiative integrates
the Thunderhead NOW platform for multi-channel (print, Web and mobile)
document automation with IBM Information Management and IBM Lotus
Forms software - helping insurers streamline creation, delivery and
management of customer correspondence and other personalized content.

   Thunderhead NOW is the first document generation platform built
with an open, standards-based architecture that natively supports XML
without relying on proprietary data formats.

   The technology combines Thunderhead NOW with IBM Enterprise
Content Management (ECM) and Business Process Management (BPM), IBM
DB2 pureXML(TM) and IBM Lotus Forms software, resulting in technology
that both creates and manages insurance information.

   Hundreds of large and small organizations worldwide have been
long-time users of IBM Forms software, which quickly and easily
automates business processes.

   With the combined features of Thunderhead and IBM middleware,
insurance organizations are able to:

   --  Improve the customer experience by delivering content on
        demand, through Web self-service, the call center or broker
        channel

   --  Gain faster time to market by automating the creation and
        management of letters, quotes, policies and other documents

   --  Increase efficiency and reduce costs by eliminating manual
        steps and integrating correspondence into straight-through
        claims processing initiatives

   --  Support e-business initiatives through the use of ACORD XML
        standards and modern open Services Oriented Architectures
        (SOA)

   --  Reduce risk by ensuring that customer and broker
        communications are in compliance with brand and regulatory
        guidelines

   With the integration of IBM technology, property and casualty and
life insurers can now use ACORD eForms powered by IBM Lotus Forms
software. This means customers and remote agents can submit standard
forms data and then automatically generate rules-based confirmations
or other personalized documents.

   With the addition of IBM FileNet BPM software, insurers can
automate reviews and approval processes as well, to ensure documents
created follow brand and regulatory compliance guidelines. Documents
can then be automatically archived for record-keeping in IBM ECM
software.

   New capabilities offered in the product by DB2 pureXML allow
compliant data to be stored, managed and retrieved efficiently.
Thunderhead NOW uses this XML data to generate customized responses to
customer inquiries, often without manual intervention.

   "Thunderhead's move to build upon IBM Information Management
software reflects IBM's Information on Demand strategy, helping
clients unlock the business value of information and use it to gain a
competitive advantage," said Martyn Christian, vice president, IBM
Enterprise Content Management. "By combining Thunderhead and IBM
technologies, insurance organizations can be more competitive."

   "The ability to natively support open standards and easily
integrate with IBM's market-leading middleware is important to
Thunderhead," said Glen Manchester, chief executive officer of
Thunderhead. "We applaud ACORD for driving the development of
XML-based standards and we look forward to continuing our work with
IBM to help insurance companies be more responsive to their customer
needs."

   Do large integrated oil companies also have the means to develop
alternative energies at some point in the future?

   They have the means, in terms of resources, but not necessarily
the incentive to go for it. They are in the business of producing and
selling hydrocarbons-based energy products and they are doing a very
good job at that. Much better, I would add, than many of the national
oil companies of the world. They have helped develop sources of
hydrocarbons that were not very conventional even a few years ago -
sources like the deepwater, tar sands, shale oil etc. In fairness to
them, they do invest a fair amount technological improvements and
efficiencies.

   Which companies would you consider your top Buy recommendations at
this time?

   While it is true that I have all along favored the large-cap
integrated company group within this space, I also like selective
oilfield service and drilling names. As I mentioned earlier, I am
looking for continued weakness in crude oil prices in the near term.
Historically, this has not been a favorable backdrop for stock prices
in the energy space. As such, I would expect across-the-board weakness
in the group in the face of moderating commodity prices.

   This is only a short-term headwind and should not be of much
concern to long-term investors who should view this expected pullback
as an opportunity to add to their positions in large-cap integrateds -
ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:
COP) - offshore drillers, particularly with deepwater drilling
capabilities - Transocean (NYSE: RIG), Diamond Offshore (NYSE: DO).

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), the world's biggest drinks maker, is seeking more acquisition opportunities in the fast-growing soft drinks market to expand its revenue sources, the company's CEO-in-waiting said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sales of established soft drinks are declining in the United States as people opt for the likes of bottled water and tea, which they see as healthier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You will see us grow organically as well as through targeted acquisitions," said Coca-Cola Chief Operating Officer Muhtar Kent, who is due to become chief executive officer on July 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent told reporters at the Foreign Correspondents' Club of Japan that such acquisitions would not be large, and the company was looking from country to country for opportunities, though he didn't specify where.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, whose rivals include PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N) and Dr Pepper Snapple Group Inc (DPS.N), has benefited from its recent acquisition of FUZE teas and Glaceau vitamin water, which have helped boost the company's sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Atlanta-based company, which gets 78 percent of its sales abroad, also bought Russian juice maker Multon in 2005 for $500 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no better industry, truly we believe, to be in than the non-alcohol beverage business," said Kent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that the soft drinks market was growing faster than most other categories of consumer products such as cosmetics, toiletries and beers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see huge opportunities in every category (of soft drinks)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent also reiterated Coke's long-term targets of increasing annual sales volume by 3 to 4 percent, operating income by 6 to 8 percent and earnings-per-share by a high single-digit percentage rate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 16, Coca-Cola reported a higher-than-expected quarterly profit as strong international growth offset the effects of a weak U.S. economy and flat sales volume at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke's international business, especially in places like China, India, Brazil and Turkey, has grown more important to investors in recent years as growth slows in mature markets like North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Coke shares closed up 25 cents, or 0.5 percent, at $56.40 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Mariko Katsumura, Editing by Brent Kininmont)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chairman 
and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon on Monday told bank investors 
that while the current credit market crunch may soon be over, 
the U.S. economy could still face a deep and extended 
recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The slump in mortgage and corporate loan markets could 
bottom out this year, said Dimon, whose bank largely 
side-stepped the losses and mark-downs that have hobbled rivals 
during the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet the economy may face a longer-term challenge even as 
financial markets begin to function again, the "slower burn" of 
a recession that may rival the severity of the 1982 
contraction, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These challenging conditions, marked by tighter bank 
credit, new rounds of mark-downs, further capital infusions and 
asset sales by banks, could last through next year and into 
2010, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If that happens, Dimon warned that New York-based JPMorgan 
and its national consumer lending businesses would suffer some 
significant losses, such as home equity losses doubling to $900 
million by year-end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon further warned that the bank would have to continue 
boosting loan-loss reserves if economic conditions deteriorate, 
further eating into profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the current quarter, Dimon said subprime mortgage losses 
could rise to between $200 million and $250 million, with prime 
mortgages generating about $100 million in losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loss rates in JPMorgan Chase's massive credit card business 
are expected to reach 5 percent in the second quarter and rise 
to as high as 6 percent next year, while at the same time 
interest and fee revenue decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The third-largest U.S. bank also expects to write down 
"several-hundred-million" dollars of auction rate securities, 
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) expects to
report a $1 billion second-quarter gain related to the Bear
Stearns Cos BSC.N takeover, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie
Dimon said on Monday, though some merger benefits will be less
than predicted while some losses will drag on results.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Dimon also told a UBS investor conference that JPMorgan has
identified positions for 40 percent of Bear's nearly 14,000
employees. To date, 75 percent of people decisions from the
merger have been completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has already realized $200 million of losses
reflecting its 49.5 percent ownership of Bear since April 8,
Dimon said. He warned that JPMorgan expects about $200 million
of further Bear losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The projected $1 billion gain reflects the addition of Bear
Stearns capital, offset by roughly $9 billion of losses
reflecting asset sales, purchase accounting, restructuring,
litigation costs and Bear's second-quarter losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon also disclosed that JPMorgan now expects its total
equity to rise by $2 billion, substantially less than the $5
billion increase previously forecast. Dimon also projected $900
million in merger expenses through 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet Dimon remained upbeat about the deal, which was
orchestrated by Federal Reserve officials who worried Bear was
in danger of going bankrupt in mid-March. JPMorgan initially
agreed to pay just $2 a share for Bear, but later lifted that
to $10 a share, or roughly $1.5 billion in total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the short run, integrating Bear's asset management and
brokerage businesses will reduce earnings through next year,
Dimon said. JPMorgan intends to close down "a big chunk" of
Bear's asset management, while the bigger bank was forced to
pay hefty bonuses to retain Bear's productive brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Longer term, Dimon said Bear's investment bank would
generate between $800 million and $1.13 billion of earnings for
JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan also disclosed that Bear's balance sheet has been
reduced substantially since JPMorgan announced its takeover in
mid-March.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total risk-weighted assets fell to $150 billion from $225
billion, led by reductions in mortgage and credit trading
positions, and that figure is expected to shrink further to $95
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prime brokerage assets, down 25 percent to $30 billion, are
expected to rebound to $50 billion, he said. Total Bear assets
of $410 billion fell by nearly half to $225 billion since March
17, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Any Star Trek fan knows that space travel is not always easy, but Microsoft Corp wants to make traveling the "final frontier" as simple as turning on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker launched a free software application called WorldWide Telescope on Monday that allows everyone from space novices to astronomy professors to easily explore galaxies, star systems and distant planets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WorldWide Telescope stitches together 12 terabytes -- the data equivalent of 2.6 billion pages of text -- of pictures from sources including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-Ray Observatory Center and the Spitzer Space Telescope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience is similar to playing a video game, allowing users to zoom in and out of galaxies that are thousands of light years away. It allows seamless viewing of far-away star systems and rarely-seen space dust in breathtaking clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A test version of the software is available for download at www.worldwidetelescope.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft archrival Google Inc also has its eyes to the skies. Google Sky started as an extension of space data and images into Google Earth before eventually unveiling a version that can be used through a Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's version is also free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will release the WorldWide Telescope free of charge as a tribute to Jim Gray, a Microsoft researcher who went missing off the coast of California while sailing last year. Gray worked on projects with astronomers to organize the vast amounts of data and images being pulled from satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects the technology used in the WorldWide Telescope to help the company in future software applications, but the goal for this program is to spark the interest of children to want to learn more about space and possibly pursue careers in science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My idea of success is if WorldWide Telescope changes how people see the universe and for a generation of kids to have a degree of knowledge about space that they are just not getting now," said Curtis Wong, manager of Microsoft's Next Media Research Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Contextualizing astronomy is missing right now. You see all of these Hubble images and they're amazing, but you have no idea about how big they are, how far away it is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software allows users to develop their own guided tours of the universe to share with others or take part a guided tour created by astronomy experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Kim Coghill)&lt;/p&gt;

residual material into petroleum coke, which has a variety

California, on Wednesday, according to a notice filed with
state pollution regulators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The flaring was from the plant's coking unit flare,

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc today named Garry A. Nicholson as Senior Vice
President, General Manager of the company's newly created Oncology
Business Unit, reporting to Ian Read, President of Pfizer Worldwide
Pharmaceutical Operations. Nicholson will serve as head of Pfizer's
oncology franchise, with direct responsibility for clinical
development, medical affairs, commercial development, sales and
marketing.

   "Garry is a highly regarded and accomplished executive whose
experience in the global oncology market makes him exceptionally
qualified to lead this important new growth area for Pfizer," Mr. Read
said. "The Oncology market is expected to grow significantly in the
next decade. This is being driven by breakthrough science, the rapid
uptake of new agents that meet high unmet medical need and treatments
that are enabling cancer patients to live longer."

   Mr. Nicholson is a senior pharmaceutical executive with extensive
experience in product development, marketing, sales and general
management on a worldwide basis.

   Mr. Nicholson joins Pfizer from Eli Lilly and Company, where he
spent more than 10 years as Executive Director of the U.S. Oncology
Business Unit and subsequently in an expanded role as Global Oncology
Platform Leader. In the latter role, Mr. Nicholson was responsible for
the global Oncology franchise, including the Oncology therapeutic area
strategy, portfolio management, Phase II/III development, global
integration of Oncology medical and marketing strategies, regulatory
submissions and approvals, and licensing and partnerships. In
addition, Mr. Nicholson was directly accountable for the company's
Oncology drug development budget and review of country and regional
forecasts and income statements. He also played a key leadership role
in business development and licensing initiatives in Oncology. Under
Mr. Nicholson's leadership, Lilly's global Oncology sales exceeded
$2.5 billion in 2007.

   From 2004 to 2005, Mr. Nicholson served as the Executive Director
of the Corporate Six Sigma Task force, where he was responsible for
driving significant operational improvements across Lilly's entire
business. Mr. Nicholson recruited and deployed Six Sigma team
participants and led implementation efforts for the Sales, Marketing
and Medical Affairs teams in all Lilly geographies.

   Mr. Nicholson has a Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacy from
the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and an MBA from the
University of South Carolina, Columbia.

   "This is a very exciting time to join Ian and the rest of Pfizer's
leadership as they seek to seize promising opportunities in the
growing global oncology market," Mr. Nicholson said. "I believe Pfizer
has the most promising and extensive oncology pipeline in the industry
and look forward to leading this important new business."

   On March 5th, Pfizer announced the establishment of a new Business
Unit focused solely on oncology in its Worldwide Pharmaceutical Group.
The unit will have the resources to seize growth opportunities to
strengthen Pfizer's research investment in oncology, a market expected
to more than double in the next decade. The Oncology Business Unit
will enable the Company to expedite launches of novel oncology agents,
as well as to focus research efforts on cancers common in Asia,
including those of the liver, esophagus and nasopharynx.

   Founded in 1849, Pfizer is the world's largest research-based
pharmaceutical company. Pfizer is taking new approaches to advancing
better health as it discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers
quality, safe and effective prescription medicines to treat and help
prevent disease for both people and animals. Pfizer also partners with
healthcare providers, governments and local communities around the
world to expand access to medicines and to provide better quality
health care and health system support. At Pfizer, more than 85,000
colleagues in more than 90 countries work every day to help people
stay happier and healthier longer and to reduce the human and economic
burden of disease worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 14 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase will save $3
billion because it no longer will have to build a new Lower
Manhattan headquarters for its investment bankers who instead will
move into Bear Stearns  Co's BSC.N midtown building, according
to JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan agreed to acquire credit-starved Bear Stearns in
mid-March. Dimon, speaking at a UBS AG (UBSN.VX) financial
conference on Monday, said: "This stops us from having to
basically spend $3 billion to build an investment banking
headquarters downtown."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York City's real estate market is slowing as financial
companies lay off tens of thousands of workers and developers find
bank loans harder to get and more costly. The withering credit has
already delayed mega-projects including Brooklyn's Atlantic Yards
and Midtown Manhattan's Hudson Yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan will be adding to the supply of office space. The
bank has identified one million square feet of offices it won't
need, out of the 4 million square feet it gets from Bear Stearns,
that will be sold or subleased, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan could cut as many as 4,000 of its own workers as
it takes on 6,000 Bear Stearns employees and weighs whether to
hire some or all of the 3,500 people it still is reviewing,
people familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A bank spokesman had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, the lead agency for the World Trade Center
redevelopment, said: "We haven't heard anything new. As far as
we know JPMorgan remains interested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan had unveiled plans for an office tower to be built
where the partly demolished Deutsche Bank building now stands,
just south of the World Trade Center complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Deutsche Bank building was damaged in the Sept. 11, 2001,
attacks and must be torn down, a process first delayed by mold and
then by a fatal fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noting Bear Stearns has five trading floors, JPMorgan's
Dimon said the bank would build two new ones. "Those seven in
New York City will probably accommodate the whole company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moving the entire investment bank into Bear Stearns'
midtown office tower will make it easier to run the department
now split between a couple of buildings, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "During the negotiations, I should point out that some of
our investment bankers came up and said, 'If you need a little
bit more money, we'll chip in so we don't have to commute,'" he
added.

&lt;p&gt;As Part of New Transparency Initiative Pfizer Releases List of Grants and Charitable Contributions Made in the First Quarter of 2008

   Grants of Almost $10 Million Made to 242 U.S. Medical, Scientific
                       and Patient Organizations
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer announced today that it has posted a list of U.S. medical,
scientific and patient organization grants and charitable
contributions made in the first quarter of this year, part of an
ongoing drive throughout the company to increase transparency.

   Pfizer partners with the world's leading experts and medical,
scientific and patient organizations to support their programs and
activities aimed at improving public health. This support includes
grants and charitable contributions for efforts that strengthen
communities where Pfizer colleagues live and work.

   The support highlighted today includes medical education grants,
fellowship and scholarship support for institutions, grants to patient
organizations, medical and scientific associations and academic or
other medical centers, and charitable contributions.

   Of a total $9.97 million in grants and charitable contributions
reported for the first quarter of 2008, the largest grant --
$3,420,318 -- was made to the California Academy of Family Physicians
in March for a three-year national health care professional education
campaign to reduce the number of U.S. smokers. This grant was
distributed among nine partner organizations across the country. Other
grants include $500,000 to Family Health International for malaria
patient education and treatment, and $237,500 to the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology for its clinical investigator training program
with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Information will be updated
each quarter.

   Pfizer is committed to increasing transparency and disclosure of
activities that relate to the public interest.

   --  In 2002, Pfizer began to register its clinical trials on the
        public database www.clinicaltrials.gov. The company now
        registers all trials in patients and has more than 800 trials
        registered.

   --  Also in 2002, Pfizer began publicly reporting U.S. political
        contributions.

   --  In 2004, Pfizer began publicly posting the results of its
        clinical trials at www.clinicalstudyresults.org.

   --  Starting in December 2006, the company launched a regularly
        updated public website, describing all compounds in its drug
        development pipeline and detailing their progress.

   --  And in April 2007, Pfizer began reporting its FDA
        post-marketing commitments relating to safety, efficacy or the
        use of Pfizer medicines.

   --  This latest transparency initiative follows a commitment
        Pfizer made in June 2007 to provide more information about the
        support it provides for groups that work to promote public
        health.

   "We want to bring greater transparency to the way we partner with
leading medical, scientific and patient organizations," said Jeffrey
B. Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pfizer. "Detailing
these grants and charitable contributions is an important part of our
ongoing transparency drive."

   "Easter Seals appreciates the support that Pfizer provides as it
directly enhances our capacity to serve and advocate for people with
disabilities and their families," said James E. Williams, Jr.,
President and CEO, Easter Seals, Inc, which received a grant from
Pfizer in 2007. "Our collaborations relate directly to the
mission-driven priorities of our organization. These activities are
grounded in a shared commitment to address unmet needs, eliminate
barriers, and otherwise foster improvements in health and quality of
life for persons with disabilities, their families and communities."

   "IAVI is proud to receive the support of Pfizer," said John
McGoldrick, Senior Vice President for the International AIDS Vaccine
Initiative. "Because of Pfizer's grant from its Global Health Fellows
Program, we have deployed 9 Fellows since 2005 to work directly with
IAVI teams at AIDS vaccine clinical trial sites across East and
Southern Africa. IAVI has benefited tremendously through this
strategic partnership, and we look forward to continuing our work with
Pfizer."

   Pfizer plans to report grants and charitable contributions to
medical, scientific and patient organizations quarterly. More detailed
descriptions of the type of support provided are available at
www.pfizer.com/transparencyingrants.

 IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Research In Motion (RIM) (NASDAQ: RIMM) (TSX: RIM) today
announced IBM's new hosting capabilities to support the BlackBerry(R)
platform. IBM has joined the BlackBerry(R) System Integrator (SI) Alliance
Program.

    IBM will expand its portfolio of Managed Wireless Services for the
BlackBerry
platform leveraging its successful services offering that currently hosts more
than 100,000 enterprise end users globally. The offering builds upon the
strength of the BlackBerry(R) Enterprise Server product line with a far-reaching
suite of services that include hosting, consulting, systems integration, and
deployment of enterprise applications on the converged platform.

    Ownership of wireless services in the enterprise has shifted from
Procurement
to the CIO. Like corporate data and telephony, the BlackBerry platform is
considered
by many to be fundamental to their business operations. Large organizations look
to outsource these services so they can focus on their core competencies.
Meanwhile, demand increases for innovative technology and infrastructure to
help support the mobile Web, as wireless devices now outnumber landlines.
IBM's Institute for Business Value predicts more than one billion mobile Web
users
by 2011.

    "We find that our enterprise clients increasingly need to extend wireless
data
capabilities beyond e-mail, and to leverage their enterprise investment on
wireless
device platforms," said Gary Cohen, IBM's General Manager, Global Communications
Sector. "IBM's services will facilitate the deployment and ongoing management
of enterprise applications on the BlackBerry platform. We are uniquely
positioned to enable our enterprise customers to do so on a large scale. As the
world's leading IT services provider we are very pleased to be offering these
services and to be working with RIM, an outstanding innovative leader in the
wireless data marketplace."

    "In today's business world, BlackBerry is as essential to our organization
as network
connectivity, phone and e-mail. At Fluor, we count on BlackBerry to speed our
decision making, help solve problems and improve execution," said Ray Barnard,
VP and
CIO, Fluor Corporation. "We count on IBM to deliver this essential service
and to collaborate with our business partners to innovate on new mobile
applications that further our competitive advantage."

    "RIM is excited to support the expansion of IBM's Managed Wireless
Servicesfor the BlackBerry platform," said Jeff McDowell, Vice President, Global
Alliances at Research in Motion. "RIM believes IBM's hosted services will help
extend the reach of the BlackBerry platform globally and will help customers
realize the full value of enterprise mobility."

    Managing customers' wireless applications in an increasingly
mobile-centricworld is a key focus of the new alliance between IBM and RIM. IBM
now offers
access to BlackBerry mobile applications for the full line of Web 2.0-powered
Lotus collaboration and information on demand software on the market-leading
BlackBerry platform.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co will begin trading physical oil by year-end, increasing its exposure in a market that could rise to $200 a barrel, the bank's global head of commodities said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank plans to expand in commodities and energy trading, Blythe Masters said, despite expectations of job cuts in other areas as it prepares to take on staff from Bear Stearns at the same time it deals with turbulent financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will start trading in physical oil and refined products by the end of this year," she told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will join a growing list of investment banks from Goldman Sachs to Barclays Capital seeking to boost profits on their big derivatives trading desks by gaining a foothold in physical markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third-largest U.S. bank added 50 people to its commodities and energy trading and investment team last year and is on track to hire a similar number this year, taking the strength of the total team globally to 450, Masters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, it hired former Goldman Sachs banker Oral Dawe as managing director and CEO of its Asia Pacific commodities group, in addition to hiring more than a dozen traders in Asia recently to oversee its expansion in energy and metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with oil prices surging more than 30 percent this year to a record near $127 this week, Masters said the bank would look at more ways to boost its presence in energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil rising to $200? It could happen. This year? You could see it, although it would take a further shock to expectations," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Supply disruptions, geopolitical events, increased demand for refined products, weather, additional investor inflows driven by shifting inflation expectations -- they could all contribute to high oil prices," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIMITED IMPACT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masters shrugged off the impact of the U.S. credit crisis, saying robust growth in demand from emerging markets could more than offset a slowdown in demand in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the prospects for the natural resources sector and commodity businesses are strong and are not really derailed in any sense by the credit crisis in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Urbanizing populations in markets like India and China are driving the appreciation in commodity prices," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to oil, Masters expected prices of metals and grains to remain high in the near to medium term as supplies would take some time to catch up with rapidly rising demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think high commodity prices are staying for some time but you could also see corrections and you will certainly see high volatility. The current inflated prices are a reflection of fundamental factors, not just speculation," Masters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the supply side, there are still major shortfalls in infrastructure as a result of sustained period of under investment in commodities that has not yet been undone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan came under fire in March after it acquired a nearly insolvent Bear Stearns with involvement of the Federal Reserve and at a fire-sale price. It expects to complete its takeover of Bear around June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank could cut as many as 4,000 of its own employees worldwide as it prepares to take on staff from Bear, people familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ben Tan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Nevis Networks, a market leader in secure switching and
identity-based policy enforcement appliances, today announced that
Nevis Labs has identified vulnerabilities in Microsoft Windows Live
OneCare.

-0-
*T
Affected Product/Versions:  Windows Live OneCare less than 2.0.2500
                            Windows Defender and ForeFront are also
                             affected.
*T

   Product Overview: Windows Live OneCare is a new,
subscription-based service provided by Microsoft to protect Windows
computers. OneCare provides anti-virus protection, a two-way firewall,
a back-up utility and system tune-ups.

   For more information visit http://onecare.live.com/.

   Vulnerability Details: These vulnerabilities allow remote
unauthenticated attackers to launch a Denial of Service (DoS) attack
on the Windows Live OneCare/Windows Defender/ForeFront. No user
interaction is required. There are various ways to exploit these
vulnerabilities. It can be done through sending email to victim's Mail
server, convincing victim to visit website, transferring files through
P2P/IM.

   The first flaw exists within the parsing of the certain size field
in the PE file. By setting this field to an overly large value, the
vulnerable antivirus software will "eat" several Giga bytes disk
space, which result in a disk space based DoS, especially for the
antivirus installed on the server side.

   The second flaw also exists within the parsing PE file. By
crafting a malformed PE file, the vulnerable antivirus software will
crash with memory corruption while scanning this file.

   Vendor Response / Solution: Microsoft has issued an update to
correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at:
http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/Bulletin/MS08-029.mspx.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments, background; updates share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tenzin Pema&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE May 14 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
LEH.N may suffer a second-quarter loss, as Wall Street
investment banks take hits from slower client and investment
banking activity and poor results from principal and
proprietary trading, a Goldman Sachs  Co analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; William Tanona, the analyst, also slashed his
second-quarter and 2008 earnings outlooks for Morgan Stanley
(MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tanona is the latest in a growing line-up of Wall Street
analysts to cut estimates on U.S. investment banks, but is the
only one now projecting a second-quarter loss at Lehman,
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He expects a quarterly loss of 20 cents per share at
Lehman, compared with his earlier forecast for a profit of
$1.35 per share. Tanona halved his profit forecast for Morgan
Stanley to 80 cents per share from $1.60.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst said quarterly results may suffer from hedging
activity and losses related to structured credit liabilities
will also hurt results. He expects losses from credit spread
tightening to total $1 billion at Morgan Stanley and $400
million at Lehman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TIME TO BUY?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In spite of his forecasts, Tanona expects investment
banking trends to improve, as many of the U.S. Federal
Reserve's actions should help drive economic growth in late
2008 and early 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Amex Securities Broker-Dealer Index .XBD, which
includes Lehman and Morgan Stanley, has through Tuesday fallen
17 percent this year as the effects of the subprime mortgage
crisis, credit crunch and housing slump reverberate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Tanona believes the weakness of the stocks is a buying
opportunity. He rates Lehman and Morgan Stanley "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among 18 analysts covering Lehman, one rated it a "strong
buy," eight others rated it "buy" or the equivalent, while the
rest rated it "hold," according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley is rated "strong buy" by one analyst, "buy"
or the equivalent by seven analysts, and "hold" by 12 analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tanona also cut his second-quarter and 2008 profit
forecasts for Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N, the troubled Wall
Street bank being acquired by JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N). The
closing is expected to take place by the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Lehman were little changed at $42.89 in afternoon
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley shares were up 63 cents at $47.24, while
Bear Stearns' shares were down 10 cents at $10.06.
 The following table lists Tanona's second-quarter, full-year
estimates for U.S. brokers:

&lt;p&gt;IRVINE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
This week 1105 Redmond Media Group launched a new site for IT
executives, managers, developers, vendors and others who need the
latest Microsoft-related news compiled into one location.

   The site, now available in beta format at RedmondReport.com,
offers across-the-Web coverage of the Microsoft IT world through
constantly rotating links hand-picked by the award-winning staff of
1105 Redmond Media Group.

can visit multiple times a day to be instantly updated on the latest
happenings with Microsoft and other stories that matter to the Windows
IT community," explained 1105 Redmond Media Group President Henry
Allain.

   "Our print and online editorial staff at Redmond, Redmond Channel
Partner, Redmond Developer News, and Visual Studio Magazine is out
there constantly searching the entire Internet for the freshest
Microsoft-related news all day, every day," commented Editorial
Director Doug Barney. "We wanted to come up with a better way to keep
each other updated about what's happening, and then we thought--why
not share the site with everyone?"

   Unlike its robust sister sites Redmondmag.com and RedDevNews.com

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Any Star Trek fan knows that space travel is not always easy, but Microsoft Corp wants to make traveling the "final frontier" as simple as turning on your computer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker launched a free software application called WorldWide Telescope on Monday that allows everyone from space novices to astronomy professors to easily explore galaxies, star systems and distant planets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The WorldWide Telescope stitches together 12 terabytes -- the data equivalent of 2.6 billion pages of text -- of pictures from sources including the Hubble Space Telescope, the Chandra X-Ray Observatory Center and the Spitzer Space Telescope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The experience is similar to playing a video game, allowing users to zoom in and out of galaxies that are thousands of light years away. It allows seamless viewing of far-away star systems and rarely-seen space dust in breathtaking clarity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A test version of the software is available for download at www.worldwidetelescope.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft archrival Google Inc also has its eyes to the skies. Google Sky started as an extension of space data and images into Google Earth before eventually unveiling a version that can be used through a Web browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google's version is also free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will release the WorldWide Telescope free of charge as a tribute to Jim Gray, a Microsoft researcher who went missing off the coast of California while sailing last year. Gray worked on projects with astronomers to organize the vast amounts of data and images being pulled from satellites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expects the technology used in the WorldWide Telescope to help the company in future software applications, but the goal for this program is to spark the interest of children to want to learn more about space and possibly pursue careers in science and engineering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My idea of success is if WorldWide Telescope changes how people see the universe and for a generation of kids to have a degree of knowledge about space that they are just not getting now," said Curtis Wong, manager of Microsoft's Next Media Research Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Contextualizing astronomy is missing right now. You see all of these Hubble images and they're amazing, but you have no idea about how big they are, how far away it is."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software allows users to develop their own guided tours of the universe to share with others or take part a guided tour created by astronomy experts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Kim Coghill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil, Employees, Retirees Donate More Than $7.7 Million to Texas Colleges and Universities

   79 Texas Institutions to Receive Educational Matching Gift Grant
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil announced today that more than $7.7 million has been
donated to 79 colleges and universities in Texas through the
ExxonMobil Foundation's 2007 Educational Matching Gift Program.

   ExxonMobil employees, retirees, surviving spouses and directors
contributed $2.2 million to Texas institutions of higher education in
2007, which was matched by the ExxonMobil Foundation with more than
$5.5 million in unrestricted educational grants.

   The Educational Matching Gift Program is one of the most generous
of its kind in the United States, matching gifts to affiliated higher
education institutions by employees and retirees on a 3-to-1 basis.
Since its inception in 1962, the program has provided more than $372
million to higher education in the United States.

   ExxonMobil Foundation funds math and science programs to respond
to the nation's growing need to produce more engineers and scientists
and to develop more highly qualified math and science teachers. To
assist with these efforts, the Foundation is encouraging college and
university presidents to allocate a portion of the unrestricted
matching funds to existing or new programs which provide teachers with
professional development opportunities, train new math and science
teachers, and support women and minority science and engineering
programs.

   "For more than 40 years ExxonMobil's employees and retirees have
demonstrated their commitment to institutions of higher education
through their generous contributions through the Educational Matching
Gift Program," said Kenneth P. Cohen, vice president for public
affairs, Exxon Mobil Corporation, and chairman, ExxonMobil Foundation.
"These donations provide universities throughout the nation an
opportunity to enhance their current educational programs and to
achieve new levels of excellence."

   Under the Educational Matching Gift Program, ExxonMobil provides
the 3-1 matching funding for donations of up to $7,500 a year to
colleges and universities with which employees or retirees are
affiliated. The affiliation requirement is waived for gifts to the
United Negro College Fund, the Hispanic Scholarship Fund and the
American Indian College Fund.

   About ExxonMobil Foundation

   ExxonMobil Foundation is the primary philanthropic arm of the
Exxon Mobil Corporation in the United States. The Foundation and the
Corporation engage in a range of philanthropic activities that advance
education, health and science in the communities where ExxonMobil has
significant operations. In the United States, ExxonMobil supports
initiatives to improve math and science education at the K-12 and
higher education levels. Globally, ExxonMobil provides funding to
improve basic education and combat malaria and other infectious
diseases in developing countries. In 2007, together with its employees
and retirees, Exxon Mobil Corporation, its divisions and affiliates,
and ExxonMobil Foundation provided $207 million in contributions
worldwide, of which $70 million was dedicated to education. Additional
information on ExxonMobil's community partnerships and contributions
programs is available at www.exxonmobil.com/community.

&lt;p&gt;Compellent Storage Systems Selected for Microsoft Partner Solutions Center's Virtual Data Center

        Microsoft Customers and Business Units Can Improve Data
     Utilization, Recovery and Performance with Solutions Based on
                Compellent SAN and Windows Server 2008
EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn.--(Business Wire)--
Compellent Technologies, Inc. (NYSE Arca: CML) today announced
that Microsoft Corporation has selected the Compellent storage area
network (SAN) as a core storage component of the Microsoft Partner
Solution Center's (MPSC) virtual data center and disaster recovery
strategy.

   Located in Redmond, Wash., the MPSC is installing two Compellent
SANs to host a wide array of applications to support proof-of-concept
testing, architectural design and other initiatives including
Compellent's remote replication for quick data and disaster recovery.
MPSC architects plan to test and showcase technology solutions for
customers, business units and partners, based on Microsoft platforms
such as Windows Server 2008 on the Compellent SAN.

   "Since Compellent proved itself in ease-of-use, utilization,
scalability and 'green' efficiencies in a number of projects here at
the MPSC, when it came time for us to redesign and virtualize our data
center, it was an easy choice to add the Compellent SAN" said David
Hayes, director of the Microsoft Partner Solutions Center. "We believe
the Compellent storage systems will not only enable the MPSC to expand
our own operations but also enable both companies to demonstrate more
efficient and sophisticated storage platforms for the Microsoft
community. We look forward to the continued collaboration with
Compellent."

   As a Sponsor-level partner, Compellent will work with the MPSC to
help design and validate technology offerings that benefit Microsoft
customers and business units. Compellent specialists will demonstrate
real-world environment testing using the MPSC's data center, training
rooms, briefing rooms and labs. In addition, Compellent will invite
storage customers to participate in executive briefings held at the
MPSC.

   "Compellent continues to deliver the most efficient virtualized
storage system to help customers realize the promise of virtual data
centers based on platforms such as Microsoft's upcoming release of
Hyper-V," said Bruce Kornfeld, vice president of marketing,
Compellent. "We are pleased to be chosen by the MPSC for its new data
center and are committed to making advances in data storage
utilization and power efficiencies that can exceed the needs of
Microsoft's customer base worldwide."

   The Compellent SANs feature release 4.0, which offers several
industry-first technologies that can manage data inside the volume to
reduce the number of disk drives required by up to 80 percent.
Compellent technologies such as Fast Track, Application Optimizer and
Thin Import optimize data placement and utilization for server
applications such as Microsoft SQL Server 2008, effectively reducing
total cost of ownership and energy consumption for enterprises of all
sizes. Using Compellent's storage resource management tool, Enterprise
Manager, the MPSC can quickly manage remote replication and
automatically create reports on capacity and cost savings for disks,
power consumption and carbon emissions. In addition, Free Space
Recovery, available with Enterprise Manager, enables deleted file
space in a Windows environment to be reused.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) could cut
as many as 4,000 of its own employees worldwide as the bank
prepares to take on staff from Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N at the
same time it deals with turmoil in financial markets, people
familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In addition to roughly 2,000 JPMorgan employees who will be
replaced by counterparts acquired through its takeover of Bear
Stearns, the sources said that an additional 1,000 to 2,000
JPMorgan employees may lose their jobs because of the slowdown
in investment banking activity and credit market crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Final decisions dealing with specific employees have not
been made, though JPMorgan is expected to decide on
market-related cuts by early June, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, which expects to complete its takeover of Bear
Stearns around June 1, told investors on Monday the bank had
made decisions on about 10,000 of Bear's nearly 14,000
employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told investors the bank
had extended job offers to about 6,000 Bear staffers, leaving
decisions still to be made on the remaining 3,500 Bear
staffers. Most of these employees work in technology and
operations, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources also said that of 6,000 Bear staffers offered
jobs, a little more than half are regarded as "lift and drops,"
meaning employees who can be lifted from businesses where
JPMorgan is not strong, such as prime brokerage, clearing,
energy trading and some investment banking coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among 2,500 to 2,700 Bear staffers who have been offered
jobs, some will fill operations, finance and other roles
required in a larger company. But an unspecified number of
these staffers overlap with existing JPMorgan staffers, and
JPMorgan is expected to cut roughly 2,000 of its own employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a net basis, the Bear merger would boost JPMorgan's
total headcount by 4,000 to about 184,000 worldwide, the
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan came under fire in March after it acquired a
nearly-insolvent Bear with involvement of the Federal Reserve
and at a fire-sale price. Since then, Morgan executives have
worked carefully around personnel decisions, worried that
wholesale job cuts would generate more bad publicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Gary Hill, Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SUNNYVALE, CA, May 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Aruba Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ: ARUN), a global leader in wireless LANs and
secure mobility solutions, today announced that Microsoft has passed an
important milestone having deployed more than 11,000 centrally managed access
points in its massively scalable wireless LAN. The Aruba deployment replaced a
legacy system of autonomous access points that was difficult to manage, lacked
guest access support, and required enhanced security features. The sheer
scale of the centralized Aruba system, spanning as it does across virtually
every
continent, makes it one of the largest enterprise wireless networks in the
world.

    Originally announced in June 2005, the network was to include 5,000 access
points and serve over 25,000 simultaneous users worldwide each day. While the
scope of the system subsequently expanded, the objectives remained the same:
provide follow-me connectivity and follow-me security to all users regardless
of where they work or roam; offer centralized management of the entire
network with redundant back-up; support a wide array of personal computing
systems; and enable a number of new and improved IT services. The Aruba
wireless network services over 80,000 unique wireless client users.

    "We embarked on this project with very specific objectives with respect to
network management, security, and end user satisfaction and the numbers speak
for
themselves," said Victoria Poncini, Microsoft's Network Architect. "Today more
than 75% of our employees use the wireless LAN every day, and 72% said they
could work without any wires at all. 93% of users can use their computers in
new locations because of the enhanced mobility afforded by the wireless LAN, and
70% of employees said the network saved them at least 5 work hours a week
because of increased flexibility. Because of large user adoption of wireless
connectivity it is not difficult to envision a time when we transition to an
all-wireless workplace."

    Aruba's unified mobility networks securely deliver the enterprise network to
users by integrating adaptive wireless LANs, identity-based security,
application
continuity services, and multi-vendor network management into a cohesive,
high-performance system. Adaptive wireless LANs deliver follow-me connectivity
to
roaming users, and support standard Wi-Fi clients such as Intel Centrino.
Aruba's identity-based security associates policies with users instead of
ports, delivering follow-me security that provides expanded mobility for users
without compromising security.

    "Just as Aruba relies on Microsoft SharePoint, Office, and Outlook
productsto enhance our productivity, so, too, does Microsoft look to Aruba's
adaptive
wireless LANs to enhance employee mobility and efficiency," said Keerti
Melkote, Aruba's co-founder and head of partnerships and products. "For most
Aruba
customers, Microsoft included, the wireless LAN is their primary enterprise
network. Microsoft's extensive, business-critical deployment is a strong
endorsement for
the scalability, robustness, and security of Aruba's wireless LANs."

    About Aruba Networks

    People move. Networks must follow. Aruba securely delivers networks to
users, wherever they work or roam. Our unified mobility solutions include Wi-Fi
networks, identity-based security, remote access and cellular services, and
centralized multi-vendor network management to enable the Follow-Me
Enterprise that moves in lock-step with users:


--  Follow-Me Connectivity: Adaptive 802.11a/b/g/n Wi-Fi networks optimize
    themselves to ensure that users are always within reach of mission-critical
    information;
--  Follow-Me Security: Identity-based security assigns access policies to
    users, enforcing those policies whenever and wherever a network is
    accessed;
--  Follow-Me Applications: Remote access solutions and cellular network
    integration ensure uninterrupted access to applications as users move;
--  Follow-Me Management: Multi-vendor network management provides a
    single point of control while managing both legacy and new wireless
    networks from both Aruba and its competitors.
    

    
The cost, convenience, and security benefits of our unified mobility solutions
are fundamentally changing how and where we work. Listed on the NASDAQ and
Russell 2000(R) Index, Aruba is based in Sunnyvale, California, and has
operations
throughout the Americas, Europe, Middle East, and Asia Pacific regions. To

show when they were treated to CoCaLo Baby's "Creme Brulee"
collection. Proving that the CoCaLo line possesses celebrity pizzazz,
super-stylish mom-to-be Tori Spelling also received the CoCaLo Couture
"Plumeria" collection for her nursery during her recent baby shower.

   "Providing the 'star treatment' for a child's nursery is about
well-chosen colors, sumptuous textures and attention to the details
that create a stylish extension of the home. That presents a design
challenge, but CoCaLo proves it can be done and still be affordable,"
said Renee Pepys Lowe, president of CoCaLo, Inc., a trend leader in
the infant bedding and decor business for a decade.

   "Reaching for the Stars"

   Mom's Style Plays Key Role in Room Decor...CoCaLo Plays to Both
Styles Which Stretches to Make the Most of Your Child's Room Decor

   For the first time, mom now has room decor that is uniquely
different based on her style preference. This applies to both CoCaLo
Baby and CoCaLo Couture. And, for the first time, CoCaLo room decor is
now available in retail outlets. Room decor includes lighting,
accessories, storage, rugs, window treatments and wall decor. They are
complementary but coordinate.

   CoCaLo Baby is about the child. It is child-centric, following the
child from the nursery to the playroom, bathroom and beyond. It's
theme-driven in the traditional sense, where everything matches.
CoCaLo Couture is more design-driven, transcending the child's world
of the nursery and reaching throughout the home as a stylish extension
of the well-furnished residence, reflecting parents' style
preferences. It can be used in the laundry room, guest room and grow
with the child and their room transitions. So now, moms have a choice,
baby themes or high style.

   "Our room decor line is a complementary range for the eclectic
nursery in a fun, affordable, decorative way," said Pepys Lowe. "It
allows Mom to exercise her style preference. Now she can have a
hassle-free, turnkey stylish nursery at her fingertips without having
to search for all the little things that create that total look she's
after, and it grows with the child because these items are perfectly
at home in an older child's room."

   About CoCaLo, Inc.

   Celebrating its 10th anniversary, CoCaLo, Inc., headquartered in
Costa Mesa, CA, is a leading manufacturer and distributor of popular
infant bedding and accessory products. CoCaLo Couture(TM) is the

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) is exploring acquisition possibilities in the German biotech sector and has held talks with the management of Munich-based MediGene MDGGn.DE, two industry sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer is looking at it," one of the sources told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and MediGene declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MediGene shares rose 13 percent to 6.3 euros after the news on Wednesday, valuing the group -- which specializes in cancer treatment -- at around 210 million euros ($325 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Pfizer, the world's biggest drugs company, MediGene would be an easily digested acquisition and the New York-based company has a past history of buying up smaller companies with promising products or technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said on Tuesday Pfizer's recent focus was on smaller transactions, and he did not feel obliged to buy mid-size drugmakers, in the $10 billion to $15 billion price range, as some analysts have urged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Medigene is the only German biotech firm with two products on the market -- prostrate cancer drug Eligard and genital warts treatment Veregen.

Endotag could generate annual sales of more than 1 billion euros, according to MediGene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Several leading drug companies have already expressed strong interest and started talks with us on being partners for Endotag," MediGene Chief Executive Peter Heinrich said in early April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall Medigene sees sales potential for drugs in clinical development at over 3 billion euros.

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Xoma Ltd., Goldman Sachs, Priceline.com, ON Semiconductor and LSI Logic

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: Xoma Ltd. (Nasdaq: XOMA),
Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS), Priceline.com (Nasdaq: PCLN), ON
Semiconductor (Nasdaq: ONNN) and LSI Logic (NYSE: LSI).

free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=4579

   Here are highlights from Tuesday's Analyst Blog:

   XOMA Making the Right Moves

   Advancement of XOMA-052 in the current phase I trials remains the
chief focus of the management of Xoma Ltd. (Nasdaq: XOMA). Data on
these two trials are expected in the third quarter 2008. We expect an
initiation of a phase I trial on XOMA-629 also in the third quarter
2008.

   Management will look to bring in one additional collaboration
partner on board at some point this year. All the above milestones
should get the stock moving higher in the second half of the year.

   We believe Xoma's antibody discovery platform is starting to show
signs of paying off, as both -052 and -629 could prove to be
significant products in the not-so-distant future. The name remains
significantly under-valued in our view.

   Royalty revenue continues to provide meaningful growth to Xoma.
Sales of Raptiva totaled $61 million in the first quarter 2008. Sales
of Lucentis totaled $393 million in the first quarter. Both products
are growing at double-digits rates. In May 2008 Xoma used this growing
royalty line to secure a $55 million loan with Goldman Sachs (NYSE:
GS). But with the shares trading at $2.15, Xoma is a very volatile
stock.

   Don't Chase Priceline Shares Here

   Priceline.com's (Nasdaq: PCLN) first quarter results easily blew
past consensus estimates, and management's guidance for 2008 was
equally bullish. The strength in Priceline.com's international
business and operating expense controls continue to drive the
company's impressive results.

   What's more, we think the company is well-positioned to weather a
slowdown in consumer spending due to the value proposition it offers
customers. Still, we wouldn't chase the shares here, as they trade at
over 25x our 2008 EPS estimate. That is a pricey multiple in the
current market.

   We have been bullish on PCLN shares since we upgraded the stock in
January of 2006, when it was trading around $22 per share. However, we
think the stock, which is now trading around $140, is fairly valued.
We think it is appropriate to go with a neutral stance.

   ON Semi On the Right Path

   ON Semiconductor Corporation (Nasdaq: ONNN) is an original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) of primarily analog semiconductors used
within a diverse set of end markets. March quarter results beat
consensus estimates on the top and bottom-line.

   Next quarter's revenue guidance is for 3%-6% growth. Management
anticipates that total revenues will be approximately $545 to $560
million in the second quarter of 2008. Further, they expect that
average selling prices for the second quarter of 2008 will be down
approximately two per cent sequentially. Backlog represents over 85%
of next quarter's revenue projection.

   The company has also begun to get significant revenue from its
recent major purchase of LSI Logic's (NYSE: LSI) Gresham, Oregon wafer
facility, which has the potential to be a solid revenue driver. The
products produced at the Gresham facility are of the high-margin
variety. We feel the stock is under valued at these levels, and
recommend investors Buy the shares.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) could cut 
as many as 4,000 of its own employees worldwide as the bank 
prepares to take on staff from Bear Stearns Cos BSC.N at the 
same time it deals with turmoil in financial markets, people 
familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In addition to roughly 2,000 JPMorgan employees who will be 
replaced by counterparts acquired through its takeover of Bear 
Stearns, the sources said that an additional 1,000 to 2,000 
JPMorgan employees may lose their jobs because of the slowdown 
in investment banking activity and credit market crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Final decisions dealing with specific employees have not 
been made, though JPMorgan is expected to decide on 
market-related cuts by early June, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, which expects to complete its takeover of Bear 
Stearns around June 1, told investors on Monday the bank had 
made decisions on about 10,000 of Bear's nearly 14,000 
employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told investors the bank 
had extended job offers to about 6,000 Bear staffers, leaving 
decisions still to be made on the remaining 3,500 Bear 
staffers. Most of these employees work in technology and 
operations, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sources also said that of 6,000 Bear staffers offered 
jobs, a little more than half are regarded as "lift and drops," 
meaning employees who can be lifted from businesses where 
JPMorgan is not strong, such as prime brokerage, clearing, 
energy trading and some investment banking coverage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among 2,500 to 2,700 Bear staffers who have been offered 
jobs, some will fill operations, finance and other roles 
required in a larger company. But an unspecified number of 
these staffers overlap with existing JPMorgan staffers, and 
JPMorgan is expected to cut roughly 2,000 of its own employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On a net basis, the Bear merger would boost JPMorgan's 
total headcount by 4,000 to about 184,000 worldwide, the 
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan came under fire in March after it acquired a 
nearly-insolvent Bear with involvement of the Federal Reserve 
and at a fire-sale price. Since then, Morgan executives have 
worked carefully around personnel decisions, worried that 
wholesale job cuts would generate more bad publicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Gary Hill, Toni Reinhold)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chase Invests $338 Billion in Low and Moderate-Income Families, Communities and Small Businesses in Four Years

                Firm Remains on Track in $800 Billion Commitment
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Supporting low- and moderate-income families, communities and small businesses,
Chase announced today that it has invested more than $338 billion in the first
four years of its 10-year, $800 billion commitment.

"Helping families buy a home they can afford over the long term remains a
crucial part of our commitment to communities," said Charlie Scharf, chief
executive officer of Retail Financial Services. "We have helped buyers better
understand the responsibilities they are taking on and we have helped many
homeowners facing financial challenges."

In 2004, parent company JPMorgan Chase pledged to invest $800 billion over 10
years in communities across the country, which continues to be a major
commitment to community development lending and economic development.

Chase already has invested 42 percent of that in three areas crucial to families
and communities across the country:

    --  $258 billion in mortgages in low and moderate-income neighborhoods and
        to lower-income and minority borrowers

    --  $63 billion in small business lending, and

    --  $17 billion in community development lending and investment.

"Our capital, our leadership, our banking services and our people are making
many communities across the country stronger," said William Daley, Head of
JPMorgan Chase's Office of Corporate Responsibility.

Chase supports families and communities through a broad range of programs,
including the following:

The Homeownership Preservation Office

Chase's Homeownership Preservation Office helps families stay in their homes
whenever possible by connecting homeowners with counselors through a national
help line and leading foreclosure-prevention workshops and local training
programs for community leaders, housing advocates, public officials and
investors.

    --  Case managers on the toll-free help line received more than 7,600 calls
        from non-profits, generating 2,900 new cases.

    --  Chase worked with foreclosure-prevention programs in Chicago, Cleveland,
        Dallas and Detroit as well as Colorado, Indiana and New York. It has
        conducted dozens of workshops and trained more than 2,600 counselors,
        advocates and public officials.

    --  The Homeownership Preservation Office served as a model for the national
        HOPE NOW Alliance, which reaches out to connect struggling homeowners
        with housing counselors and mortgage servicers.

Small Business Administration Loans

Chase made over 8,500 Small Business Administration loans in fiscal year 2007,
ranking second nationally in number of loans. Chase was the largest SBA lender
in Arizona, Illinois, Louisiana, Michigan and in New York City, Dallas, and
Houston.

Certified Community Development Institutions

More than $670 million of loans and investments went to certified community
development financial institutions - two-thirds of JPMorgan Chase's 10-year goal
of $1 billion. In turn, the institutions made loans to construct and
rehabilitate affordable housing, build health-care facilities, and provide small
business and micro-loans to entrepreneurs in lower-income communities.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) plans to 
buy technology outsourcing company Electronic Data Systems Corp 
EDS.N to better compete against IBM (IBM.N), but Wall Street 
questioned whether the $12.6 billion deal for a slow-growing 
company was overpriced.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; HP shares fell 5.28 percent after the deal was announced on 
Tuesday, on top of a 5 percent drop on Monday in anticipation 
of the news. The declines have wiped about $12 billion off HP's 
market value, taking it to $109 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Owning EDS, one of the pioneers of the outsourcing of 
managed computer services, would vault HP to second place in 
the global technology services industry, behind International 
Business Machines Corp. Analysts said the merged company would 
be better-equipped to go after large clients and cap costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither EDS nor HP, however, are strong in the high-end 
consulting business that is a strong suit of IBM, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brent Bracelin, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, 
said EDS gets half of its revenue from government and financial 
services customers, which are not high-growth clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What investors are worried about now is what happens over 
the next six months," he said. "I think there are still some 
concerns around extracting value out of the deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition would be HP's biggest since its $19 billion 
purchase of Compaq in 2002 and the most ambitious under Chief 
Executive Mark Hurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It values EDS at $25 per share, a 33 percent premium to its 
closing price on Friday. Including debt, the deal's enterprise 
value was $13.9 billion, the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HP said it would pay for the deal with a mixture of cash 
and debt, without giving the breakdown. HP ended its last 
fiscal quarter with nearly $10 billion in cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would say the deal, in my view, is a little pricey, but 
we'd have to look at the details," said Jeff Embersits, chief 
investment officer of Shareholder Value Management, which owns 
HP shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the key was how EDS would be integrated to make it 
a more profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Mark's working with a five-year plan. So this will 
probably look a lot smarter in two or three years, but it could 
be a tough year," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HP expects the deal to close in the second half of 2008 and 
boost its adjusted fiscal 2009 earnings and fiscal 2010 net 
earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also reported better-than-expected preliminary 
quarterly results on Tuesday and raised its fiscal 2008 
outlook, which it said did not include any potential impact 
from the EDS deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would be aggressive buyers of (HP) shares on today's 
pullback," Citi analyst Richard Gardner wrote in a report, 
calling the share fall "a clear overreaction."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The EDS acquisition was unexpected, but strategically and 
financially compelling, in our view," he said, adding there was 
minimal overlap between HP and EDS's service offerings and 
customers. "The deal should create cross-selling opportunities 
and boost confidence in EDS as a service provider."
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LUCRATIVE SERVICES BUSINESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HP has long considered an acquisition to beef up its tech 
services business, a sector that offers relatively stable 
income and high margins, even in an economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology services include specialization in consulting on 
how to build systems, providing computer and software resources 
for companies, which is broadly called outsourcing, and 
managing and maintaining technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worldwide computer services revenue rose 10.5 percent to 
$748 billion in 2007, according to market research firm Gartner 
Inc. IBM led with a 7.2 percent market share, EDS was second 
with 3.0 percent, while HP was fifth with 2.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The acquisition is estimated to more than double HP's 
services business and creates a leading force in the global IT 
services industry," Hurd told analysts on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combined company will have annual services revenue of 
more than $38 billion and 210,000 employees, HP said. That 
compared to IBM's $54.1 billion in services revenue last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the deal would likely spark a round of 
consolidation as suddenly much-smaller rivals such as Infosys 
Technologies Ltd (INFY.BO), Tata Consultancy Services Ltd 
(TCS.BO), Wipro Ltd (WIPR.BO) (WIT.N) and Cognizant Technology 
Solutions Corp (CTSH.O) scramble to stay competitive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EDS also competes against U.S. companies such as Accenture 
Ltd (ACN.N), Computer Sciences Corp (CSC.N) and Affiliated 
Computer Services Inc (ACS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're going to start seeing more, I believe, of these 
strategic deals where it's not private equity coming, but it's 
big companies -- such as Microsoft (MSFT.O) trying to go after 
Yahoo (YHOO.O) -- who have cash on their books and see beaten- 
down stock prices," said Matt McCall, president of Penn 
Financial Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HP plans to form a new business group called EDS that will 
be headquartered at EDS's existing office in Plano, Texas, and 
led by EDS CEO Ronald Rittenmeyer, who will report to Hurd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EDS shares ended up 1.08 percent at $24.34 after gaining 
nearly 28 percent on Monday in anticipation of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by Tiffany Wu; Additional reporting by Ritsuko

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financier Carl Icahn launched a campaign to replace Yahoo Inc's board with directors who would reopen talks with Microsoft Corp, saying Yahoo acted "irrationally" in refusing the software company's $47.5 billion bid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icahn harshly criticized Yahoo for the breakdown in talks this month, saying he had accumulated 59 million shares and options in Yahoo and had assembled a 10-member dissident board slate for election at Yahoo's annual meeting on July 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Yahoo's board, Icahn said that directors had "acted irrationally and lost the faith of shareholders and Microsoft. It is obvious that Microsoft's bid of $33 per share is a superior alternative than Yahoo's prospects on a stand alone basis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within hours, Yahoo board Chairman Roy Bostock responded with a letter to Icahn saying the financier's plans were not in the best interests of investors as Yahoo remained "willing to consider any proposal from any party including Microsoft if it offers our stockholders full and certain value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's board has met 20 times in recent months to consider options, including Microsoft's bid. The top managers of Yahoo and Microsoft met face-to-face seven times, the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Icahn left the door open for a settlement instead of a full-out proxy battle where both sides typically spend millions of dollars and unleash a barrage of attacks on each other. Icahn urged Yahoo to "move expeditiously to negotiate a merger with Microsoft, thereby making a proxy fight unnecessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based billionaire's move garnered public support from at least one other large investor. Paulson  Co, a $30 billion hedge fund that raked in billions of dollars betting on the credit meltdown, disclosed on Thursday that it had amassed a 3.4 percent Yahoo stake worth $1.44 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We intend to support the Icahn slate, but sincerely hope Yahoo will negotiate an agreement with Microsoft, thereby making a proxy fight unnecessary," said Paulson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to comment on Icahn's move and reiterated the line Microsoft has used since talks with Yahoo ended. "The company has moved on," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft walked away after negotiating for three months in hopes of clinching a deal to form a counterweight in Web search and online advertising to market leader Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's final $33-per-share offer wasn't enough to sway Yahoo co-founder and Chief Executive Jerry Yang, who wanted $37 a share. The stock traded around $19 prior to Microsoft's bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Yahoo shares closed up 2.3 percent at $27.75, while Microsoft rose 1.7 percent to $30.45, both on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROUGH ROAD FOR YANG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry watchers said Yang faces a rougher road dealing with Icahn, a blunt-spoken financier known for bare-knuckle takeover tactics, than with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Jerry Yang had a tough time dealing with Steve, wait till he meets Carl Icahn," said Colin Gillis, a Canaccord Adams analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bigger threat, said Gillis, will be if Microsoft is unwilling to come back to the table. "It's not clear that he has a buyer. We think that Microsoft has really walked away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others said there is a reasonable chance of revived talks, arguing that the strategic rationale for Microsoft's initial interest in Yahoo hasn't changed in the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proxy contest gives new wind to annoyed shareholders who felt Yang overplayed his hand in turning down Microsoft's $33 per share offer, holding out for a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view this as a very positive development," said a portfolio manager at a large investment firm that holds Yahoo shares. "Getting some new blood on the board would be very beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'WIN-WIN' FOR HOLDERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn said he sought clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to buy up to about $2.5 billion in Yahoo stock. In a regulatory filing, he said he now holds 4.3 percent, including 9.9 million shares and 49 million call options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One analyst said things are now looking up for Yahoo stockholders. Shares jumped from $19.18 prior to Microsoft's initial $31-per-share bid to nearly $30 in early February, only to dive to about $24 when talks collapsed on May 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Barring procedural objections, (Yahoo investors) are now in an almost win-win situation," Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Either the existing Yahoo management team now proposes an alternative -- most likely a paid search outsourcing deal with Google. Or the Icahn slate gets elected and reopens negotiations to sell the company to Microsoft," Lindsay said. "Icahn's bid now forces the issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn's slate of nominees includes himself, Frank Biondi, a former Viacom Inc chief, and Keith Meister, vice chairman of Icahn Enterprises LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks professional basketball team and co-founder of cable network HDNet, is also on Icahn's slate. Cuban struck it rich after he sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for about $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other nominees include Harvard corporate governance expert Lucian Bebchuk; John Chapple, former CEO of Nextel Partners; Adam Dell, a venture capitalist and brother of computer tycoon Michael Dell; Edward Meyer, former CEO of advertising firm Grey Global Group; hedge fund manager Brian Posner; and Robert Shaye, former co-CEO of Time Warner's New Line Cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kenneth Li and Michele Gershberg in New York, Eric Auchard in San Francisco, Svea Herbst-Bayliss in Boston and Diane Bartz in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financier Carl Icahn launched a proxy battle on Thursday to force Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) to reopen buyout talks with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), saying the Yahoo board had acted "irrationally" in refusing its $47.5 billion offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icahn harshly criticized Yahoo for the breakdown in talks, saying he had accumulated 59 million shares and options in Yahoo and had assembled a 10-member dissident board slate for election at Yahoo's annual meeting on July 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an open letter to Yahoo chairman Roy Bostock, Icahn said the board had "acted irrationally and lost the faith of shareholders and Microsoft. It is obvious that Microsoft's bid of $33 per share is a superior alternative than Yahoo's prospects on a stand alone basis." (For text of letter see nN15278966)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the New York-based billionaire left the door open for a settlement instead of a full-blown proxy battle in which both sides typically spend millions of dollars and unleash a barrage of attacks against each other. Icahn urged Yahoo to "move expeditiously to negotiate a merger with Microsoft, thereby making a proxy fight unnecessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn's move garnered public support from at least one other large investor. Paulson  Co., a $30 billion hedge fund that raked in billions of dollars betting on the credit meltdown, disclosed Thursday it had amassed a 3.4 percent Yahoo stake worth $1.44 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We intend to support the Icahn slate, but sincerely hope Yahoo will negotiate an agreement with Microsoft, thereby making a proxy fight unnecessary," said Paulson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw repeated the same line it has used since the talks ended. "The company has moved on," he said. Yahoo declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, Microsoft walked away after negotiating for three months in hopes it could clinch a deal that would catapult the software giant into a top provider of on-line commerce and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's final $33-per-share offer wasn't enough to sway Yahoo co-founder and Chief Executive Jerry Yang, who wanted $37 per share. Shares traded at around $19 prior to the Microsoft bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Yahoo shares closed up 61 cents, or 2.3 percent, at $27.75, while Microsoft stock was up 52 cents, or 1.7 percent, at $30.45, both on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROUGHER ROAD FOR YANG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry watchers said Yang faces a rougher road dealing with Icahn, a blunt-spoken veteran financier known for bare-knuckle takeover tactics, than with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Jerry Yang had a tough time dealing with Steve, wait till he meets Carl Icahn," said Colin Gillis, a Canaccord Adams analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bigger threat, said Gillis, will be if Microsoft is unwilling to come back to the table. "It's not clear that he has a buyer. We think that Microsoft has really walked away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others said there is a reasonable chance of revived talks, arguing that the strategic rationale for Microsoft's initial interest in Yahoo hasn't changed in the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft may still be interested as, in our view, it needs Yahoo to compete against Google Inc (GOOG.O)," UBS technology analysts said in a note.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co expects to liquidate or spin off much of the asset management arm of Bear Stearns Cos Inc after it takes over Bear next month, people familiar with the situation said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM), which during the past year generated more bad news than revenues, has about 400 employees and managed $39 billion in investments at the end of February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told a UBS investor conference he expected the bank would close down "big parts of Bear's asset management business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the sources said, roughly one-third of Bear's asset management employees are expected to get job offers from JPMorgan. Some funds with strong track records will be spun off to their management teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Bear Stearns declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, JPMorgan, which is eager to add on Bear's brokerage business, will shut private client brokerage operations in London and Hong Kong over the next two months. About 10 brokers plus support staff in London and about eight employees in Hong Kong will lose jobs as a result, the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The moves mark a change in strategy since March 16, when JPMorgan cited Bear's "broad asset management capabilities" as a selling point for its hastily arranged fire-sale takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BSAM was at the epicenter of last year's subprime mortgage meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Dimon said JPMorgan expected $300 million in the second-quarter charges "mostly related to closing down big parts of Bear Stearns Asset Management" and from the expense of trying to retain Bear's 470 brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People familiar with the situation said weak performing funds would be shut down and liquidated, while a few would make the move to JPMorgan's $1.3 trillion asset management arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some of the more successful funds, such as Melissa Ko's $1.2 billion Emerging Markets Macro Fund, will likely be spun off to their management teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BSAM has been buffeted by both internal and external events over the past year. First star money manager James O'Shaughnessy left to launch his own firm and took $8.8 billion of BSAM assets with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unit also was at the center of the subprime mortgage crisis that continues to roil financial markets. BSAM managed two risky subprime mortgage funds that struggled before finally going bankrupt last July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fund investors are suing Bear over the meltdown and accuse it of misrepresenting these funds as safe investments. The collapse also tarnished Bear's reputation as a savvy risk manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is eager to take on Bear's private client brokerage business that generated $161 million in revenue and increased client assets during the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A number of brokers have been lured away by rivals. Roughly 400 out of 470 brokers are expected to join JPMorgan, which does not have a retail brokerage business. Almost all of Bear's brokers are in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A. Giannone; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings of Chevron
Corporation (Chevron; NYSE: CVX):

   --Issuer Default Rating (IDR) affirmed at 'AA';

   --Senior unsecured notes affirmed at 'AA';

   --Commercial paper affirmed at 'F1+';

   --Short-term IDR affirmed at 'F1+'

   The Ratings Outlook is Stable.

   Chevron's ratings reflect the diversification benefits of the
integrated oil business model, the size and quality of the company's
large worldwide asset base, its strong cash flow generation
capability, conservative financial management, and shrinking debt
levels. Concerns center primarily on Chevron's low reserve replacement
rates of the last few years.

   Chevron's financial performance remains strong, buoyed by very
robust crude oil prices. In 2007, the company generated EBITDA of
$35.6 billion, cash flow from operations of $24.97 billion, and free
cash flow of $3.51 billion after capex of $16.68 billion and dividends
of $4.79 billion. Chevron also retired approximately $2.6 billion in
net debt in 2007, resulting in total debt/proven reserves of
$0.92/boe, and E debt/proven reserves (excluding bitumen and
allocating 25% of debt to other operations) of just $0.69/boe,
according to Fitch calculations. In Q1, Chevron retired an additional
$438 million in net debt, bringing its total debt balance down to just
$6.79 billion, well below cash and equivalents of $8.2 billion.
Debt-to-capitalization was just 7.9% as of 03/31/2008, and upstream
output was 2.599 million boepd (barrels of oil equivalent per day), a
decline of 1.7% from year-ago levels.

   Like many of its integrated peers, Chevron continues to struggle
with low reserve replacement rates, prompted by resource nationalism,
tougher reserve access terms, and limited drilling success. Chevron's
one and three year all-in reserve replacement rates (including sales
and purchases) were just 41% in 2007 and 88% from 2005-2007,
indicating that the upstream shrank over this time frame. Organic
reserve replacement was significantly lower than this. Factors
contributing to Chevron's low reserve replacement include increased
production, oil-priced linked PSC revisions, and the debooking of
Venezuelan Heavy Oil Reserves, among other things. The company's R/P
(Reserves to Production) ratio fell from 12.4 in 2006 to 11.4 in 2007,
while three year FD costs (as calculated by Fitch) rose to
$18.72/boe from $15.67/boe. Looking forward, Fitch believes that
continued low reserve replacement may increase M risk for Chevron
bondholders down the road, but notes that this is more than offset by
Chevron's very strong cash flows, deep access to capital markets, and
track record of financing deals conservatively. Fitch also notes that
with recent debt reductions, Chevron remains at the upper end of its
current rating category.

   Chevron Corporation is a large integrated oil company with
upstream production of approximately 2.6 million boepd (barrels of oil
equivalent per day) and proven hydrocarbon reserves of 11.21 billion
boe as of year-end 2007. Chevron's downstream portfolio includes
interests in 20 refineries with an aggregate refining capacity of 2.12
million bpd and over 25,000 branded retail stations. Chevron's
chemicals assets are held through CPChem, a joint venture with
ConocoPhillips Corporation (COP) which holds interests in 30 chemical
manufacturing sites. Other assets include midstream assets, power
generation, mining, and energy services.

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
Published ratings, criteria and methodologies are available from this
site, at all times. Fitch's code of conduct, confidentiality,
conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance and other

rating process other than through the medium of its public disclosure.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Paulson, analyst comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Dane Hamilton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 15 (Reuters) - Financier Carl Icahn launched
a proxy battle on Thursday to force Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) to

other large investor. Paulson  Co., a $30 billion hedge fund
that raked in billions of dollars betting on the credit

with Icahn, a blunt-spoken veteran financier known for
bare-knuckle takeover tactics, than with Microsoft CEO Steve
Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Jerry Yang had a tough time dealing with Steve, wait
till he meets Carl Icahn," said Colin Gillis, a Canaccord Adams
analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A bigger threat, said Gillis, will be if Microsoft is
unwilling to come back to the table. "It's not clear that he
has a buyer. We think that Microsoft has really walked away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others said there is a reasonable chance of revived talks,
arguing that the strategic rationale for Microsoft's initial

who felt Yang overplayed his hand in turning down Microsoft's
$33 per share offer, holding out for a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We view this as a very positive development," said a
portfolio manager at a large investment firm that holds Yahoo
shares. "It seems that the initial deal did not get done
because some Yahoo directors got in the way. Getting some new
blood on the board would be very beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'WIN-WIN' FOR HOLDERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn also disclosed in the letter that he sought antitrust
clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to acquire up
to about $2.5 billion worth of Yahoo stock. In a regulatory
filing, he said he now holds a stake of 4.3 percent, including
9.9 million shares and 49 million call options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One analyst said things are now looking up for Yahoo
shareholders. The stock jumped from $19.18 just prior to
Microsoft's initial $31 per-share bid to nearly $30 in early
February, only to dive to around $24 in May when talks
collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Barring procedural objections, (Yahoo shareholders) are
now in an almost win-win situation," Sanford C. Bernstein
analyst Jeffrey Lindsay wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Either the existing Yahoo management team now proposes an
alternative -- most likely a paid search outsourcing deal with
Google. Or the Icahn slate gets elected and reopens
negotiations to sell the company to Microsoft," Lindsay said.
"Icahn's bid now forces the issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn's slate of nominees includes himself, Frank Biondi, a
former Viacom Inc VIAb.N chief, and Keith Meister, vice
chairman of Icahn Enterprises LP IEP.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks professional
basketball team and co-founder of cable network HDNet, is also

&lt;p&gt;  HOUSTON, TX, May 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 A San Francisco jury awarded an $8,000,000 verdict yesterday to a 17-year
employee
of Seariver Maritime, Inc. and its predecessor, Exxon Shipping Co. The
employee developed kidney cancer as a result of the unsafe working
conditions provided by the companies.

    The twelve-person jury found that the plaintiff, Mack Shelby of Rock
Springs,
Georgia, was frequently exposed to benzene and other toxins during the course of
his employment and ultimately developed kidney cancer as a result.  As part
of his job, Mr. Shelby was required to clean tanks, unload cargo and was
repeatedly exposed to unsafe levels of airborne benzene and other toxins. 
The jury found that Exxon was negligent in failing to provide Mr. Shelby
with a safe working environment and that the dangerous conditions of his work on
their vessels caused Mr. Shelby's cancer.

    "This was a tragic incident which could and should have been prevented,"
said lead
counsel, Robert Chaffin. "This man's life and the lives of his family have
been irrevocably altered for the worse due to the irresponsible actions of the
defendant.  We can only hope that the award from the jury will go a long way
in easing some of their suffering."

    The jury reached a verdict after only one full day of deliberations.

    As compensation for his injuries, the jury awarded Mr. Shelby $350,000 for
lost future earnings, $1,125,000 for pain, suffering, mental anguish and loss
of enjoyment of life in the past and $6,525,000 for pain, suffering, mental
anguish
and loss of enjoyment of life in the future.

    Mr. Shelby was represented by lead counsel, Robert A. Chaffin of the firm
Chaffin &amp; Stiles, Houston, Texas; S. Reed Morgan of the Law Offices of S.
Reed Morgan, Comfort, Texas; and Lyle Cavin of the Law Offices of Lyle C.
Cavin, Jr., Oakland, California, served as co-counsel in the trial of this
case.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced a research breakthrough in photovoltaics
technology that could significantly reduce the cost of harnessing the Sun's
power for electricity.

    By mimicking the antics of a child using a magnifying glass to burn a leaf
or
a camper to start a fire, IBM scientists are using a large lens to
concentrate the Sun's power, capturing a record 230 watts onto a
centimetersquare solar cell, in a technology known as concentrator
photovoltaics, or
CPV. That energy is then converted into 70 watts of usable electrical power,
about
five times the electrical power density generated by typical cells using CPV
technology in solar farms.

    If it can overcome additional challenges to move this project from the lab
to
the fab, IBM believes it can significantly reduce the cost of a typical CPV
based
system. By using a much lower number of photovoltaic cells in a solar farm
and concentrating more light onto each cell using larger lenses, IBM's system
enables a significant cost advantage in terms of a lesser number of total
components.

    For instance, by moving from a 200 sun system ("one sun" is a measurement
equal to
the solar power incident at noon on a clear summer day), where about 20 watts
per square centimeter of power is concentrated onto the cell, to the IBM Lab
results of a 2300 sun system, where approximately 230 watts per square
centimeter are concentrated onto the cell system, the IBM system cuts the
number of photovoltaic cells and other components by a factor of 10.

    "We believe IBM can bring unique skills from our vast experience in
semiconductors and nanotechnology to the important field of alternative energy
research," said Dr. Supratik Guha, the scientist leading photovoltaics
activities
at IBM Research. "This is one of many exploratory research projects incubating
in our
labs where we can drive big change for an entire industry while advancing the
basic underlying science of solar cell technology."

    The trick lies in IBM's ability to cool the tiny solar cell. Concentrating
the
equivalent of 2000 suns on such a small area generates enough heat to melt
stainless steel, something the researchers experienced first hand in their
experiments. But by borrowing innovations from its own R in cooling computer
chips, the team was able to cool the solar cell from greater than 1600 degrees
Celsius to just 85 degrees Celsius.

    The initial results of this project will be presented at the 33rd IEEE
Photovoltaic Specialists conference today, where the IBM researchers will
detail how their liquid metal cooling interface is able to transfer heat from
the solar cell to a copper cooling plate much more efficiently than anything
else available today.

    The IBM research team developed a system that achieved breakthrough
resultsby coupling a commercial solar cell to an advanced IBM liquid metal
thermalcooling system using methods developed for the microprocessor industry.

    Specifically, the IBM team used a very thin layer of a liquid metal made
ofa gallium and indium compound that they applied between the chip and a
cooling block. Such layers, called thermal interface layers, transfer the
heat from the chip to the cooling block so that the chip temperature can
bekept low. The IBM liquid metal solution offers the best thermal
performanceavailable today, at low costs, and the technology was successfully
developed by IBM to
cool high power computer chips earlier.

    While concentrator-based photovoltaics technologies have been around since
the
1970s, they have received renewed interest in recent times. With very high
concentrations, they have the potential to offer the lowest-cost solar
electricity for large-scale power generation, provided the temperature of the
cells can be kept low, and cheap and efficient optics can be developed for
concentrating the light to very high levels.

    IBM is exploring four main areas of photovoltaic research: using current
technologies to develop cheaper and more efficient silicon solar cells,
developing new solution processed thin film photovoltaic devices, concentrator
photovoltaics, and future generation photovoltaic architectures based upon
nanostructures such as semiconductor quantum dots and nanowires.

    The goal of the projects is to develop efficient photovoltaic structures
that would
reduce the cost, minimize the complexity, and improve the flexibility of
producing solar electric power.

    In addition to the photovoltaic research announced today, IBM is focused
onseveral areas related to energy and the environment, including energy
efficient
technology and services, carbon management, advanced water management,
intelligent utility networks and intelligent transportation systems. With
decades of
leadership in environmental stewardship, proven ability to solve complex
challenges and unparalleled global reach, IBM is uniquely positioned to
increase the efficiency of today's systems and enable our clients' "green"
strategies.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 15 (Reuters) - Shareholder advisory service
Proxy Governance Inc has joined the other two major proxy
advisory firms in recommending that Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
shareholders vote to urge the company to split its chairman and
chief executive positions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Rex Tillerson currently holds both jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil appears to need a vision for the future that
transcends engineering excellence, conservative accounting,
rigorous cost discipline and a tough 'my way or the highway"
leadership style,'" Proxy Governance said in a report issued on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group criticized the company's current strategy, saying
that Exxon Mobil's conservative drilling plans and huge share
buybacks amount to a slow liquidation of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given these circumstances, and the compelling need for
good lines of communication between the board of directors and
major shareholders at this important juncture in the company's
history, we believe that an independent chair would be
beneficial to Exxon Mobil at this time," Proxy Governance
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholder advisers ISS and Glass Lewis have also backed
the proposal to split the positions, which has drawn media
attention, as many members of the Rockefeller family have
publicly supported the move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John D. Rockefeller founded Standard Oil Co in 1870, and it
became a precursor to Exxon Mobil.

&lt;p&gt;IdentityTruth Reaches out to Pfizer Employees That Were Impacted by the May 12 Data Breach Resulting from a Stolen Laptop

WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Preliminary news reports indicate that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer
suffered a data breach on May 12 involving 13,000 employee records.
The breach occurred when a laptop storing the information was stolen.
While it appears that Social Security numbers were not involved,
names, home addresses, telephone numbers, employee ID numbers, job
titles and salary information may have been compromised in this
breach.

   IdentityTruth is offering a one-month special subscription rate of
$1 to the more than 13,000 employees reportedly impacted by the
breach. IdentityTruth's unique service provides more complete
protection than other, credit-based services offering simple fraud
alerts. IdentityTruth includes all of these basic protections, but
goes beyond credit monitoring and fraud alerts to provide the most
comprehensive protection available in the market--all backed by a $2
million service guarantee.

   Pfizer has reported a number of breaches over the past year,
including an incident earlier this year which also affected
employees. According to news sources, Pfizer has sent more than 65,000
data breach notifications over the past twelve months. The recent
spate of data breaches suffered by Pfizer, a technology leader
pioneering new solutions in medicine, is a reminder that even the
world's most advanced institutions are vulnerable.

   Because credit monitoring alone does not help to prevent identity
theft, IdentityTruth is reaching out to affected employees to offer
special pricing on its comprehensive identity theft prevention
technology. IdentityTruth detects real-time suspicious activities,
fraud schemes, credit requests and related data breaches.
IdentityTruth uses this information to build an individual identity
profile which offers a complete picture of a consumer's identity
risk--from credit information to SSN tracking and more.

   "Even when great care is taken with personal data, unexpected
events like having a laptop stolen can still put your information at
risk," said Steven Domenikos, CEO of IdentityTruth. "There are
inevitable risks of exposure with data stored everywhere -- at work,
in hospital files, academic records, retail transactions-- but people
can limit the impact that those risks can cause with proactive,
comprehensive management services like those provided by
IdentityTruth."

   IdentityTruth's comprehensive identity theft prevention service:

   --  Reports suspicious events in the past;

   --  Ensures that free fraud alerts are properly activated on the
        consumer's credit profile with the three credit bureaus;

   --  Helps to predict possible fraud actions that could impact the
        individual in the future;

   --  Delivers ongoing alerts about any changes to the individual's
        credit and identity profile; and

   --  Reports on any related regionalized data breach that could
        have impacted the individual's identity.

   IdentityTruth not only provides the Earliest Possible
Notification(TM), but it also provides the most complete identity
theft prevention service available today, including all of the
foregoing capabilities, for the same price as other companies charge
for fraud alerts alone.

   Individuals who believe their information may have been
compromised as part of the Pfizer employee data breach are invited to
contact IdentityTruth at 800-684-1336. IdentityTruth's service will be
offered to any impacted employees for $1 for the first month's
service. For more information go to

&lt;p&gt;IdentityTruth Reaches out to Pfizer Employees That Were Impacted by the May 12 Data Breech Resulting from a Stolen Laptop

WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Preliminary news reports indicate that pharmaceutical giant Pfizer
suffered a data breach on May 12 involving 13,000 employee records.
The breach occurred when a laptop storing the information was stolen.
While it appears that Social Security numbers were not involved,
names, home addresses, telephone numbers, employee ID numbers, job
titles and salary information may have been compromised in this
breach.

   IdentityTruth is offering a one-month special subscription rate of
$1 to the more than 13,000 employees reportedly impacted by the
breach. IdentityTruth's unique service provides more complete
protection than other, credit-based services offering simple fraud
alerts. IdentityTruth includes all of these basic protections, but
goes beyond credit monitoring and fraud alerts to provide the most
comprehensive protection available in the market--all backed by a $2
million service guarantee.

   Pfizer has reported a number of breaches over the past year,
including an incident earlier this year which also affected
employees. According to news sources, Pfizer has sent more than 65,000
data breach notifications over the past twelve months. The recent
spate of data breaches suffered by Pfizer, a technology leader
pioneering new solutions in medicine, is a reminder that even the
world's most advanced institutions are vulnerable.

   Because credit monitoring alone does not help to prevent identity
theft, IdentityTruth is reaching out to affected employees to offer
special pricing on its comprehensive identity theft prevention
technology. IdentityTruth detects real-time suspicious activities,
fraud schemes, credit requests and related data breaches.
IdentityTruth uses this information to build an individual identity
profile which offers a complete picture of a consumer's identity
risk--from credit information to SSN tracking and more.

   "Even when great care is taken with personal data, unexpected
events like having a laptop stolen can still put your information at
risk," said Steven Domenikos, CEO of IdentityTruth. "There are
inevitable risks of exposure with data stored everywhere -- at work,
in hospital files, academic records, retail transactions-- but people
can limit the impact that those risks can cause with proactive,
comprehensive management services like those provided by
IdentityTruth."

   IdentityTruth's comprehensive identity theft prevention service:

   --  Reports suspicious events in the past;

   --  Ensures that free fraud alerts are properly activated on the
        consumer's credit profile with the three credit bureaus;

   --  Helps to predict possible fraud actions that could impact the
        individual in the future;

   --  Delivers ongoing alerts about any changes to the individual's
        credit and identity profile; and

   --  Reports on any related regionalized data breach that could
        have impacted the individual's identity.

   IdentityTruth not only provides the Earliest Possible
Notification(TM), but it also provides the most complete identity
theft prevention service available today, including all of the
foregoing capabilities, for the same price as other companies charge
for fraud alerts alone.

   Individuals who believe their information may have been
compromised as part of the Pfizer employee data breach are invited to
contact IdentityTruth at 800-684-1336. IdentityTruth's service will be
offered to any impacted employees for $1 for the first month's
service. For more information go to

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Microsoft spokesman, antitrust lawyer, further analyst
comment, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Dane Hamilton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 15 (Reuters) - Financier Carl Icahn on
Thursday launched a proxy battle to force Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) to
reopen buyout talks with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), saying the
Yahoo board had acted "irrationally" in refusing its $47.5
billion offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn harshly criticized Yahoo for the breakdown in talks,
and said he had accumulated 59 million shares and options in
Yahoo and assembled a 10-member dissident board slate for
election at Yahoo's annual meeting on July 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The board of directors of Yahoo has acted irrationally and
lost the faith of shareholders and Microsoft," Icahn wrote in
an open letter to Roy Bostock, Yahoo's chairman. "It is obvious
that Microsoft's bid of $33 per share is a superior alternative
than Yahoo's prospects on a stand alone basis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For text of letter see [nN15278966])&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the New York-based billionaire left the door open for a
settlement instead of a full-blown proxy battle, where both
sides typically spend millions of dollars and unleash a barrage
of negative charges against each other. He urged Yahoo to "move
expeditiously to negotiate a merger with Microsoft, thereby
making a proxy fight unnecessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move came just two weeks after Microsoft walked away
from three-month talks to buy Yahoo in a bid to catapult it
into a top provider of on-line commerce and services. But
Microsoft's final $33-per-share offer wasn't enough to sway
Yahoo CEO and co-founder Jerry Yang, who wanted $37 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares initially moved up on the news, but were down
6 cents, or 0.2 percent, to $27.08 in afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One analyst said Yang will face a rougher road dealing with
Icahn, a blunt-spoken veteran financier known for bare-knuckle
takeover tactics, than Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Jerry Yang had a tough time dealing with Steve, wait
till he meets Carl Icahn," said Colin Gillis, a Canaccord Adams
analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HAS MICROSOFT MOVED ON?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A bigger threat, said Gillis, is whether Microsoft is
willing to come back to the table. "It's not clear that he has
a buyer. We think that Microsoft has really walked away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others said there is a reasonable chance of revived talks,
saying the strategic rationale for Microsoft's initial interest
in Yahoo hasn't changed in the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft may still be interested as, in our view, it
needs Yahoo to compete against Google (GOOG.O)," said UBS
technology analysts in a note. "We continue to think a deal
could be reached, with the value in the $34 to $35 range."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw was noncommittal: "Right now
we don't have very much to say. We will see how it goes. The
company has moved on." Yahoo declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Others said the proxy contest gives new wind to existing
shareholder pressure to revive talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We view this is a very positive development," said a
portfolio manager at a large investment firm that holds Yahoo
shares. "It seems that the initial deal did not get done
because some Yahoo directors got in the way. Getting some new
blood on the board would be very beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICAHN'S SLATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn's slate of nominees includes himself, Frank Biondi, a
former Viacom Inc VIAb.N chief, and Keith Meister, vice
chairman of Icahn Enterprises IEP.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mark Cuban, Dallas Mavericks basketball team owner and
co-founder of cable network HDNet is also on Icahn's slate.
Cuban is also familiar with Yahoo's negotiating style after he
sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for about $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other nominees include Lucian Bebchuk, professor of law,
economics and finance at Harvard Law School; John Chapple,
president of Hawkeye Investments; and telecoms industry veteran
and former chief executive of Nextel Partners; Adam Dell,
managing partner of Impact Venture Partners; Edward Meyer, CEO
of Ocean Road Advisors and former CEO of advertising firm Grey
Global Group; Brian Posner, a former CEO of ClearBridge
Advisors LLC; and Robert Shaye, the former co-CEO of Time
Warner Inc's (TWX.N) New Line Cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn also disclosed in the letter that he sought antitrust
clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to acquire up
to about $2.5 billion worth of Yahoo stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evan Stewart, an antitrust lawyer with Zuckerman Spaeder
LLP, said he does not anticipate any antitrust issues for the
shares purchase and the proxy battle adds to existing
shareholder pressure. "The shareholder pressure was going to
happen," said Stewart. "That it's someone as well-resourced and
well-connected as Icahn makes it newsworthy."

   The $19.1 million class P, $3.2 million class Q, $9.5 million
class T and $25.4 class NR are not rated by Fitch.

   The ratings affirmations are the result of stable performance
since issuance. As of the April 2008 remittance, the transaction has
paid down 0.1% to $2.541 billion from $2.543 billion at issuance.

   Fitch has identified three loans of concern (1.8%), one of which
is specially serviced (0.4%). The specially serviced asset is a
multifamily facility located in Houston, TX. The loan transferred to
special servicing in March 2008 for monetary default, however, the
loan is now current. No losses are anticipated at this time.

   Fitch reviewed the most recent servicer provided operating
statement analysis reports for the two shadow rated loans (2.4%).
Based on the improving performance of both properties since issuance,
the loans maintain their investment grade shadow ratings.

   The largest shadow rated loan (1.6%) is secured by the 379 room
Portola Plaza Hotel in Monterey, CA. As of year-end (YE) 2007, the
average daily rate (ADR) and revenue per available room (RevPAR) have
increased to $191 and $138, respectively, from $180 and $126,
respectively, at issuance.

   The second shadow rated loan (0.8%) is secured by the Palace
Theater located at 1564 Broadway in Manhattan in addition to the air
rights above the theater.

&lt;p&gt;  MCLEAN, VA, May 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 "The Chinese Government continues to make changes to visa application rules,
which are now causing an increase in processing delays. Because of these
procedural changes, visitors to the 2008 Olympics and business travelers are
urged to use a professional expediting service," said Steve Diehl, CIBT, Inc.,
Vice
President.  CIBT, Inc. (http://www.cibt.com) is the world's largest visa and
passport expediter.

    "Don't try to send applications directly to the Chinese Embassy or its
consulates," suggested Mr. Diehl. "Travelers who go to the consulates themselves
to
obtain their visas on their own may not have the correct supporting materials
and
their applications could be rejected  -- resulting in multiple return trips.  
Sending your application by mail is even riskier. Until recently, a Chinese
visa was valid for one year and permitted multiple entries. Now, people need
official invitations, flight and hotel confirmation, and in some cases bank
statements and other documents to apply for a visa," Mr. Diehl continued.

    "People often travel with friends from other parts of the country and
sharevisa processing information," he said. "However, what might be acceptable
at the
Chinese Consulate in San Francisco may not work in New York or Miami. 
Finally, CIBT provides free telephone support 12 hours a day, Monday through
Friday to assist concerned travelers to China.  You may have difficulty
reaching a live person if you call any of the Chinese Consulates since they are
very
busy right now given the high volume of seasonal and Olympics related
applications and the recent earthquake."

    Mr. Diehl concluded, "CIBT has developed a unique, comprehensive database
containing all requirements necessary to enter China and over 180 other
countries. Every element is updated in real-time allowing us to
accommodateand adapt to the new Chinese rules with ease, ensuring that our
clients always
receive the most current visa application information. We continually
communicate the latest changes with our clients so that no unpleasant
surprises spoil once-in-a-lifetime trips like the Olympics. Travelers should
think
of CIBT's services as 'trip insurance.'  Our clients have spent thousands of
dollars on their trips to China and for a nominal fee, we can help to ensure
they
are able to travel successfully and on time," he said.

    In addition to working with individual travelers, CIBT also delivers
highlycustomized solutions for groups ranging from 25 to as many as 1500 people.
Special visa kits include everything needed to travel to China, from
application forms and instructions, to cell phone rental information and
important U.S. Embassy contact information.

    About CIBT, Inc.

    CIBT, Inc. and its subsidiaries provide comprehensive visa and passport
requirements and support as well as other international document
processingon behalf of travel management companies, corporations, government
agencies, tour
operators, cruise lines, airlines, and international relief organizations. The
Company's broad coverage across the United States, Canada, Western Europe and
Australia enables it to provide prompt, secure travel document processing. CIBT

&lt;p&gt;  SEATTLE, WA, May 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 As concerns of a global hunger crises mount, IBM (NYSE: IBM) and researchers at
the University of Washington today launched a new program to develop stronger
strains of rice that could produce crops with larger and more nutritious yields.

    With the processing power of 167 teraflops, equivalent to the world's Top
3supercomputer, IBM's World Community Grid will harness the unused and donated
power from nearly one million individual PCs in a new initiative --
"Nutritious Rice for the World" project -- that will study rice at the atomic
level and then combine it with traditional cross breeding techniques used by
farmers
throughout history.

    The project can be completed in less than two years as compared to over
200years using more conventional computer systems.

    "The world is experiencing three simultaneous revolutions: in molecular
biology and
genetics; in computational power and storage capacity; and in
communications.  The computational revolution allows scientists around the
world to tackle almost unimaginably complex problems as a community, and
inreal-time," said Director General Robert Zeigler, of the International
RiceResearch Institute based in the Philippines.  "While there are no silver
bullets, rice production can be revitalized with the help of new
technologies.  The world community must invest now and for a long time to
come."

    World Community Grid will run a three-dimensional modeling program created
by
computational biologists at the University of Washington to study the
structures of the proteins that make up the building blocks of rice.
Understanding the structure is necessary to identify the function of those
proteins and to enable researchers to identify which ones could help produce
more rice grains, ward off pests, resist disease or hold more nutrients.  In
the end, this project will create the largest and most comprehensive map of
rice proteins and their related functions, helping agriculturalists and farmers
pinpoint which plants should be selected for cross-breeding to cultivate
better crops.

    "The issue is that there are between 30,000 and 60,000 different protein
structures to study," said Principal Investigator, Dr.  Ram Samudrala, Associate
Professor in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Washington.
 "Using traditional experimental approaches in the laboratory to identify
detailed
structure and function of critical proteins would take decades. Running our
software program on World Community Grid will shorten the time from 200 years to
less than 2 years."

    Ultimately, this project, jumpstarted by a $2 million grant from the
National
Science Foundation, could enable rice-producing countries to become better
adapted to future climate changes because they can quickly find the right plants
for cross breeding, and create "super hybrids" that are more resistant to
changing weather patterns.

    This research is also important in the U.S. and other countries because
theknowledge gained creating the 3D models can be easily transferred to other
cereal crops such as corn, wheat, and barley.

    World Community Grid is fast approaching its own milestone, expecting to hit
next week, as the grid reaches one million registered computers helping to
advance scientific research. Each week, thousands of people sign on to this
project that has significantly advanced several research projects on
diseases like cancer and AIDS. The nutritious rice project is the latest
toutilize the grid, and could have a major impact on global health.

    "This project could ultimately help farmers around the world plant better
crops
and stave off hunger for some," said Stanley Litow, Vice President of
Corporate Citizenship and Corporate Affairs and President of the IBM
International Foundation.  "People who want to be a part of something big can
take a small step today by donating their unused computer time. Volunteers can
personally effect how quickly this research is completed and can make a
significant difference for farmers and people in great need."

    Anyone with a computer and Internet access can be a part of the solution. To
donate
unused computer time, individuals register on www.worldcommunitygrid.org and
install a free, small, secure software program onto their computers.  When
computers are idle, data is requested from World Community Grid's server.  These
computers then perform the computations, and send the results back to the
server, prompting it for a new piece of work.  A screen saver will tell
individuals when their computers are being used.

    World Community Grid, the largest public humanitarian grid in existence, has
380,000-plus members who represent more than 200 countries and links to
nearly one million computers. It is the volunteers that help make the
difference because as each one shares their computer time, scientists are
able to conduct their research faster.   For example, the AfricanClimate@Home
project just completed its data collection, and research analysis will now
begin.

    "The project could not have been completed in such quick time without the
help of World Community Grid. The results will help us develop a better
understanding of how land surface changes over South Africa affect the
climate, as well as paving the way for later investigations of other aspects of
climate," said Mark Tadross, Principal Investigator, University of Cape Town,
South
Africa.

    In addition, the Cancer Institute of New Jersey earned a $2.5 million
research
grant from the National Institute of Health in 2007 based on the Help Defeat
Cancer project that ran on World Community Grid.  The FightAIDS@Home project
completed the equivalent of five years of HIV/AIDS research in just six months. 
Five other projects are now running on World Community Grid, and additional
projects are in the pipeline.

    World Community Grid is fast approaching its own milestone, expecting to hit
next week, as the grid reaches one million registered computers helping to
advance scientific research. Each week, thousands of people sign on to this
project that has significantly advanced several research projects on
diseases like cancer and AIDS. The nutritious rice project is the latest
toutilize the grid, and could have a major impact on global health.

    "This project could ultimately help farmers around the world plant better
crops
and stave off hunger for some," said Stanley Litow, Vice President of
Corporate Citizenship and Corporate Affairs and President of the IBM
International Foundation.  "People who want to be a part of something big can
take a small step today by donating their unused computer time. Volunteers can
personally effect how quickly this research is completed and can make a
significant difference for farmers and people in great need."

    Anyone with a computer and Internet access can be a part of the solution. To
donate
unused computer time, individuals register on www.worldcommunitygrid.org and
install a free, small, secure software program onto their computers.  When
computers are idle, data is requested from World Community Grid's server.  These
computers then perform the computations, and send the results back to the
server, prompting it for a new piece of work.  A screen saver will tell
individuals when their computers are being used.

    World Community Grid, the largest public humanitarian grid in existence, has
380,000-plus members who represent more than 200 countries and links to
nearly one million computers. It is the volunteers that help make the
difference because as each one shares their computer time, scientists are
able to conduct their research faster.   For example, the AfricanClimate@Home
project just completed its data collection, and research analysis will now
begin.

    "The project could not have been completed in such quick time without the
help of World Community Grid. The results will help us develop a better
understanding of how land surface changes over South Africa affect the
climate, as well as paving the way for later investigations of other aspects of
climate," said Mark Tadross, Principal Investigator, University of Cape Town,
South
Africa.

    In addition, the Cancer Institute of New Jersey earned a $2.5 million
research
grant from the National Institute of Health in 2007 based on the Help Defeat
Cancer project that ran on World Community Grid.  The FightAIDS@Home project
completed the equivalent of five years of HIV/AIDS research in just six months. 
Five other projects are now running on World Community Grid, and additional
projects are in the pipeline.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON May 15 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) is scheduled
to load its first shipment of Angola's Saxi crude blend in July,
traders said on Thursday, as production in the West African
country continues to rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angolan export programmes showed the first cargo of Saxi
crude to be loaded on July 4-5, traders said. A total of three
950,000-barrel cargoes were scheduled to load in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon was not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's website said production at the Saxi offshore
oilfield would begin in June with peak production of around
100,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The grade is marketed as a medium sweet crude with an API
gravity of 32.83 degrees and a sulphur content of 0.32 percent,
according to its assay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon holds a 40 percent equity share in the oilfield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angola's production has risen gradually for the past few
years as new offshore oilfields come online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angola last month overtook Nigeria as Africa's largest oil
producer, pumping 1.873 million barrels per day, OPEC said
earlier on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Randy Fabi)

&lt;p&gt;Aplana Software Has Developed a New Web-Site for Russian TV Channel Sport Using Microsoft Silverlight Technology

MOSCOW--(Business Wire)--
Aplana Software, a Moscow based software services company and a
member of I.T.Co Group, has successfully developed a new interactive
web-site for Russian TV Channel 'Sport' (www.sportbox.ru) to broadcast
sport events for internet users. The site was developed with the use
of Microsoft Silverlight - a recently developed technology for
delivering next generation media experiences and rich interactive
applications for the Web.

   Sport is an all-Russia TV channel owned by VGTRK Media Corporation
- the Russian TV and radio broadcasting company - with an audience of
over 62 million people viewing sports events and competitions.

recordings on the video archive page, as well as in two full screen
display modes: full screen display of the list of transmissions; and

   Aplana specialists greatly enhanced the user interface to make
watching sports events more engaging and comfortable, resulting in an
easier-to-use service. "Microsoft Silverlight is a great technology
for development of rich interactive applications for the Web. The
Video-catalog demonstrates the advantages of this technology,
especially as a viewer can watch an interesting moment as many times
as you wish. Besides, it provides an opportunity to watch and make
comments, examine statistics and many other services, which is one of
the top factors of Internet-TV development,- said Anatoly Gaidai,
technical director of Aplana Software.

   "Based on the ever-increasing demands of our users, we chose
Microsoft Silverlight as a technological basis for a new generation of
Internet broadcasting with unique viewing perspectives and media
content management", said Oleg Dyagterev, Sportbox.ru Technical
Manager.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the expansion of its Grow Your Business with
IBM
Software tool to enable Business Partners to identify new growth opportunities
by
recommending cross-brand sales scenarios which now include products from the
IBM Express Advantage and mid-market offerings portfolio. In addition, at no
charge, IBM is now offering a Web syndication service that will simplify how
Business Partners gain information on IBM's latest innovations and complement
their marketing strategies.

    The enhanced tool supports cost-effective growth by automatically
recommending IBM
cross-sell software scenarios that utilize Business Partners' existing areas of
expertise and available skills.  Grow Your Business with IBM Software now
includes over 50 new products selected from the IBM Express Advantage and
mid-market portfolios, each designed and packaged to meet the price point,
ease of use and maintenance, configuration and scalability requirements of
mid-market
customers. With the tool, Business Partners can plan for profitable growth in
themid-market with links to IBM cross-brand small and medium business marketing
programs, product sales and marketing dashboards, Express Advantage programs,
and
ROI analysis for mid-market products.

    For example, a Business Partner who has developed a strong install base
selling IBM database software can now use the tool to find recommendations for
Tivoli
Express software offerings that deliver additional security and database
backup capabilities for their mid-sized customers. The new version of Grow Your
Business with IBM Software also helps Business Partners develop new
opportunities
with IBM hardware customers, with over 29 software cross-sell software
scenarios for IBM BladeCenter, System Storage, System x, System i and System p
platforms.

    "Grow Your Business with IBM Software is a valuable tool for our
mid-marketresellers as it enables them to dig deeper into IBM's portfolio of
productsand determine which solutions will best meet the needs of their
customers,"said Mark Taylor, VP and General Manager, Arrow ECS Midmarket Group.
"As
the tool continues to evolve and incorporate new sales scenarios, it enhances
how we work with our resellers and help them build their revenue stream."

    With the addition of the Express Advantage products, the tool now includes
128
products and more than 300 sales scenarios for mid-market and enterprise
Partners.

    "IBM continues to differentiate itself through new and easy-to-use tools
that
simplify how Business Partners can better meet the needs of their clients and
help them generate leads," said Shaun Jones, Vice President Worldwide Channel
and
General Business Marketing. "With these resources, we are empowering our
Business Partners to grow their businesses and succeed in the marketplace."

    IBM has also introduced a new benefit for Business Partners to syndicate
information from ibm.com directly to their Web sites at no cost. This solution
opens an automated pipeline between IBM's Web site and Business Partners' Web
sites, through which they can tap into IBM's Web marketing content about
offerings.
 As IBM updates and changes information on its site, the partner's Web site
is synchronized to do the same.

    Nearly 90 percent of IT decision makers use search engines to locate
products,
services and solution providers that will best meet their needs. In many cases,
those decision makers come across Web sites with out-of-date information.
Through
this syndication service, IBM Business Partners can leverage IBM's marketing
assets, such as briefs, brochures, data sheets, white papers, and videos,
transforming their Web sites into powerful sales and marketing tools.

    IBM's Web site enables Business Partners to educate customers on how its
products differ from the competition, highlighting those attributes and
features that demonstrate why a particular product or service offers the
greatest value for the customer.  Having a Web site with current product
information is critical to generating new leads and helping to drive business.

    "The free syndication of information from IBM's Web site has acted as an
online sales force for us by keeping our site updated with new product
announcements and information," said David Sylvestre, Vice President of
Marketing for Lighthouse Computer Services, Inc. "The ability to have our Web
site
automaticallypopulated with information on IBM's latest innovations has
complimented
ourmarketing initiatives around key software, hardware and services offerings
for our
customers."

    To complement IBM's content, Business Partners can take advantage of a
search engine optimization benefit, designed to analyze and enhance their Web
assets while improving the performance of their Web sites in online searches.
This benefit provides a detailed assessment of how well the Business
Partner's Web site performs in online searches and recommendations to help drive
increased traffic from search engines to their Web site. Business Partners will
also learn how to identify and capture prospects who visit their Web site
from a search engine.

    In addition, IBM is offering a discount for Business Partners that take
advantage of this new offering. The benefit of search engine optimization is
offered
at a 60% savings over the regular rate. It includes a one hour personalized
consultation with experts from Global Strategies International (GSI), a vendor
that
provides this service for large enterprise companies.

    These tools are now available for IBM Business Partners. For more

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 15 (Reuters) - Carl Icahn has launched a
proxy battle to force Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) to reopen buyout talks
with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), the billionaire investor said in
a letter to the Internet company on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Icahn has formed a 10-member rival slate for Yahoo's board
to push the company to accept Microsoft's bid of $33 per share,
or $47.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also disclosed in the letter to Yahoo Chairman Roy
Bostock that he had acquired 59 million shares and had sought
antitrust clearance from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to
acquire up to about $2.5 billion worth of Yahoo Stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is clear to me that the board of directors of Yahoo has
acted irrationally and lost the faith of shareholders and
Microsoft," Icahn wrote.

&lt;p&gt;  KORTRIJK, BELGIUM, May 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Belgian-based Barco (Euronext Brussels: BAR), a global technology company that
designs and develops visualization products, including the special video and

    The new CLM Lease Offering, backed by IBM Global Financing gives companies
the
opportunity to access Barco's CLM line of projectors, designed and built
specifically for the demanding rental and staging market.

    "For years, large concert promoters and event planners have relied on the
Barco name to bring high-tech visualization and lighting technology to the
stage," said Paul Foulkes, vice president, Vendor Financing, IGF. "Thanks to
this
leasing program, smaller rental companies will also get the chance to acquire
Barco'sstate-of-the-art projection technology. We are delighted to incorporate a
financing program with Barco to support those companies as they grow their
business."

    The offering provides an easy and affordable monthly payments structure
forthe state of the art projector line, including the CLM HD8, a compact
8,500lumen Digital Light Processing (DLP) projector with full high definition
(1,920 x
1,080) resolution and the CLM R10+, a 10,000 lumen DLP projector that delivers a
brilliant, sharp and consistent image.

    "Barco has specifically designed this program with IBM Global Financing to
get sophisticated DLP and high definition projector technology into the hands
of rental and staging companies in the small to mid-market arena," said Stephan
Paridaen, President of Barco's Media &amp; Entertainment division. "While we are
proud
to see our brand featured at many of the larger headliner concerts around the
world, there is a lot of demand too for our technology at smaller corporate
events and conferences."

    The Barco-IBM Global Financing program will be rolled out, for credit
qualified
customers initially, in Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain,
Switzerland, the United Kingdom, Canada and the United States. Customers
interested in the CLM Lease Offering can choose from special lease packages
developed for the CLM HD8 and R10+ mid-venue projectors which can include lens

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The price of gasoline in the United States is at or near the level where people begin to curb their usage, Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) chief executive Rex Tillerson told NBC's "Today" program on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We're already seeing some demand slackening in gasoline demand in terms of miles driven," Tillerson said. "So I think we're very near, if we're not already at, the price where people clearly are altering their daily behavior."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added, "They're making different choices, they're thinking about how they're using this gasoline, the energy that's available to them. And that's a good thing because that's about all that consumers can do, is find ways to be more efficient, economize their consumption."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether gasoline prices could fall dramatically if consumption drops considerably, Tillerson said that had happened in the past during previous price corrections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It could be gradual, it could be very dramatic," he said of such a drop. "And if you look back in the past history when we've had rapid run-ups in prices like we've had, oftentimes the corrections are fairly dramatic."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by David Alexander; Editing by John Picinich)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - General Electric Co (GE.N) is looking to sell its appliance unit in an auction that could bring in $5 billion to $8 billion, The Wall Street Journal reported on its Web site on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;GE, the second-largest U.S. company by market capitalization, had no immediate comment on the report, said spokesman Jeff DeMarrais.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to advise on a possible sale, the Journal said. Goldman officials declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While GE's appliance unit, which makes refrigerators, stoves and other so-called "white goods," is one of its most visible to consumers, the business made up about 4 percent of the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company's $173 billion in revenue last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it is dear to some of the Fairfield, Connecticut-based company's employees and retirees, one of whom pleaded with Chief Executive Jeffrey Immelt at the shareholders' meeting last month not to sell the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Immelt, GE has worked to shed slower-growth businesses including the company's plastics unit, where Immelt spent the early part of his career. It sold that business, last year to Riyadh-based chemicals company Saudi Basic Industries Corp 2010.SE in an $11.6 billion deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the pressure has ramped up since the company stunned Wall Street last month with an unexpected drop in quarterly profit. That news punished GE's shares, which are now down about 12 percent for the year, a far deeper decline than the 3 percent slide of the blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, of which GE is a component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GE has also put its U.S. private label credit card and Japanese consumer lending units on the block.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Scott Malone in Boston, additional reporting by Megan Davies in New York; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney Interactive Studios Launches DGamer Community With Disney/Walden Media's The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian on Nintendo DS(TM)

   Brand New Online Network Enables Disney Gamers and Narnia Fans to
                Communicate via Nintendo DS and Online

      Prince Caspian Game to Be Available on Multiple Video Game
                               Platforms
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Interactive Studios today announced the availability of
DGamer in North America for Nintendo DS(TM) users in conjunction with
the launch of the Nintendo DS version of Disney/Walden Media's The
Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian. DGamer from Disney is the
first-of-its-kind online community developed exclusively for Disney
video gamers. Players can now use their Nintendo DS handhelds to
interact with each other while on the go via the Nintendo Wi-Fi
Connection and online through the DGamer Web site (www.DGamer.com).
The integrated service is scheduled to be included at no additional
cost on subsequent Nintendo DS titles from Disney. DGamer is also
scheduled to be available in other international regions by 2009.

   "DGamer was built around the vision to connect Disney video game
fans in a secure, fun environment and it is truly the first integrated
online community of its kind to do so on multiple platforms," said
Graham Hopper, executive vice president and general manager for Disney
Interactive Studios. "We recognize the importance of delivering unique
experiences to our consumers and how crucial it is for parents to feel
confident that the community is secure for their kids."

   DGamer, which leverages the community technology of Disney.com,
allows players to log into their DS and online accounts to create and
customize a unique 3-D avatar and persistent profile. A wide variety
of outfits, hats, eyewear and accessories are available to choose
from, including special Disney-themed costumes, such as Buzz
Lightyear, Tinker Bell and familiar Disney theme park mouse ears. Kids
can chat, view user profiles of their DGamer friends, and post high
scores to leaderboards. In addition, players earn "honors" which
represent what players have been rewarded when completing in-game
missions. Honors can also trigger unlockables such as special gear for
player's avatars, all of which transfer automatically between the
DGamer Web site and the DGamer feature in DS games from Disney when
users log in. For example, when playing The Chronicles of Narnia:
Prince Caspian, players can unlock Prince Caspian character costumes
that can be worn by their DGamer avatar. Certain "honors" also unlock
exclusive content in Nintendo DS games from Disney and within the
DGamer channel online.

   Parents are also encouraged to play an active role in the DGamer
community. By accessing parental controls at www.dgamer.com, they can
specify the level of interactivity that kids have online and feel
confident that their child's experience is age appropriate. For
example, parents can choose between three chat levels for their kids'
use by utilizing the familiar security features and infrastructure at
Disney.com, which hosts the DGamer site. Kids can either communicate
using a predetermined list of words and phrases called "Speed Chat,"
through modified free-form typing that blocks inappropriate language
or suggestive phrases called "Speed Chat Plus," or via "Open Chat"
which requires an exchange of a True Friend Code outside of the DGamer
system. Disney.com employs several safety features to ensure all chat
communication is moderated for safety.

   Fall Line Studio, the Nintendo platform-dedicated development
studio of Disney Interactive Studios, developed both DGamer and The
Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian for Nintendo DS. The Chronicles
of Narnia: Prince Caspian is an action/role-playing adventure game
that takes players through Narnia and beyond the events of the
much-anticipated second film, which is set to open in theaters across
North America tomorrow.

   "The Chronicles of Narnia franchise has such a massive following
that it made this the perfect game to launch DGamer on because it
keeps fans connected like never before," said Hopper. "Through the
DGamer functionality, fans can chat, share honors, and engage in a
truly unique and different experience that immerses them in the world
of Narnia in only a way that Disney can deliver."

   In addition to Nintendo DS, The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince
Caspian video game will be available for the Xbox 360(R) video game
and entertainment system from Microsoft, the PLAYSTATION(R)3 computer
entertainment system, the Wii(TM) home video game console, the
PlayStation(R)2 computer entertainment system and Windows-based PC.
The console and Windows-based PC versions of the game were developed
by Traveller's Tales and take players on a fast-paced action/adventure
that features 20 playable characters and combat, exploration and
puzzle solving that extends beyond the film. The console versions also
include two live action scenes that were created exclusively for the
video game and accompany 16 scenes taken from the film.

   The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian for Nintendo DS has an
Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) rating of E10+ for Everyone
10 years and older and is now available for $29.99. The Chronicles of
Narnia: Prince Caspian for consoles and Windows-based PC is rated T
for Teen and will be available for Xbox 360, the PLAYSTATION 3 system
and Wii for $49.99; and the PLAYSTATION 2 system and Windows-based PC
for $29.99.

&lt;p&gt;Gorilla Nation Names JP Kemp as UK Sales Director - ex-Freewebs Exec to Open London Office of World's Largest Online Rep Firm

LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Gorilla Nation (www.gorillanation.com), the world's largest online
ad rep firm, announced today that it has appointed JP Kemp as UK Sales
Director of their new London office.

   Kemp was formerly Head of UK Sales at Freewebs where he was
charged with launching the property in the UK, and was among the first
to sell branded widget solutions to marketers including Universal
Pictures, O2, and the Energy Saving Trust. Prior to this, he held the
position of Head of Agency Sales at Handbag Publishing Group (now
Hearst Digital) where he managed an agency sales team across

year.

lead our entry into the UK," stated Brian Fitzgerald, Gorilla Nation

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co will begin trading physical oil by year-end, increasing its exposure in a market that could rise to $200 a barrel, the bank's global head of commodities said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank plans to expand in commodities and energy trading, Blythe Masters said, despite expectations of job cuts in other areas as it prepares to take on staff from Bear Stearns at the same time it deals with turbulent financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will start trading in physical oil and refined products by the end of this year," she told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will join a growing list of investment banks from Goldman Sachs to Barclays Capital seeking to boost profits on their big derivatives trading desks by gaining a foothold in physical markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third-largest U.S. bank added 50 people to its commodities and energy trading and investment team last year and is on track to hire a similar number this year, taking the strength of the total team globally to 450, Masters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, it hired former Goldman Sachs banker Oral Dawe as managing director and CEO of its Asia Pacific commodities group, in addition to hiring more than a dozen traders in Asia recently to oversee its expansion in energy and metals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with oil prices surging more than 30 percent this year to a record near $127 this week, Masters said the bank would look at more ways to boost its presence in energy markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oil rising to $200? It could happen. This year? You could see it, although it would take a further shock to expectations," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Supply disruptions, geopolitical events, increased demand for refined products, weather, additional investor inflows driven by shifting inflation expectations -- they could all contribute to high oil prices," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LIMITED IMPACT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Masters shrugged off the impact of the U.S. credit crisis, saying robust growth in demand from emerging markets could more than offset a slowdown in demand in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the prospects for the natural resources sector and commodity businesses are strong and are not really derailed in any sense by the credit crisis in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Urbanizing populations in markets like India and China are driving the appreciation in commodity prices," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to oil, Masters expected prices of metals and grains to remain high in the near to medium term as supplies would take some time to catch up with rapidly rising demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think high commodity prices are staying for some time but you could also see corrections and you will certainly see high volatility. The current inflated prices are a reflection of fundamental factors, not just speculation," Masters said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the supply side, there are still major shortfalls in infrastructure as a result of sustained period of under investment in commodities that has not yet been undone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan came under fire in March after it acquired a nearly insolvent Bear Stearns with involvement of the Federal Reserve and at a fire-sale price. It expects to complete its takeover of Bear around June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank could cut as many as 4,000 of its own employees worldwide as it prepares to take on staff from Bear, people familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ben Tan)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Visa Meetings Card, in Alliance with Arcaneo, Can Provide
Businesses More Efficiency and Transparency in Managing These Costs
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
In response to growth in global spending on meetings, incentives,
conferences and exhibitions, Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced the
addition of the Visa Meetings card to its suite of commercial payment
solutions to help businesses more strategically manage this expense
category.

   According to research by the Aberdeen Group, surveyed companies
spent on average nearly three percent of their annual revenues, or
$17.3 million, on meetings-related expenses during 2007, up from $15.8
million the previous year.(1) Aberdeen research also indicates that a
meetings card ranks the highest among corporate expense managers as
the most cost effective method for managing meetings and related
expenses.(2) Current growth in spending in this category is driving
demand for effective expense management tools to help businesses
control costs and manage their meetings spending, which is expected to
reach $86 billion annually in the U.S. alone in 2008 according to
research by PhoCusWright Inc.(3)

   The Visa Meetings card includes the features of the existing Visa
Purchasing and Visa Corporate payment cards. This combination offers a
flexible procure-to-pay solution to help companies simplify the
process to purchase, pay, reconcile and report on meetings-related
expenditures. The new card provides corporate expense managers the
ability to tailor a card program to meet their specific company needs
while helping them to reduce costs, streamline operational and payment
processes and make more informed business decisions.

   "Using payment cards for meetings expenses helps enable companies
to improve the efficiency of their spend management processes, gain
greater control and visibility over their spending and ultimately
drive increased cost savings to their bottom line," said Darren
Parslow, Global Head of Commercial Solutions, Visa Inc.

   The Visa Meetings card builds upon a strategic alliance with
Arcaneo(TM), a leading global meetings technology provider, to
integrate Visa Meetings card transaction data into Arcaneo's
Metron(TM) strategic meetings management system. This integration
provides mid-size, large and multinational enterprises, along with
meeting and travel management companies with the information they need
to more efficiently manage meetings expenses.

   "With an increasing focus among corporate CFOs on strategic
meetings management, the Visa Meetings card in conjunction with
Metron(TM) is intended to address a growing need among businesses for
an end-to-end solution to more strategically manage their expenses"
said Dale Beckles, President and CEO of Arcaneo.

   The use of the Visa Meetings card with Arcaneo's Metron(TM) system
helps companies more easily centralize internal processes for
purchasing, data tracking, reporting on meetings expenses and managing
logistical aspects of planning meetings. This integration enables
businesses to increase visibility into spending for meetings, travel,
procurement and other expenses to enable greater compliance with
corporate and regulatory policies and preferred supplier usage.

   Web-based data and reporting tools available through Visa
Information Management, an integral component of the Visa Meetings
card, further improves company visibility into meetings spending.
These tools provide access to transaction details and e-folio data
from hotels, airlines, car rental agencies and other suppliers through
easy-to-read reports, expense reporting tools, cardholder statements
and file extract capabilities. These tools also enable consolidation
of spending data from Visa commercial card programs across all
departments, divisions and subsidiaries within a company to provide
management with an aggregate view of all business expenses for travel,
procurement and meetings.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc today named Garry A. Nicholson as Senior Vice President, General
Manager of the company's newly created Oncology Business Unit, reporting to Ian
Read, President of Pfizer Worldwide Pharmaceutical Operations. Nicholson will
serve as head of Pfizer's oncology franchise, with direct responsibility for
clinical development, medical affairs, commercial development, sales and
marketing.

"Garry is a highly regarded and accomplished executive whose experience in the
global oncology market makes him exceptionally qualified to lead this important
new growth area for Pfizer," Mr. Read said. "The Oncology market is expected to
grow significantly in the next decade. This is being driven by breakthrough
science, the rapid uptake of new agents that meet high unmet medical need and
treatments that are enabling cancer patients to live longer."

Mr. Nicholson is a senior pharmaceutical executive with extensive experience in
product development, marketing, sales and general management on a worldwide
basis.

Mr. Nicholson joins Pfizer from Eli Lilly and Company, where he spent more than
10 years as Executive Director of the U.S. Oncology Business Unit and
subsequently in an expanded role as Global Oncology Platform Leader. In the
latter role, Mr. Nicholson was responsible for the global Oncology franchise,
including the Oncology therapeutic area strategy, portfolio management, Phase
II/III development, global integration of Oncology medical and marketing
strategies, regulatory submissions and approvals, and licensing and
partnerships. In addition, Mr. Nicholson was directly accountable for the
company's Oncology drug development budget and review of country and regional
forecasts and income statements. He also played a key leadership role in
business development and licensing initiatives in Oncology. Under Mr.
Nicholson's leadership, Lilly's global Oncology sales exceeded $2.5 billion in
2007.

From 2004 to 2005, Mr. Nicholson served as the Executive Director of the
Corporate Six Sigma Task force, where he was responsible for driving significant
operational improvements across Lilly's entire business. Mr. Nicholson recruited
and deployed Six Sigma team participants and led implementation efforts for the
Sales, Marketing and Medical Affairs teams in all Lilly geographies.

Mr. Nicholson has a Bachelor of Science degree in pharmacy from the University
of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and an MBA from the University of South
Carolina, Columbia.

"This is a very exciting time to join Ian and the rest of Pfizer's leadership as
they seek to seize promising opportunities in the growing global oncology
market," Mr. Nicholson said. "I believe Pfizer has the most promising and
extensive oncology pipeline in the industry and look forward to leading this
important new business."

On March 5th, Pfizer announced the establishment of a new Business Unit focused
solely on oncology in its Worldwide Pharmaceutical Group. The unit will have the
resources to seize growth opportunities to strengthen Pfizer's research
investment in oncology, a market expected to more than double in the next
decade. The Oncology Business Unit will enable the Company to expedite launches
of novel oncology agents, as well as to focus research efforts on cancers common
in Asia, including those of the liver, esophagus and nasopharynx.

Founded in 1849, Pfizer is the world's largest research-based pharmaceutical
company. Pfizer is taking new approaches to advancing better health as it
discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers quality, safe and effective
prescription medicines to treat and help prevent disease for both people and
animals. Pfizer also partners with healthcare providers, governments and local
communities around the world to expand access to medicines and to provide better
quality health care and health system support. At Pfizer, more than 85,000
colleagues in more than 90 countries work every day to help people stay happier
and healthier longer and to reduce the human and economic burden of disease
worldwide.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase will save $3 billion
because it no longer will have to build a new Lower Manhattan
headquarters for its investment bankers who instead will move
into Bear Stearns  Co's BSC.N midtown building, according to
JPMorgan Chase Chief Executive Jamie Dimon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan agreed to acquire credit-starved Bear Stearns in
mid-March. Dimon, speaking at a UBS AG (UBSN.VX) financial
conference on Monday, said: "This stops us from having to
basically spend $3 billion to build an investment banking
headquarters downtown."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York City's real estate market is slowing as financial
companies lay off tens of thousands of workers and developers
find bank loans harder to get and more costly. The withering
credit has already delayed mega-projects including Brooklyn's
Atlantic Yards and Midtown Manhattan's Hudson Yards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan will be adding to the supply of office space. The
bank has identified one million square feet of offices it won't
need, out of the 4 million square feet it gets from Bear
Stearns, that will be sold or subleased, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan could cut as many as 4,000 of its own workers as
it takes on 6,000 Bear Stearns employees and weighs whether to
hire some or all of the 3,500 people it still is reviewing,
people familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A bank spokesman had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman for the Port Authority of New York and New
Jersey, the lead agency for the World Trade Center
redevelopment, said: "We haven't heard anything new. As far as
we know JPMorgan remains interested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan had unveiled plans for an office tower to be built
where the partly demolished Deutsche Bank building now stands,
just south of the World Trade Center complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Deutsche Bank building was damaged in the Sept. 11,
2001, attacks and must be torn down, a process first delayed by
mold and then by a fatal fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noting Bear Stearns has five trading floors, JPMorgan's
Dimon said the bank would build two new ones. "Those seven in
New York City will probably accommodate the whole company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moving the entire investment bank into Bear Stearns'
midtown office tower will make it easier to run the department
now split between a couple of buildings, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "During the negotiations, I should point out that some of
our investment bankers came up and said, 'If you need a little
bit more money, we'll chip in so we don't have to commute,"' he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Joseph Giannone and Joan Gralla, editing by

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd (CCL.AX) (CCA), said on Thursday it expected increases in its soft drink prices to help it grow profits this year despite a drop off in volumes, sending its shares up nearly 6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consumer-focused companies have suffered this year as Australians spend less in the face of rising interest rates and fuel costs, but CCA said it had so far managed to offset weaker sales volumes through measures to better manage its revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in CCA, 30 percent owned by the Coca-Cola Co (KO.N), rose as much as 5.9 percent after the announcement, before falling back slightly to trade up 5.3 percent at A$8.37 by 0348 GMT in a wider market .AXJO up 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a classic relief rally," said Deutsche Bank analyst Kristan Walker. "There was some nervousness it was going to be worse."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People always get concerned that you might have to see a rollback in price increases," he added. "But the increases they've put through are fairly material; between 4 and 5 percent in Australia is a decent number."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA's shares have followed the downward trend of many companies dependent on discretionary spending so far this year, falling around 16 percent to Wednesday's close, more than double the decline in the benchmark index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ahead of the statement, analysts had on average expected full year profit before items to rise 9 percent to A$399.4 million ($373 million), according to Reuters Estimates, up from A$366.3 million in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrill Lynch said in a note earlier this week that profit growth of 5-10 percent in the first half of 2008 would be at the lower end of where it initially expected CCA to be at this stage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the benefits of a couple of years of investment into its brands and its productivity facilities we expect 2008 to be a "big year" for CCA," Merrill Lynch added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA said trading in Australia in the first four months of the year had also been affected by poor weather in the important states of New South Wales and Queensland, and substantial discounting of its major competitor, Pepsi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Managing Director Terry Davis told reporters he saw the majority of CCA's products as consumer staples, which would help it withstand a general decline in consumer demand in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although the trading environment is not quite as robust as it was this time last year, we would expect another strong performance for the business in 2008," he had told the company's annual shareholder meeting earlier on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company raised prices in 2007 to offset higher aluminium and other commodity prices, but said on Thursday the rate of increase in commodity input costs was continuing to fall from the levels experienced in 2006 and 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We now expect the full-year increase in our cost of goods sold per unit case to be at the low end of the 3-4 percent guidance given in February," it said, forecasting high single-digit profit growth in both the half and full year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CCA said it had minimal refinancing requirements for the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=A$1.07)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ben Wilson; Editing by James Thornhill and Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) sees tens of millions of corporate e-mail accounts moving to its data centers over the next five years, shifting to a business model that may thin profit margins but generate more revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview ahead of the Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit, Chris Capossela, who manages Microsoft's Office products, said the company will see more and more companies abandon their own in-house computer systems and shift to "cloud computing", a less expensive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is the trend by Internet powerhouses to array huge numbers of computers in centralized data centers to deliver Web-based applications to far-flung users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft built its business selling software to run on local machines, both computer servers and personal computers, but, in recent years, it has invested billions of dollars in massive data centers, which are the basic infrastructure for a wide range of Web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has started offering corporate customers the option of having Microsoft run their e-mail, collaboration or sales programs on the software giant's computers and delivering those applications over the Web as a monthly subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capossela, a senior vice president at Microsoft, said it plans to be "agnostic" by offering customers the choice between a traditional licensing model or a subscription-based service model embraced by rivals like Salesforce.com (CRM.N) and Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's where we think we are far stronger than our service-religious competition who think it's all going to be in the cloud," he said. "A lot of companies are not ready to take their money out of the pillowcase and put it in the bank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchange Online, the service offering for its Exchange mail and messaging server software, will be the primary application adopted by corporate customers, according to Capossela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In five years, 50 percent of our Exchange mailboxes will be Exchange Online," said Capossela, who expects a portion of Exchange Online customers to come from customers switching from International Business Machines' (IBM.N) Lotus Domino system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research firm Radicati, Exchange will run about 210 million corporate e-mail accounts in 2008, growing to 319 million mailboxes in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THE CLOUDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift to cloud computing will introduce some changes, according to Capossela, in the earnings model at Microsoft's business division, which generated revenue of $16.4 billion and operating profit of $10.8 billion in fiscal 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, customers pay Microsoft a licensing fee for the software, then buy their own computer and hire their own technology staff to manage those systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a services business, the customer will pay Microsoft a larger fee, since Microsoft also runs and maintains all the hardware. But Microsoft's profit margins may not be "as high," Capossela said, even though revenue may be more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key for Microsoft will be to run its computers systems as efficiently as possible to reduce hardware costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's where we make the business model work," said Capossela, 38, who worked in his earlier years at the company as a speech writing assistant for co-founder Bill Gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already signed up large customers to its online services. The company said Coca Cola Enterprises Inc (CCE.N) signed up 70,000 seats for Exchange Online, switching over from IBM's Lotus Domino system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it continues to build up its infrastructure, adding roughly 10,000 powerful computer servers a month to its data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a staggering amount of computing power, about the equivalent what popular social networking site Facebook uses, according to Capossela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/ )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes from head strategist)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 16 (Reuters) - The Libor interbank
rate-setting process is not broken, and recent rate volatility
can be blamed largely on reluctance among banks to lend to each
other amid the current credit crunch, JPMorgan said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan (JPM.N) is one of the 16 banks surveyed by the
British Bankers' Association daily to set or "fix" the daily
London Interbank Offered Rates on overseas dollar deposits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The question of whether a benchmark could be designed that
is less flawed than Libor is debatable," JPMorgan analysts said
in a note published on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Everyone is funding at a similar level, but when credit
conditions worsen and we have periods like this of
unprecedented turmoil, the reality is there is not a single
borrowing rate," Terry Belton, head of global fixed income
strategy at JPMorgan, said in an interview on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This fixing -- it is what it is -- and it is doing I think
what is designed to do properly. That is, it takes 16 very high
quality, very large banks...to capture kind of an indicative
rate for a prime bank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spread of three-month Libor and three-month overnight
index swap (OIS) rate, a gauge of banks' aversion to lend to
each other, was hovering at historically wide levels until
recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But JPMorgan analysts said the difference between the two
rates will shrink sharply in the coming months in response to
efforts by global central banks to increase liquidity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The increased liquidity measures by central banks along
with increased term funding by financial companies are the main
drivers, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Richard Leong and Jennifer Ablan;)

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details; changes source)

 May 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded the U.S.
department-store sector to "neutral" from "attractive," saying
higher gasoline prices should further crowd out consumer
discretionary spending.

 Goldman said it recently raised its 2008 oil price forecast
to $149 per barrel, from $115 per barrel.

 "Higher energy spending in the second half is likely
setting the stage for a more challenging backdrop for consumer
discretionary sectors, particularly for the department-store
stocks," the brokerage said in a note to clients.

 Goldman downgraded JC Penny Co Inc (JCP.N) and Nordstrom
Inc (JWN.N) to "neutral" from "buy," saying expansion efforts
and product launches have placed them at a near-term
disadvantage regarding inventory and expense management.

 Both carry more near-term earnings risk than peers Kohl's
Corp (KSS.N) and Macys Inc (M.N), the brokerage added.

 But Goldman upgraded TJX Cos Inc (TJX.N) to "buy" from
"neutral," saying, "We expect the company's value proposition,
inventory model, and consistent square footage growth to
deliver sustained EPS growth of +10 percent -outpacing peers
within our coverage universe."

 The brokerage removed Kohl's Corp (KSS.N) from conviction
buy list and added Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) to the list.

 The brokerage made the following price target changes to
some of the companies within the sector:
 COMPANY              RATING            PRICE TARGET

                                  CURRENT     PRIOR
 JC Penny             Neutral          $45         $49
 Nordstrom            Neutral          $39         $43
 Carters Inc          Neutral          $16         $16.50
 Kohl's Corp          Buy              $53         $56
 Macys Inc            Buy              $27         $30
 TJX Cos              Buy              $36         $33
 Wal-Mart             Buy              $63         $60

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 16 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve may raise
the offering size and extend the term of loans to banks from
its Term Auction Facility in a bid to reduce strains in the
U.S. banking system, JPMorgan analysts said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Fed has already enlarged TAF auction size several times
since it was conceived late last year. At the latest TAF
auction held earlier this month, banks bid for $75 billion
worth of 28-day funds at a clearing rate of 2.22 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terry Belton, JPMorgan's head of fixed income and
derivative strategy, said during a teleconference that the U.S.
central bank may decide in the next few months to stretch the
TAF loan term to three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Further adjustments to TAF will be another step "to move
Libor significantly lower," Belton said, referring to interbank
borrowing costs.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it has signed services agreements in Brazil
with a major entertainment company and a development bank. The agreements
include:


--  The Rede Brasil Sul de Comunicacao (RBS) Group - A major entertainment
    enterprise in Brazil selected IBM to implement a Networked Interactive
    Content Access (NICA) solution.  This solution, developed by IBM, is used
    for digital file management of printed and on-line media content. The RBS
    Group is the first Brazilian company to acquire the solution, which will
    include a twenty-four-hour IBM support service.  The NICA solution from IBM
    is already in use worldwide at other large media groups.

    NICA accelerates interaction between all production steps of a
    publishing medium. Picture requests are entered into the system and
    sent to the photographers, who create the images and upload them into
    NICA. The solution will integrate both the agenda and editing systems
    of the newspaper or media site. The software program will also
    centralize and integrate all picture files of the Group, so that
    whenever a picture is retrieved from the records, the journalist or
    photographer will also be able to know when it was used, on which
    occasion and for which of the eight RBS newspapers and sites.  The
    agreement was signed during the first quarter of 2008.

--  Banco Nacional do Desenvolvimento Economico e Social (BNDES) - IBM
    signed an agreement with BNDES for access to IBM's alternative data
    processing center to assist in disaster recovery, as well as, security
    services for the collection, delivery and custody of BNDES's external
    security tape library. BNDES's mission is to promote Brazil's development
    by boosting the Brazilian economy's competitiveness, prioritizing the
    reduction of both social and regional inequalities, and maintaining and
    creating employment opportunities. The agreement is for twenty-four months
    and R$8,450,000 (BRL currency). It was signed in the second quarter of
    2008.
    

    
"These services agreements reflect the strength of IBM's global
businessmodel and our unmatched track record in business and IT transformation,"
said Gonzalo

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer announced today that study results across several difficult-to-treat
cancers will be presented at the 44th American Society of Clinical Oncology
(ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago from May 30 to June 3, 2008. Pfizer will hold
two briefings for journalists on June 1 and investors on June 2.

Researchers will present the latest data from the breadth of Pfizer's oncology
portfolio, focused in four areas of discovery: anti-angiogenesis, signal
transduction, immuno-oncology and cytotoxics/potentiators.

Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma (mRCC)

    --  Updated overall survival data from a Phase 3 trial evaluating
        single-agent, oral SUTENT(R) (sunitinib malate) versus interferon-alfa
        (IFN-(alpha)) in the first-line treatment of mRCC will be presented in
        an oral presentation by Dr. Robert Figlin, City of Hope on Saturday, May
        31.

    --  Phase 2 data evaluating the anti-tumor activity of axitinib in patients
        with mRCC refractory to sunitinib and sorafenib, cytokines and
        sorafenib, or sorafenib alone will be presented by Dr. Janice P.
        Dutcher, New York Medical College on Saturday, May 31.

Non-small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC)

    --  Phase 2 data evaluating the activity of the anti-IGF-1R antibody
        CP-751,871 in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin in NSCLC will
        be presented by Dr. Daniel Karp, MD Anderson Cancer Center on Monday,
        June 2.

    --  Phase 1 clinical trial data exploring the safety and preliminary
        activity of PF-299804, an irreversible pan-HER inhibitor will be
        presented by Dr. Pasi A. Janne, Dana Farber Cancer Center on Monday,
        June 2.

    --  Characterization of NSCLC patients responding to anti-IGF-1R therapy
        will be presented by Dr. Antonio Gualberto, Pfizer Global Research and
        Development on Sunday, June 1.

Ewing's Sarcoma

    --  Results of the safety, pharmacokinetics and preliminary activity of the
        anti-IGF-1R antibody CP-751,871 in sarcoma patients will be presented by
        Dr. Paul Haluska, Mayo Clinic on Saturday, May 31.

Prostate Cancer (mHRPC)

    --  Preliminary data from a Phase 2 study evaluating the safety and
        tolerability of first-line SUTENT in combination with docetaxel and
        prednisone in patients with metastatic hormone-refractory prostate
        cancer will be presented by Dr. Daniel J. George, Duke University
        Medical Center on Saturday, May 31.

Other Pfizer Data Presentations and Celldex

Data on the following compounds will also be presented at ASCO 2008: Aromasin(R)
(exemestane), Camptosar(R) (irinotecan HCl), CP-868596, PF-3512676, PF-562271
and tremelimumab.

Phase 2 data assessing the effect of EGFRvIII-targeted vaccine (CDX-110) on
immune response and time to progression when given with simultaneous standard
and continuous temozolomide in patients with Glioblastoma, a form of brain
cancer will be presented by Dr. John Sampson, Duke University on Monday, June 2.
Pfizer has signed an exclusive license agreement with Celldex Therapeutics to
develop and commercialize CDX-110.

About SUTENT(R) (sunitinib malate)

SUTENT is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of advanced
renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after
disease progression on or intolerance to imatinib mesylate.

SUTENT works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important sunitinib malate targets,
vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth
factor receptor (PDGFR) are expressed by many types of solid tumors, and are
thought to play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors
acquire blood vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. SUTENT also
inhibits other targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET.

Important SUTENT(R) (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on SUTENT.

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure.

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. CBCs with platelet count and serum
chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each treatment cycle for
patients receiving treatment with SUTENT.

The most common adverse reactions in mRCC and GIST clinical trials were fatigue,
asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspensia, abdominal
pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin discoloration,
altered taste, anorexia and bleeding.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs, the most active investment bank in energy markets, on Friday sharply raised its forecast for oil prices in the second half of this year, citing tight supply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank expects U.S. crude to average $141 a barrel in the second half of 2008, up from a previous projection of $107, it said. Goldman also forecasts prices will rise further next year to average $148.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tight supply conditions continue to be the primary catalyst for higher crude prices," the bank said in a research note. "The near-term outlook for oil prices continues to be bullish."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman forecast helped send crude prices to a record high of $127.82 on Friday, analysts said. The 2009 estimate is the most bullish among more than 30 banks regularly polled by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, one of the first to point to triple-digit oil more than two years ago -- a once unthinkable level -- earlier this month said oil could shoot up to $200 within the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its note on Friday said that despite the advent of alternative sources such as biofuels, oil supply growth has slowed to 1 percent from about 1.8 percent in 2005 and less than the bank's forecast for 2008 world GDP growth of 3.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given this imbalance, long-term oil prices will need to continue to rise," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPECULATION, FUNDAMENTALS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's view that prices are rising in response to tight supply contrasts with others in the industry that oil's rally is being driven by factors beyond supply and demand fundamentals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, source of two in every five barrels of oil, has rebuffed calls from the U.S. and other industrialized countries for more oil, saying supply is sufficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In OPEC's view, factors like the weakness of the U.S. dollar, speculative trading, a lack of capacity at oil refineries and political tension are lifting prices, not a lack of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Royal Dutch Shell Plc, the world's second-largest fully publicly traded oil company by market value, has also said current prices contain an element of speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is the latest bank to raise its price outlook this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS lifted its projection on Thursday and said inflation risks from rising oil costs would put a global economic recovery in 2009-2010 at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note, the bank said oil economist Jan Stuart had lifted the UBS oil price forecast for U.S. crude to $115 a barrel from $86.96, a 32 percent rise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alex Lawler, editing by William Hardy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney is bridging the gap between gaming and virtual worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney Interactive Studios on Thursday formally launched DGamer, a free avatar-based community for U.S. buyers of games the company developed for the handheld Nintendo DS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beginning with Friday's release of "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian" in tandem with the theatrical release of the fantasy sequel, all Disney Interactive DS games will come with DGamer-added content like customizable avatars. DGamer members also will be able to use the WiFi connectivity of the DS to communicate with other members with either a DS or a PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it features avatars and text chat, DGamer can't really be described as a true virtual world such as Disney Online's Club Penguin or Fairies.com -- at least not yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But as Paul Yanover, executive vp and managing director of Disney Online, noted, "DGamer is our opportunity to work with Disney Interactive to make sure we have this connected environment and to make sure we reach our guests wherever they are, including a player on a Disney Interactive DS title talking to a player in 'Pirates of the Caribbean Online.'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;David Cole, president of video game market research firm DFC Intelligence, noted other publishers, including Nintendo, have leveraged the WiFi connectivity of the DS for game play and to share game characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said Disney Interactive deserves credit for being the first to formalize a virtual community around the DS, adding DGamer appears to be a good fit for the parent company's overall online strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney has been fairly aggressive in creating virtual communities across the board," Cole added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, Disney sold 3.4 million units of Nintendo DS video games in the U.S. alone, according to consulting firm NPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DGamer members will be able to customize their avatars using parts and clothing not just from the DS game they're currently playing, but also from other well-known Disney characters such as Buzz Lightyear and Tinker Bell. In addition, the honors by which all DGamer members are measured will be cumulative, encouraging players to purchase and play as many Disney Interactive DS titles as they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The avatars, game results, honors and virtual gifts can also be ported to other DS owners who have joined DGamer, as well as to the PC-based Dgamer.com site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Interactive senior producer Michelle Golding said the company also plans to send such additional content as player polls and surveys to members through the DS WiFi connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Noting that the target DGamer audience is tweens, Golding said Disney Interactive is leveraging the parental controls from Disney.com to ensure players communicate in a safe environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats story first transmitted Thursday night)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE May 16 (Reuters) - Two weeks after Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) abandoned its pursuit of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), a proxy
fight launched by activist investor Carl Icahn has put
Microsoft in the driver's seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn wants Yahoo to reopen talks with Microsoft, saying
the company's board had acted "irrationally" when it rejected
Microsoft's $47.5 billion buyout offer. Microsoft walked away
from the deal earlier this month when Yahoo rejected its final
offer of $33 a share, holding out for at least $37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With Yahoo being pushed by shareholders to get back to the
table, you would think it's just what Microsoft wanted," said
Marc Weingarten, an attorney with Schulte Roth  Zabel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its part, Microsoft has declined to comment on Icahn's
actions. A company spokesman repeated the same message that its
executives have said over the last two weeks: it had moved on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Icahn has opened the door for Microsoft to swoop in
as white knight and buy Yahoo in a friendly deal without
instigating the proxy battle it had threatened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft can come directly back to the Yahoo board and
save them from the proxy contest, save them from all the
criticism that they are getting," said Weingarten.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's motivation for buying Yahoo -- to create an
online advertising powerhouse to rival Google Inc (GOOG.O) --
remains intact. The alternatives of a build-from-within
strategy and a piece-by-piece acquisition strategy could bring
significant risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MICROSOFT SHOULD WAIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mergers and acquisitions experts said it would be wise for
Microsoft to lie low and see if pressure from Icahn and other
activist investors will prompt Yahoo's board to turn to
Microsoft with hat in hand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The whole strategy for Microsoft, in an MA sense, was to
say 'fine, we take our bat and ball and go home.' You don't
want to say that and then be seen popping out of the house and
looking down the block for your former playmates," said
Marshall Sonenshine, Chairman of New York-based investment bank
Sonenshine Partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If they have any intention of coming back, they shouldn't
say anything. If they don't have any intention, then they have
nothing to say," said Sonenshine, who sees the deal getting
done at a price slightly above $33 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sonenshine said an eventual Microsoft-Yahoo deal may play
out like News Corp's NWSa.N acquisition of Dow Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bancroft family, which controlled Dow Jones, balked at
News Corp's $5.6 billion bid, but the 65 percent premium proved
too attractive for many family members to resist, especially
after it eliminated the possibility of competing bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, shareholders may push Yahoo to accept
Microsoft's $33-a-share bid, a 72 percent premium on Yahoo's
share price before Microsoft went public with its hostile bid
on Feb. 1, especially if no other viable offers emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Yahoo fell below $23 after Microsoft pulled its
offer. Yahoo's two largest shareholders, Capital Research
Management and Legg Mason, have signaled displeasure with how
the company handled negotiations with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a response to Icahn, Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock defended
the board's actions and said it continues to "actively and
expeditiously explore strategic alternatives."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What's unusual about this is that the Yahoo board said,
'no, this is not good enough, and we're just going to go back
to being a company.' The stock collapsed and that honked off a
lot of shareholders," said Bob Profusek, head of the mergers
and acquisitions practice at law firm Jones Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Everybody is fixated on the Microsoft bid, but causing
something else to happen that would create short-term
shareholder value could also be a pay day for (Icahn)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Historically, companies targeted in a hostile takeover bid
would issue a special dividend, a major share buyback or
another measure to ease the blow from a fall in the share price
if a deal collapsed, according to Profusek.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI May 16 (Reuters) - China's key stock index is
expected to rise 20 percent by the end of the year with economic
tightening steps likely to be delayed after this week's
devastating earthquake, JPMorgan Chairman of China Equities Jing
Ulrich said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The government is unlikely to announce new tightening
measures anytime soon," said Ulrich, who expected the quake to
help push inflation above 7 percent for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She added that Chinese banking stocks would benefit from a
widening spread between deposit and lending rates, while rising
costs of coal and crude oil would boost profits at resource
firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But oil refiners such as Sinopec Corp (600028.SS) and
PetroChina (601857.SS) will be squeezed by rising crude oil
prices as the government is unlikely to relax restrictions on
retail fuel prices this year, while low-end manufacturers will
continue to suffer from rising labour and resource costs, yuan
appreciation and an economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index has .SSEC
rebounded about 20 percent from a 13-month low last month after
the government took measures, including a stock trading tax cut,
to stabilise share prices, which had fallen by half from a record
peak last October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The index ended down 0.36 percent at 3,624.233 points on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China's consumer price inflation has remained stubbornly
high, rising to 8.5 percent in April from March's 8.3 percent in
data released on Monday, and holding near a 12-year peak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The central bank quickly announced a 0.5 percentage point
rise in banks' reserve requirement ratios on Monday and many
traders and analysts saw the data increasing the chances of an
interest rate hike next month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ulrich played down the chances of more aggressive
macroeconomic tightening by the Chinese government, however,
especially after this week's 7.9 magnitude earthquake in
southwest China that is expected to have killed more than 50,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She also dismissed worries over the possibility of massive
supplies of additional shares flooding the market following the
expiry of lock-up periods linked to reforms for state-held
shares.
 "I'm quite optimistic on the A-share market, especially
during the period leading up to the Beijing Olympic Games," she
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Reconstruction following the earthquake may even be a
positive factor for the economy," she added.

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, May 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Nortel(1) (TSX: NT)(NYSE: NT) and IBM(2) (NYSE: IBM) today announced a
new service assurance solution combining IBM Tivoli Netcool Carrier VoIP

    Nortel's Service Assurance Solution unites IBM Tivoli Netcool Carrier

and Nortel Global Services to provide greater visibility and control
across multi-technology, multi-vendor networks. This enables service
providers to more quickly isolate and address performance issues, helping
to lower support costs and improve service levels.

    "As customers use more video and other bandwidth-intensive applications,
they become less tolerant of service degradation," said Dietmar Wendt,

challenging than ever as converged networks and technologies grow more
complex. IBM and Nortel understand these challenges, and we have combined

Manager, the first integrated service quality, fault and performance
management offering from IBM for carrier VoIP networks. It presents
real-time service level management views, helping service providers
identify network problems before they occur.

    The initial version of IBM Tivoli Netcool Carrier VoIP Manager supports
Nortel's Communication Server 2000 IP Multimedia Softswitch.

    "Leveraging IBM's Tivoli Netcool technology in Nortel's Common Management
Platform is an effective way to offer consistent, comprehensive network
management," said Peter Mottishaw, an analyst with OSS Observer(2).
"Combining Nortel's network engineering and operations expertise with IBM
Tivoli Netcool's market-leading service assurance product suite offers
service providers the ability to efficiently implement a world-class OSS
(Operations Support System) solution while minimizing the risks that
often accompany such projects."

    "IBM Tivoli Netcool Carrier VoIP Manager supports IBM's commitment to the
communication service provider market in enabling best-in-class service
assurance for existing and emerging next generation services," said
Kieran Moynihan, vice president and chief technology officer of Telecoms,
Tivoli Software, IBM. "The software leverages IBM's industry leading
service management platform for real-time management of carrier VoIP
services and infrastructures."

&lt;p&gt; By Steven Scheer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM May 13 (Reuters) - The SP 500 index .SPX is
expected to stay in a range of 1,300 to 1,400 this year before
improving to 1,500 in 2009, Goldman Sachs senior global
strategist Abby Joseph Cohen said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Share price gains in recent weeks appear sustainable since
U.S. economic data look set to improve in the second half of the
year, she told a news conference in Jerusalem.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What's priced in the stock market is a mild recession with
some pressure on corporate profits," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SP 500 closed at 1,403.58 on Monday, versus its 52-week
high and low of 1,257 and 1,576, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joseph Cohen believes the market fell too far. Investors are
now realising the U.S. economy has hit bottom and that profits
will look better this year than last year when many firms had
large write-offs, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I am not surprised in the increase in share prices," she
said. "The economy is showing signs of stability. We believe
that the weakest part of the economy is right now ... In the
second half of this year economic data will look a little
better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Areas like exports, growing at an annual rate of 8 percent,
and capital goods spending by companies are increasing, said
Joseph Cohen, who was recently succeeded by David Kostin as
Goldman's U.S. investment strategist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I believe that many export-related companies will show very
good profits," Joseph Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She believes that income tax rebates and a series of Federal
Reserve rate reductions will give a boost to the economy later
in 2008 and into 2009. "The second half of the year things will
be better but not robust," Joseph-Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But that is enough for the market to stabilise and reduce
volatility, she noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One area of concern is very high oil prices, currently above
$120 a barrel, although Goldman uses a level of $100 as its base
estimate for market strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Joseph Cohen said that despite surging energy costs, the
impact on the U.S. economy was constrained by the fact just 10
percent of business costs were related to commodities prices.
Labour costs, equal to two-thirds of business costs, were rising
at slightly above growth in productivity, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the sectors Joseph Cohen likes are those related to
information technology, since the United States is a leader, and
companies dealing with alternative energy, "greentech" and
health science technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the weak dollar is a problem and is priced "too low
against the euro and other senior currencies", it was having a
limited impact on the U.S. economy since U.S. exports, for the
most part, compete with countries that produce low-cost goods,
Joseph Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Most products for export are value added," she said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) expects to 
liquidate or spin off much of the asset management arm of Bear 
Stearns Cos Inc BSC.N after it takes over Bear next month, 
people familiar with the situation said Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bear Stearns Asset Management (BSAM), which during the past 
year generated more bad news than revenues, has about 400 
employees and managed $39 billion in investments at the end of 
February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told a UBS 
investor conference he expected the bank would close down "big 
parts of Bear's asset management business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, the sources said, roughly one-third of Bear's 
asset management employees are expected to get job offers from 
JPMorgan. Some funds with strong track records will be spun off 
to their management teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan and Bear Stearns declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, JPMorgan, which is eager to add on Bear's 
brokerage business, will shut private client brokerage 
operations in London and Hong Kong over the next two months. 
About 10 brokers plus support staff in London and about eight 
employees in Hong Kong will lose jobs as a result, the sources 
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The moves mark a change in strategy since March 16, when 
JPMorgan cited Bear's "broad asset management capabilities" as 
a selling point for its hastily arranged fire-sale takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BSAM was at the epicenter of last year's subprime mortgage 
meltdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Dimon said JPMorgan expected $300 million in the 
second-quarter charges "mostly related to closing down big 
parts of Bear Stearns Asset Management" and from the expense of 
trying to retain Bear's 470 brokers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People familiar with the situation said weak performing 
funds would be shut down and liquidated, while a few would make 
the move to JPMorgan's $1.3 trillion asset management arm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the more successful funds, such as Melissa Ko's 
$1.2 billion Emerging Markets Macro Fund, will likely be spun 
off to their management teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BSAM has been buffeted by both internal and external events 
over the past year. First star money manager James 
O'Shaughnessy left to launch his own firm and took $8.8 billion 
of BSAM assets with him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unit also was at the center of the subprime mortgage 
crisis that continues to roil financial markets. BSAM managed 
two risky subprime mortgage funds that struggled before finally 
going bankrupt last July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fund investors are suing Bear over the meltdown and accuse 
it of misrepresenting these funds as safe investments. The 
collapse also tarnished Bear's reputation as a savvy risk 
manager.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is eager to take on Bear's private client 
brokerage business that generated $161 million in revenue and 
increased client assets during the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A number of brokers have been lured away by rivals. Roughly 
400 out of 470 brokers are expected to join JPMorgan, which 
does not have a retail brokerage business. Almost all of Bear's 
brokers are in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Joseph A. Giannone; editing by Jeffrey

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financier Carl Icahn launched a campaign to replace Yahoo Inc's (YHOO.O) board with directors who would reopen talks with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), saying Yahoo acted "irrationally" in refusing the software company's $47.5 billion bid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icahn harshly criticized Yahoo for the breakdown in talks this month, saying he had accumulated 59 million shares and options in Yahoo and had assembled a 10-member dissident board slate for election at Yahoo's annual meeting on July 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Yahoo's board, Icahn said that directors had "acted irrationally and lost the faith of shareholders and Microsoft. It is obvious that Microsoft's bid of $33 per share is a superior alternative than Yahoo's prospects on a stand alone basis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within hours, Yahoo board Chairman Roy Bostock responded with a letter to Icahn saying the financier's plans were not in the best interests of investors as Yahoo remained "willing to consider any proposal from any party including Microsoft if it offers our stockholders full and certain value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's board has met 20 times in recent months to consider options, including Microsoft's bid. The top managers of Yahoo and Microsoft met face-to-face seven times, the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Icahn left the door open for a settlement instead of a full-out proxy battle where both sides typically spend millions of dollars and unleash a barrage of attacks on each other. Icahn urged Yahoo to "move expeditiously to negotiate a merger with Microsoft, thereby making a proxy fight unnecessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based billionaire's move garnered public support from at least one other large investor. Paulson  Co, a $30 billion hedge fund that raked in billions of dollars betting on the credit meltdown, disclosed on Thursday that it had amassed a 3.4 percent Yahoo stake worth $1.44 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We intend to support the Icahn slate, but sincerely hope Yahoo will negotiate an agreement with Microsoft, thereby making a proxy fight unnecessary," said Paulson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to comment on Icahn's move and reiterated the line Microsoft has used since talks with Yahoo ended. "The company has moved on," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft walked away after negotiating for three months in hopes of clinching a deal to form a counterweight in Web search and online advertising to market leader Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's final $33-per-share offer wasn't enough to sway Yahoo co-founder and Chief Executive Jerry Yang, who wanted $37 a share. The stock traded around $19 prior to Microsoft's bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Yahoo shares closed up 2.3 percent at $27.75, while Microsoft rose 1.7 percent to $30.45, both on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROUGH ROAD FOR YANG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry watchers said Yang faces a rougher road dealing with Icahn, a blunt-spoken financier known for bare-knuckle takeover tactics, than with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Jerry Yang had a tough time dealing with Steve, wait till he meets Carl Icahn," said Colin Gillis, a Canaccord Adams analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bigger threat, said Gillis, will be if Microsoft is unwilling to come back to the table. "It's not clear that he has a buyer. We think that Microsoft has really walked away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others said there is a reasonable chance of revived talks, arguing that the strategic rationale for Microsoft's initial interest in Yahoo hasn't changed in the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proxy contest gives new wind to annoyed shareholders who felt Yang overplayed his hand in turning down Microsoft's $33 per share offer, holding out for a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view this as a very positive development," said a portfolio manager at a large investment firm that holds Yahoo shares. "Getting some new blood on the board would be very beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'WIN-WIN' FOR HOLDERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn said he sought clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to buy up to about $2.5 billion in Yahoo stock. In a regulatory filing, he said he now holds 4.3 percent, including 9.9 million shares and 49 million call options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One analyst said things are now looking up for Yahoo stockholders. Shares jumped from $19.18 prior to Microsoft's initial $31-per-share bid to nearly $30 in early February, only to dive to about $24 when talks collapsed on May 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Barring procedural objections, (Yahoo investors) are now in an almost win-win situation," Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Either the existing Yahoo management team now proposes an alternative -- most likely a paid search outsourcing deal with Google. Or the Icahn slate gets elected and reopens negotiations to sell the company to Microsoft," Lindsay said. "Icahn's bid now forces the issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn's slate of nominees includes himself, Frank Biondi, a former Viacom Inc VIAb.N chief, and Keith Meister, vice chairman of Icahn Enterprises LP IEP.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks professional basketball team and co-founder of cable network HDNet, is also on Icahn's slate. Cuban struck it rich after he sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for about $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other nominees include Harvard corporate governance expert Lucian Bebchuk; John Chapple, former CEO of Nextel Partners; Adam Dell, a venture capitalist and brother of computer tycoon Michael Dell; Edward Meyer, former CEO of advertising firm Grey Global Group; hedge fund manager Brian Posner; and Robert Shaye, former co-CEO of Time Warner's (TWX.N) New Line Cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kenneth Li and Michele Gershberg in New York, Eric Auchard in San Francisco, Svea Herbst-Bayliss in Boston and Diane Bartz in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; SAN DIEGO (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney is bridging the gap 
between gaming and virtual worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney Interactive Studios on Thursday formally launched 
DGamer, a free avatar-based community for U.S. buyers of games 
the company developed for the handheld Nintendo DS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beginning with Friday's release of "The Chronicles of 
Narnia: Prince Caspian" in tandem with the theatrical release 
of the fantasy sequel, all Disney Interactive DS games will 
come with DGamer-added content like customizable avatars. 
DGamer members also will be able to use the WiFi connectivity 
of the DS to communicate with other members with either a DS or 
a PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although it features avatars and text chat, DGamer can't 
really be described as a true virtual world such as Disney 
Online's Club Penguin or Fairies.com -- at least not yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as Paul Yanover, executive vp and managing director of 
Disney Online, noted, "DGamer is our opportunity to work with 
Disney Interactive to make sure we have this connected 
environment and to make sure we reach our guests wherever they 
are, including a player on a Disney Interactive DS title 
talking to a player in 'Pirates of the Caribbean Online."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cole, president of video game market research firm 
DFC Intelligence, noted other publishers, including Nintendo, 
have leveraged the WiFi connectivity of the DS for game play 
and to share game characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he said Disney Interactive deserves credit for being 
the first to formalize a virtual community around the DS, 
adding DGamer appears to be a good fit for the parent company's 
overall online strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Disney has been fairly aggressive in creating virtual 
communities across the board," Cole added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2007, Disney sold 3.4 million units of Nintendo DS video 
games in the U.S. alone, according to consulting firm NPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DGamer members will be able to customize their avatars 
using parts and clothing not just from the DS game they're 
currently playing, but also from other well-known Disney 
characters such as Buzz Lightyear and Tinker Bell. In addition, 
the honors by which all DGamer members are measured will be 
cumulative, encouraging players to purchase and play as many 
Disney Interactive DS titles as they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The avatars, game results, honors and virtual gifts can 
also be ported to other DS owners who have joined DGamer, as 
well as to the PC-based Dgamer.com site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Interactive senior producer Michelle Golding said 
the company also plans to send such additional content as 
player polls and surveys to members through the DS WiFi 
connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noting that the target DGamer audience is tweens, Golding 
said Disney Interactive is leveraging the parental controls 
from Disney.com to ensure players communicate in a safe 
environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background on Icahn, Yahoo and Microsoft)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE May 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on
Sunday it has proposed an alternative deal to Yahoo Inc
(YHOO.O), rather than a full acquisition, in a move that could
save the web pioneer from fighting a proxy battle with
financier Carl Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft is considering and has raised with Yahoo an
alternative that would involve a transaction with Yahoo but not
an acquisition of all of Yahoo," the company said in a
statement without clarifying what that alternative might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft emphasized it was not proposing to make a new bid
to buy all of Yahoo but could reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source familiar with Microsoft's thinking said Yahoo was
responsive to Microsoft's latest proposal but emphasized that
discussions between the two companies might not result in a
deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Times reported that Microsoft and Yahoo may
form a partnership or joint venture for search-related
advertising to take on Google Inc (GOOG.O), which dominates the
search market with a share significantly larger than a combined
Yahoo and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its part, Yahoo continues to talk with Google Inc
(GOOG.O) about a search advertising partnership and a deal
could come as early as this week, a source familiar with the
talks said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The statement from Microsoft comes on the heels of a proxy
campaign launched on Thursday by Icahn to replace Yahoo's board
with directors who would reopen talks with Microsoft, saying
Yahoo had acted irrationally in refusing the giant software
company's $47.5 billion bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft walked away from its pursuit of Yahoo two weeks
ago after three months of negotiations when Yahoo's board
rejected Microsoft's sweetened offer of $33 a share, saying the
company was worth at least $37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Microsoft and Icahn have not held discussions
about Yahoo, said another source close to the company. A
spokesman for Yahoo declined to comment and Icahn could not be
reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a letter to Icahn last week, Yahoo board Chairman Roy
Bostock said a new board would not be in the best interests of
Yahoo investors, adding that Yahoo would consider any deal from
any party, including Microsoft, if it offered the company full
value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn, who has said he had accumulated 59 million shares
and options in Yahoo, also has the support of Paulson  Co, a
$30 billion hedge fund that has amassed a 3.4 percent stake in
Yahoo, and other investors upset by the board's handling of
negotiations with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft had said it had moved on from Yahoo and remained
committed to building an online advertising powerhouse to rival
Google. Company executives had said in making a case for a
Yahoo acquisition that buying the web company would be the
fastest way to close the gap on Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an e-mail to employees on Sunday, Kevin Johnson,
president of Microsoft's platform and services division, said
the company must strengthen its online business regardless of
how talks with Yahoo turn out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fact is that we are not where we want to be in this
business yet and we've been in this position longer than we'd
all like," Johnson wrote in the e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kim Caughey, a senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group,
said the market will probably send Yahoo shares higher while
pushing down Microsoft shares when the market opens on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caughey said a joint venture or minority investment with
Yahoo could cause confusion about who was in charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft walking away from Yahoo was a total head fake,"
said Caughey. "Microsoft is a terrible poker player if it
thought people were going to believe that the deal was dead."

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Sunday it is in contact with Yahoo Inc about an alternative deal that would not involve a full acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a move could save Yahoo from fighting a proxy battle with financier Carl Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following is a timeline of key events in Microsoft's pursuit of Yahoo, stretching back more than two years, when Yahoo's financial results began weakening and private talks started in which Microsoft sought to merge with the web pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early 2006 - Yahoo begins to report a string of disappointing quarterly results that stretches over the next two years, reflecting competitive missteps by the company, market share gains by rival Google Inc, changes in the online advertising landscape and weakening spending in some ad segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late 2006/early 2007 - Microsoft and Yahoo discuss various partnerships, including a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February - Yahoo, under the leadership of previous Chief Executive Terry Semel, tells Microsoft it is not the right time to discuss a takeover, as the Yahoo board sees great potential from new advertising technology and internal changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 12 - A strong minority of Yahoo shareholders challenges Yahoo's direction, as CEO Semel comes under fire. Nearly a third of votes cast at the company's annual shareholder meeting oppose some of Yahoo's directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 18 - Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang takes over as chief executive as Semel steps aside. Semel remains Yahoo chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 31 - Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer makes a $44.6 billion, $31-per-share cash-and-stock takeover offer to Yahoo's board. Semel resigns as chairman and is replaced by Roy Bostock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 1 - Microsoft makes the offer public. Its shares fall 6.6 percent to $30.45; Yahoo shares rise 48 percent to $28.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 11 - Yahoo rejects the Microsoft offer as too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 13 - MySpace owner News Corp and Yahoo discuss a tie-up, according to a source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 18 - Yahoo gives financial forecasts for the next two years, in an effort to prove it is worth more than Microsoft bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 28 - One of seven face-to-face meetings takes place between the "senior-most" executives of Microsoft and Yahoo to discuss the bid. Yahoo asks how Microsoft would handle regulatory issues, including antitrust concerns, tied to a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 4 - People familiar with the matter say Microsoft is evaluating its bid for Yahoo because the Internet company may have lost value since Microsoft first made its offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 5 - Microsoft sets a three-week deadline for Yahoo to negotiate and reach a deal or face a proxy fight and a possible cut to the bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 7 - Yahoo again rejects Microsoft and says it is open to a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 9 - Yahoo says it will test Google search ads on its site, which could be more lucrative than selling its own search ads. Sources say Yahoo and Time Warner Inc are in parallel talks to join Time Warner's AOL and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 15 - At another meeting between  Yahoo and Microsoft executives and their financial advisers, Yahoo asks about Microsoft's integration plans and Yahoo raises a list of "key non-price deal terms" it believes are critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 26 - Microsoft's deadline to Yahoo passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 30 - Ballmer flies to California for talks with Yahoo CEO Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 3 - Yang meets Ballmer in Seattle. Microsoft raises its offer to $33 per share, or $47.5 billion. That is about $5 billion over the value of the previous offer at the time. Yahoo wants $37 per share, or about $5 billion more. Late in the day, Ballmer calls off the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 15 - Carl Icahn proposes a 10-member dissident board slate for election at Yahoo's annual shareholder meeting in July. Icahn says he now holds a 4.3 percent stake in Yahoo, including 9.9 million shares and 49 million call options. Yahoo Chairman Bostock replies to Icahn that "none of the alternatives we are considering would preclude us from entering into a transaction with Microsoft or any other party."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 18 - Microsoft says it has raised with Yahoo an "alternative" deal that would not involve the software maker buying all of the web company but says it could reconsider pursuing a full acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 3 - Yahoo's annual meeting is planned for July 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources: Letters between Microsoft, Yahoo and Icahn; Reuters stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Compiled by Eric Auchard and Peter Henderson; Editing by Braden Reddall and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is considering and has raised with Yahoo an alternative that would involve a transaction with Yahoo but not an acquisition of all of Yahoo," the company said in a statement without clarifying what that alternative might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft emphasized it was not proposing to make a new bid to buy all of Yahoo "but reserves the right to reconsider that alternative" depending on discussions with Yahoo, shareholders of Yahoo or Microsoft, or other third parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with Microsoft's thinking said Yahoo was responsive to Microsoft's latest proposal but emphasized that discussions between the two companies may not result in a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York Times reported that Microsoft and Yahoo may form a partnership or joint venture for search-related advertising to take on Google Inc, which dominates the search market with a share significantly larger than a combined Yahoo and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Yahoo continues to talk with Google Inc about a search advertising partnership and a deal could come as early as this week, a source familiar with the talks said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The statement from Microsoft comes on the heels of a proxy campaign launched on Thursday by Icahn to replace Yahoo's board with directors who would reopen talks with Microsoft, saying Yahoo had acted irrationally in refusing the giant software company's $47.5 billion bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft walked away from its pursuit of Yahoo two weeks ago after three months of negotiations when Yahoo's board rejected Microsoft's sweetened offer of $33 a share, saying the company was worth at least $37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Microsoft and Icahn have not held discussions about Yahoo, said another source close to the company. A spokesman for Yahoo declined to comment and Icahn could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim Caughey, a senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, said the market will probably send Yahoo shares higher while pushing down Microsoft shares when the market opens on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caughey said a joint venture or minority investment with Yahoo could cause confusion about who was in charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft walking away from Yahoo was a total head fake," said Caughey. "Microsoft is a terrible poker player if it thought people were going to believe that the deal was dead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; additional reporting by Anupreeta Das and by Sinead Carew in New York; editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; SAN DIEGO (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney is bridging the gap 
between gaming and virtual worlds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney Interactive Studios on Thursday formally launched 
DGamer, a free avatar-based community for U.S. buyers of games 
the company developed for the handheld Nintendo DS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beginning with Friday's release of "The Chronicles of 
Narnia: Prince Caspian" in tandem with the theatrical release 
of the fantasy sequel, all Disney Interactive DS games will 
come with DGamer-added content like customizable avatars. 
DGamer members also will be able to use the WiFi connectivity 
of the DS to communicate with other members with either a DS or 
a PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although it features avatars and text chat, DGamer can't 
really be described as a true virtual world such as Disney 
Online's Club Penguin or Fairies.com -- at least not yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But as Paul Yanover, executive vp and managing director of 
Disney Online, noted, "DGamer is our opportunity to work with 
Disney Interactive to make sure we have this connected 
environment and to make sure we reach our guests wherever they 
are, including a player on a Disney Interactive DS title 
talking to a player in 'Pirates of the Caribbean Online."'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Cole, president of video game market research firm 
DFC Intelligence, noted other publishers, including Nintendo, 
have leveraged the WiFi connectivity of the DS for game play 
and to share game characters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he said Disney Interactive deserves credit for being 
the first to formalize a virtual community around the DS, 
adding DGamer appears to be a good fit for the parent company's 
overall online strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Disney has been fairly aggressive in creating virtual 
communities across the board," Cole added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2007, Disney sold 3.4 million units of Nintendo DS video 
games in the U.S. alone, according to consulting firm NPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DGamer members will be able to customize their avatars 
using parts and clothing not just from the DS game they're 
currently playing, but also from other well-known Disney 
characters such as Buzz Lightyear and Tinker Bell. In addition, 
the honors by which all DGamer members are measured will be 
cumulative, encouraging players to purchase and play as many 
Disney Interactive DS titles as they can.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The avatars, game results, honors and virtual gifts can 
also be ported to other DS owners who have joined DGamer, as 
well as to the PC-based Dgamer.com site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Interactive senior producer Michelle Golding said 
the company also plans to send such additional content as 
player polls and surveys to members through the DS WiFi 
connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Noting that the target DGamer audience is tweens, Golding 
said Disney Interactive is leveraging the parental controls 
from Disney.com to ensure players communicate in a safe 
environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financier Carl Icahn launched a campaign to replace Yahoo Inc's board with directors who would reopen talks with Microsoft Corp, saying Yahoo acted "irrationally" in refusing the software company's $47.5 billion bid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Icahn harshly criticized Yahoo for the breakdown in talks this month, saying he had accumulated 59 million shares and options in Yahoo and had assembled a 10-member dissident board slate for election at Yahoo's annual meeting on July 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter to Yahoo's board, Icahn said that directors had "acted irrationally and lost the faith of shareholders and Microsoft. It is obvious that Microsoft's bid of $33 per share is a superior alternative than Yahoo's prospects on a stand alone basis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within hours, Yahoo board Chairman Roy Bostock responded with a letter to Icahn saying the financier's plans were not in the best interests of investors as Yahoo remained "willing to consider any proposal from any party including Microsoft if it offers our stockholders full and certain value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's board has met 20 times in recent months to consider options, including Microsoft's bid. The top managers of Yahoo and Microsoft met face-to-face seven times, the letter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Icahn left the door open for a settlement instead of a full-out proxy battle where both sides typically spend millions of dollars and unleash a barrage of attacks on each other. Icahn urged Yahoo to "move expeditiously to negotiate a merger with Microsoft, thereby making a proxy fight unnecessary."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based billionaire's move garnered public support from at least one other large investor. Paulson  Co, a $30 billion hedge fund that raked in billions of dollars betting on the credit meltdown, disclosed on Thursday that it had amassed a 3.4 percent Yahoo stake worth $1.44 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We intend to support the Icahn slate, but sincerely hope Yahoo will negotiate an agreement with Microsoft, thereby making a proxy fight unnecessary," said Paulson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman Frank Shaw declined to comment on Icahn's move and reiterated the line Microsoft has used since talks with Yahoo ended. "The company has moved on," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft walked away after negotiating for three months in hopes of clinching a deal to form a counterweight in Web search and online advertising to market leader Google Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's final $33-per-share offer wasn't enough to sway Yahoo co-founder and Chief Executive Jerry Yang, who wanted $37 a share. The stock traded around $19 prior to Microsoft's bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Yahoo shares closed up 2.3 percent at $27.75, while Microsoft rose 1.7 percent to $30.45, both on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ROUGH ROAD FOR YANG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry watchers said Yang faces a rougher road dealing with Icahn, a blunt-spoken financier known for bare-knuckle takeover tactics, than with Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Jerry Yang had a tough time dealing with Steve, wait till he meets Carl Icahn," said Colin Gillis, a Canaccord Adams analyst.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bigger threat, said Gillis, will be if Microsoft is unwilling to come back to the table. "It's not clear that he has a buyer. We think that Microsoft has really walked away."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others said there is a reasonable chance of revived talks, arguing that the strategic rationale for Microsoft's initial interest in Yahoo hasn't changed in the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proxy contest gives new wind to annoyed shareholders who felt Yang overplayed his hand in turning down Microsoft's $33 per share offer, holding out for a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view this as a very positive development," said a portfolio manager at a large investment firm that holds Yahoo shares. "Getting some new blood on the board would be very beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'WIN-WIN' FOR HOLDERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn said he sought clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to buy up to about $2.5 billion in Yahoo stock. In a regulatory filing, he said he now holds 4.3 percent, including 9.9 million shares and 49 million call options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One analyst said things are now looking up for Yahoo stockholders. Shares jumped from $19.18 prior to Microsoft's initial $31-per-share bid to nearly $30 in early February, only to dive to about $24 when talks collapsed on May 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Barring procedural objections, (Yahoo investors) are now in an almost win-win situation," Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Jeffrey Lindsay wrote in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Either the existing Yahoo management team now proposes an alternative -- most likely a paid search outsourcing deal with Google. Or the Icahn slate gets elected and reopens negotiations to sell the company to Microsoft," Lindsay said. "Icahn's bid now forces the issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icahn's slate of nominees includes himself, Frank Biondi, a former Viacom Inc chief, and Keith Meister, vice chairman of Icahn Enterprises LP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Cuban, owner of the Dallas Mavericks professional basketball team and co-founder of cable network HDNet, is also on Icahn's slate. Cuban struck it rich after he sold Broadcast.com to Yahoo in 1999 for about $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other nominees include Harvard corporate governance expert Lucian Bebchuk; John Chapple, former CEO of Nextel Partners; Adam Dell, a venture capitalist and brother of computer tycoon Michael Dell; Edward Meyer, former CEO of advertising firm Grey Global Group; hedge fund manager Brian Posner; and Robert Shaye, former co-CEO of Time Warner's New Line Cinema.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kenneth Li and Michele Gershberg in New York, Eric Auchard in San Francisco, Svea Herbst-Bayliss in Boston and Diane Bartz in Washington, D.C.; Editing by Jeffrey Benkoe and Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has proposed to buy Yahoo Inc's search business and take a minority stake in the Web pioneer, stopping short of a full-out merger, a person familiar with the discussions said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Yahoo would sell its Asian assets including significant minority stakes in Yahoo Japan and China's Alibaba Group, while Microsoft would buy a chunk of what remains of the company, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks were revealed by the two companies on Sunday, but they declined to reveal the terms of the discussions. Earlier this month, Microsoft walked away from a proposal to acquire Yahoo for $47.5 billion, or $33 per share, after Yahoo rebuffed the offer, saying it would only settle for $37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new deal, if completed, would forge an alliance between the two companies that would represent an alternative means of competing with rival Google Inc, whose ubiquitous search engine has made it an online advertising powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal represents an outline of Microsoft's current thinking and it does not yet put a value on Yahoo's search business, said the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record because the discussions are confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo representatives declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo fell as much as 0.87 percent on Monday, before closing up 2 cents at $27.68 on Nasdaq. Microsoft dropped 1.8 percent to $29.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins Stewart analyst Sandeep Aggarwal estimates Yahoo's search advertising business is worth about $21 billion, while putting the value of its  international assets at $9.25 billion, according to a research note he published on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is the most interested in Yahoo Search," said Aggarwal, who added that Microsoft may buy parts of Yahoo for a premium or buy all of Yahoo and then spin off certain assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said on Sunday that it was talking with Yahoo about an alternative transaction that did not involve a full buyout after withdrawing its sweetened $47.5 billion bid for the company on May 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHASING GOOGLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is a distant second to Google Inc in Web search in the United States, and Microsoft is third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined, Yahoo and Microsoft would have around a 30 percent U.S. share, compared with Google's roughly 60 percent, according to figures from research firm comScore. Google's lead is even larger on a global basis, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal from Microsoft would likely complicate ongoing discussions between Yahoo and Google. The two companies are still talking about a possible search advertising partnership, people familiar with those discussions have told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between Yahoo and Microsoft resumed after Microsoft insisted for two weeks that it had moved on from its pursuit of Yahoo, prompting shareholders of the Web company to criticize its board for mishandling negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financier Carl Icahn launched a proxy fight last week to force Yahoo to reopen talks with Microsoft. Icahn, who owns nearly 10 million Yahoo shares as well as options to acquire another 49 million shares, formally filed on Monday the preliminary proxy to nominate 10 directors to Yahoo's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with Icahn's thinking said on Sunday that an alternative deal for Yahoo, rather than a full acquisition, would prompt the investor to push Yahoo to do a deal with Google. Icahn did not comment on the talks between Microsoft and Yahoo in his filing on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Alibaba, the private holding company whose assets include Alibaba.com Ltd, has been lining up investors to help it buy back the Yahoo stake, sources told Reuters earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's core franchise stems from the roughly 500 million Web users who pass through its network of Internet media properties each month. Major attractions include Yahoo Mail, news, sports, entertainment and its Flickr.com photo site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It generates most of its revenue through sales of display advertising to those visitors, as well as making an increasing push to sell ads on non-Yahoo sites. As the No. 2 provider of Web search services, Yahoo also sells ads alongside search results and on a variety of affiliated sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in New York and Daisuke Wakabayashi in Los Angeles; editing by Carol Bishopric, Jeffrey Benkoe, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Option investors bet heavily on Monday that Yahoo Inc might strike a deal of some sort with Microsoft Corp, spurred on in part by pressure from activist shareholder Carl Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has proposed an alternative deal for Yahoo, a complex transaction that would include just buying Yahoo's search business, rather than a full buyout, a person familiar with the discussions said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal, Microsoft would also buy a minority stake in what remains of the company after Yahoo sells its Asian assets, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of software giant Microsoft and Yahoo, the No. 2 U.S. search engine after Google Inc, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The question now is what form this deal will take," said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at online brokerage thinkorswim Inc in Chicago. "During Monday's (option) trading, the perception was that this deal would get done at $30 (per share) or better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it proposed an alternative deal to Yahoo over the weekend, rather than a full acquisition of Yahoo as it had originally proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares rose almost 2 cents to close at $27.68 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Icahn holdings in shares, options)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Doris Frankel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO May 19 (Reuters) - Option investors bet heavily on
Monday that Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) might strike a deal of some sort
with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O), spurred on in part by pressure
from activist shareholder Carl Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has proposed an alternative deal for Yahoo, a
complex transaction that would include just buying Yahoo's
search business, rather than a full buyout, a person familiar
with the discussions said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the deal, Microsoft would also buy a minority
stake in what remains of the company after Yahoo sells its    
Asian assets, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representatives of software giant Microsoft and Yahoo, the
No. 2 U.S. search engine after Google Inc (GOOG.O), declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The question now is what form this deal will take," said
Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at online brokerage
thinkorswim Inc in Chicago. "During Monday's (option) trading,
the perception was that this deal would get done at $30 (per
share) or better."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it proposed an alternative deal to Yahoo
over the weekend, rather than a full acquisition of Yahoo as it
had originally proposed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares rose almost 2 cents to close at $27.68 on
Nasdaq. In the U.S. options market, roughly 169,000 calls and
163,000 puts traded in Yahoo, below its average daily volume
430,000 contracts, according to option analytics firm Trade
Alert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a large part of the put volume was mainly due to more
than 57,000 lots traded in the July $27.50 puts, which might
have been sold as part of a large spread or a closing trade,
both of which are typically perceived as bullish transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speculators bought June and July calls allowing them to buy
Yahoo shares from $27.50 to $32.50 on hopes of making a profit
if the deal commences at those prices or better, Kinahan
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We were really active in buying July $30 and $32.50 calls.
My customers believe that there will be some positive outcome
in the Yahoo shareholders meeting due on July 3," said an
options trader who declined to be identified. "Traders are also
rolling over their June positions into July in anticipation of
that meeting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICAHN FACTOR&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest tactic in Microsoft's pursuit of Yahoo comes as
the Internet media company faces a bruising proxy battle with
financier Icahn, who wants to install his own slate of Yahoo
directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn filed a preliminary proxy on Monday to nominate 10
directors to Yahoo's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the filing, Icahn disclosed he owns nearly 10 million
Yahoo shares, as well as call options allowing him to acquire
another 49 million shares in the company. Together, they would
give him a 4.3 percent stake in Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clearly there are investors out there who think Icahn's

$31," Schwartz added.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Camillus Eboh&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA May 19 (Reuters) - Nigeria signed a $2 billion deal
with ExxonMobil (XOM.N) on Monday to help plug a funding gap
which has delayed some of their joint venture projects, the
country's state-run oil firm NNPC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is the second such agreement in less than a week
between the world's eighth biggest oil exporter and one of the
five joint venture partners with which it operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreements are meant to help solve chronic funding
shortfalls in Nigeria's oil industry which, along with attacks
by militants on industry installations, have helped depress
output by a fifth since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This funding will be used to finance major oil and gas
upstream development projects," Levi Ajuonuma, spokesman for
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The funding challenges of the NNPC/MPN (Mobil Producing
Nigeria) joint venture have been put to rest," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the deal, ExxonMobil will loan the money to NNPC to
fund its portion of joint venture projects this year. The state
firm will pay the loans back in cash and not with crude oil, as
had been the case in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NNPC said the "modified carry agreement" -- similar to a $1
billion deal signed with French energy group Total (TOTF.PA)
last Friday -- introduced a greater level of transparency with
repayment being in cash rather than crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The compensation is also competitive and comparable to a
bank loan," it said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Umaru Yar'Adua has been keen to bridge the
funding gap in Nigeria's mainstay oil industry through private
sector financing since he took power about a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But carry agreements are only a short-term solution to the
funding shortfalls, which are preventing the Nigerian industry
from reaching its full output potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy Minister Odein Ajumogobia said last month Nigeria
also planned to raise cash on both the international and local
capital markets to help fund the joint venture projects and
avoid future shortfalls.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects rezoning details in 10th paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joan Gralla&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 19 (Reuters) - New York's Metropolitan
Transit Agency on Monday said it reached an agreement to
develop a major tract of land on Manhattan's West Side with
Related Companies and Goldman Sachs (GS.N) , just six days
after the agency's deal with Tishman Speyer failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the $1 billion deal, Related Companies, a New
York-based property developer, and Goldman Sachs will build
five towers housing a total of 6.27 million square feet of
residential and commercial space above the MTA's railyards in
west Midtown Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The MTA said its board could initially approve the 99-year
lease that matches the "business and legal terms" of the $1
billion deal it had with Tishman Speyer as soon as Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Related Cos, which developed Manhattan's Time Warner Center
located at Colombus Circle, had been one of the original
bidders to develop the 26-acre site -- one of the largest
under-developed tracts in Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new plan includes a "grand civic plaza," along with
1.67 million square feet of apartments, 3.57 million square
feet of offices, 565,000 square feet of shops, and a 265,000
square foot hotel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The apartments would include 1,522 rental and condominium
units. Some 200,000 square feet of the total space would be
used for a community or cultural center.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The delays in developing the rail yards, where a developer
will must build a costly platform to support the new complex,
and the cooling real estate market have prompted Gov. David
Paterson to warn that there is not enough money to pay for all
of the public projects planned over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The collapse of the Tishman Speyer deal was a harsh blow
for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who says the Hudson Yards
is the city's most important project. The city has sold $2
billion of bonds to pay for a new subway link for the area --
and it must start repaying the interest starting July 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bloomberg, in a statement said: "The attractiveness of this
area for developers stems in part because the City is funding
an extension of the Number Seven subway line, making this vital
new mixed-use community of residential, commercial and office
space a truly transit oriented development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To date, only the eastern half of the MTA site has been
rezoned to accommodate a dense, mixed-used development. The MTA
had said its deal with Tishman Speyer collapsed because Tishman
Speyer had insisted on delaying the deal's closing until the
western half of the site was also rezoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The City Council has the last word on rezoning, a process
that can take 18 months or longer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to New York, Related Cos. has operations in
California, Florida and elsewhere in the United States.

Days 1 and 2: May 20 (8:30 am to 5 pm ET) and May 21 (8:30 am to 12:30
 pm ET)

Day 1: TUESDAY, MAY 20
8:30-8:45      Opening Remarks: Nancy Kramer--CEO and Founder,
                Resource Interactive


8:45-9:15      iTalk: Kelly Mooney--President and CXO, Resource
                Interactive, co-author of The Open Brand

            Topic: The Open Imperative
            What began as a digital movement championing the values of
             participation, collaboration, transparency and
             authenticity has emerged as a macrotrend. Widening our
             view of openness to spheres ranging from politics to
             environmentalism will prepare us for the next phase of
             the web--the open web, with its interoperable ecosystem
             and new consumer experiences.

9:15-10:15     Keynote: Joseph Jaffe--Author, Join the Conversation

            Topic: Are You Still Just Communicating?
            All movements have a guru and Jaffe is leading the charge
             of conversational marketing by urging marketers to cease
             the monologue and join the dialogue. Case studies,
             cautionary tales and a thorough how-to approach help
             marketers make the most of the social web.

10:45-11:45    Panel: And Community Makes Three

            Moderator: Susan Ashley--Executive Director, Client
             Services, Resource Interactive
            Adam Brown--Director, Digital Communications, The Coca-
             Cola Company
            Jan Valentic--SVP of Marketing, The Scotts Miracle-Gro
             Company
            Stan Joosten--Innovation Manager, Holistic Consumer
             Communication, Procter &amp; Gamble
            Megabrands like The Coca-Cola Company, P and Scotts have
             been talking with individual consumers for ages, but with
             the power of consumer communities, even the seasoned pros
             have to reinvent everything from organizational
             structures to entirely new consumer-facing roles.

12:00 -1:30    Lunch Speaker: Marsha Collier--Author, over 15 books on
                eBay

            Topic: My Life as an iCitizen
            One of the world's most recognized eBay authorities shares
             her success story--how she used the tools of the social
             web to redefine her career and how eBay embraced her
             efforts.

1:30-2:30      Keynote: Duncan Watts--Principal Research Scientist,
                Yahoo! Research

            Topic: Influential or Insignificant?
            Duncan rivets us with his empirical approach and
             application of network theory to sociology. So when he
             encourages brands to extend the conversation beyond the
             elite few and interact with networks on a vaster,
             exponential level, we can't help but listen.

2:30-3:00      iTalk: Steve Knox--CEO, Tremor

            Topic: Lynchpins of Communication
            Steve and the crack team at Tremor believe in the power of
             the influential and have built brands connecting with
             these elusive individuals using the tools of the social
             web. Just how much influence do they really offer anyway?

3:30-4:30      Panel: What Consumers Can Do

            Moderator: Molly Metzger - Innovation Consultant, Resource
             Interactive
            Sam Decker--CMO, Bazaarvoice
            Tim Smith--Chief Strategy Officer, Lemonade, Inc.
            Manish Chandra--CEO, Kaboodle
            Adam Weinroth--Director of Product Marketing, Pluck

            Even card-carrying believers of the value creation of
             online consumer advocates need to learn more about how to
             better support their efforts. The companies on this panel
             will share their unique approaches to word-of-mouth
             advocacy by tapping the consumer's motivation to create,
             share and influence.

4:30-5:00      iTalk: Tom Venable--EVP, InnoCentive

            Topic: The Allure of Open Innovation
            Through an open call, progressive organizations can fast-

            Web visionary Searls isn't much interested in making the
             current ad-centric "attention economy" more engaging. He
             wants to replace it altogether with an "intention
             economy" that matches consumers' intent to purchase a
             specific product with any and all relevant brands. Is
             this nirvana for marketers or does this economy render
             them obsolete? And will Searls's Vendor Relationship
             Management get us there?

9:30-10:15     Panel: Personal &amp; Portable

            Moderator: Doc Searls--Harvard Fellow at the Berkman
             Center
            Rooley Eliezerov--President and Co-founder, Gigya
            Bill Washburn--Executive Director, Open ID
            Kelly O'Neill--Commerce Product Marketing Director, ATG

            Customer identity and content management helps merchants
             create the utmost in personalized shopping experiences at
             key online touchpoints, from e-commerce site to call
             center to email. What happens when personal identity data
             traverses the web freely, untethered to any single
             merchant's web site or campaigns? When it takes on the
             dimensions of a real human, with personal photos,
             shopping preferences, favorite web links and that
             individual's social graph? RSS and widgets have made
             portable data a reality, presaging a web that is fluid
             and interconnected. But the real value of data
             portability for brands and consumers can't be realized
             without widespread adoption of a shared system or
             language. Doc Searls leads this panel of insiders in a
             discussion of what's at stake and who stands to gain the
             most.

10:30-11:15    Panel: Have Phone, Will Travel (the Web)

            Moderator: Troy Gibson--Director, Technology, Resource
             Interactive
            John Harrobin--SVP of Marketing and Digital Media, Verizon
            Will Hodgman--CEO, M:Metrics
            Riccardo Spina--Formerly Senior Director of Digital Media,
             Integrated Marketing, Wal-Mart

            We're near the watershed moment for mobile in the US, as
             data services finally catch hold. So what applications
             will your consumers want most? How should you use text,
             advertising and search for more consumer value? What kind
             of content is right for the small screen? Hear the
             experts discuss ways to integrate mobile into your
             consumer's brand experience and what technologies you'll
             need to support it.

11:15-11:45    iTalk: Avinash Kaushik--Analytics Evangelist, Google

            Topic: A Battle Cry for Qualitative Metrics
            Author, blogger and analytics evangelist Avinash shares
             his unique insider's perspective on metrics that matter
             and metrics that are missing, or rather, what management
             misses when they train their gaze exclusively on a web
             site's macroconversions. "Microconversions" measure all
             the other valuable on-site behavior unrelated to
             purchase, and Avinash thinks it's time we got on with the
             revolution in qualitative metrics and analytics, if we're
             to do justice to consumer engagement.

11:45-12:30    Panel: Who Keeps Moving the Goalpost?

            Moderator: Laura Evans--Executive Director, Retail
             Practice, Resource Interactive
            Dr. Robert Leone--Professor, Texas Christian University
            Pete Blackshaw--CMO, Nielsen Online
            Steve Kahn--VP of Internet Marketing, DSW
            Paul Horstmeier--VP of HP.com, Hewlett-Packard

            While some marketers focus on engagement, others have
             singled out consumer advocacy as the online behavior most
             worth measuring. Still others care only about
             straightforward satisfaction scores and conversion rates.
             It's clear that choosing the appropriate framework takes
             work, and this panel's experts represent the full range
             of approaches, from customer referral value to buzz
             monitoring to click-through rates, email and e-commerce
             conversion rates, and the latest advertising metric: Pay-
             for-Performance.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 At its annual IBM Pulse Conference in Orlando, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced
new software designed to help customers address the growing need to maximize
energy
efficiency and reduce costs associated with power and cooling. The software is
part of IBM's Project Big Green initiative in which IBM has committed $1 billion
per year to deliver technologies that help customers increase energy
efficiency in their data centers and physical plants.

    This latest version of IBM Tivoli Monitoring (ITM) software consolidates
views of
energy management information that enable optimization across data centers and
facilities infrastructures. Monitoring capabilities offer customers the ability
to understand energy usage to alert data center managers to potential
energy-related problems and take preventive action. Historical trending and
forecasting capabilities enable greater precision in existing environments and
energy planning. Autonomic capabilities allow customers to set power and
utilization thresholds to help control energy usage. The new software can also
help customers handle physical constraints in the data center relating to space,
power and cooling.

    IBM is combining the new energy management software with partner solutions
to
provide customers with a comprehensive view of energy consumption across the
enterprise -- not just in data centers but also in non-IT assets such as air
conditioning equipment, power distribution units, lighting, and security
systems.

    According to a 2007 EPA research(1) report, U.S. energy consumption by
servers and data centers is expected to nearly double in the next five years.

    "Customers today are faced with an array of energy challenges such as
increased power and cooling costs, exceeding power capacity, and an
inability to monitor and plan for power consumption," said Al Zollar, General
Manager, IBM Tivoli. "IBM's new software offers the tools needed to monitor
and manage power usage. Together with our partners, we are able to expand on
our data center management capabilities to include facility management that
provides customers with a holistic view of energy consumption and its potential
impact on their businesses."

    Generally, more than 50 percent of the energy consumed by data centers is
now utilized for power and cooling infrastructures. IBM's new software provides
the foundation of efficient data center energy management going beyond a single
vendor solution by providing an interface that can be used with partners for
visibility into comprehensive power, thermal and environmental data.

    By combining the ITM energy management software with partner solutions,
customers
can capture operating and performance data from data centers and non-IT
assets and use this information to analyze events and alerts, correlate with
end-user application performance, and associate with service levels to take
preventive action that can result in lower energy consumption while helping to
enhance the quality of IT services delivery.

    As part of today's announcement, IBM will join forces with nine partners
tooffer IBM's IT management expertise with partner solutions that will allow
customers to monitor and control energy consumption across their
enterpriseto help reduce power consumption and energy costs and better maintain
service
levels. The partners include:


--  APC and TAC by Schneider Electric:  APC, an integrated critical power
    and cooling services provider, and TAC, a building environment services
    provider, are combining APC's InfraStruXure Central(R) and TAC building
    management systems with ITM energy management software. This integration
    will help administrators view, correlate and profile the dependencies of
    business process and IT assets to the underlying physical infrastructure to
    help manage risk and increase data center availability and energy
    efficiency.
--  Eaton Corporation: Integrated with ITM energy management software,
    Eaton's Power Xpert(R) Software, Foreseer Class is a browser-based solution
    that helps ease energy management by providing a clearer picture of energy
    consumption and utilization at a component, device and system level. By
    gathering, presenting and analyzing power usage data in detail, customers
    can more easily identify opportunities for cost savings, downtime
    prevention and energy efficiency.
--  Emerson Network Power: By leveraging ITM energy management software
    with Liebert SiteScan from Emerson Network Power, customers can enhance
    their infrastructure management capabilities with alerts regarding energy-
    related issues with facilities equipment, such as overheating or low power
    on uninterruptible power supply batteries, as well as providing for
    corrective or preventive actions to be taken to help optimize for energy
    efficiency.
--  Johnson Controls, Inc.:  ITM energy management software combined with
    the energy monitoring and control features of Johnson Controls Metasys(R)
    building management system is a web-enabled offering that allows customers
    to make real-time decisions about whether to scale back data center power
    consumption, make informed decisions about allocation of energy consuming
    assets based on priority needs of the business, and make faster failover
    decisions to help maintain uninterrupted performance of critical IT
    services.
--  Matrikon: MatrikonOPC interfaces enable raw data flow into ITM energy
    management software from third party systems and building automation
    devices such as heating and air conditioning, lighting and fire and
    security alarms.
--  OSIsoft: Leveraging ITM energy management software, the OSIsoft PI
    System and library of over 480 interfaces deliver real-time and high
    fidelity historical data visibility within the enterprise data center by
    consolidating operational data control systems into a single view,
    unlocking multi-vendor silos and enabling customers to capture and analyze
    data from data centers as well as building automation systems.
--  Siemens Building Technologies: By integrating building automation
    systems with ITM energy management software, Siemens can help customers
    translate related building systems and facility data into more cost-
    effective site-wide operational efficiencies. Leveraging this information
    effectively requires more than interfacing technologies and the Siemens
    solution provides customers with broad facility sub-systems integration
    experience to help them realize the financial and operational benefits of
    total facility optimization.
--  SynapSense Corporation: SynapSense sensor technology is combined with
    ITM energy management software to offer customers real-time data center
    monitoring and energy management capabilities for both the data center as
    well as building facilities. By pairing ITM software with SynapSense
    technology, customers can better identify inefficiencies in the data center
    operations and drive real-time, corrective actions that can reduce energy
    and help significantly improve resiliency.
--  VMware: VMware's virtualization technology and ITM energy management
    software work together to drive intelligent, dynamic consolidation of
    customers' application workloads onto fewer servers, as well as power down
    under-utilized servers. IBM and VMware's complementary technologies can
    further optimize virtual data center power consumption while maintaining
    service commitments to the business.
    

    
"IBM is making a strategic move to apply its breadth of data center
management capabilities to partner solutions that will help customers monitor
energy consumption across IT and facility resources such air conditioning
units and lighting," said Rich Ptak, co-founder and analyst at Ptak, Noel &amp;
Associates LLC.  "By creating one cohesive view of energy consumption across the
enterprise, customers will be able to use the new IBM Tivoli Monitoring
energy management software to manage power usage and predict potential
energy-related events. This allows staff to make the IT decisions and energy
allocations necessary to maintain service levels. This is a giant step in
energy management as it brings data center and facility management together to
help increase energy efficient operation across the enterprise."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced open client and partner testing of the new
IBM(R) Optim(TM) Data Privacy Solution for use with SAP(R) solutions, which
provides advanced enterprise data management and data privacy capabilities in
support of SAP applications.

    The IBM Optim Data Privacy Solution offers data masking techniques to
protect privacy in the more vulnerable development, testing and training
environments. This capability goes beyond the typical controls and
authorization strategies available to protect application data in SAP
solution-based production environments.

    "Today, it is imperative that companies implement comprehensive data
protection strategies across their enterprise IT environments, with protecting
data privacy as one of the key components," stated Jim Lee, Director of Optim
Product Line Management for IBM. "Optim provides powerful data transformation
capabilities to mask personal information, so that companies can use it safely
for application testing. And with Optim's capabilities to scale across an
enterprise, companies can quickly achieve measurable benefits. IBM remains
committed to delivering solutions that help ease the pains associated with
privacy compliance, now and moving forward."

    The Optim Data Privacy Solution for use with SAP solutions addresses privacy
issues
by delivering application-specific templates that include predefined attributes,
for example to de-identify employee data in the SAP ERP Human Capital
Management solution. These capabilities enable customer sites to begin with the
most common attributes and customize as needed. With personal data masked across
all occurrences, developers and testers can use realistic test data and produce
valid test results, and still comply with privacy legislation.

    For instance, organizations can use the Optim software to mask names,
addresses,
national identification numbers, payment card and e-mail addresses, with a
fictitious, but contextually accurate substitute data. Companies also need to
adapt an enterprise focus for protecting privacy by deploying a consistent
data masking methodology across applications, platforms and operating
environments.

    "The introduction of the Optim Data Privacy Solution in support of SAP
applications enforces our commitment to expanding our Optim enterprise

&lt;p&gt;Advertising Celebrates Iconic Moments in Olympic History and the
                Athletes who Embody the Olympic Spirit
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), a Worldwide Olympic Partner for more than two
decades, today announced the launch of "Go World," a U.S. advertising
campaign that evokes the emotion and memories of unforgettable moments
in Olympic history. The campaign, featuring current Olympic and
Paralympic athletes and Olympic legends will include national
television commercials, print and online advertisements, and an online
microsite.

   "The Olympic Games begin and end with the athletes - a fact that
we at Visa have emphasized and celebrated during our 20-plus year
partnership with the Games," said Antonio Lucio, chief marketing
officer of Visa Inc. "The 'Go World' campaign captures the passion
that is unique to the Olympic Games by focusing attention on the
achievement of the human spirit as embodied in extraordinary athletes,
past and present."

   "Go World" creative sets itself apart from other recent
advertising campaigns through the use of striking sepia tones combined
with dramatic still photography and moving images from past Olympic
competitions. Together they capture the essence of iconic Olympic
moments.

   "Come Together," the first in a series of national television
commercials debuts tonight on CBS during "How I Met Your Mother." Four
additional spots featuring six-time gold medal swimmer Michael Phelps,
Paralympic track and field gold medalist Cheri Blauwet, gold medal
gymnast Kerri Strug and sprinter Derek Redmond will premiere
throughout the week. These spots highlight Phelps' superhuman
athleticism, Blauwet's many talents on and off the track, as well as
the heart and determination of U.S. gymnast Kerri Strug and English
sprinter Derek Redmond, who overcame devastating injuries to cement
their Olympic moments.

   Subsequent television and online creative will include Visa
sponsored athletes who are members of Team Visa Beijing including
Bryan Clay and Allyson Felix (track and field), Paul Hamm and Nastia
Liukin (gymnastics), Steven Lopez (taekwondo), Katie Hoff (swimming),
Bubba Harris (BMX Supercross), Kerri Walsh (beach volleyball) as well
as Paralympian Marlon Shirley (track and field). Legendary track and
field Olympians such as Bob Beamon, Dick Fosbury and Jim Thorpe will
also be featured in upcoming spots.

   Visa's Olympic television commercials will air leading up to and
during NBC's broadcast of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, where Visa
will enjoy category exclusivity for the duration of the Games.

   Fans can also visit
http://usa.visa.com/microsites/goworld/?ep=v_sym_goworld to view the
ads and learn more about the heroic feats of Olympians featured in the
campaign. In the coming weeks, fans will be able to submit stories
about Olympic moments that have inspired them for a chance to be
featured on the website alongside sporting greats.

   Visa's Olympic Sponsorship

   Since 1986, Visa has empowered more than 1,000 Olympic and
Paralympic hopefuls to achieve their dreams by providing financial
support, life skills training and valuable marketing exposure in
pursuit of their Olympic goals. In the run-up to the Beijing 2008
Olympic and Paralympic Games, Visa has been supporting more than 90
individual athletes from 19 different countries, all with the
potential to be selected for their national teams for the Beijing 2008
Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games.

   "For more than two decades Visa has proudly and successfully
linked our brand with the Olympic Movement to promote, enhance and
reinforce preference for our products and services," added Lucio.
"Importantly, our Olympic partnership not only benefits Visa's
business, it has enabled thousands of merchants and financial
institutions to associate with the Games and participate in business
building marketing programs."

   In advance of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, Visa is working with
more than 380 of its financial institution clients in 66 countries to
offer Visa cardholders the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to attend
the Games this summer. Visa is also working with retail partners in 31
countries to help them generate business and excitement among their
customers in advance of the Olympic Games.

   Visa remains the only card that enables fans to get into the
Olympic Games at venues in Beijing and at select Olympic Trials in the
United States. This extends to the purchase of Olympic Games
merchandise online, in Olympic retail stores and by catalog. Thousands
of Visa-branded ATMs have been installed in and around Beijing,
including many at Olympic venues, for added cardholder convenience.
Visa Signature cardholders were given a unique opportunity to purchase
tickets to the Olympic Games before the general public and to receive
discounts on travel and hospitality packages for the Games.

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, May 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 At its PULSE 2008 conference, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new software
and services designed to help organizations improve the management and delivery
of
their business and IT services while reducing costs.

    IBM Service Management was developed to help address one of the biggest
challenges facing clients today: aligning business and IT processes to
support overall business goals while creating a greater view of the assets and
applications that support those goals and deploying automation to improve
efficiency, security and compliance control. The new offerings to help
clients include those covering:


--  Service Delivery and Process Automation
--  Application and System Management and Monitoring
--  Service Management Center for System z
--  Service Management Quick Start and Healthcheck
--  Tools and Accelerator Services
    

    
A recent IBM Global Business Services study of more than 1,100 CEOs
showedthat organizations are facing faster, broader and more complex change than
ever before. The study also indicates that organizations are struggling to
manage services in line with these changes. IBM Service Management
providesenhanced visibility, control and automation of services so decision
makers have
the knowledge and capability to deliver services that meet business goals and
cost
objectives.

    "IBM Service Management delivers a unique combination of the software,
services and
supporting hardware our clients need to improve the management of services
across
the enterprise," said Al Zollar, General Manager of IBM Tivoli Software.
"Just like Henry Ford did with the manufacture of automobiles in the early
19th Century, the goal of IBM Service Management is to industrialize services by
streamlining workflows and processes to provide repeatable, scalable and
consistent high-quality results."

    New Service Delivery and Process Automation Offering

    IBM's new Service Delivery and Process Automation solution is built on a
set of common capabilities, called the Tivoli Process Automation Platform. It
includes new releases of several products that complement IBM Tivoli Change and
Configuration Management Database, which provides IBM's vast application
discovery capabilities. The platform provides clients with an integrated
solution that helps improve their ability to deliver quality, efficient IT
services with a common way of defining, refining, linking, and automating
tasks and processes in the context of a common, federated and reconciled view
of their infrastructure and application relationships. It uses a single user
interface to help customers move from one process or task to another.

    IBM's enterprise asset solutions also are built on the Tivoli Process
Automation
Platform, enabling both IT and Enterprise Asset Maximo customers to automate and
converge enterprise asset processes and IT processes, at will, as enterprise
assets increasingly become IP-network-enabled. The new products supporting
this platform include:


--  IBM Tivoli Service Request Manager -- offering advanced and flexible
    service desk and catalog capabilities that help to improve problem
    resolution time while automating customer interaction with a built-in
    service catalog which provides on-line order fulfillment to expedite new
    service requests. It also provides computer telephony interchange support
    to automate call management and routing, auditable remote desktop takeover,
    knowledge management and bulletin boards to assist in self diagnosis and
    problem resolution, integration with Lotus Sametime, and a Web-based
    catalog with an integrated shopping cart function.

--  IBM Tivoli Asset Management for IT -- to help manage an IT asset's
    lifecycle, optimize sourcing and utilization, reduce asset costs and
    improve service levels.

--  IBM Maximo Asset Management -- to help improve the performance of
    assets and work management processes with comprehensive functionality
    around asset, work, contract, inventory, procurement and service management
    processes based on industry best practices. It supports asset lifecycle and
    maintenance management for all asset types from production equipment to
    linear assets, and now has new benefits around work management, job plans
    and reporting.

--  IBM Tivoli Business Continuity Process Manager -- to automate disaster
    recovery and improve speed and reliability of recovery tasks. It leverages
    data provided by automated discovery of IT infrastructure such as z/OS
    sysplexes, LPARs, z/OS subsystems, and GDPS K-systems, to enable rapid, out-
    of-the-box implementation of service continuity processes.
    

    
New Offerings in Application and System Management and Monitoring

    New software and services announced today help companies take advantage of
automation to improve management and monitoring of IT systems and
applications. These include:


--  IBM Tivoli System Automation Application Manager -- offering a single
    point of control for heterogeneous clustering technologies including
    Veritas Cluster Server, Microsoft Cluster Server, HACMP, and Tivoli System
    Automation. The user may easily coordinate the starting and stopping of
    services across zOS, zLinux and distributed platforms to reduce the
    frequency and duration of planned and unplanned outages.

--  IBM Tivoli Composite Application Manager (ITCAM) -- offering
    integrated role-based views for administrators of applications, servers and
    middleware to proactively monitor and maintain profitable customer
    transactions and services at optimal performance. This can help lower costs
    associated with managing complex IT infrastructures and offer flexible
    licensing that allows for changes in projects, middleware and application
    technology while protecting the investment in IT management tools.

--  IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Microsoft Applications -- offering
    components to monitor and manage all Microsoft-based systems, including the
    operating system, active directory, SQL database, Exchange, .Net and MS
    Cluster Server.

--  IBM Event Management and Monitoring Services -- offering design
    guidance and implementation services with a focus on event management and
    monitoring for IT systems, IT services and business performance management.
    It helps clients maximize their event management system and turn multiple
    monitoring data streams into manageable information.
    

    
New Service Management Center for System z Offering

    IBM Tivoli Service Management Center for System z is an integrated set of
softwareofferings that provides process automation and service management
solutionsto make better use of the mainframe's vast power for tackling business
challenges.
The updated offering, adding support for Linux-based System z, helps clients
benefit from a single, integrated management view of critical applications
hosted
on System z as well as across the enterprise, integrating IT and business views
to
help organizations manage the overall service delivery provided by IT in support
of business objectives.

    Clients can now integrate IT operational management products with service
management and process automation solutions for resource discovery, application
mapping, service views, and automated processes for change, configuration and
business continuity management in a Linux-based mainframe environment. These
integrated solutions help bolster System z as the hub for service management
and support workload consolidation to the mainframe along with the associated
costs
savings.

    New Service Management Quick Start and Healthcheck Offerings

    The new Healthcheck services for service management provide insight into how
to better manage services. They use IBM tooling and service management expertise
to
evaluate clients' key service management processes and compare those processes
with industry best practices, allowing clients to identify where workflows can
be
streamlined and where technology can be applied to improve service quality.

    "Service Management isn't just about keeping servers up and running, it's
about keeping trains running on time, cash registers operating and factories
producing products," said Jeanine Cotter, IBM Global Services vice president for
IT Services and Architecture. "In today's world, service management is all about
keeping a business running with precision while identifying and resolving
problems quickly."

    The new Quick Start services for service management leverage IBM's expertise
in
the design and deployment of service management technology to help clients
quickly deploy automation solutions for processes such as service request
management, problem management and change management. As part of this, a new
version of IBM Tivoli Unified Process also is available to easily describe
processes, roles and tools.  The free "starter kit" provides detailed
information
to help users adopt service management and implement specific processes based on
industry best practices. This is aligned with best practices, including ITIL
v3, and is the result of the combined efforts of IBM Global Services and IBM
Tivoli experts and reflects the experience from thousands of real world
engagements. The IBM Tivoli Unified Process can help organizations significantly
improve IT operations by enabling users to easily understand processes, the
relationships between processes, and the roles and tools involved in an
efficient
process implementation.

    New Tools and Accelerator Services

    Recognizing that technology and operations leaders are under pressure to
deliver new IT services while also containing costs, IBM is providing a
newset of return on investment assets and tools to help evaluate and build
business cases to adopt service management. These tools can help organizations
to move forward with improved, predictive knowledge on the effects and costs
associated with their service management approach. IBM is also making
available new accelerator services to help clients improve the speed of
software implementation by leveraging IBM's vast experience in this area.
These services use standardized templates and workflows to help clients take
advantage of experiences from other implementations.

    IBM has built the technology, experience and proven methodology to help
clients plan, implement and improve service management. IBM has fully
integrated products from more than 20 acquisitions into its Tivoli portfolio,
bolstering its ability to address the industry's widest range of technology
to help manage IT operations. IBM assists its clients with over 2,000
worldwide business partners and its Global Technology Services organization,
which
work closely with Tivoli from development to delivery of new software to help
clients quickly deploy and benefit from the IBM Service Management portfolio.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) sees tens of millions of corporate e-mail accounts moving to its data centers over the next five years, shifting to a business model that may thin profit margins but generate more revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview ahead of the Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit, Chris Capossela, who manages Microsoft's Office products, said the company will see more and more companies abandon their own in-house computer systems and shift to "cloud computing", a less expensive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cloud computing is the trend by Internet powerhouses to array huge numbers of computers in centralized data centers to deliver Web-based applications to far-flung users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft built its business selling software to run on local machines, both computer servers and personal computers, but, in recent years, it has invested billions of dollars in massive data centers, which are the basic infrastructure for a wide range of Web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has started offering corporate customers the option of having Microsoft run their e-mail, collaboration or sales programs on the software giant's computers and delivering those applications over the Web as a monthly subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Capossela, a senior vice president at Microsoft, said it plans to be "agnostic" by offering customers the choice between a traditional licensing model or a subscription-based service model embraced by rivals like Salesforce.com (CRM.N) and Google Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's where we think we are far stronger than our service-religious competition who think it's all going to be in the cloud," he said. "A lot of companies are not ready to take their money out of the pillowcase and put it in the bank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exchange Online, the service offering for its Exchange mail and messaging server software, will be the primary application adopted by corporate customers, according to Capossela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In five years, 50 percent of our Exchange mailboxes will be Exchange Online," said Capossela, who expects a portion of Exchange Online customers to come from customers switching from International Business Machines' (IBM.N) Lotus Domino system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to research firm Radicati, Exchange will run about 210 million corporate e-mail accounts in 2008, growing to 319 million mailboxes in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN THE CLOUDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shift to cloud computing will introduce some changes, according to Capossela, in the earnings model at Microsoft's business division, which generated revenue of $16.4 billion and operating profit of $10.8 billion in fiscal 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, customers pay Microsoft a licensing fee for the software, then buy their own computer and hire their own technology staff to manage those systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a services business, the customer will pay Microsoft a larger fee, since Microsoft also runs and maintains all the hardware. But Microsoft's profit margins may not be "as high," Capossela said, even though revenue may be more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key for Microsoft will be to run its computers systems as efficiently as possible to reduce hardware costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's where we make the business model work," said Capossela, 38, who worked in his earlier years at the company as a speech writing assistant for co-founder Bill Gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has already signed up large customers to its online services. The company said Coca Cola Enterprises Inc (CCE.N) signed up 70,000 seats for Exchange Online, switching over from IBM's Lotus Domino system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it continues to build up its infrastructure, adding roughly 10,000 powerful computer servers a month to its data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a staggering amount of computing power, about the equivalent what popular social networking site Facebook uses, according to Capossela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

"neutral," based on valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage upgraded Alaska Air Group Inc (ALK.N) and
JetBlue Airways (JBLU.O) to "neutral" from "underweight," based
on its liquidity analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan said Continental's ability to avoid Chapter 11
bankruptcy is better than that of JetBlue and that its
management team is on the liquidity prowl more than most.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industry fuel expense is expected to rise $17.5 billion

had earlier expected an operating loss of $4.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At current fuel prices, legacy bankruptcies and/or
merge-at-all-cost attempts are a question of when, not if, in

percent at $17.54 in morning trade on the New York Stock
Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Alaska Air were trading up about 5 percent at
$22.39 while shares of Continental were down about 3 percent at
$17.50 in morning trade the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JetBlue shares were trading up about 3 percent at $5.01 on
Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Citigroup slashed its earnings outlook for Wall Street investment banks, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), citing a tough operating environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second quarter has seen lower client-related trading volumes, little banking activity, losses related to ineffective hedging and reversals of gains on fair valuing liabilities, analyst Prashant Bhatia wrote in a note dated May 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bhatia, who is the latest in a growing line-up of Wall Street analysts to cut estimates on U.S. investment banks, said he expects significant asset sales related to leveraged loan inventory, and commercial and residential mortgages as a result of a greater degree of liquidity in the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We expect the brokers may take some losses to exit concentrated positions," he said, adding that although the operating environment appears to have improved considerably this month, it will not offset the weakness seen in March and April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter results could be a catalyst for restoring investor confidence that the worst of the markdowns have been taken and that balance sheets have been considerably de-levered and significantly de-risked, Bhatia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst rates Lehman and Morgan Stanley "buy," and Goldman Sachs "hold."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cut his target on Morgan Stanley stock to $70 from $75.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs shares fell nearly 1 percent to $185.77 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Bank Marks 33 Years as Leader in ACH Transactions; Reports Record 4 Billion
                                    Payments

    JPMorgan Maintains Standards for Exceptional Quality in ACH Products and
                                    Services
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan, a full-service provider of cash management, trade finance, and
treasury solutions, today announced it has been ranked as the number-one
financial institution in total automated clearing house (ACH) network
transactions originated for 2007 by NACHA - The Electronic Payments Association.
The bank has ranked first in ACH originations for a record 33 years in a row,
since the inception of the network. JPMorgan saw its ACH transactions grow to
nearly 4 billion in 2007, an increase of nearly 9 percent over the previous
year.

"Our continued growth and leadership in ACH payments origination is a direct
result of our commitment to quality improvement and customer service," Craig T.
Vaream, managing director, ACH and Global Check Deposit product executive,
JPMorgan Treasury Services. "We are constantly challenging ourselves to develop
more efficient ways to help our clients streamline their payments processes.
Indicative of those efforts, we are proud to have achieved and maintained ISO
9001:2000 certification for the overall quality and timeliness of our operation
for the past several years."

JPMorgan has consistently originated more ACH entries than any other bank. The
firm's fully scalable platform, advanced electronic systems and proprietary
software set the industry standard for quality in ACH products and services.

ISO certification applies to all domestic and international ACH transactions
processed through JPMorgan's state-of-the-art facility. The bank has a
straight-through processing rate of 99 percent and maintains dual processing
capabilities. Additionally, JPMorgan monitors the quality of transactions and
customer satisfaction as a regular pattern of doing business. The firm also
maintains dedicated remote contingency sites, which provide seamless operations
and business continuity in the event of an emergency or disaster.

The ACH system is the engine that is driving the new era of payments. As the ACH
network has grown, safety and security have risen in importance.

"The ACH network remains incredibly safe for all users, but the industry must
stay vigilant and sustain the highest levels of safety and security to combat
future threats to the network," added Vaream. "JPMorgan has taken a leadership
role in maintaining the safety of the ACH network, and championing efforts to
mitigate the risk of fraud within the system."

JPMorgan is at the forefront of technological developments in authentication and
encryption procedures that detect and reduce fraud. As the ACH network continues
to grow, imaging solutions are fueling that growth. In a further step toward
fraud prevention, JPMorgan will introduce an integrated payables solution for
ACH later this year.

&lt;p&gt;Tarrant County, Texas Achieves Exceptional Tax Collection, Payment Results Using
                              Electronic Processing
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan, a full-service provider of cash management, trade, finance, and
treasury solutions, today announced that its Image Cash Letter with ACH product
has been successfully piloted by the Tax Assessor of Tarrant County, Texas and
is now available. Using JPMorgan's electronic processing capabilities, the
Tarrant County Tax Office significantly improved its collection results while
delivering improved service to tax payers.

JPMorgan's Image Cash Letter with ACH makes possible the processing of paper
checks and then converting them through the ACH system. Check images and related
information are captured electronically and then transmitted to JPMorgan for
clearing and settlement via the ACH network, when eligible. This eliminates the
need for substitute checks to be created by the bank, thus speeding up
processing.

"As the leader in ACH originations for more than 30 years, we take the
responsibility of bringing innovative ACH solutions to the marketplace very
seriously," said Craig Vaream, managing director, ACH and Global Check Deposit
product executive, JPMorgan Treasury Services. "By partnering with us in this
pilot, the Tax Assessor of Tarrant County demonstrated their willingness to put
advanced electronic payment processes to work. This willingness has not only
improved their payment collection methods, but also made it fast, easy and
convenient for tax payers to satisfy their obligations."

Tarrant County Tax Office has long been at the technology forefront, using
innovative payment tools to collect and process tax payments. The county was one
of only two JPMorgan clients in the country piloting Image Cash Letter with ACH.
Participating in the pilot required changes in the tax collector's back office
operation. They were richly rewarded for their efforts, achieving outstanding
results.

"Using Image Cash Letter with ACH, the Tarrant County Tax Office achieved the
best collection results we've had since I have been in office," said Betsy
Price, tax assessor, Tarrant County, Texas. "Not only were we able to speed up
the collection and processing of payments, but we also were able to improve
service to our constituents by offering them the payment options they wanted.
The pilot was a win-win for the county and our tax payers. JPMorgan has been a
supportive partner in this process and we were pleased to have been selected to
pilot this solution with them."

Image Cash Letter with ACH becomes an important component of Tarrant County's
Tax Office eGov efforts designed to electronify collection processes and
solidifies its position as a national leader in government electronification
adoption. Using Image Cash Letter with ACH to supplement existing online payment
options, Tarrant County's Tax Office is now able to process all tax office
receivables fees, including property taxes, department of motor vehicle fees,
vehicle inventory tax (VIT), and beer, wine and liquor licensing (BWL) fees.
eGov has delivered tremendous results, allowing the county to electronically
process over 35,000 property tax payments and 100,000 motor vehicle renewals
during the past fiscal year. Credit card and eCheck payments for property tax
made over the Web grew by 20 and 30 percent respectively last year.

JPMorgan's Image Cash Letter with ACH also enabled the Tax Assessor of Tarrant
County to achieve the following:

    --  Significant process change resulting in faster opening of mailed
        payments, as well as quicker posting and routing through banking systems

    --  Eight percent increase in collected and paid entities over historical
        averages

    --  Collected funds balance increase by an average of $37 million per day

    --  Nearly 100 percent of the County's one million checks are now sent to
        the bank electronically

    --  No waiting on collected funds balances to pay entities

Image Cash Letter with ACH optimizes the preparation, processing and clearing of
checks using JPMorgan's enhanced electronic processing solution. Key features
and benefits of the solution include:

    --  Optimized check clearing and decisioning via ACH or Check 21 channels

    --  Reduced costs, time and risks associated with transporting paper checks

    --  Optimized funds availability

    --  Improved efficiencies and lower administrative costs by streamlining
        operations

&lt;p&gt;Bank Marks 33 Years as Leader in ACH Transactions; Reports Record
                          4 Billion Payments

      JPMorgan Maintains Standards for Exceptional Quality in ACH
                         Products and Services
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan, a full-service provider of cash management, trade
finance, and treasury solutions, today announced it has been ranked as
the number-one financial institution in total automated clearing house
(ACH) network transactions originated for 2007 by NACHA - The
Electronic Payments Association. The bank has ranked first in ACH
originations for a record 33 years in a row, since the inception of
the network. JPMorgan saw its ACH transactions grow to nearly 4
billion in 2007, an increase of nearly 9 percent over the previous
year.

   "Our continued growth and leadership in ACH payments origination
is a direct result of our commitment to quality improvement and
customer service," Craig T. Vaream, managing director, ACH and Global
Check Deposit product executive, JPMorgan Treasury Services. "We are
constantly challenging ourselves to develop more efficient ways to
help our clients streamline their payments processes. Indicative of
those efforts, we are proud to have achieved and maintained ISO
9001:2000 certification for the overall quality and timeliness of our
operation for the past several years."

   JPMorgan has consistently originated more ACH entries than any
other bank. The firm's fully scalable platform, advanced electronic
systems and proprietary software set the industry standard for quality
in ACH products and services.

   ISO certification applies to all domestic and international ACH
transactions processed through JPMorgan's state-of-the-art facility.
The bank has a straight-through processing rate of 99 percent and
maintains dual processing capabilities. Additionally, JPMorgan
monitors the quality of transactions and customer satisfaction as a
regular pattern of doing business. The firm also maintains dedicated
remote contingency sites, which provide seamless operations and
business continuity in the event of an emergency or disaster.

   The ACH system is the engine that is driving the new era of
payments. As the ACH network has grown, safety and security have risen
in importance.

   "The ACH network remains incredibly safe for all users, but the
industry must stay vigilant and sustain the highest levels of safety
and security to combat future threats to the network," added Vaream.
"JPMorgan has taken a leadership role in maintaining the safety of the
ACH network, and championing efforts to mitigate the risk of fraud
within the system."

   JPMorgan is at the forefront of technological developments in
authentication and encryption procedures that detect and reduce fraud.
As the ACH network continues to grow, imaging solutions are fueling
that growth. In a further step toward fraud prevention, JPMorgan will
introduce an integrated payables solution for ACH later this year.

&lt;p&gt;Tarrant County, Texas Achieves Exceptional Tax Collection, Payment
                  Results Using Electronic Processing
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan, a full-service provider of cash management, trade,
finance, and treasury solutions, today announced that its Image Cash
Letter with ACH product has been successfully piloted by the Tax
Assessor of Tarrant County, Texas and is now available. Using
JPMorgan's electronic processing capabilities, the Tarrant County Tax
Office significantly improved its collection results while delivering
improved service to tax payers.

   JPMorgan's Image Cash Letter with ACH makes possible the
processing of paper checks and then converting them through the ACH
system. Check images and related information are captured
electronically and then transmitted to JPMorgan for clearing and
settlement via the ACH network, when eligible. This eliminates the
need for substitute checks to be created by the bank, thus speeding up
processing.

   "As the leader in ACH originations for more than 30 years, we take
the responsibility of bringing innovative ACH solutions to the
marketplace very seriously," said Craig Vaream, managing director, ACH
and Global Check Deposit product executive, JPMorgan Treasury
Services. "By partnering with us in this pilot, the Tax Assessor of
Tarrant County demonstrated their willingness to put advanced
electronic payment processes to work. This willingness has not only
improved their payment collection methods, but also made it fast, easy
and convenient for tax payers to satisfy their obligations."

   Tarrant County Tax Office has long been at the technology
forefront, using innovative payment tools to collect and process tax
payments. The county was one of only two JPMorgan clients in the
country piloting Image Cash Letter with ACH. Participating in the
pilot required changes in the tax collector's back office operation.
They were richly rewarded for their efforts, achieving outstanding
results.

   "Using Image Cash Letter with ACH, the Tarrant County Tax Office
achieved the best collection results we've had since I have been in
office," said Betsy Price, tax assessor, Tarrant County, Texas. "Not
only were we able to speed up the collection and processing of
payments, but we also were able to improve service to our constituents
by offering them the payment options they wanted. The pilot was a
win-win for the county and our tax payers. JPMorgan has been a
supportive partner in this process and we were pleased to have been
selected to pilot this solution with them."

   Image Cash Letter with ACH becomes an important component of
Tarrant County's Tax Office eGov efforts designed to electronify
collection processes and solidifies its position as a national leader
in government electronification adoption. Using Image Cash Letter with
ACH to supplement existing online payment options, Tarrant County's
Tax Office is now able to process all tax office receivables fees,
including property taxes, department of motor vehicle fees, vehicle
inventory tax (VIT), and beer, wine and liquor licensing (BWL) fees.
eGov has delivered tremendous results, allowing the county to
electronically process over 35,000 property tax payments and 100,000
motor vehicle renewals during the past fiscal year. Credit card and
eCheck payments for property tax made over the Web grew by 20 and 30
percent respectively last year.

   JPMorgan's Image Cash Letter with ACH also enabled the Tax
Assessor of Tarrant County to achieve the following:

   --  Significant process change resulting in faster opening of
        mailed payments, as well as quicker posting and routing
        through banking systems

   --  Eight percent increase in collected and paid entities over
        historical averages

   --  Collected funds balance increase by an average of $37 million
        per day

   --  Nearly 100 percent of the County's one million checks are now
        sent to the bank electronically

   --  No waiting on collected funds balances to pay entities

   Image Cash Letter with ACH optimizes the preparation, processing
and clearing of checks using JPMorgan's enhanced electronic processing
solution. Key features and benefits of the solution include:

   --  Optimized check clearing and decisioning via ACH or Check 21
        channels

   --  Reduced costs, time and risks associated with transporting
        paper checks

   --  Optimized funds availability

   --  Improved efficiencies and lower administrative costs by
        streamlining operations

   --  Mitigation of check fraud by accelerated return item
        notifications

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 19 (Reuters) - A potential partnership deal
between Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) the
companies revealed over the weekend may prove to be a stepping
stone to an outright acquisition, analysts said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; UBS analysts said in a research note that the business
discussions between Microsoft and Yahoo could be a prelude to
an eventual outright acquisition offer because it was vital for
Microsoft to acquire Yahoo on friendly terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A near-term deal could act as an intermediate step that
would go a long way toward testing the waters," UBS wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said a Microsoft-Yahoo partnership is likely
to focus on search advertising and should be seen as an
alternative to a scenario in which Yahoo would outsource to
Google Inc (GOOG.O) part of its Web search ad sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stifel Nicolas argued that Microsoft may be seeking to buy
Yahoo's search and search-advertising business outright,
leaving Yahoo independent but smaller, focused on display
advertising and Internet media businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stifel analysts George Askew and Scott Devitt warned that
Yahoo must reach a deal with either Google or Microsoft or face
a bruising proxy battle with activist investor Carl Icahn, who
is seeking to install his own slate of Yahoo directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn launched a proxy campaign last Thursday to replace
Yahoo's board with directors who would reopen talks with
Microsoft, saying Yahoo had acted irrationally in refusing the
software company's $47.5 billion bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proxy battle "may ultimately drive a damaged Yahoo into
Microsoft's arms" at around $31 per share, Stifel said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft made a $31-per-share cash and stock offer in late
January. Earlier this month, Microsoft discussed raising that
offer to $33 a share, but backed away after Yahoo management
held out for $37 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software giant's move to court Yahoo was likely to
prompt the Icahn to press Yahoo to further pursue an alliance
with Google, a person familiar with the billionaire investor's
thinking told Reuters on Sunday.

&lt;p&gt;Advertising Celebrates Iconic Moments in Olympic History and the
                Athletes who Embody the Olympic Spirit
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), a Worldwide Olympic Partner for more than two
decades, today announced the launch of "Go World," a U.S. advertising
campaign that evokes the emotion and memories of unforgettable moments
in Olympic history. The campaign, featuring current Olympic and
Paralympic athletes and Olympic legends will include national
television commercials, print and online advertisements, and an online
microsite.

   "The Olympic Games begin and end with the athletes - a fact that
we at Visa have emphasized and celebrated during our 20-plus year
partnership with the Games," said Antonio Lucio, chief marketing
officer of Visa Inc. "The 'Go World' campaign captures the passion
that is unique to the Olympic Games by focusing attention on the
achievement of the human spirit as embodied in extraordinary athletes,
past and present."

   "Go World" creative sets itself apart from other recent
advertising campaigns through the use of striking sepia tones combined
with dramatic still photography and moving images from past Olympic
competitions. Together they capture the essence of iconic Olympic
moments.

   "Come Together," the first in a series of national television
commercials debuts tonight on CBS during "How I Met Your Mother." Four
additional spots featuring six-time gold medal swimmer Michael Phelps,
Paralympic track and field gold medalist Cheri Blauwet, gold medal
gymnast Kerri Strug and sprinter Derek Redmond will premiere
throughout the week. These spots highlight Phelps' superhuman
athleticism, Blauwet's many talents on and off the track, as well as
the heart and determination of U.S. gymnast Kerri Strug and English
sprinter Derek Redmond, who overcame devastating injuries to cement
their Olympic moments.

   Subsequent television and online creative will include Visa
sponsored athletes who are members of Team Visa Beijing including
Bryan Clay and Allyson Felix (track and field), Paul Hamm and Nastia
Liukin (gymnastics), Steven Lopez (taekwondo), Katie Hoff (swimming),
Bubba Harris (BMX Supercross), Kerri Walsh (beach volleyball) as well
as Paralympian Marlon Shirley (track and field). Legendary track and
field Olympians such as Bob Beamon, Dick Fosbury and Jim Thorpe will
also be featured in upcoming spots.

   Visa's Olympic television commercials will air leading up to and
during NBC's broadcast of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, where Visa
will enjoy category exclusivity for the duration of the Games.

   Fans can also visit www.visa.com/GoWorld to view the ads and learn
more about the heroic feats of Olympians featured in the campaign. In
the coming weeks, fans will be able to submit stories about Olympic
moments that have inspired them for a chance to be featured on
the website alongside sporting greats.

   Visa's Olympic Sponsorship

   Since 1986, Visa has empowered more than 1,000 Olympic and
Paralympic hopefuls to achieve their dreams by providing financial
support, life skills training and valuable marketing exposure in
pursuit of their Olympic goals. In the run-up to the Beijing 2008
Olympic and Paralympic Games, Visa has been supporting more than 90
individual athletes from 19 different countries, all with the
potential to be selected for their national teams for the Beijing 2008
Olympic Games and the Paralympic Games.

   "For more than two decades Visa has proudly and successfully
linked our brand with the Olympic Movement to promote, enhance and
reinforce preference for our products and services," added Lucio.
"Importantly, our Olympic partnership not only benefits Visa's
business, it has enabled thousands of merchants and financial
institutions to associate with the Games and participate in business
building marketing programs."

   In advance of the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games, Visa is working with
more than 380 of its financial institution clients in 66 countries to
offer Visa cardholders the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to attend
the Games this summer. Visa is also working with retail partners in 31
countries to help them generate business and excitement among their
customers in advance of the Olympic Games.

   Visa remains the only card that enables fans to get into the
Olympic Games at venues in Beijing and at select Olympic Trials in the
United States. This extends to the purchase of Olympic Games
merchandise online, in Olympic retail stores and by catalog. Thousands
of Visa-branded ATMs have been installed in and around Beijing,
including many at Olympic venues, for added cardholder convenience.
Visa Signature cardholders were given a unique opportunity to purchase
tickets to the Olympic Games before the general public and to receive
discounts on travel and hospitality packages for the Games.

&lt;p&gt;Free Three Week Trial Allows Customers to Test Drive ViewXchange
                                Service
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
Azaleos(R) Corporation, the managed Microsoft messaging services
company, today announced the release of version 4.0 of ViewXchange,
its monitoring and reporting service for Microsoft Exchange.
ViewXchange provides enhanced real-time visibility and reporting into
the health, performance, and usage of Microsoft Exchange environments
including Active Directory, Windows Server, storage systems, and
physical and virtual servers. Azaleos also announced a free three (3)
week trial offer that allows qualifying organizations to use this
monitoring service to evaluate the health of their Exchange system.

   "Managing Microsoft Exchange requires specialized skills and the
ability to recognize conditions that are likely to lead to problems,
this can be a challenge for many organizations," said Laura DiDio,
Research Fellow at research firm Yankee Group. "With ViewXchange
organizations maintain access to critical information and reports
about their on-premise Exchange environment, while leaving the
day-to-day management to the Azaleos operations team."

   Making Sense of Exchange

   The ViewXchange 4.0 service monitors and provides real-time views
of nearly three thousand Exchange system data points that influence
system availability and performance. ViewXchange 4.0 is a SaaS service
that is already shipping and used by Azaleos network operations center
professionals to manage service level agreements for the company's
customers located across 3 continents. Organizations that qualify for
the limited time free trial, can access the same visibility into their
Exchange environment from the ViewXchange browser-based dashboard.
Some of the new capabilities in ViewXchange 4.0 include:

   --  A redesigned System View for a simplified, "at a glance"
        overview of Exchange health vital signs

   --  A new view and reports of real-time and historical Exchange
        mail flow statistics

   --  Health and data views of both the physical server and virtual
        (guest and host) servers

   "ViewXchange 4.0 is an industrial strength monitoring platform
developed for Azaleos network operations center professionals who
manage our customer's production environments," said Keith McCall, CTO
of Azaleos. "It provides much deeper visibility into the health status
of Exchange than other packaged software applications, and allows
customers to view key indicators and reports without having to manage
their messaging environment themselves."

   The Service Advantage

   ViewXchange provides superior depth and breadth of monitoring
capabilities compared to traditional Exchange monitoring software
products such as Microsoft Systems Center Operations Manager or NetIQ
AppManager. The service component of ViewXchange, which involves
24x7x365 monitoring of customer environments by Azaleos technicians,
really sets it apart and is the biggest asset for organizations. From
the Azaleos network operations center a team of Exchange professionals
performs real-time monitoring, analysis, and interpretation of system
data from a customer's Exchange environment to identify and resolve
issues before they can affect availability or performance.

   ViewXchange Free Three Week Trial

   For a limited time, Azaleos is offering a free three week trial
program of the ViewXchange monitoring service. Organizations with 500
or more users on Exchange 2003 or Exchange 2007 can qualify for a
ViewXchange trial to:

   --  Compare the Azaleos service to their current monitoring and
        management methods

   --  Identify the health, performance and overall status of their
        Exchange environment

   --  Gain the same visibility into Exchange used by Azaleos network
        operations center professionals

   OneStop Managed Services

   ViewXchange is part of the modular lineup of Azaleos OneStop
managed Exchange services. OneStop offerings are based on OneServer
for Microsoft Exchange 2007, a high availability, hardened e-mail
appliance that is managed remotely by experts in the Azaleos network
operations center. A virtualized edition of OneServer is also
available that reduces the number of physical servers required to
deploy Exchange 2007 from four to two.

   In addition to ViewXchange, other OneStop remotely managed
services include: ProtectXchange, a comprehensive anti-virus/anti-spam
service; MobileXchange, monitoring and management services for mobile
connectivity with Exchange; RestoreXchange, business continuity
services for Exchange; and ArchiveXchange, automatic archival and
storage of e-mail for Exchange server.

   About Azaleos

   Azaleos Corporation provides 24X7 remotely managed messaging
services for enterprises with on-premise installations of Microsoft
Exchange Server and Blackberry Enterprise Server. Azaleos OneServer
and OneStop Services offer remote monitoring, management, maintenance,
and reporting, which enable an organization's IT staff to focus on
strategic technology initiatives. Azaleos solutions can be installed

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats story first sent Friday night)
 (For other news from the  Reuters Global Technology, Media and
Telecoms Summit, click here)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE May 19 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) sees
tens of millions of corporate e-mail accounts moving to its
data centers over the next five years, shifting to a business
model that may thin profit margins but generate more revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an interview ahead of the Reuters Global Technology,
Media and Telecoms Summit, Chris Capossela, who manages
Microsoft's Office products, said the company will see more and
more companies abandon their own in-house computer systems and
shift to "cloud computing", a less expensive alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cloud computing is the trend by Internet powerhouses to
array huge numbers of computers in centralized data centers to
deliver Web-based applications to far-flung users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft built its business selling software to run on
local machines, both computer servers and personal computers,
but, in recent years, it has invested billions of dollars in
massive data centers, which are the basic infrastructure for a
wide range of Web services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has started offering corporate customers the option of
having Microsoft run their e-mail, collaboration or sales
programs on the software giant's computers and delivering those
applications over the Web as a monthly subscription service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capossela, a senior vice president at Microsoft, said it
plans to be "agnostic" by offering customers the choice between
a traditional licensing model or a subscription-based service
model embraced by rivals like Salesforce.com (CRM.N) and Google
Inc (GOOG.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's where we think we are far stronger than our
service-religious competition who think it's all going to be in
the cloud," he said. "A lot of companies are not ready to take
their money out of the pillowcase and put it in the bank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exchange Online, the service offering for its Exchange mail
and messaging server software, will be the primary application
adopted by corporate customers, according to Capossela.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In five years, 50 percent of our Exchange mailboxes will
be Exchange Online," said Capossela, who expects a portion of
Exchange Online customers to come from customers switching from
International Business Machines' (IBM.N) Lotus Domino system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to research firm Radicati, Exchange will run
about 210 million corporate e-mail accounts in 2008, growing to
319 million mailboxes in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IN THE CLOUDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shift to cloud computing will introduce some changes,
according to Capossela, in the earnings model at Microsoft's
business division, which generated revenue of $16.4 billion and
operating profit of $10.8 billion in fiscal 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently, customers pay Microsoft a licensing fee for the
software, then buy their own computer and hire their own
technology staff to manage those systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a services business, the customer will pay Microsoft a
larger fee, since Microsoft also runs and maintains all the
hardware. But Microsoft's profit margins may not be "as high,"
Capossela said, even though revenue may be more consistent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The key for Microsoft will be to run its computers systems
as efficiently as possible to reduce hardware costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's where we make the business model work," said
Capossela, 38, who worked in his earlier years at the company
as a speech writing assistant for co-founder Bill Gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has already signed up large customers to its
online services. The company said Coca Cola Enterprises Inc
(CCE.N) signed up 70,000 seats for Exchange Online, switching
over from IBM's Lotus Domino system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft said it continues to
build up its infrastructure, adding roughly 10,000 powerful
computer servers a month to its data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a staggering amount of computing power, about the
equivalent what popular social networking site Facebook uses,
according to Capossela.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO (Reuters) - Facebook Inc founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg stressed his company's independent spirit on Monday, after a report the social networking site might be sold to software giant Microsoft, which is hunting for ways to beef up its Internet business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"You can tell, from our history and what we've done, that we really wanted to keep the company independent, by focusing on building and focusing on the long-term," Zuckerberg told Reuters while in Japan to launch a Japanese language version of Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft already has a small stake and the Wall Street Journal said this month the software giant, having failed in its $47.5 billion bid for Internet portal Yahoo Inc, had approached Facebook to gauge its interest in a full takeover. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked specifically about the prospect of a sale, Zuckerberg declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has not given up on a deal with Yahoo, saying on Sunday it had proposed an alternative plan to Yahoo. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook, founded by Zuckerberg when he was at Harvard University in 2004, has become one of the hottest properties on the Internet because of its strong loyalty among the more than 70 million users who swap pictures, messages and virtual gifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft took a $240 million stake in Facebook in October last year, a purchase that valued the start-up at $15 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hong Kong tycoon Li Ka-shing recently put $120 million into the company and smaller investors have contributed another $15 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg, in the past, has resisted selling the entire company, opting to work towards an initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Facebook is launching a Japanese website to try to lure users in Japan's online networking market, which is currently dominated by Japanese firm Mixi Inc, which has more than 10 million users and an 80 percent share of Japan's 44 billion yen ($422 million) social networking market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zuckerberg said he was confident that Facebook could lure Japanese users as its services differed from its rivals as users gave their real names.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest thing about Facebook is that it's real names and real people," Zuckerberg said, adding that made his site more trusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Facebook was planning to launch a Japanese language service on cellphones, an area Mixi is already active in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=104.17 Yen)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Rodney Joyce)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Analyst Interview. Today's interview
is with senior analyst Steve Biggs, who discusses EDS (NYSE: EDS), IBM
(NYSE: IBM), Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ), Yahoo! (Nasdaq: YHOO) and
3Com (Nasdaq: COMS).

   Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the
free Profit from the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.

   Does Hewlett-Packard's buying out of EDS have any immediate impact
on the tech sector overall, or does it mostly just make HP a bigger
competitor versus IBM?

   With the addition of EDS (NYSE: EDS), HP will have triple the size
of its services business and become a much closer competitor to IBM
(NYSE: IBM). We had a Sell rating on EDS prior to the announcement of
HP's acquisition due to declining contract signings, which don't bode
well for future results.

   In fact, I have been somewhat negative on most of the IT services
industry. I believe large scale outsourcing, such as what EDS and IBM
do, is on the decline with enterprises choosing to bring more IT
infrastructure management back in-house and outsource to smaller
specialty providers that focus on certain aspects of the business,
such as account statements, human resources, etc.

   Given my view on EDS, I believe this could be a major disruption
for Hewlett-Packard (NYSE: HPQ) as they are battling a deteriorating
top-line. HP believes that they can take out $1 billion in expenses,
so profitability may be able to meet expectations, although this will
take time. CEO Mark Hurd is known for organizational skills and his
ability to cut costs, which helped HP realize benefits from the Compaq
acquisition.

   EDS is also a partner of Opsware, which HP acquired last year, and
had tried to buy the company in the past. My belief is that over the
next year or so, investors will look at likely revenue disappointments
which will likely hurt the shares. Five years down the road, we might
be able to look at this acquisition and see how it helped HP's
competitive position, much like the Compaq acquisition.

   How has The Street reacted to the news in the couple days since
this announcement?

   As expected, EDS was up based on the cash value of HP's offer and
HP was down due to concerns over risks associated with the
acquisition. The increased merger and acquisition activity we have
seen over the past few quarters is probably a good sign for technology
stocks in general, as acquirers perceive value in these companies. A
number of companies in my universe have been acquired or have agreed
to acquisitions over the past months. The majority of acquisition
targets have been poorly performing companies that are near long-term
lows in market capitalization, such as Yahoo! (Nasdaq: YHOO) and 3Com
(Nasdaq: COMS), meaning the acquirer (or hopeful) acquirer must have
confidence in the business environment going forward.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Sunday it is in contact with Yahoo Inc about an alternative deal that would not involve a full acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such a move could save Yahoo from fighting a proxy battle with financier Carl Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following is a timeline of key events in Microsoft's pursuit of Yahoo, stretching back more than two years, when Yahoo's financial results began weakening and private talks started in which Microsoft sought to merge with the web pioneer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early 2006 - Yahoo begins to report a string of disappointing quarterly results that stretches over the next two years, reflecting competitive missteps by the company, market share gains by rival Google Inc, changes in the online advertising landscape and weakening spending in some ad segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Late 2006/early 2007 - Microsoft and Yahoo discuss various partnerships, including a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2007&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February - Yahoo, under the leadership of previous Chief Executive Terry Semel, tells Microsoft it is not the right time to discuss a takeover, as the Yahoo board sees great potential from new advertising technology and internal changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 12 - A strong minority of Yahoo shareholders challenges Yahoo's direction, as CEO Semel comes under fire. Nearly a third of votes cast at the company's annual shareholder meeting oppose some of Yahoo's directors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;June 18 - Yahoo co-founder Jerry Yang takes over as chief executive as Semel steps aside. Semel remains Yahoo chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2008&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;January 31 - Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer makes a $44.6 billion, $31-per-share cash-and-stock takeover offer to Yahoo's board. Semel resigns as chairman and is replaced by Roy Bostock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 1 - Microsoft makes the offer public. Its shares fall 6.6 percent to $30.45; Yahoo shares rise 48 percent to $28.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 11 - Yahoo rejects the Microsoft offer as too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;February 13 - MySpace owner News Corp and Yahoo discuss a tie-up, according to a source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 18 - Yahoo gives financial forecasts for the next two years, in an effort to prove it is worth more than Microsoft bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;March 28 - One of seven face-to-face meetings takes place between the "senior-most" executives of Microsoft and Yahoo to discuss the bid. Yahoo asks how Microsoft would handle regulatory issues, including antitrust concerns, tied to a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 4 - People familiar with the matter say Microsoft is evaluating its bid for Yahoo because the Internet company may have lost value since Microsoft first made its offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 5 - Microsoft sets a three-week deadline for Yahoo to negotiate and reach a deal or face a proxy fight and a possible cut to the bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 7 - Yahoo again rejects Microsoft and says it is open to a higher price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 9 - Yahoo says it will test Google search ads on its site, which could be more lucrative than selling its own search ads. Sources say Yahoo and Time Warner Inc are in parallel talks to join Time Warner's AOL and Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 15 - At another meeting between  Yahoo and Microsoft executives and their financial advisers, Yahoo asks about Microsoft's integration plans and Yahoo raises a list of "key non-price deal terms" it believes are critical.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 26 - Microsoft's deadline to Yahoo passes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;April 30 - Ballmer flies to California for talks with Yahoo CEO Yang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 3 - Yang meets Ballmer in Seattle. Microsoft raises its offer to $33 per share, or $47.5 billion. That is about $5 billion over the value of the previous offer at the time. Yahoo wants $37 per share, or about $5 billion more. Late in the day, Ballmer calls off the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 15 - Carl Icahn proposes a 10-member dissident board slate for election at Yahoo's annual shareholder meeting in July. Icahn says he now holds a 4.3 percent stake in Yahoo, including 9.9 million shares and 49 million call options. Yahoo Chairman Bostock replies to Icahn that "none of the alternatives we are considering would preclude us from entering into a transaction with Microsoft or any other party."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;May 18 - Microsoft says it has raised with Yahoo an "alternative" deal that would not involve the software maker buying all of the web company but says it could reconsider pursuing a full acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;July 3 - Yahoo's annual meeting is planned for July 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources: Letters between Microsoft, Yahoo and Icahn; Reuters stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Compiled by Eric Auchard and Peter Henderson; Editing by Braden Reddall and Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM May 19 (Reuters) - The Dutch NAM oil joint
venture, owned by Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch Shell Plc.
(RDSa.L)(RDSb.L) and Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), is mulling reopening
old oilfields in the Netherlands, a paper reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; NAM is considering reopening some oilfields in the west of
the country, Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf reported, as oil
prices rocket to highs near to $128 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are currently looking at different fields where oil was
extracted in the past," NAM spokesman Reinier Treur said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Most of them are situated in the west of the Netherlands,"
he added, but he would not give more precise details of the
fields and how much oil he thought was still available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NAM has already said it is reopening its 1 billion-barrel
Dutch Schoonebeek field in the east of the country, the largest
onshore oilfield in northwestern Europe, which produced about
250 million barrels between 1948 and 1996.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Production there was stopped more than 11 years ago as the
thick oil was hard to extract with the techniques and
infrastructure available at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the Netherlands there are also several other oilfields
which have been shut down but where oil is still sitting in the
ground," Treur told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Catherine Hornby)

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - A top shareholder in Daewoo Shipbuilding 
and Marine Engineering Co Ltd (042660.KS) said on Sunday it had 
withdrawn from talks to have Goldman Sachs (GS.N) manage the 
sale of the South Korean shipbuilder.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; State-run Korea Development Bank (KDB) and other banks want 
to sell their 50.4 percent stake in the world's third-largest 
shipbuilder and KDB picked the Wall Street bank in April to 
handle the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had been in talks with Goldman, a preferred negotiator, 
to manage the deal," a KDB spokesman said by telephone. "But 
Goldman said it could not accept our requests, so the talks 
ended."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to give any details on those requests. Goldman 
Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale is expected to be the country's biggest MA 
transaction this year, fetching more than $4 billion, based on 
the stake's market value of 4.15 trillion won ($4 billion).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Local media reported, without citing sources, that the KDB 
had asked Goldman Sachs to address a potential conflict of 
interest because the U.S. bank had invested in a Chinese 
shipbuilder. The shipbuilding company was not identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ernst  Young ERNY.UL has been selected as the accounting 
adviser and South Korean law firm Lee  Ko as legal adviser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal has drawn interest from a number of domestic 
companies, including steel giant POSCO (005490.KS) and South 
Korean business group Hanwha.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs topped South Korea's MA arrangers' league 
table in 2007, when it managed a sale of shares in broadband 
provider hanarotelecom (033630.KQ) shares by a consortium led 
by American International Group to SK Telecom (017670.KS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=1037.0 Won)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Cheon Jong-woo and Kim Yeon-hee; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's proposal of an alternative deal with Yahoo Inc, rather than a full acquisition, is unlikely to win favor with Carl Icahn, the financier who has launched a proxy battle to force Yahoo to reopen talks with Microsoft, a person familiar with the financier's thinking said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with Icahn view from source, adds details, additional
byline and New York dateline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Daisuke Wakabayashi and Dane Hamilton&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/NEW YORK May 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) said on Sunday it proposed an alternative deal to
Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) rather than a full acquisition, but the move
was unlikely to win favor with financier Carl Icahn, a person
familiar with his thinking said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn launched a proxy campaign on Thursday to replace
Yahoo's board with directors who would reopen talks with
Microsoft, saying Yahoo had acted irrationally in refusing the
giant software company's $47.5 billion bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft walked away from its pursuit of Yahoo two weeks
ago after three months of negotiations when Yahoo's board
rejected Microsoft's sweetened offer of $33 a share, saying the
company was worth at least $37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software giant's move on Sunday was likely to prompt
the billionaire investor to press Yahoo to further pursue a
possible alliance with Google (GOOG.O), the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft is trying to get the milk without buying the
cow, and if you look at Icahn's history, he has never been used
that way," said this person. "He does not want to see Yahoo
pushed into some joint venture with Microsoft and is not going
to be used to push Yahoo into it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's statement on Sunday said it was "considering
and has raised with Yahoo an alternative that would involve a
transaction with Yahoo but not an acquisition of all of Yahoo."
It did not clarify what that alternative might be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York Times reported that Microsoft and Yahoo may
form a partnership or joint venture for search-related
advertising to take on Google Inc (GOOG.O), which dominates the
search market with a share significantly larger than a combined
Yahoo and Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its part, Yahoo continues to talk with Google Inc
(GOOG.O) about a search advertising partnership and a deal
could come as early as this week, a source familiar with the
talks said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft emphasized it was not proposing to make a new bid
to buy all of Yahoo, after recently being rebuffed, but could
reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo replied later on Sunday that it continued to consider
a number of strategic alternatives and was "open to pursuing
any transaction which is in the best interest of our
stockholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's board will "evaluate each of our
alternatives, including any Microsoft proposal, consistent with
its fiduciary duties, with a focus on maximizing stockholder
value," Yahoo said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It added it had confirmed with Microsoft that it was not
interested in "pursuing an acquisition of all of Yahoo at this
time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANALYSTS SPLIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts were split on the benefits of an alternative
scenario to a full-fledged takeover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I definitely think an alternative deal is better than a
full acquisition," said Toan Tran, analyst at Morningstar. "It
is positive for both companies, because you are getting the
benefits of a Yahoo acquisition without the negatives, namely
the integration risks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Kim Caughey, a senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital
Group, said the market will probably send Yahoo shares higher
while pushing down Microsoft shares when the market opens on
Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caughey said a joint venture or minority investment with
Yahoo could cause confusion about who was in charge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft walking away from Yahoo was a total head fake,"
said Caughey. "Microsoft is a terrible poker player if it
thought people were going to believe that the deal was dead."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, Microsoft and Icahn have not held discussions
about Yahoo, said another source close to the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a letter to Icahn last week, Yahoo board Chairman Roy
Bostock said a new board would not be in the best interests of
Yahoo investors, adding Yahoo would consider any deal from any
party, including Microsoft, if it offered the company full
value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icahn, who has said he had accumulated 59 million shares
and options in Yahoo, also has the support of Paulson  Co, a
$30 billion hedge fund that has amassed a 3.4 percent stake in
Yahoo, and other investors upset by the board's handling of
negotiations with Microsoft.

   Fitch does not rate the $15.1 million class NR certificates.

   The rating affirmations are the result of minimal reduction of the
pool collateral balance and stable performance since the last Fitch
rating action. As of the May 2008 distribution date, the pool has paid
down 4.1%, to $1.05 billion from $1.10 billion at issuance. Seventeen
loans (22.5%) have defeased since issuance. Three loans (4.6%) are
currently in special servicing. In total, 12.4% of the pool is
considered a Fitch loan of concern.

   The largest specially serviced loan, (2.4%), is secured by a
182,322 square foot (sf) office in Melville, NY. The principal of the
borrower, which is also a major tenant at the property (American Home
Mortgage, 41.1% of NRA), filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy. The
borrowing entity has not filed Chapter 11 and has not been
consolidated into the bankruptcy filing. The borrower is keeping the
loan payments current. The special servicer is currently evaluating
workout options, including a potential loan assumption. Losses are not
expected at this time.

   The second largest specially serviced loan (1.7%) transferred to
special servicing in October 2007 after the owner/operator, MBS Cos.,
defaulted on debt service. The loan is secured by a 312-unit
multifamily property located in San Antonio, TX. The property is
currently listed for sale.

   The third largest specially serviced loan (0.65%) is secured by a
216-unit multifamily complex located in Houston, TX also owned and
operated by MBS Cos. The special servicer is pursuing workout
strategies, including disposition of the asset. Losses are expected.

   The largest loan in the pool, Centro Retail Portfolio (12.8%),
maintains its investment grade shadow rating. The loan is secured by
seven anchored retail properties, 54.1% located in Southern CA, and
45.9 % in Northern, CA. Occupancy as of June 30, 2007 was 93%,
consistent with occupancy at issuance (95%).

   Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings
are available on the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com.
Published ratings, criteria and methodologies are available from this
site, at all times. Fitch's code of conduct, confidentiality,
conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance and other
relevant policies and procedures are also available from the 'Code of

&lt;p&gt; (Adds dateline, new throughout, adds byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
Chairman and Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, speaking to
shareholders at the annual meeting Tuesday, said he wants to
expand the company's consumer banking business in Washington,
D.C., and the southern United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'd love to be in the South," Dimon said in response to a
shareholder asking if Chase would have more branches in places
like Florida and Georgia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier in the meeting, he told another shareholder, "We
would like to be in Washington one day."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon declined to comment on takeover talk, though he
reasserted his view that JPMorgan's pending merger with Bear
Stearns Cos BSC.N for about $1.5 billion would not stop it
from pursuing other deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan has in the past told investors it was interested
in expanding its retail banking business in the United States
outside its base in the New York City region and the former
Bank One's network in the Great Lakes and Midwest states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recently, takeover speculation has linked JPMorgan Chase
with Washington Mutual (WM.N), the largest U.S. savings  loan,
as well as PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) of
Pittsburgh and SunTrust Banks Inc. (STI.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike the tense gatherings held by banks hard hit by the
credit crunch, JPMorgan's meeting was a lengthy but relatively
muted affair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders reelected all 12 directors to the board and
rejected all seven investor proposals covering such issues as
lobbying, political contributions and an independent chairman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is also one of six US banks facing proposals from
socially responsible funds who want lenders and investors to
use their clout to apply pressure on Sudan, particularly
through its oil industry, to end "the ongoing atrocities" in
Darfur. The bank opposed a shareholder resolution calling for
JPMorgan to take a stronger stand on Darfur.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon during the meeting touted the bank's new human rights
policy and promised to continue discussions with human rights
groups, but he largely brushed off shareholders who spoke in
support of the proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors also turned down an advisory vote on executive
compensation, or "say on pay."    &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like most banks, JPMorgan's earnings and stock price fell
last year, but Dimon's own stock soared since the bank largely
avoided the subprime and leveraged lending losses that pounded
rivals such as Citigroup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jamie Dimon received $28 million in total compensation last
year, when JPMorgan reported record profit and revenue.
Morgan's  stock fell nearly 10 percent, compared with a 25
percent plunge by KBW's index .BKX of large U.S. banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was well deserved," gadfly investor Evelyn Davis said,
typically very critical about CEO pay. "He not only saved Bear
Stearns, he saved the whole world from Armageddon."

&lt;p&gt;ADDING MULTIMEDIA Coca-Cola Renews Global Sponsorship of Special Olympics, Identifies Executive to Serve as Special Olympics President and COO

      Coca-Cola and Special Olympics Further Partnership On 40th
                 Anniversary of Long-Term Relationship
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company and Special Olympics today announced the
renewal of their partnership through 2011 and further strengthened
their 40-year relationship with the election of Coca-Cola executive J.
Brady Lum to serve as the new President and Chief Operating Officer of
Special Olympics, Inc.

   To celebrate the renewal of a partnership that dates to the
founding of Special Olympics in 1968, The Coca-Cola Company hosted the
semi-annual Special Olympics International Board of Directors meeting
at the world headquarters of Coca-Cola where board members, along with
other Coca-Cola employees, participated in sporting activities with
invited Special Olympics athletes.

   The worldwide sponsorship commitment, which covers the calendar
years 2008 through 2011 - including support for the 2009 Special
Olympics World Winter Games and the 2011 World Summer Games - consists
of cash, in-kind products and services, technical support and
marketing and fund-raising support for Special Olympics.

   Underscoring the relationship, the organizations announced that
Lum will serve as President and COO of Special Olympics. In that
capacity, he will provide strategic direction and day-to-day
leadership for Special Olympics. Lum is a 15-year veteran of the
Coca-Cola system, most recently having led the integration of the
"Manifesto for Growth," a global initiative that recast the Company's
mission, vision and capabilities. He has served in a variety of
leadership roles in operations, marketing, strategic planning and
organizational development, including Vice President, North America
Strategic Planning and Integration and Vice President and Northeast
Region Manager for Coca-Cola North America.

   Mr. Lum's community involvement has been extensive. He has served
as Chairman of the Board of the national Hands On Network, and as a
Board Member, chaired the Strategic Planning Committee of the recently
combined Hands On Network and Points of Light Foundation. He has also
served on the Jefferson Scholars National Selection Committee and Mead
Endowment Advisory Board at the University of Virginia, and is a
graduate of the Diversity Leadership Academy in Atlanta. He earned a
bachelor's degree in government and foreign affairs, with honors, from
the University of Virginia and a master's degree in business from
Harvard University.

   "For the past four decades, Coca-Cola has been a committed
supporter of Special Olympics," said Timothy Shriver, Chairman of
Special Olympics. "That dedication is evident today through a renewed
sponsorship but perhaps even more telling, the willingness to offer a
very talented and experienced executive to serve as President and
Chief Operating Officer of Special Olympics. It is a rare opportunity
to welcome someone of Brady's caliber and expertise in building
collaborative teams and working within multinational, decentralized
businesses."

   Lum's involvement represents a continuation of Coca-Cola's support
for Special Olympics through its senior leadership. In 2007, Muhtar
Kent, President and Chief Operating Officer, The Coca-Cola Company,
was elected to the Special Olympics International Board of Directors.

   "It is appropriate that in a year when we celebrate the 40th
anniversary of our founding partnership with Special Olympics that we
further strengthen the ties that bond our organizations," said Mr.
Kent. "It is a reflection that we are natural partners because we
share the same values of inclusion, acceptance and optimism."

   Coca-Cola, which became a founding partner of Special Olympics
when the organization was established in 1968 by Eunice Kennedy
Shriver, has been deeply involved with both the summer and winter
editions of the Special Olympics World Games since 1979. The Coca-Cola
Company supports the Olympic Games, Paralympic Games and Special
Olympics World Games, three global events that bring people together
from all around the world through sport.

   "I look forward to working with Tim Shriver, a truly visionary
leader, in exploring new opportunities to extend the reach and impact
that the Special Olympics has on communities around the world," said
Lum.

   Special Olympics athletes, Coca-Cola employees and members of the
Special Olympics Board of Directors at today's festivities came
together in the "Special Olympics Sports Experience" zone set up at
Coca-Cola headquarters. This activity allowed participants to
experience the talents and personalities of Special Olympics athletes
first hand through interactive sports activities such as basketball,
table tennis, bocce and floor hockey.

&lt;p&gt;  PHOENIX, AZ, May 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) has elevated nine employees to the title of IBM Fellow
-- its most prestigious technical honor. The company also presented more than
$3.5million in cash awards to corporate and patent portfolio awardees in
addition to
awards given to more than 500 IBM technical leaders from around the world
directly responsible for collaborating to deliver true innovation and business
value.

    IBM conferred the accolades and awards at its 2008 Corporate Technical
Recognition
Event (CTRE) in Phoenix, Ariz. CTRE is a 45-year tradition at IBM,
established to recognize exceptional technical employees and reward them for
extraordinary achievements and contributions to the company's technology

    "Fueled by the extraordinary achievements put forth by our technical
community of
214,000 professionals, this year's honorees have displayed an organic sense
of the crucial importance of operating within a global culture, and this has
resulted in a caliber of work that is raising the bar even higher," said Nick
Donofrio, executive vice president, Innovation and Technology, IBM.  "By defying
the
limitations of geographic boundaries, their outstanding technical
accomplishments
have made IBM a stronger company.  Their tireless drive and passion for
excellence along with their outstanding body of work is generating real

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from Shell, paragraph 6)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Felix Onuah&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA May 20 (Reuters) - Nigeria is seeking $1.91 billion
it says it is owed by Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and ExxonMobil
(XOM.N) under the terms of oil production sharing contracts
governing two offshore fields, the presidency said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Umaru Yar'Adua had ordered state oil firm NNPC to
take "immediate steps" to recover the money as part of efforts
to ensure Nigeria was not losing revenue from the multi-billion
dollar contracts for its deep water fields, his office said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "His administration will continue to do everything possible
to ensure that Nigeria derives maximum economic benefits from
the exploitation of its God-given resources," the presidency
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria is seeking $850 million from Shell and $646.3
million from Exxon which it says accrued to the NNPC as capital
allowance from the Bonga and Erha fields respectively, the
statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The NNPC and the government were also seeking $414.6 million
they say are owed from Bonga gas sales and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As these matters are subject of ongoing discussions between
NNPC, (Shell's local unit) SNEPCo and other partners in block
OML 118 (which includes Bonga) we have no further public
comments to make at this stage," a Shell spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon officials were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exploration licences for the two fields were awarded under a
production sharing contract which allows the investor to recoup
all their costs before sharing profits with the government, and
paying royalties and taxes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yar'Adua had told Nigeria's largest investors shortly after
he took power about a year ago that Africa's top oil producer
wanted a greater share of profits from the offshore fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The statement said he had also directed the federal revenue
service to pursue income tax payments due from Shell and Exxon
on the operations of the Bonga and Erha fields.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also added that all future gas sales agreements with oil
multi-nationals would be extended to include natural gas
liquids, which were not covered by previous deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The statement said Yar'Adua would soon unveil his
long-awaited agenda for the total restructuring of the oil and
gas sector, but gave no further details.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp has proposed to buy Yahoo Inc's search business and take a minority stake in the Web pioneer, stopping short of a full-out merger, a person familiar with the discussions said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of the deal Yahoo would put its Asian assets, including significant minority stakes in Yahoo Japan and China's Alibaba Group, up for sale, while Microsoft would buy a chunk of what remains of the company, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The talks were revealed by the two companies on Sunday, but they declined to reveal the terms of the discussions. Earlier this month, Microsoft walked away from a proposal to acquire Yahoo for $47.5 billion, or $33 per share, after Yahoo rebuffed the offer, saying it would only settle for $37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new deal, if completed, would forge an alliance between the two companies that would represent an alternative means of competing with rival Google Inc, whose ubiquitous search engine has made it an online advertising powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal represents an outline of Microsoft's current thinking and it does not yet put a value on Yahoo's search business, said the source, who was not authorized to speak on the record because the discussions are confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo representatives declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Yahoo fell as much as 0.87 percent on Monday, before closing up 2 cents at $27.68 on Nasdaq. Microsoft dropped 1.8 percent to $29.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Collins Stewart analyst Sandeep Aggarwal estimates Yahoo's search advertising business is worth about $21 billion, while putting the value of its  international assets at $9.25 billion, according to a research note he published on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is the most interested in Yahoo Search," said Aggarwal, who added that Microsoft may buy parts of Yahoo for a premium or buy all of Yahoo and then spin off certain assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in both Yahoo Japan and Alibaba.com Ltd dropped 4 percent on the new proposal, thanks to the greater uncertainty now hanging over the two companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We had always looked at Yahoo Inc teaming up with Microsoft as a positive for Yahoo Japan," said Macquarie Securities analyst Nathan Ramler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that Yahoo Japan is potentially not included is a concern," he said, adding that the Japanese company could have benefited from Microsoft's expertise in software, personal computers and its deep pockets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHASING GOOGLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said on Sunday that it was talking with Yahoo about an alternative transaction that did not involve a full buyout after withdrawing its sweetened $47.5 billion bid for the company on May 3.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo is a distant second to Google Inc in Web search in the United States, and Microsoft is third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combined, Yahoo and Microsoft would have around a 30 percent U.S. share, compared with Google's roughly 60 percent, according to figures from research firm comScore. Google's lead is even larger on a global basis, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The proposal from Microsoft would likely complicate ongoing discussions between Yahoo and Google. The two companies are still talking about a possible search advertising partnership, people familiar with those discussions have told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between Yahoo and Microsoft resumed after Microsoft insisted for two weeks that it had moved on from its pursuit of Yahoo, prompting shareholders of the Web company to criticize its board for mishandling negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financier Carl Icahn launched a proxy fight last week to force Yahoo to reopen talks with Microsoft. Icahn, who owns nearly 10 million Yahoo shares as well as options to acquire another 49 million shares, formally filed on Monday the preliminary proxy to nominate 10 directors to Yahoo's board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A person familiar with Icahn's thinking said on Sunday that an alternative deal for Yahoo, rather than a full acquisition, would prompt the investor to push Yahoo to do a deal with Google. Icahn did not comment on the talks between Microsoft and Yahoo in his filing on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Alibaba Group, the private holding company whose assets include Alibaba.com, has been lining up investors to help it buy back the Yahoo stake, sources told Reuters earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo's core franchise stems from the roughly 500 million Web users who pass through its network of Internet media properties each month. Major attractions include Yahoo Mail, news, sports, entertainment and its Flickr.com photo site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It generates most of its revenue through sales of display advertising to those visitors, as well as making an increasing push to sell ads on non-Yahoo sites. As the No. 2 provider of Web search services, Yahoo also sells ads alongside search results and on a variety of affiliated sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in New York, Daisuke Wakabayashi in Los Angeles and Edwina Gibbs in Tokyo; editing by Carol Bishopric, Jeffrey Benkoe, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Three major brokerage firms said on Tuesday they will start letting their clients access each other's "dark pools" -- trading systems which keep buyers and sellers anonymous -- to increase chances of trading orders being filled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrangement among Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and UBS AG (UBSN.VX) pairs each in bilateral agreements that allow algorithmic trading orders from one to tap into the additional liquidity offered by the other's electronic trading network. These include Goldman Sachs' SIGMA X, Morgan Stanley's MS POOL and UBS' PIN ATS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dark pools now account for roughly 10 percent of equities trading in the United States, according to New York-based consultancy TABB Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They now number more than 40, up from a handful just two years ago, as investors seek to place larger orders without showing their hand to the market and risk adverse price movements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs' SIGMA X is the largest broker-run dark pool, averaging 140 million shares a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though the companies will allow their rivals' to tap into their dark pools, the pools will remain separate entities and the firms are indifferent as to which pools their trades will tap as they seek to fill orders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The benefit to our clients is that we are reconnecting a marketplace that has been fragmented," said Andrew Silverman, Morgan Stanley's director of electronic trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Having to go to separate pools has been a point of contention for buy-side firms, said TABB director of research Adam Sussman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While the three firms compete ferociously for trading business, they said they were teaming up because they were comfortable with the quality and confidentiality of each other's pools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a balancing act between finding liquidity and not advertising our clients' interests," said Will Sterling, UBS Electronic Trading's managing director. "Not a lot of pools out there fit that mold, but Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while this deal brings together three of the largest brokers, they are keeping the door open others eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For now we are sticking to these two," said Goldman Sachs Electronic Trading's managing director Greg Tusar. "This isn't a final statement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Phil Wahba, editing by Dave Zimmerman and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Five Prime Therapeutics, Inc. and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) today
announced the initiation of a worldwide collaborative research and
license agreement. The collaboration will focus on the discovery of
antibody targets and novel therapeutic protein products to treat
certain areas of cancer and diabetes. Under the collaboration,
FivePrime will screen its comprehensive protein library in both
cell-based assays and primary in vivo screens directed toward finding
potential therapeutic protein products and antibody targets.

   Upon the commencement of the collaboration, FivePrime will receive
an up-front payment and an equity investment from Pfizer and three
years of committed research funding. Pfizer will have exclusive
worldwide rights to develop and commercialize certain products and
targets discovered during the research term, in exchange for future
milestones and royalties. Further details of the agreement have not
been disclosed.

   "Pfizer's commitment to biotherapeutics and its extensive
development and commercialization capabilities are an ideal match for
FivePrime's powerful biologics discovery platform. This combination
will increase the likelihood and speed of discovering and developing
new biotherapeutics for patients in need," stated Lewis T. ("Rusty")
Williams, MD, PhD, FivePrime's Founder and Executive Chairman.

   FivePrime's existing investors made a co-investment in FivePrime
in conjunction with Pfizer's equity purchase. "This is a very
significant transaction for FivePrime," commented Gail Maderis,
President and CEO of FivePrime. "It provides the financial runway to
take several of our oncology products into clinical trials in addition
to greatly expanding our discovery efforts."

   A key component of the collaboration is FivePrime's comprehensive,
rapid protein discovery system. Its protein screening library contains
essentially all human secreted proteins and their receptors, including
many that are unavailable in public collections. FivePrime screens its
protein library in both complex, primary cell assays and in
high-throughput in vivo systems. The in vivo technology is also used
for rapid validation of hits, significantly reducing the time from an
idea to an Investigational New Drug.

   "We are very excited about this research collaboration, as it will
fill a core need for Pfizer's new biologics enterprise, the
Biotherapeutics and Bioinnovation Center (BBC)," said BBC President
Corey Goodman, PhD. "Our mission is to gain access to the best
internal and external science and to achieve Pfizer's corporate
ambition of becoming a global leader in biotherapeutics. The
investment and partnership with FivePrime represents a key milestone
in our efforts as we are confident it will generate therapeutic
proteins and antibodies that will ultimately lead to innovative
medicines for patients worldwide."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds more analyst comments, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 20 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers cut its earnings
forecast for Wall Street investment banks Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to reflect losses from hedging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This past quarter we have seen a meaningful dislocation
between cash and derivative prices across several assets
classes including commercial mortgages, leveraged loans and
corporate debt," Lehman analyst Roger Freeman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that the brokers will incur hedging program
losses due to this basis risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freeman said broker stocks could come under further
pressure as consensus estimates continue to come down as the
market factors in the far-reaching impact of spread basis risk
this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Structured debt marks should not come as a surprise to the
market as brokers have in the past indicated that these gains
would reverse when broker credit spreads compressed again, he
said, noting that recent estimate cuts had been focused on the
reversal of structured debt gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Effectively the second quarter is looking to be a messy
quarter, but not one exposing incremental fundamental
weaknesses in balance sheets," the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freeman cut his second quarter earnings estimate on Goldman
Sachs to $3.18 a share from $3.75 and 2008 estimate to $15.04 a
share from $15.60. He cut his second quarter estimate on Morgan
Stanley to $0.87 a share from $1.31 and 2008 estimate to $4.72
a share from $5.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect further losses in Alt-A residential mortgage
assets, as we believe hedging for this 'murky' mortgage asset
class is much more difficult," Freeman noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The below-prime Alt-A loans often go to people who cannot
fully document income or assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Freeman said in Alt-A, both Goldman and Morgan Stanley have
meaningful exposure, $5 billion and $4.6 billion respectively,
that he believes will generate losses during the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "...the economic environment (with an expectation of weak
4Q and 1Q GDP and a new round of Fed cutting) will temper
sustainable post-quarter gains in the stocks, though we
acknowledge that near-term sentiment around the economy appears
to have temporarily improved," he wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Goldman were trading down $2.30 at $182.10, while
Morgan Stanley stock was down $1.59 $44.61 in morning trade on
the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;OMNI Home Care Acquired by MBF Healthcare Partners and Goldman Sachs Urban Investment Group

NEW YORK &amp; CORAL GABLES, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
MBF Healthcare Partners, LP ("MBF") and the Goldman Sachs Urban
Investment Group ("Goldman Sachs") today announced the acquisition of
OMNI Home Care ("OMNI"), a leading provider of skilled nursing and
therapy home healthcare services. MBF and Goldman Sachs will share
joint ownership of OMNI; Wachovia and ORIX Finance Corp. led the
financing of the senior credit facility; other details of the
acquisition were not disclosed. Through the acquisition, MBF and
Goldman Sachs will seek to maximize OMNI's potential for organic and
acquisitive growth.

   OMNI, a Coral Springs, FL based company founded in 2001, is a
leading provider of healthcare services to homes in more than 30
locations across Florida, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana and
Illinois. OMNI offers coordinated skilled home health nursing and
rehabilitation therapy programs that are readily implemented in a
variety of housing settings that benefit senior residents. OMNI has
established itself as a leader in implementing innovative ways to
provide quality care to its patients and is well positioned to grow
organically and explore additional acquisitions to expand the platform
of its services.

   "OMNI's strong presence across Florida presents a number of
opportunities to capitalize on adjacent markets. We are excited about
the opportunity to partner with MBF and Goldman Sachs to grow the
company and capitalize on the opportunities currently available in the
home healthcare market," said Fred Portnoy, Chief Executive Officer of
OMNI Home Care. "Our current management team has built the company
since 2001 into a high quality, growth oriented regional home health
provider without the aid of institutional capital. We are excited to
enter the next phase of growth for OMNI alongside MBF and Goldman
Sachs." Mr. Portnoy will join the Board of Directors for OMNI.

   Home health is one of the fastest growing segments in the delivery
of health care. Home care spending from both public and private
sources grew from $2.4 billion in 1980 to an estimated $64.2 billion
in 2008, driven by favorable underlying demographic trends, new
clinical protocols that expanded the range of home-based therapy,
lower cost of home care relative to facilities-based care, and patient
preferences for in-home care. As the U.S. over-65 population increases
and the industry seeks to contain rising costs, home care is
increasingly viewed as a favorable alternative for treatment.

   Miguel (Mike) B. Fernandez, Chairman at MBF said, "We have been
looking at making an investment in the home nursing industry for quite
some time and are excited to partner with Goldman Sachs on the OMNI
transaction. OMNI and its management team represent the very best in
class in home nursing and we are looking forward to working with them
to maximize their growth potential." MBF will hold two Board of
Directors seats on OMNI's board.

   Martin Chavez, Managing Director at Goldman Sachs in the Urban
Investment Group said, "We are very pleased to have the opportunity to
work with OMNI's management team and MBF. We believe Mr. Portnoy and
his management team have a strong track record of operating excellence
that will prove to be very valuable as the industry adopts the 2008
Prospective Payment System rule changes. We look forward to working
jointly with MBF, leveraging their deep sector expertise, in building
a leading national home care provider." Goldman Sachs will also hold
two Board of Directors seats on OMNI's board.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced details of new application security software
designed to help clients securely manage employee, partner and customer IT users
and their access to company applications and information.

    The new release of IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager software focuses on
enabling a company's separate business divisions to deploy secure software
applications using open standards and a wide range of security credentials
without
needing to embed complex security logic into each application. The solution
simplifies application integration using many forms of user credentials and
facilitates the secure sharing of information between trusted parties -- such as
business partners or separately managed divisions within an organization
operating in an SOA environment.

    IBM, the current leader in Identity and Access Management software
revenue,according to analyst firm IDC (1), bolsters its existing portfolio with
this
new release that provides new management capabilities, user-centric identity
technology and substantially extended interoperability with several open
industry standards and other vendors' software.

    "With its extended interoperability, IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager
is
uniquely positioned to simplify application security integration, enabling
business
process and application owners to deliver their services without being
constrained
by IT security and compliance issues," said Venkat Raghavan, director of
product management, IBM Tivoli security, risk and compliance software. "This
enables clients to tie together various organizational and business silos while
also simplifying the integration between their company and partners' Web sites."

    The vexing challenge for developers building applications is how to deal
with
the multitude of user credentials that need to be managed while providing
end-to-end security. Using an office building analogy, end-to-end security could
entail electronic locks opened by employee badges on the front door and keys
for individual offices and file cabinets that store business critical
information. Similarly, in the IT environment, it is common to have a single
application that needs to support many forms of user credentials as business
processes and organizations are linked across many facets of a company,
including mainframe applications. Managing and securing access to a company's
many services, applications and data are needed to meet security and
compliance requirements.

    This new IBM Tivoli software release automates the management of user
credentials across applications without the application specialists
needingto be security experts. Application owners define the type of credential
needed
based on an application's risk profile, and end users who present their
credentials are automatically signed-on and given access to the various parts
of the applications as appropriate. The software also provides auditors with a
single view of the credentials used to help validate that the user access
matches policy.

    IBM Software Brings New User-Centric Identity to SOA Applications

    The new IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager now provides businesses the
flexibility to integrate with leading user-centric identity management
technology
and frameworks, including OpenID, Microsoft Windows CardSpace and Eclipse's
Higgins
Identity Frameworks.

    User-centric identity management provides a means for users to control
whatinformation they share about themselves. Similar to a college id, driver's
license
and a passport, the user is able to choose which identification claims will be
used when
a situation requires it.  IBM software now enables organizations to bring these
identities into one central, federated identity management system that supports
traditional identities in addition to the emerging user-centric frameworks.

    While reusing existing applications and Web services can dramatically reduce
SOA
implementation costs, applications are often developed independently and have
different formats to define, share and audit user identities. IBM Tivoli
Federated Identity Manager's built-in SOA Identity Service provides the ability
to
manage and audit identities across a wide range of formats and vendors'
applications to help maintain identity context throughout use in an SOA
environment.  This helps provide clients a unified approach to manage and
report on user identities across shared applications, including portal
environments.

    The software now supports various user and application credentials such as
RACF Passticket, Kerberos, SAML, WS-Security and platform specific credentials
used by Microsoft .NET, IBM WebSphere, SAP NetWeaver, Oracle and CA. When
combined with leading user-centric identity management technology and
frameworks,
including OpenID, Microsoft Windows CardSpace and Eclipse's Higgins Identity
Frameworks, the software provides the required flexibility for business
process and application owners to quickly and securely provide services to their
business.

    "Already a recognized leader in federated identity management, one should
expect
IBM's ability to extend its integration with other vendors' Web access
management software and the major open standards and user-centric identity
management
approaches to help speed the adoption of secure SOA and federated identity
around the world," said Sally Hudson, research director within IDC's security
products and services group.

    IBM's Tivoli security software helps prevent unauthorized access to valuable
customer, employee and business data and facilitates compliance with corporate
security policy and regulatory requirements. It is part of IBM's portfolio
of service management software which automates some of the most challenging
processes associated with managing complex IT environments, such as managing
storage devices and deploying new software releases and patches. The software
helps customers fight rising IT costs, manage constant change and meet the
demand to stay competitive.

    The new IBM Tivoli Federated Identity Manager will be generally available
worldwide
in June 2008.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that Alcatel-Lucent (Euronext Paris: ALU)
(NYSE: ALU) has selected IBM Tivoli identity management software to help support
its efforts to increase security measures, improve employee efficiency, reduce
help desk costs and support compliance initiatives.

    Alcatel-Lucent is deploying IBM Tivoli Identity Manager and creating a
standardized process for managing the digital identities of its employees and
contractors, with plans to expand the scope to its suppliers, resellers and
other
business partners. With this new process, the company expects to reduce the
total cost of running its IT service desk by about 10 percent.

    "Expectations for real-time access, regulatory compliance, operational
costoptimization and mobility of the workforce are key drivers for
streamliningour user account provisioning processes," said Elizabeth Hackenson,
Alcatel-Lucent
CIO. "IBM's expertise and software have helped us develop a global user
identity management program, providing us an automated tool to manage our
user accounts, while reducing costs."

    The initiative replaces various user provisioning processes with one
integrated, standardized user management system. It provides
Alcatel-Lucentgreater visibility into system-wide user identities, and uses
automated software to
streamline processes and tasks, lowering IT support costs.

    With IBM Tivoli Identity Manager's password self-reset feature, which allows
users to reset and synchronize their passwords on-line, the company expects to
reduce password-related calls to the IT service desk by 70 percent and
provide increased productivity for both system users and support staff.
Additionally, the new system can automatically close accounts of employees who
have
left the company, helping to eliminate related security risks and improving
the data quality of the company directories. The IBM Tivoli software also helps
to support Alcatel-Lucent's compliance efforts with worldwide Sarbanes-Oxley
requirements.

    By expanding its identity management program to include users from its
network of business partners, Alcatel-Lucent can provide new, secure
levelsof information sharing, access, and monitoring, helping to support its
partners and promote channel growth.

    "Alcatel-Lucent has demonstrated leadership through its sustainable business
strategy, focused on adopting a business-driven risk management approach," said
Sean
Bergin, director, worldwide sales, IBM Tivoli security and compliance software.
"Today's forward-thinking business leaders look differently at IT security --
a security strategy should manage risk and support business goals, but also
help drive business growth by opening new, secure doors of opportunity."

    IBM leads in Identity and Access Management worldwide revenue, according
toanalyst firm IDC (1), thanks in part to the strength of key offerings such as
IBM Tivoli Identity Manager, Tivoli Access Manager and Tivoli Federated Identity
Manager.

    IBM Tivoli Identity Manager software takes a risk-based approach to help
clients effectively manage user accounts, access permissions and passwords for
employees, customers and other IT system users from creation to termination.
It provides a centralized point for administering users, their passwords,
business roles and access rights -- helping to ensure that business and
security policy is set on all systems and applications across the company. The
software also automates for businesses the manual process of setting-up new
accounts and resetting user passwords.

    IBM's Tivoli security software helps prevent unauthorized access to valuable
customer, employee and business data and facilitates compliance with corporate
security policy and regulatory requirements. It is part of IBM's portfolio
of service management software which automates some of the most challenging

&lt;p&gt;QUINCY, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
On Friday, May 16th, Pipeline Data Inc (OTCBB:PPDA) and COCARD(R)
Marketing Group, LLC ("COCARD") signed a Definitive Merger Agreement
for Pipeline to acquire COCARD for approximately $79.5 million in cash
and notes plus future considerations based on performance. COCARD is a
Nashville, Tennessee-based merchant services provider comprised of 73
independent sales offices catering primarily to small and medium-sized
retail accounts. COCARD processes over $3 billion of credit card
transactions annually from its base of over 26,000 merchants.

   Pipeline Data has received a senior secured debt proposal of $90
million for the funding of the transaction led by a Fortune 10
financial institution, of which approximately $70 million will be
available to support the purchase. Pipeline has also received a
proposal for the equity component of the transaction in the amount of
approximately $50 million. In addition to funding the COCARD
acquisition, the funds will reduce Pipeline's current cost of capital
and enable the company to properly rationalize its balance sheet in
coordination with the transaction. The COCARD transaction, among other
matters, is subject to the approval of the proposed financing
institutions. At this time, Pipeline has elected to defer its
previously announced merger with Innovative Resource Alliance.

&lt;p&gt;Citrix and Microsoft Unveil New Branch Office Application Delivery Solution at Citrix Synergy 2008

   New Citrix Branch Repeater Combines Innovative Staging Technology
   with Windows Services to Enhance Application Delivery for Branch
                           Office Employees
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Today at Citrix Synergy(TM), the event where virtualization,
networking and application delivery meet, Citrix Systems, Inc.
(NASDAQ:CTXS) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced the
immediate availability of Citrix Branch Repeater(TM), an innovative
new line of branch office appliances developed and marketed as part of
a strategic alliance between the two companies. By staging the
delivery of applications and Windows services closer to branch office
users, Citrix Branch Repeater helps make branch office computing
faster and more cost-effective for companies of all sizes.

   Citrix Branch Repeater will be sold as part of the Citrix Delivery
Center(TM) product family, an end-to-end infrastructure designed to
help customers transform static datacenters into dynamic delivery
centers. Just as digital television repeaters amplify and retransmit
media signals to homes in a given neighborhood, Citrix Branch Repeater
sits between corporate datacenters and branch offices, amplifying and
retransmitting applications to branch office users. Based on Windows
Server and available with Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration
(ISA) Server software, the Citrix Branch Repeater provides an ideal
complement to application virtualization solutions, enhancing
application delivery and performance while simultaneously delivering
critical Windows Server infrastructure services in the branch.

   "This type of alliance will give companies more flexibility for
managing their branches, and it will address never-ending bandwidth
demands from branch workers," said Robin Gareiss, executive vice
president and senior founding partner, Nemertes Research. "The
adoption of managed services at the branch is increasing. Today, 63
percent of companies use some form of managed services at the branch,
compared to 46 percent in 2007(1)."

   Citrix Branch Repeater optimizes the branch through:

   --  Staging Streamed Applications Closer to Branch Office Users:
        Windows applications streamed to branch employees by Citrix
        XenApp(TM) (previously known as Citrix Presentation
        Server(TM)) can now be staged at the front door of the branch
        by Citrix Branch Repeater. Once an application has been
        received at the branch, it can be delivered rapidly to branch
        employees directly from the Branch Repeater, eliminating
        unnecessary traversal back to the datacenter across expensive
        and often slow WAN links. As new or updated applications are
        staged in the datacenter by XenApp administrators, they can be
        easily delivered to each Branch Repeater for fast, efficient
        and secure "rebroadcast" to each branch employee's desktop as
        needed.

   --  Consolidating Windows Branch Services: Citrix Branch Repeater
        is built on Windows Server, enabling the consolidation and
        delivery of native Windows services such as file, print,
        Active Directory, domain name system (DNS), and dynamic host
        configuration protocol (DHCP) plus ISA Server 2006 Web caching

        native Windows management tools to remotely manage Citrix
        Branch Repeater, helping minimize support costs in remote
        offices(2).

   --  Accelerating All Applications Delivered over the Wide Area
        Network: Citrix Branch Repeater accelerates the delivery of
        application traffic to and from the branch using advanced wide
        area network (WAN) optimization technology from Citrix. In
        addition to improving application performance for branch
        office users, this optimization can reduce bandwidth
        consumption by up to 75 percent(3).

   "We have been customers of both Citrix and Microsoft for many
years, and their respective technologies have continuously benefitted
our growing company," said Tom Allen, director of IT, Ozinga Brothers,

throughout the US Midwest. "Citrix Branch Repeater will allow us to
further enhance our use of Citrix XenApp and Windows Server to deliver
applications to our branches without increasing our IT overhead while
keeping our branch users satisfied."

   "Branch office employees should have the same productive computing
experience as employees at headquarters," said Bala Kasiviswanathan,
director of branch and storage solutions, Windows Server division at
Microsoft. "Windows Server-based branch office solutions help
customers deliver core infrastructure services that are required to
keep branch office applications and operations running efficiently.
The Citrix Branch Repeater streamlines and consolidates the
application delivery infrastructure while delivering on the
performance and availability expectations of the most demanding branch
office environments."

   "Citrix Branch Repeater is an impactful addition to the toolkit of
enterprise IT departments, because its easy integration with the
application delivery infrastructure helps solve the key challenges
facing IT administrators," said Troy Trenchard, vice president and
general manager, Access and Acceleration Group at Citrix. "The
seamless environment allows customers to place the technology where it
makes the most sense for the business."

&lt;p&gt;AbsoluteProof for Microsoft Exchange Provides Content Integrity
                               for Email
RESTON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Surety, LLC, the leading provider of data integrity solutions,
today announced the release of AbsoluteProof(R) for Microsoft
Exchange, a lightweight, automated solution that seamlessly integrates
into the Microsoft(R) Exchange Server 2003 to prove time, date and
content integrity of email records. AbsoluteProof for Microsoft
Exchange is based on Surety's AbsoluteProof service, the standard for
electronic data authentication, which provides customers with the
ability to prove the authenticity of their electronic records.

   Surety's recent Email Security and Authentication Survey of more
than 800 IT security, email security and compliance professionals
revealed significant corporate demand for email authentication
solutions. More than 65 percent of respondents expressed doubt that
their organization's emails would be authenticated and admitted as
evidence in legal, regulatory or patent disputes, and more than 80
percent of respondents doubted their organization's ability to
authenticate email records and attachments.

   AbsoluteProof for Microsoft Exchange is designed to provide
third-party validation of the time, date and content integrity of
electronic records, enabling organizations to authenticate all email
records. AbsoluteProof for Microsoft Exchange automatically affixes a
cryptographic timestamp or Surety Integrity Seal(TM) (Seal) to all
sent and received emails stored in the Microsoft Exchange Server
Message Archive. Once an email is sealed, the Seal can be used to
prove the authenticity of the e-mail at any time in the future. Seals
are associated with stored email in such a way that, if email messages
are migrated to a separate email archive, or sent to a third party,
the Seals automatically accompany them. The result is a
litigation-ready solution to the problem of defending the integrity of
email evidence.

   "As the most widely-deployed solution for business-class email and
collaboration, Microsoft Exchange Server is actively used by more than
100 million professionals," said Tom Klaff, CEO of Surety, LLC. "Not
surprisingly, this year's Email Security and Authentication Survey
revealed that organizations are extensively using email to collaborate
and share business-critical data, and an increasing number of
organizations are being called upon to produce email records to meet
e-discovery requests. The survey also revealed serious doubt in the
ability to authenticate email records in order to ensure their
admittance as evidence in court. AbsoluteProof for Microsoft Exchange
provides Microsoft Exchange customers with a way to ensure that they
will be able to authenticate those critical email records should the
need arise for legal or regulatory disputes."

   AbsoluteProof for Microsoft Exchange is $25 per seat for unlimited
use and is available immediately. For more information on
AbsoluteProof for Microsoft Exchange visit http://www.surety.com.

   About Surety, LLC

   Founded in 1994 by two prominent Bellcore Scientists, Surety is
recognized as a premiere trusted third-party timestamp authority. The
company's flagship product AbsoluteProof(R) enables organizations to
meet the legal, fiduciary and regulatory responsibilities associated
with creating, managing and archiving electronic data by providing
verifiable evidence of data authenticity. Their client base is made up
of legal and financial services firms, research and development
laboratories and copyright protection agencies that are ensuring
record integrity with AbsoluteProof. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Renews Global Sponsorship of Special Olympics, Identifies Executive to Serve as Special Olympics President and COO

      Coca-Cola and Special Olympics Further Partnership On 40th
                 Anniversary of Long-Term Relationship
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company and Special Olympics today announced the
renewal of their partnership through 2011 and further strengthened
their 40-year relationship with the election of Coca-Cola executive J.
Brady Lum to serve as the new President and Chief Operating Officer of
Special Olympics, Inc.

   To celebrate the renewal of a partnership that dates to the
founding of Special Olympics in 1968, The Coca-Cola Company hosted the
semi-annual Special Olympics International Board of Directors meeting
at the world headquarters of Coca-Cola where board members, along with
other Coca-Cola employees, participated in sporting activities with
invited Special Olympics athletes.

   The worldwide sponsorship commitment, which covers the calendar
years 2008 through 2011 - including support for the 2009 Special
Olympics World Winter Games and the 2011 World Summer Games - consists
of cash, in-kind products and services, technical support and
marketing and fund-raising support for Special Olympics.

   Underscoring the relationship, the organizations announced that
Lum will serve as President and COO of Special Olympics. In that
capacity, he will provide strategic direction and day-to-day
leadership for Special Olympics. Lum is a 15-year veteran of the
Coca-Cola system, most recently having led the integration of the
"Manifesto for Growth," a global initiative that recast the Company's
mission, vision and capabilities. He has served in a variety of
leadership roles in operations, marketing, strategic planning and
organizational development, including Vice President, North America
Strategic Planning and Integration and Vice President and Northeast
Region Manager for Coca-Cola North America.

   Mr. Lum's community involvement has been extensive. He has served
as Chairman of the Board of the national Hands On Network, and as a
Board Member, chaired the Strategic Planning Committee of the recently
combined Hands On Network and Points of Light Foundation. He has also
served on the Jefferson Scholars National Selection Committee and Mead
Endowment Advisory Board at the University of Virginia, and is a
graduate of the Diversity Leadership Academy in Atlanta. He earned a
bachelor's degree in government and foreign affairs, with honors, from
the University of Virginia and a master's degree in business from
Harvard University.

   "For the past four decades, Coca-Cola has been a committed
supporter of Special Olympics," said Timothy Shriver, Chairman of
Special Olympics. "That dedication is evident today through a renewed
sponsorship but perhaps even more telling, the willingness to offer a
very talented and experienced executive to serve as President and
Chief Operating Officer of Special Olympics. It is a rare opportunity
to welcome someone of Brady's caliber and expertise in building
collaborative teams and working within multinational, decentralized
businesses."

   Lum's involvement represents a continuation of Coca-Cola's support
for Special Olympics through its senior leadership. In 2007, Muhtar
Kent, President and Chief Operating Officer, The Coca-Cola Company,
was elected to the Special Olympics International Board of Directors.

   "It is appropriate that in a year when we celebrate the 40th
anniversary of our founding partnership with Special Olympics that we
further strengthen the ties that bond our organizations," said Mr.
Kent. "It is a reflection that we are natural partners because we
share the same values of inclusion, acceptance and optimism."

   Coca-Cola, which became a founding partner of Special Olympics
when the organization was established in 1968 by Eunice Kennedy
Shriver, has been deeply involved with both the summer and winter
editions of the Special Olympics World Games since 1979. The Coca-Cola
Company supports the Olympic Games, Paralympic Games and Special
Olympics World Games, three global events that bring people together
from all around the world through sport.

   "I look forward to working with Tim Shriver, a truly visionary
leader, in exploring new opportunities to extend the reach and impact
that the Special Olympics has on communities around the world," said
Lum.

   Special Olympics athletes, Coca-Cola employees and members of the
Special Olympics Board of Directors at today's festivities came
together in the "Special Olympics Sports Experience" zone set up at
Coca-Cola headquarters. This activity allowed participants to
experience the talents and personalities of Special Olympics athletes
first hand through interactive sports activities such as basketball,
table tennis, bocce and floor hockey.

&lt;p&gt;VISANOW Outlines How to Build an Efficient, Dynamic Immigration System within a Comprehensive Talent Management Plan

   Immigration and talent management go hand-in-hand for successful
        recruiting and retention in today's global marketplace
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Talent management is sweeping through companies around the globe
as business leaders realize the importance of recruiting and retaining
their number one resource: human capital. With the global marketplace
making competition for bright minds a world-wide challenge, leading
immigration solutions provider VISANOW shares recommendations on how
to bring talent and immigration management together into one cohesive
plan.

   "To remain competitive, U.S. businesses must develop a strategic
immigration system in conjunction with their talent management plans
to successfully recruit abroad and retain their foreign national
employees," said VISANOW CEO Bob Meltzer. "With the knowledge that the
growth and success of their companies are powered by the strength of
their employees, business leaders are developing strategic talent
management plans to track and manage employee talent and skill. With
competition for the best and brightest spanning the globe, talent is
pulled from an international pool. Recruitment and retention must
include easy ways for foreign nationals to work and live in the U.S."

   Talent management spans all aspects of cultivating staff members -
from recruiting and onboarding to retaining and developing. According
to VISANOW, immigration management is an integral part of strategic
talent management.

   An efficient, dynamic immigration system is a staple in a
comprehensive talent management plan. Outlined below are tools to
build this system:

   --  Streamlined, more efficient HR programs: The integration of
        immigration and talent management crosses several key concepts
        including attracting and recruiting qualified candidates,
        training and development opportunities, retention programs,
        and promotion and transitioning. Technology is available to
        streamline the immigration process and help HR departments
        become more efficient in all of these areas.

   --  Immigration processes aligned with talent management
        initiatives: Immigration management technology helps companies
        acquire the top global talent in their industries. Technology
        also helps HR departments align their immigration processes
        with other talent management initiatives, such as finding the
        talent needed to break into new markets or developing skills
        required to support a new service or product.

   --  Higher satisfaction and approval ratings, faster onboarding:
        With a tech-based immigration management system, employers can
        provide an empowering solution to improve employee
        satisfaction levels and ensure higher visa approval ratings.
        This technology facilitates faster onboarding and allows the
        employee and company representative to monitor and manage the
        process easily from anywhere in the world at anytime.

   --  More efficient, productive immigration and talent management:
        Ultimately, a technology based solution makes immigration
        management a far more strategic entity within an organization,
        helping everyone involved - HR representatives, recruiters,
        hiring managers and new employees. A technology-based system
        creates a more efficient and productive model that is aligned
        with talent management goals.

   "The talent shortage is a familiar problem. The Bureau of Labor
and Statistics projected that more than 300,000 of the new 1.3 million
new IT jobs that were created between 1996 and 2006 went unfilled,"
said Meltzer. "Talent management alone only addresses part of the
problem. HR departments need to take initiative to create a
streamlined immigration process to partner with their comprehensive
talent management strategy."

   About VISANOW

   VISANOW has redefined the way immigration services are delivered
with a process that consistently provides faster responses, allows
greater access to information and saves time. Since 1998, VISANOW has

&lt;p&gt;Citrix and Microsoft Unveil New Branch Office Application Delivery Solution at Citrix Synergy 2008

   New Citrix Branch Repeater Combines Innovative Staging Technology
   with Windows Services to Enhance Application Delivery for Branch
                           Office Employees
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Today at Citrix Synergy(TM), the event where virtualization,
networking and application delivery meet, Citrix Systems, Inc.
(NASDAQ: CTXS) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced the
immediate availability of Citrix Branch Repeater(TM), an innovative
new line of branch office appliances developed and marketed as part of
a strategic alliance between the two companies. By staging the
delivery of applications and Windows services closer to branch office
users, Citrix Branch Repeater helps make branch office computing
faster and more cost-effective for companies of all sizes.

   Citrix Branch Repeater will be sold as part of the Citrix Delivery
Center(TM) product family, an end-to-end infrastructure designed to
help customers transform static datacenters into dynamic delivery
centers. Just as digital television repeaters amplify and retransmit
media signals to homes in a given neighborhood, Citrix Branch Repeater
sits between corporate datacenters and branch offices, amplifying and
retransmitting applications to branch office users. Based on Windows
Server and available with Microsoft Internet Security and Acceleration
(ISA) Server software, the Citrix Branch Repeater provides an ideal
complement to application virtualization solutions, enhancing
application delivery and performance while simultaneously delivering
critical Windows Server infrastructure services in the branch.

   "This type of alliance will give companies more flexibility for
managing their branches, and it will address never-ending bandwidth
demands from branch workers," said Robin Gareiss, executive vice
president and senior founding partner, Nemertes Research. "The
adoption of managed services at the branch is increasing. Today, 63
percent of companies use some form of managed services at the branch,
compared to 46 percent in 2007(1)."

   Citrix Branch Repeater optimizes the branch through:

   --  Staging Streamed Applications Closer to Branch Office Users:
        Windows applications streamed to branch employees by Citrix
        XenApp(TM) (previously known as Citrix Presentation
        Server(TM)) can now be staged at the front door of the branch
        by Citrix Branch Repeater. Once an application has been
        received at the branch, it can be delivered rapidly to branch
        employees directly from the Branch Repeater, eliminating
        unnecessary traversal back to the datacenter across expensive
        and often slow WAN links. As new or updated applications are
        staged in the datacenter by XenApp administrators, they can be
        easily delivered to each Branch Repeater for fast, efficient
        and secure "rebroadcast" to each branch employee's desktop as
        needed.

   --  Consolidating Windows Branch Services: Citrix Branch Repeater
        is built on Windows Server, enabling the consolidation and
        delivery of native Windows services such as file, print,
        Active Directory, domain name system (DNS), and dynamic host
        configuration protocol (DHCP) plus ISA Server 2006 Web caching
        in a single, easy-to-manage appliance. IT staff also can use
        native Windows management tools to remotely manage Citrix
        Branch Repeater, helping minimize support costs in remote
        offices(2).

   --  Accelerating All Applications Delivered over the Wide Area
        Network: Citrix Branch Repeater accelerates the delivery of
        application traffic to and from the branch using advanced wide
        area network (WAN) optimization technology from Citrix. In
        addition to improving application performance for branch
        office users, this optimization can reduce bandwidth
        consumption by up to 75 percent(3).

   "We have been customers of both Citrix and Microsoft for many
years, and their respective technologies have continuously benefitted
our growing company," said Tom Allen, director of IT, Ozinga Brothers,
Inc., a leading materials supply company with branch offices
throughout the US Midwest. "Citrix Branch Repeater will allow us to
further enhance our use of Citrix XenApp and Windows Server to deliver
applications to our branches without increasing our IT overhead while
keeping our branch users satisfied."

   "Branch office employees should have the same productive computing
experience as employees at headquarters," said Bala Kasiviswanathan,
director of branch and storage solutions, Windows Server division at
Microsoft. "Windows Server-based branch office solutions help
customers deliver core infrastructure services that are required to
keep branch office applications and operations running efficiently.
The Citrix Branch Repeater streamlines and consolidates the
application delivery infrastructure while delivering on the
performance and availability expectations of the most demanding branch
office environments."

   "Citrix Branch Repeater is an impactful addition to the toolkit of
enterprise IT departments, because its easy integration with the
application delivery infrastructure helps solve the key challenges
facing IT administrators," said Troy Trenchard, vice president and
general manager, Access and Acceleration Group at Citrix. "The
seamless environment allows customers to place the technology where it
makes the most sense for the business."

   Pricing and Availability

   Citrix Branch Repeater is available today in three easy-to-deploy
appliances designed for small, medium and large sized branch offices
with list pricing starting at $5,500. Microsoft ISA Server 2006 and a
Fail-to-Wire Ethernet interface options are also available starting at
$1,000. Citrix Branch Repeater is available through Citrix-authorized
resellers.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced new enhancements to its Telelogic portfolio of
software and systems development tools.  IBM acquired Telelogic on April 3,
2008 to accelerate the innovation of products that rely on software.

    The new features, planned prior to acquisition as part of Telelogic's
comprehensive
set of offerings, will help organizations better manage their application
development environments amidst rapidly changing market dynamics to deliver
better products and systems to market faster.  The new enhancements allow
developers to work across global teams, cutting development time and cost.

    "Today's announcement signals continued progress in the existing Telelogic
portfolio and IBM's commitment to the current product set even after
acquisition," said Dr. Daniel Sabbah, general manager, IBM Rational software.

    Software development is experiencing its own version of Moore's Law, with
customers reporting that the sheer volume of software in products and systems
can double every 18 months. At the same time, software development has become
increasingly de-centralized, with partners, subcontractors, offshore teams and
outsourcing organizations all trying to work together more effectively. The
enhancements to the Telelogic offerings help organizations meet the challenges
associated with these trends and improve performance within their de-centralized
IT and engineering environments.

    "Customers need to respond proactively to the changing dynamics of their
markets faster than their competitors," said Ingemar Ljungdahl, Acting President
and CEO, Telelogic, An IBM Company. "With these new enhancements from Telelogic,
IBM
is helping organizations turn change into a competitive advantage by adapting
their
systems and software development at the speed of global business, while
ensuring control over the process and outcome."

    New software enhancements to Telelogic's portfolio include:

    Telelogic Change 5.0 allows global development teams to adopt consistent,
proven
processes as best practices as they move from project to project. Organizations
can unite development teams around a single change management product, even if
they
use diverse configuration management solutions and are based around the
world. This allows management to enforce common processes and collect consistent
metrics, without the potential risk and burden associated with SCM tool
migration. With Telelogic Change 5.0, organizations can manage and assess the
impact of change to business processes, business strategy, and variation across
product portfolios, enabling them to build better systems and software and bring
them
to market quickly.

    Telelogic DOORS sets a new standard for managing requirements for complex
systems
and software projects. With DOORS, systems development teams can define,
review, analyze and change requirements, trace progress toward goals,
collaborate and validate results. New capabilities include a Rich Internet
Application that promotes the review and discussion of requirements from
anywhere in the world by providing Web access to the DOORS database, as well
as new visual methods for managing complexity in requirements and their
relationships. Through collaborative participation among business and
development
stakeholders, Telelogic DOORS helps ensure that complex systems and products
meet the needs of customers, conform to requirements, and comply with
regulations.

    Telelogic System Architect/Change Integration plus Enhanced SOA Workflow
represents a significant milestone in governance and change management for
enterprise architecture and business process analysis projects. The
integration between Telelogic System Architect and Telelogic Change offers an
important layer of granularity for change management as well as a formal
approach to governance for projects and related initiatives, including
service-oriented architecture (SOA) and business process analysis.

    In addition, through its enhanced integration between System Architect and
Telelogic Tau(R), Telelogic is taking the next steps to provide a
model-driven workflow that helps customers implement an enterprise-wide
approach to service oriented architecture (SOA).

    Extended Defense Industry Support through new capabilities for defense
agencies,
contractors and system integrators. The new capabilities include an interface
between Telelogic System Architect and Telelogic Rhapsody(R), along with
Rhapsody
support for net-centric operations and the Ministry of Defence Architecture
Framework (MODAF). Through these capabilities, Telelogic offers a seamless
transition
from 'system of systems' enterprise architecture through systems engineering and
software development for both information systems, and real-time and embedded
applications.

    Telelogic Dashboard 3.5 improves decision-making by providing managers the
project status and trend information they need to measure progress so that
application development projects meet their goals. The new features available in
Dashboard 3.5 help managers to easily work together on vital information across
multiple projects.

    Telelogic Rhapsody Updates, announced in April, will provide a new Telelogic
Rhapsody-Eclipse Plug-in, due later this summer, to integrate Rhapsody into the
Eclipse open-source development environment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS), Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and UBS
(NYSE:UBS) today announced a series of bi-lateral agreements that will
allow each firm to offer their respective clients access to each
other's pool of non-displayed liquidity. These arrangements allow
algorithmic trading orders of each firm to interact with the U.S.
equity liquidity found in three of the largest broker-dealer operated
"dark" liquidity pools in the U.S. - Goldman Sachs' SIGMA X, Morgan
Stanley's MS POOL and UBS' PIN ATS.

   Through this initiative, the firms seek to address the growing
complexity of market fragmentation across various non-displayed

additional liquidity with no information leakage in the handling of
their orders," said Andrew Silverman, Managing Director, Morgan
Stanley Electronic Trading. "These arrangements will enable us to work
with trusted industry participants to deliver the same level of
confidentiality our clients have come to expect from us."

   Will Sterling, Managing Director, UBS Electronic Trading, said:
"Our clients are looking for incremental liquidity without having to
split each order across many different algorithms. These agreements
should offer clients access to additional high quality liquidity
without making their trading process more complex."

 Auditorium

WHO/WHEN
Days 1 and 2: May 20 (8:30 am to 5 pm ET) and May 21 (8:30 am to 12:30
 pm ET)

Day 1: TUESDAY, MAY 20
8:30-8:45      Opening Remarks: Nancy Kramer--CEO and Founder,
                Resource Interactive


8:45-9:15      iTalk: Kelly Mooney--President and CXO, Resource
                Interactive, co-author of The Open Brand

            Topic: The Open Imperative
            What began as a digital movement championing the values of
             participation, collaboration, transparency and
             authenticity has emerged as a macrotrend. Widening our
             view of openness to spheres ranging from politics to
             environmentalism will prepare us for the next phase of
             the web--the open web, with its interoperable ecosystem
             and new consumer experiences.

9:15-10:15     Keynote: Joseph Jaffe--Author, Join the Conversation

            Topic: Are You Still Just Communicating?
            All movements have a guru and Jaffe is leading the charge
             of conversational marketing by urging marketers to cease
             the monologue and join the dialogue. Case studies,
             cautionary tales and a thorough how-to approach help
             marketers make the most of the social web.

10:45-11:45    Panel: And Community Makes Three

            Moderator: Susan Ashley--Executive Director, Client
             Services, Resource Interactive
            Adam Brown--Director, Digital Communications, The Coca-
             Cola Company
            Jan Valentic--SVP of Marketing, The Scotts Miracle-Gro
             Company
            Stan Joosten--Innovation Manager, Holistic Consumer
             Communication, Procter &amp; Gamble
            Megabrands like The Coca-Cola Company, P and Scotts have
             been talking with individual consumers for ages, but with
             the power of consumer communities, even the seasoned pros
             have to reinvent everything from organizational
             structures to entirely new consumer-facing roles.

12:00 -1:30    Lunch Speaker: Marsha Collier--Author, over 15 books on
                eBay

            Topic: My Life as an iCitizen
            One of the world's most recognized eBay authorities shares
             her success story--how she used the tools of the social
             web to redefine her career and how eBay embraced her
             efforts.

1:30-2:30      Keynote: Duncan Watts--Principal Research Scientist,
                Yahoo! Research

            Topic: Influential or Insignificant?
            Duncan rivets us with his empirical approach and
             application of network theory to sociology. So when he
             encourages brands to extend the conversation beyond the
             elite few and interact with networks on a vaster,
             exponential level, we can't help but listen.

2:30-3:00      iTalk: Steve Knox--CEO, Tremor

            Topic: Lynchpins of Communication
            Steve and the crack team at Tremor believe in the power of
             the influential and have built brands connecting with
             these elusive individuals using the tools of the social
             web. Just how much influence do they really offer anyway?

3:30-4:30      Panel: What Consumers Can Do

            Moderator: Molly Metzger - Innovation Consultant, Resource
             Interactive
            Sam Decker--CMO, Bazaarvoice
            Tim Smith--Chief Strategy Officer, Lemonade, Inc.
            Manish Chandra--CEO, Kaboodle
            Adam Weinroth--Director of Product Marketing, Pluck

            Even card-carrying believers of the value creation of
             online consumer advocates need to learn more about how to
             better support their efforts. The companies on this panel
             will share their unique approaches to word-of-mouth
             advocacy by tapping the consumer's motivation to create,
             share and influence.

4:30-5:00      iTalk: Tom Venable--EVP, InnoCentive

            Topic: The Allure of Open Innovation
            Through an open call, progressive organizations can fast-
             track R and traditional product development by reaching
             out to some of the world's most creative thinkers--
             icitizens who thrive on solving tough challenges and
             accelerating change.

Day 2: WEDNESDAY, MAY 21
8:30-9:30      Keynote: Doc Searls--Harvard Fellow at the Berkman
                Center, Co-author, The Cluetrain Manifesto

            Topic: Next on the Open Horizon
            Web visionary Searls isn't much interested in making the
             current ad-centric "attention economy" more engaging. He
             wants to replace it altogether with an "intention
             economy" that matches consumers' intent to purchase a
             specific product with any and all relevant brands. Is
             this nirvana for marketers or does this economy render
             them obsolete? And will Searls's Vendor Relationship
             Management get us there?

9:30-10:15     Panel: Personal &amp; Portable

            Moderator: Doc Searls--Harvard Fellow at the Berkman
             Center
            Rooley Eliezerov--President and Co-founder, Gigya
            Bill Washburn--Executive Director, Open ID
            Kelly O'Neill--Commerce Product Marketing Director, ATG

            Customer identity and content management helps merchants
             create the utmost in personalized shopping experiences at
             key online touchpoints, from e-commerce site to call
             center to email. What happens when personal identity data
             traverses the web freely, untethered to any single
             merchant's web site or campaigns? When it takes on the
             dimensions of a real human, with personal photos,
             shopping preferences, favorite web links and that
             individual's social graph? RSS and widgets have made
             portable data a reality, presaging a web that is fluid
             and interconnected. But the real value of data
             portability for brands and consumers can't be realized
             without widespread adoption of a shared system or
             language. Doc Searls leads this panel of insiders in a
             discussion of what's at stake and who stands to gain the
             most.

10:30-11:15    Panel: Have Phone, Will Travel (the Web)

            Moderator: Troy Gibson--Director, Technology, Resource
             Interactive
            John Harrobin--SVP of Marketing and Digital Media, Verizon
            Will Hodgman--CEO, M:Metrics
            Riccardo Spina--Formerly Senior Director of Digital Media,
             Integrated Marketing, Wal-Mart

            We're near the watershed moment for mobile in the US, as
             data services finally catch hold. So what applications
             will your consumers want most? How should you use text,
             advertising and search for more consumer value? What kind
             of content is right for the small screen? Hear the
             experts discuss ways to integrate mobile into your
             consumer's brand experience and what technologies you'll
             need to support it.

11:15-11:45    iTalk: Avinash Kaushik--Analytics Evangelist, Google

            Topic: A Battle Cry for Qualitative Metrics
            Author, blogger and analytics evangelist Avinash shares
             his unique insider's perspective on metrics that matter
             and metrics that are missing, or rather, what management
             misses when they train their gaze exclusively on a web
             site's macroconversions. "Microconversions" measure all
             the other valuable on-site behavior unrelated to
             purchase, and Avinash thinks it's time we got on with the
             revolution in qualitative metrics and analytics, if we're
             to do justice to consumer engagement.

11:45-12:30    Panel: Who Keeps Moving the Goalpost?

            Moderator: Laura Evans--Executive Director, Retail
             Practice, Resource Interactive
            Dr. Robert Leone--Professor, Texas Christian University
            Pete Blackshaw--CMO, Nielsen Online
            Steve Kahn--VP of Internet Marketing, DSW
            Paul Horstmeier--VP of HP.com, Hewlett-Packard

            While some marketers focus on engagement, others have
             singled out consumer advocacy as the online behavior most
             worth measuring. Still others care only about
             straightforward satisfaction scores and conversion rates.
             It's clear that choosing the appropriate framework takes
             work, and this panel's experts represent the full range
             of approaches, from customer referral value to buzz
             monitoring to click-through rates, email and e-commerce
             conversion rates, and the latest advertising metric: Pay-
             for-Performance.

&lt;p&gt;HERZLIYA, Israel (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is not looking to bid to buy all of Yahoo Inc but is in talks about other types of deals with the U.S. No. 2 search engine, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are not bidding to buy Yahoo," Ballmer said at the launch of Microsoft's new research and development centre in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yet, we are trying to have discussions about deals with Yahoo that might create value, but not a whole acquisition of the company," he said without elaborating further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Microsoft walked away from a proposal to acquire Yahoo for $47.5 billion, or $33 per share, after Yahoo rebuffed the offer, saying it would only settle for $37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has now made an alternative offer, proposing to buy Yahoo's search business and take a minority stake in the Web firm, a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should a deal be completed, it would forge an alliance between the two companies that would represent an alternative means of competing with rival Google Inc, which has turned into an online advertising powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Yahoo has said it was considering a "number of value maximizing strategic alternatives" and would evaluate any proposal made by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo on Sunday confirmed with Microsoft that it was not interested in pursuing an acquisition of all of the company but it remained open to pursuing any deal in the best interest of stockholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor Carl Icahn last week launched a proxy battle in order to pressure Yahoo to agree to be sold to Microsoft. A number of other large Yahoo shareholders have since said they would back Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also believed to be interested in buying social network site Facebook as a means of expanding its Internet business. Microsoft already has a small stake in Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's nothing particularly new on that front," Ballmer said. "We have a great relationship with Facebook and we look to continue to invest in that partnership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Steven Scheer, editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Washington (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp said on Wednesday it launched a new "cashback" search service that pays users a rebate for buying products they found through the company's Windows Live search engine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Live Search cashback is the latest attempt by the world's largest software maker to draw users to its online search engine, which is a distant third behind market leader Google Inc and Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is giving you a reason why you should use a particular search engine," Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates said at the company's Advance 08 advertising conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sees online search as a critical component to establishing an online advertising powerhouse. By placing text-based ads next to results from its ubiquitous search engine, Google has become the leader in Web advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A product search on Windows Live will call up links to online retailers offering that item. The user who buys that item from the retailer's site will get 2 percent to 30 percent of the purchase price back as a rebate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers would have to sign up for a free Windows Live cashback account to participate in the program. Rebates would be issued after a 60-day waiting period to make sure there are no returned products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Gates said it will partner with more than 700 retailers including eBay Inc, Barnes  Noble, Sears and Home Depot Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft will offer advertisers a cost-per-acquisition model of payment, meaning that they only pay for ads that lead to purchases. The current cost-per-click model charges advertisers for every click on a sponsored link associated with certain keywords.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you knew the user and watched their behavior you could do a lot better for them in terms of taking them directly to the information or presentation they want. Search can be dramatically better," said Gates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think we're entering a period where there'll be quite a bit of change (in search)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's effort to gain more market share in Web search led to its unsolicited offer to buy Yahoo Inc earlier this year. It withdrew a sweetened $47.5 billion offer a few weeks ago, but said on Sunday it had re-approached Yahoo with an alternative deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the talks said Microsoft had offered to buy Yahoo's search business and take a minority stake in the rest of the company after selling off its Asian assets. Microsoft executives did not address the Yahoo issue directly at the conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also launched Live Search Farecast, based on the airfare-predicting technology that the company bought in April through its acquisition of travel site Farecast. Microsoft also said it will consider cash rebates for flights booked through the search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell 51 cents, or 1.77 percent, to $28.25 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bruce Rutledge, writing by Daisuke Wakabayashi in Los Angeles, editing by Maureen Bavdek, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) bid for Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) indicates an acquisition hunger that could prompt it to gobble up a chain of smaller companies, venture capitalists said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VCs participating in the Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit see new deals for the next 12 to 18 months fueled by the few sectors that appear resilient to valuation concerns, such as alternative energy and social networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Microsoft, the aim to compete for the Internet advertising behind Google Inc's (GOOG.O) growth may take it beyond its pursuit of Yahoo. Microsoft pulled a $47.5 billion offer to buy Yahoo earlier this month and has been discussing alternative deals with the Web company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If they can't buy Yahoo, they're going to do whatever it takes to dominate that space," David Chao, co-founder of DCM, said in a panel discussion between New York, San Francisco and Boston. "There's a whole value chain of companies in between that eventually they're probably going to buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Navin Chaddha, managing director of Mayfield Fund, said the hype over social networks may not be overstated. Advertising in the sector is expected to grow to $2 billion this year from $1.2 billion in 2007, he noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's going to be mainstream, it's going to be ubiquitous, it's where people are going to hang out," he said. "There's going to be scarcity value. The next Yahoo, the next Google ... are going to be created. If you have this kind of scale, you are bigger than any TV network."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FACEBOOK: RIDING OR BREAKING THE WAVE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chaddha still advises start-ups and their investors to take a wider margin of error when it comes to the amount of time it will take to cash in on the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this environment it is extremely prudent ... to fully finance companies that have cash on their balance sheet, to be conservative, I would say for the next 2 to 2-1/2 years because we don't know where they're going to head in the next 12 to 18 months," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Facebook, one of the biggest social networks, it could be a tough choice between a deep-pocketed acquirer or going it alone to an initial public offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say to the extent they see continued growth, and really only Facebook knows that, they're in a position to continue on as is," said Bob Davis, general partner at Highland Capital Partners. "It is not riding a crest. It is the crest in terms of what's taking place out there today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chao said he doubted Facebook could fend off potential competition in the same way as Google, which beat out about a half-dozen rivals within a few years to become the world's Web search leader by a wide margin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because (social networks) are viral, other competitors could come in a different niche, whether by language, by geography, who knows?" he said. "I don't think it will monopolize the market the way Google has."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he does believe Microsoft could pony up the billions needed to acquire both Yahoo and Facebook, in which it holds a minority stake, as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I were Microsoft, why not buy both?" he said. "They have the cash to do it ... and if they miss out on this window, they miss the entire Internet advertising space."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For more on the Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summits see ID:nL1919425&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ritsuko Ando in New York and Scott Hillis in San Francisco; editing by Phil Berlowitz, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details from report)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 21 (Reuters) - Shareholder advisory service
Proxy Governance recommended on Wednesday that Bear Stearns Cos
Inc BSC.N shareholders back the storied U.S. investment
bank's fire sale to JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As the proposed transaction salvages meaningful value for
shareholders and enables participation in the future success of
a stronger surviving entity with significant potential, we
recommend shareholders vote to approve the transaction," the
firm wrote in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shareholder vote is scheduled for May 29. The
transaction was pushed through by the U.S. Federal Reserve on
March 17 to head off a Bear bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the terms of the agreement, Bear Stearns shareholders
will receive 0.21753 shares of JPMorgan common stock per share
of Bear common stock held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Proxy Governance said the approval of the deal was
virtually guaranteed as JPMorgan directly controls about 49.4
percent of the voting power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it said Bear shareholders should not be deterred by
that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This vote will be shareholders' final but definitive
opportunity to voice a judgment on the performance of their
board and executive management team, and the role of
regulators, in the destruction of 86 percent of market value
over two weeks," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said shareholders were hurt by "poor oversight of
inherent business risks which left the company with few
alternatives as the liquidity crisis escalated."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Proxy Governance also blamed "a seat-of-the-pants Fed
intervention which ultimately extended rather than quelled the
liquidity crisis, causing substantial and unnecessary damage to
shareholders in the process."

&lt;p&gt; (Adds further analyst comment, details from study)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Susan Heavey&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON May 21 (Reuters) - Hundreds of patients taking
Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) anti-smoking drug Chantix have reported
serious accidents, vision problems and heart trouble,
researchers said on Wednesday, sending shares of the world's
largest drugmaker to their lowest level since 1997.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. aviation regulators responded quickly to the research,
saying they would prohibit use of Chantix by private and
commercial pilots, while consumer advocates called for stronger
warnings on the drug's label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chantix, also known as varenicline, has already been linked
to depression and suicide, among other problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers at the nonprofit Institute for Safe Medication
Practices, and Wake Forest University, said they found hundreds
of reported problems since the drug's 2006 approval that
included blurred vision, dizziness, confusion and loss of
consciousness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These data provide a strong signal that the risks of
varenicline treatment have been underestimated and show that a
wide spectrum of serious injuries are being reported in large
numbers," the researchers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The data does not definitively prove that Chantix is at
fault but does show a strong signal, the researchers cautioned,
adding that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Pfizer
should take further steps, including conducting more studies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer officials defended Chantix, one of the struggling
drugmaker's newest medicines, saying the side effects are
already mentioned on the drug's label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you've got the nicotine withdrawal along with
Chantix, it's just very difficult to tell what is causing it,"
said Gretchen Dieck, Pfizer's senior vice president for safety
and risk management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chantix works by targeting brain receptors affected by
nicotine, tobacco's addictive ingredient. The drug blocks some
of the effects of nicotine while also providing a nicotine-like
buzz to help curb withdrawal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the drugmaker fell 1.2 percent to $19.76 in
after-hours trading Wednesday following release of the study,
having closed on the New York Stock Exchange down 4 cents at
$20.01.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SALES HURT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has touted Chantix as one of its biggest hopes for
future earnings growth, but its sales have been hurt in recent
months by safety concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, the FDA warned about the risk of mood and
behavior changes with Chantix and called for new warnings on
the drug's label. It also said the drug could impair patients'
ability to drive or use heavy equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug brought in $277 million in U.S. sales during the
first quarter of 2008, but has since seen its prescriptions
fall 5 percent, according to Bear Stearns analyst John Boris.
On Monday he revised his estimate for 2008 sales to $640
million, down from $915 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said the new data
was not surprising, given that many smokers have multiple
health problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conover said many smokers might accept the risks for a
better chance to quit smoking, which can cause lung cancer and
other health problems. He said Chantix should still bring in
global sales this year of $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FDA spokeswoman Susan Cruzan said the FDA was still
investigating the drug's psychiatric effects. Wider reviews of
new drugs like Chantix were desirable but "FDA currently does
not have adequate staffing to conduct such reviews."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRAIN RECEPTORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The same brain receptors targeted by Chantix also control
muscle movement, according to the researchers, who combed FDA
data on reported side effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They found 173 reports of accidents and injuries in people
taking Chantix. They also found 397 cases of psychotic behavior
and another 227 involving suicidal behavior.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hundreds of cases of severe skin swelling, heart problems
and diabetes were also reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Federal Aviation Administration said 150 pilots and 30
air traffic controllers used Chantix, but it was unclear how
many of the pilots worked for airlines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the FAA was not aware if any accidents linked to use
of the drug, "it's prudent to deem the drug no longer
acceptable for use," agency spokesman Les Dorr said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new study prompted the Health Research Group of
consumer advocacy group Public Citizen to call for stronger
"black box" warnings on the drug's packaging.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has taken rating actions on the
mezzanine/subordinate bonds of the following three GSAA Home Equity
Trust transactions:

   --GSAA Home Equity Trust 2005-5;

   --GSAA Home Equity Trust 2007-9;

   --GSAA Home Equity Trust 2007-10.

   A spreadsheet detailing Fitch's rating actions on the transactions
in question is available on the Fitch Ratings web site at
www.fitchratings.com under the following headers:

   Structured Finance then RMBS then Research Highlights

   The rating actions taken today reflect Fitch's analysis of
expected default and loss from delinquent loans, in addition to
projected losses from the currently performing pool. Fitch generates
its expectations using its ResiLogic default and loss model. These
expectations are adjusted based on actual performance to-date versus
model projected performance. The model incorporates the impact of
historical home price movements on mortgage performance, in addition
to projecting further stress for many regions of the U.S. The model
also reflects the demonstrated high default rates for loans that
exhibit risk-layering.

   The details of the application of ResiLogic to seasoned mortgage
pools, and the specific assumptions used for the Alt-A review, will be
described in research to be released shortly.

   Fitch is completing its review of the 2005-2007 Alt-A transactions
in two separate phases. The first phase will be a review of all
mezzanine and subordinated bonds, which are more immediately exposed
to delinquency losses. This phase is currently nearing completion. The
second phase, which will begin shortly, will be a review of all the
senior bonds that, in many instances, require additional cash flow
analysis to evaluate the risk of the various individual classes within
the senior tranche. Most notably, the use of super-senior structures
will be considered in evaluating senior bonds.

&lt;p&gt;ST GALLEN, Switzerland (Reuters) - Microsoft said on Wednesday that starting some time next year it will make it easier for users of an open-source rival to work with Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without adding any special software to Office, users will be able to open documents sent to them in the open source Open Document Format (ODF), the company said. As well, users will be able to edit and save documents in that format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is going to be providing support for three new file formats directly in the Office product," said Erich Anderson, vice president and general counsel for Europe, in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to ODF, Microsoft will also support Adobe's popular PDF fixed format and Microsoft's competitor to PDF, known as XPS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft offers support for ODF in its current version of Office but only if additional software is downloaded separately and installed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not address concerns expressed earlier this month by a British government agency, BECTA, that Microsoft's existing ODF software does not work very well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BECTA has complained to competition authorities in London and Brussels that the ODF "translator software" has limited functionality and is poorly integrated, compared with Microsoft's own products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission responded cautiously to Microsoft's statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission would welcome any step that Microsoft took towards genuine interoperability, more consumer choice and less vendor lock-in," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission added that it will look into whether Microsoft's announcement "leads to better interoperability and allows consumers to process and exchange their documents with the software product of their choice."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission has fined Microsoft 1.68 billion euros since 2004, in large part for the company's failure to provide proper interoperability between its dominant Windows operating system and other software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has appealed against part of that, an 899 million euro fine imposed in February for its failure to co-operate. The company has said it will now cooperate with the Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will add support for ODF version 1.1 when it updates its Office 2007 product some time next year with "service pack 2."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said it would also join a technical committee that is discussing a newer version of ODF. It did not say how long it would support ODF or whether it would support successive versions of ODF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomas Vinje in Brussels, a lawyer who has represented clients opposed to Microsoft, said the announcement was meaningless unless Microsoft made ODF the default standard when people opened office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If ODF is not the standard its presence "won't matter because the vast majority will not use it. That was the experience in the U.S. case," he said, referring to a case which found Microsoft in violation of the Sherman antitrust act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlo Piana, a lawyer in Milan who represents clients who make open source software, called Microsoft's approach "too little, too late."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that Microsoft should meld its own standards with ODF. Microsoft's own standards were recently adopted by the International Standards Organisation (ISO) as an alternative to ODF. The Microsoft standard is called OOXML.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Lawsky, editing by Gerald E. McCormick, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  GUADALAJARA, MEXICO, May 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 As part of IBM's New Enterprise Data Center strategy to help customers gain
greater efficiency from their IT resources, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced
it has opened the world's first center specifically designed to help clients
across the globe develop and implement long-term plans to manage and archive
massive amounts of business information.  The announcement will be made at
the center's grand opening in front of more than 200 clients, business partners
and local dignitaries in Guadalajara, Mexico.

    The archiving and retention of information -- including documents, email,
video,
audio, medical files, etc. -- is one of the highest storage growth segments
today according to the Enterprise Strategy Group. Worldwide digital archive
capacity is expected to increase at a nearly 60 percent compound annual growth
rate by 2012 which is an 800 percent total increase in archive capacity over a
five year period of time (1). To address this demand, IBM opened its Global
Archive Solutions Center in Mexico's "Silicon Valley." Under one roof, IBM's
team
of archive subject matter consultants can simulate real-world customer
environments
and present solutions in real time using IBM software and storage technologies.

    Today, organizations are facing a sharp increase in the amount of digital
content
that must be managed with new compliance and discovery requirements. Worldwide
file, database and email archive capacity will each skyrocket at an a compound
annual growth rate of up to 73 percent -- altogether totaling nearly two
trillion full filing cabinets of information (2).

    Organizations are looking to keep this data secure, control costs when
seeking
information and manage risks. Failure to comply with government regulations can
cost
millions of dollars in fines. As a result, effective management strategies are
critical to retain the most important corporate data and identify the most
essential technology available in records management, image, email archiving and
e-discovery.

    With rising energy prices, data centers are also running out of power and
space and IBM's archive solutions are helping clients move to a New
Enterprise Data Center model by focusing on best practices for
virtualization, energy efficiency, service management, security and cloud
computing. With IBM, clients can benefit from blended archive solutions that
bring
together disk and tape that help enable the rapid deployment of new IT
services to support future business growth.

    "Incredible data growth is driving the need for data backup, archiving and
replication as businesses must protect, recover, and retrieve information. By
establishing the first world-class briefing center solely focused on
archiving, we are helping organizations manage their information infrastructure
in a
complete way," said Andy Monshaw, General Manager, IBM System Storage.  "IBM
is the only company in the world that has the thought leadership, broad base of
skills, proven capabilities and technology to deliver a dedicated archive
solutions center to our clients that will help them plan, integrate and access
their information infrastructure."

    Innovations from IBM Research help bring together the industry's most
complete
storage solutions today. As unstructured and replicated data continue to
double year after year, IBM's Research Centers around the world are working to
build systems that manage data for cost, security and compliance through
policies controlled by the customer (3). IBM's Haifa Research Lab is leading in
emerging archive technologies such as long term digital preservation.

    International Center, International Investment

    The new multi-million dollar Global Archive Solutions Center leverages IBM
Guadalajara's experienced community of technologists and management team. IBM
plans to invest more than $10 million US dollars over the next several years in
training and infrastructure costs to continue to expand the center.

    Guadalajara also known as Mexico's "Silicon Valley" provides a scenic yet
historic backdrop to host international clients. IBM was the first major
ITcorporation to establish a core presence in the region in 1927.  Today,
Guadalajara remains a fast growing IT region as a top exporter for
electronics and is the manufacturing base for many IBM System Storage products. 
Following its global workforce strategy, IBM has continued to invest in the
region adjusting to the worldwide demands of IT business and continuously
building its highly skilled workforce.   In 2007, the IT opportunity in
Mexico ranked 20th worldwide and second in Latin America, just behind Brazil
(4). 
IBM is the leading storage vendor in Latin America and remains the external disk
leader in Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Peru and Chile (5).

    Diverse &amp; Targeted Solutions to Meet Demand

    IBM's systems, software and services featured at the center are enabling
SMBs to
Enterprise clients achieve their archiving goals.

    Absa in South Africa currently utilizes IBM Enterprise Content Management,
Tivoli and
IBM Optim software as well as IBM hardware to run its vast information
infrastructure. Now, the financial institution is working with IBM Global
Technology Services to define its total archiving strategy for compliance,
business value, and long term digital preservation.

    As an independent software vendor, Global Data Vaulting of Canada powers its
secure managed archive solution with Tivoli Storage Manager enabling them to
provide archiving and data protection services via a software-as-a-service
model to small and medium sized businesses.

    Through a combination of software, hardware and services, the center will
also
specialize in delivering health industry storage solutions such as the IBM
Grid Medical Archive Solution (GMAS). Iowa Health System and Spectrum Health
have
implemented IBM System Storage products and software for delivering medical
images, patient records and other critical healthcare reference information on
demand.

    The center aims to become a key resource for IBM Business Partners such as
becom Informationssysteme GmbH of Germany which specializes in the IBM System
Storage DR550, IBM's award winning archive and data retention solution. 
Mainline
Information Systems implements a variety of storage archive solutions for its
vast client base including Security Service Federal Credit Union which runs its
business on the DR550 as well as Tivoli Storage Manager and IBM Content Manager
to dramatically boost data storage performance.

    IBM Global Services enabled Hansgrohe AG, a global plumbing fixture
manufacturer
to support compliance with IBM enterprise content management software and IBM
storage hardware. The company is now storing and managing its 40,000 daily email
volume for up to 10 years in a searchable format.

    By establishing the Global Archive Solutions Center, IBM looks to continue
its
leadership and momentum in the IT industry by offering complete solution
packages,
investing in channels, driving demand for IBM Business Partners, researching new
innovations and developing competitive storage products for all types of
businesses. IBM is the number one storage hardware vendor in the world today
based on recent market data and with its storage services leadership, IBM
continues to outpace overall storage software growth at an 11 percent
year-over-year growth with leadership in archive, data protection and
recovery, replication, storage management and infrastructure software
solutions (6).

&lt;p&gt;HERZLIYA, Israel (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is not looking to bid to buy all of Yahoo Inc but is in talks about other types of deals with the U.S. No. 2 search engine, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We are not bidding to buy Yahoo," Ballmer said at the launch of Microsoft's new research and development centre in Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yet, we are trying to have discussions about deals with Yahoo that might create value, but not a whole acquisition of the company," he said without elaborating further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Microsoft walked away from a proposal to acquire Yahoo for $47.5 billion, or $33 per share, after Yahoo rebuffed the offer, saying it would only settle for $37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has now made an alternative offer, proposing to buy Yahoo's search business and take a minority stake in the Web firm, a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should a deal be completed, it would forge an alliance between the two companies that would represent an alternative means of competing with rival Google Inc, which has turned into an online advertising powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Yahoo has said it was considering a "number of value maximizing strategic alternatives" and would evaluate any proposal made by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo on Sunday confirmed with Microsoft that it was not interested in pursuing an acquisition of all of the company but it remained open to pursuing any deal in the best interest of stockholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor Carl Icahn last week launched a proxy battle in order to pressure Yahoo to agree to be sold to Microsoft. A number of other large Yahoo shareholders have since said they would back Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is also believed to be interested in buying social network site Facebook as a means of expanding its Internet business. Microsoft already has a small stake in Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's nothing particularly new on that front," Ballmer said. "We have a great relationship with Facebook and we look to continue to invest in that partnership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Steven Scheer, editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today released a new study which reveals 80 percent of
consumers would prefer a service provider that gave them more choice in the
applications and services available on their mobile device. The study, titled,
"Go mobile, grow" produced by IBM's Institute for Business Value points to how
consumer demand for customization and personalization will drive innovation
and open standards in the mobile marketplace.

    The mobile web provides people with access to the Internet anytime and
anywhere. The market for mobile Internet services is estimated to reach US$80
billion by 2011, with increasing usage expected to fuel growth in both the
provision of services and mobile Internet advertising.(1) At the same time,
the number of mobile Internet users worldwide is projected to approach 1
billion, a 191 percent increase from 2006 and a compound annual growth rate of
24 percent.(2) The ubiquitous availability of IP wireless broadband and more
affordable advanced smart phones will change the way companies around the
world operate and relate to their customers, employees and partners.

    IBM surveyed nearly 700 consumers around the world on their preferences
regarding the
mobile internet. 69 percent of consumers reported they want devices that are
open to personalization and configuration of applications.

    The IBM survey found the mobile web will increasingly be used for utility
and
transactional services. For example, nearly 60 percent of consumers are
interested in banking via mobile devices. Other utility services include e-mail,
instant messaging, stock trading, news and information and general browsing.
Also, entertainment applications are growing in popularity with the IBM study
finding 53 percent of consumers interested in mobile TV and 45 percent
interest in buying music via mobile devices.

    "Clearly the same market forces which empowered consumers to choose personal
computers that were open and enabled them to customize their applications are
at play in the mobile web marketplace," said Dr. Sungyoul Lee, Global Consulting
Leader, Electronics Industry, IBM.  "Our survey found 60 percent of consumers do
not have a specific brand preference when using mobile Internet services. With
consumers clamoring for choice, the marketplace will need to innovate around
open platforms and models to build loyalty."

    Markets around the world will adopt the mobile web differently. In mature
markets, IBM consultants predict the Mobile Web will extend and complement the
personal computer. While in emerging markets like India and China, consumers are
skipping their first PC purchase and going straight to high-end mobile
platforms that deliver the same service. IBM consultants also predict that in
semi-literate populations, people will use low-cost mobile phones, whose user
interface will be voice-based, which will greatly expand their connectivity to
people and data.

    Implications and Recommendations for Mobile Device Makers

    The IBM study, points to a number challenges which Mobile Device Makers
(MDMs)
will face in the "Era of the Mobile Web." In particular, competition with
established
Internet brands looking to the mobile web as a source of potential revenue
poses a huge challenge. Also, existing business relationships and channel
conflicts will be a major obstacle as MDMs could be perceived as threats to
offerings by their network partners and impact the core device business of MDMs.

    "These challenges from portal players and mobile network operators will
force
MDMs to compete where they excel most by delivering innovation that wows
consumers," said IBM's Dr. Lee. "Mobile device makers, confronted by
numerous challenges to growth and profitability, need to develop new avenues
to expand their core offerings. At the moment, the mobile internet market is
still
somewhat fragmented. But it is unlikely to stay that way for long. The time
to act is now."

    Based on the consumer survey results and further analysis by IBM industry
consultants, the IBM study identifies a number of factors which will help MDMs
secure market share in the mobile internet space.  Namely, a focus on
driving their design and business models based directly on consumer insights
will
be vital.  Also, the development of a participation in a standards-based,
open ecosystem for devices and services will be a boon for innovation.

    To take advantage of the opportunities offered by the mobile Internet, the
study says many MDMs may need to transform from device-driven to
service-driven. This may require changes in marketing and brand
perception,partnership strategies, content delivery and management, as well as
revenuemodels. This transformation in business model will also require a
scalable and
cost-efficient infrastructure that enables them to rapidly ramp up services.
This may include looking at the benefits of partnering with a third party
(e.g. outsourcing partner, system integrator, etc.) in order to bring in the
necessary expertise, while still keeping the costs low.

    Handset sales have reached saturation point in emerging markets therefore
compelling MDMs to move to higher end devices that enable more services. This
could
bring a double boost to earnings and revenue as it raises the average device
price point and provides MDMs a cross sell opportunity to high margin
services.

    As part of its ongoing consumer research efforts, IBM has the full report
"Go
mobile, grow" available at this IBM website.

    In addition to working with clients on mobile web initiatives, IBM is making
major investments in software, hardware, services and partnerships related to
the
mobile web. IBM Research has a number of projects in its labs focused on
bringing simple, easy-to-use services to the millions of people in the world
who have bypassed using the personal computer as their primary method of
accessing technology, and are instead using their mobile phone to access the
web, conduct financial transactions, entertain themselves, shop and more.
Additionally, IBM has opened several worldwide telecom solutions labs focused on
research and development in areas related to the mobile web.  For more
information, visit www.ibm.com/press/mobileweb.

    IBM Survey Methodology

    The online survey conducted by InstantSurvey was fielded among a
representative sample of 680 adults in USA, Germany, China, India and
Japanthe first quarter of 2008.  The results can be considered statistically
significant at
the 95 percent confidence level and have a margin of error of +/- 0.0138 points.

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Corporate Citizenship Report Outlines Improvements in Environmental, Economic &amp; Social Performance

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) improved its environmental,
economic and social performance while continuing to supply energy
necessary for economic growth and improved living standards, the
corporation said today in its 2007 Corporate Citizenship Report.

   The report details how ExxonMobil reduced greenhouse gas
emissions, led the industry in worker safety and oil-spill prevention,
and contributed more than eight times its earnings -- a record $336
billion -- to economies around the world through taxes and purchases
of goods and services.

   "We are proud of our financial and operating results, but we are
equally proud of our culture of integrity and commitment to act in a
safe and responsible manner towards employees, the environment and
local communities," said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief
executive officer.

   "How we achieve our results is every bit as important as the
results themselves."

   ExxonMobil is working on technologies with the potential for
near-term impact on greenhouse gas emissions, while at the same time
looking for breakthrough technologies for the future.

   Near-term initiatives include:

   --  Investing more than $100 million on improving natural gas
        treating technology, which could reduce costs for carbon
        capture and storage.

   --  Working with manufacturers of automobiles and commercial
        industrial vehicles to increase fuel economy by as much as 30
        percent.

   --  Helping to enable the next generation of lower-emission hybrid
        and electric vehicles through the development of new film
        technologies to greatly enhance the power, safety and
        reliability of lithium-ion batteries.

   --  Conducting research and development of an on-vehicle hydrogen
        production system, which has the potential to improve vehicle
        efficiency by up to 80 percent while improving safety and
        eliminating the need for a hydrogen distribution
        infrastructure.

   Longer-term initiatives include:

   --  Conducting internal research and supporting academic research
        to accelerate development of commercially viable energy
        technologies to lower emissions on a global scale -- such as
        hydrogen production, storage and use; biomass and solar
        energy; carbon dioxide capture and storage, and advanced
        transportation and coal technologies.

   --  Partnering with the European Commission to study carbon
        capture and storage in the CO2ReMoVe program, a research
        initiative to establish scientific monitoring systems and
        determine the reliability of geological carbon dioxide
        storage.

   The Corporate Citizenship Report details ExxonMobil's commitment
in five areas - environmental performance, workplace, corporate
governance, transparency and human rights and community development.
The report is available at www.exxonmobil.com.

   Other highlights include:

   --  A record low rate of lost time safety incidents for the
        company's combined employee and contractor workforce,
        continuing ExxonMobil's industry-leading safety record.

   --  Industry-leading oil spill prevention results, including no
        spills from ExxonMobil-operated marine vessels for the third
        consecutive year.

   --  Community investment spending of more than $206 million, which
        included $12.4 million in grants through ExxonMobil's Africa
        Health Initiative and more than $6 million through the
        company's Educating Women and Girls Initiative. In addition,
        ExxonMobil became a founding sponsor and committed $125
        million to the National Math and Science Initiative as part of
        the corporation's continued commitment to math and science
        education.

   The Corporate Citizenship Report was prepared in accordance with
the reporting guidelines and indicators of the International Petroleum
Industry Environmental Conservation Association and the American
Petroleum Institute Oil and Gas Industry Guidance on Sustainability
Reporting. The majority of these indicators are also consistent with
the indicators used by the Global Reporting Initiative in the G3
Sustainability Reporting Guidelines Version 3.0.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) is optimistic it can hit its 2010 profit target as the focus on emerging markets helps insulate the world's top computer services provider from the global credit crunch, its chief financial officer said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I think we are well on track," International Business Machines Corp CFO Mark Loughridge told the Reuters Global Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not going to reintroduce a forecast today, but if you look at the performance, we have had some pretty encouraging signs," he said, when asked if IBM could beat its earnings goal of $10 to $11 per share by 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares, which are trading just off six-year-high levels reached a week ago, ticked higher on the news before succumbing to downward pressure on the overall market. The stock slipped 14 cents to $125.04 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge underscored that IBM isn't counting on recovery in established G7 markets for growth this year, and is looking instead to emerging markets ranging from Poland to Argentina and Mexico to the Philippines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If I were in a business model where I needed double-digit growth out of the G7 to drive my performance, I would be in a cold sweat," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not counting on a resurgence or recovery to achieve our growth for the year," he said of the G7 nations -- the United States, Japan, Germany, Britain, Italy, France and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But we are counting on the high-growth markets to continue to grow," he said, noting that the company enjoyed more than 10 percent growth in 50 countries last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial services, IBM's biggest customer segment but also one sector hardest hit by the economic downturn, highlights how the company's move into emerging markets insulates it from the Wall Street slump.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM generates 28 percent of global revenues from financial services customers, but fully 75 percent of that business comes from outside the United States. The company is building major banking systems in China, India and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in the United States, IBM is benefiting from strong short-term contract signings in recent quarters as banks and brokers increase spending on risk analysis and compliance tools, Loughridge said. "I think there's plenty of spend in this environment," he said of U.S. financial customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The executive said IBM has gauged its investments and expectations "more conservatively in all the established G7-like markets" amid worries about slower growth and credit concerns in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge downplayed concerns that any slowdown in the developed economies could spread to emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I personally see less linkage, dependency, between the established markets and the high growth markets," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO LET-UP ON 2010 PROFIT GOAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In May 2007, IBM laid out a "2010 Earnings Per Share Roadmap," which called for 14 percent to 16 percent compound annual growth from 2006 to 2010 based on five objectives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did $6.06 in 2006, then we did $7.18 (in 2007 and) our view of the (2008) year is $8.50," Loughridge said of its EPS growth. "If you look at that ... it puts us in good position as we move forward (to 2010)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company expects to maintain modest historic rates of revenue growth but to expand profit margins and buy back substantial amounts of its shares. IBM plans to spend $12 billion on stock repurchases in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is also investing in growth in emerging markets and software acquisitions, and expects savings on pension plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loughridge said the 2010 earnings target is predicated on revenue growth of 3 percent to 4 percent. "We're not asking the investor to lean into the wind," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a wide-ranging interview at the Reuters Summit, Loughridge said rival computer maker Hewlett-Packard Co's (HPQ.N) planned acquisition of Electronic Data Systems Corp EDS.N would not lead to any changes in IBM's own merger thinking. "That acquisition of HP is going to have no effect on our acquisition strategy," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has acquired more than 60 companies in the past five years, mostly small technology-focused software deals that it tucks into broader software and services offerings that it then sells to its global pipeline of customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this year IBM completed its $5 billion acquisition of Cognos, its largest deal ever. He said attractive technology valuations in the past year, combined with IBM's healthy balance sheet, strong cash generation and independent financing ability leaves it well-positioned for further deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tiffany Wu, Peter Henderson and Ritsuko Ando, editing by Derek Caney/Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) is not counting on recovery in established G7 markets for growth this year, and is looking instead to emerging markets like India and China, Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, lawmaker comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON May 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is
currently working with Iraq's government on crafting a technical
agreement in the OPEC nation's oil sector, a company executive
told U.S. lawmakers on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're looking at a technical agreement right now," Stephen
Simon, Exxon's senior vice president, told lawmakers at a
hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even without a long-awaited oil law to set international
investment terms, Iraq is plowing ahead to set deals to
reinvigorate its dilapidated oil sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Simon said he would not agree to delay signing contracts
with Iraq's government until the oil law is finalized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm not going to make any commitment of that type," Simon
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sen. Charles Schumer, New York Democrat, said it was
"outrageous" for Exxon to forge ahead with oil deals before a
framework oil law was enacted, and said such actions could
exacerbate sectarian violence in the war-torn nation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iraq, whose primary source of revenue comes from oil, needs
huge amounts of investment to boost oil output but also to
rebuild the country after years of sanctions and war.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Delays in approving the oil law to govern the industry have
held back investment -- the current draft being negotiated, for
example, was first agreed by the Cabinet in February 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - A picture campaign highlighting the devastation caused in Colombia by the production of cocaine for markets in Europe and America came to London on Wednesday before heading across Europe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shared Responsibility, a collection of photographs with captions showing the wholesale destruction of the rainforest for plantations of coca plants, aims to raise the guilt factor among cocaine users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cocaine kills Colombians, it hurts Colombians and massively destroys the environment," Colombia's Vice President Francisco Santos said at the opening of the campaign in Trafalgar Square.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every gram of cocaine you inhale destroys four square meters of rainforest," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only are three hectares of rainforest cleared for every one hectare of coca plants, but the chemicals used in the cultivation of the plants and the production of the drug also cause major water pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The real price of cocaine is not just among communities and on the streets here, but in communities and on the streets of Colombia," said British Home Office Minister Vernon Coaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The campaign says 2.2 million hectares of forest have been cleared for cocaine production, adding that the wholesale destruction not only puts at risk the lives of thousands of ordinary Colombians but also vast quantities of wildlife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says Colombia's forests are home to 13 percent of the world's amphibians, 10 percent of sweet water fish, nine percent of mammals and six percent of reptiles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not only that but the forests is a vital lung for the world and its destruction for drugs therefore has global consequences for climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The US Department of Justice's National Drug Threat Assessment said 144,000 hectares of land was under coca cultivation in Colombia in 2005, producing 545 tonnes of pure cocaine -- 70 percent of the region's total.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eradication campaigns in Colombia, with clearance teams on the ground facing the threat of landmines, had succeeded to a certain extent but had also resulted in farmers moving to non-traditional areas that were harder to find and reach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been some successes with farmers switching to cocoa, coffee, fishing and beekeeping, but much more was needed to be done, said Coaker, praising the cooperation between Britain and Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I hope this campaign will make an impact on the way people think and behave and the individual decisions they make and they recognize the problems that can accrue to the innocent people of Colombia," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Matthew Jones)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  NICE, FRANCE, May 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) received the Best Practices Award for Supplier or System
Integrator at the TeleManagement Forum, Management World 2008 conference in
Nice, France.  IBM was recognized for its world-class leadership in eTOM
(Enhanced Telecom Operations Map(R)) customization and real world applications
and solutions for the telecommunications industry, based upon its outstanding
business process redesign work at T-Com Croatia.

    Eduardo Argueso Lopez, Telecommunications Solutions Manager,
CommunicationsSector in Europe, accepted the award on behalf of IBM.  Mr.
Argueso Lopez said,
"I am pleased to accept this distinguished award and would like to thank
T-Com Croatia for the opportunity to work with them.  Using the TMF's eTOM as a
foundation, coupled with our business process redesign expertise, we were able
to
re-engineer and improve several key business processes that enable end-to-end
DSL service rollout and delivery for T-Com Croatia's customers."

    Commenting on the award, Ivana Soljan, CEO of T-Com Croatia, said, "We are
pleased to have our project highlighted by the TM Forum. IBM gave us a
level of process insight we could not have gained elsewhere. We are very
excited to put that insight to work for the benefit of our customers and
tomake us a stronger competitor."

    The project highlighted IBM's unique ability to push beyond the boundaries
of
traditional business process transformation by extending the eTOM standard
into deeper levels of process detail, as well as into broader business
architecture areas such as organizational change and information flow. Key
business
improvements identified include: optimized network deployment, better
integration
between marketing and network planning, optimized quote-to-service activities,
strengthened supply chain reliability, higher customer satisfaction and
retention, and improved competitiveness and profitability.

    "In order to promote best practices, it is critical that service providers
request
and implement industry best practices to provide the motivation and market
for standards-based products and processes," said Martin Creaner, President and
CTO of the TM Forum. "This year we have seen some major, highly ambitious
projects and are thrilled that IBM has won this prestigious category."

    TeleManagement Forum's Management World 2008 is the global conference
attracting
more then 3,000  attendees from 74 countries, where distinguished speakers,
analysts, service providers and technologists from the world of information,
communications and entertainment services come together to identify

&lt;p&gt;Head of Development and Commercial Strategic Alliances to Address
  Convergence of Diagnostics, Devices and Pharmaceuticals in Hartford
HARTFORD, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
MEDi 2008 (www.MEDi2008.com), the leading conference and
exhibition for the growing worldwide medical device industry,
announced today that Dr. David K. Rosen, from World Wide Business
Development at Pfizer Inc will deliver its Opening Keynote address.

   Dr. Rosen will discuss "In-Licenses, Out-Licenses and Alliances in
the Healthcare Industry -- the Convergence of Diagnostics, Devices and
Pharmaceuticals" in his address at the Connecticut Convention Center
during the two-day (September 9-10) conference offering
Research/Scientific, Clinical Applications, Manufacturing and
Commercialization tracks, and an exhibit floor with pavilions
showcasing new companies and international participants.

   "Physicians, patients and payors are challenging pharmaceutical
companies to demonstrate that their medicines are both valuable and
differentiable from older medicines in the management of disease. This
has created some tremendous challenges but it has also opened the door
to many opportunities for innovation in healthcare," said Dr. Rosen.
"Today, there are new ways to predict disease risk or occurrence, the
potential to predict adverse events and the potential to predict
response to therapy . . . all of which will drive a new wave of
products and technologies in years ahead.

   "Decision makers and innovators come to MEDi 2008 to learn
first-hand which improvements in healthcare will drive this
innovation," he said. "This Keynote will discuss how new and better
diagnostics and devices will contribute to the development of
medicines, how concurrent use of diagnostics, devices and
pharmaceuticals will create value in the delivery of healthcare and,
what innovations pharma is looking to create or acquire to meet these
new healthcare demands."

   For the past five years at Pfizer, Dr. Rosen has lead a team of
business development professionals focused on the in-licensing and
acquisition of biomarkers, diagnostics and delivery systems that
enable or complement the Pfizer pharmaceutical portfolio across 11
therapeutic areas in development and commercial sales. He is currently
responsible for out-licensing and for divesture of Pfizer assets in
Nagoya, Japan.

   Dr. Rosen is a 1980 graduate of the University of Wisconsin and a
1984 graduate of Iowa State University, College of Veterinary
Medicine. After a decade in his own veterinary practice, he joined the
pharmaceutical industry, first at SmithKline Beecham and then Pfizer.
In 1996, Dr. Rosen left Pfizer to join a start-up bio-technology
company, before returning to Pharmacia and UpJohn Company in 1999.
During his career in the biotechnology and the pharmaceutical
industry, he has worked in licensing and acquisition and has directed
project teams responsible for the development of diagnostics,
pharmaceuticals and vaccines.

   Joseph Bronzino PhD, PE, president of the Biomedical Engineering
Alliance &amp; Consortium (BEACON, www.BeaconAlliance.org), the producer
of the MEDi 2008 conference and exhibition, said this event "is very
fortunate to have Dr. Rosen as a keynoter.

   "Dr. Rosen is a scientific and commercial leader and innovator
with global experience," said Dr. Bronzino. "We look forward to
hearing the fresh perspective and valuable insights he will bring to
the audience at our opening session."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Hewlett-Packard Co's (HPQ.N) pending purchase of Electronic Data Systems Corp EDS.N will not change International Business Machines Corp's (IBM.N) acquisition plans, IBM's chief financial officer said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"That acquisition of HP is going to have no effect on our acquisition strategy," CFO Mark Loughridge told the Reuters Technology, Media and Telecoms Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the company was still focused on deals for companies with intellectual property that could be used widely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology companies are looking like good buys, he added. "I do think valuations are attractive now, and I think we have advantages in this framework 'cause we have a very healthy balance sheet, strong cash generation, good cash on hand," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But I also have to say we are quite financially disciplined about our acquisitions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hewlett-Packard shook up the technology world last week after saying it would buy EDS, a pioneer in outsourcing managed computer services. The deal would vault HP to second place in the global technology services industry, behind IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think this could be a very logical acquisition for Hewlett-Packard. But it's quite different than our services business," Loughridge said. IBM has a strong consulting services business in addition to its EDS-like outsourcing group that maintains and runs networks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That application management and consulting business is tightly aligned with our software business," he said, noting that software accounted for approximately 40 percent of IBM profits. "HP really doesn't really have a very strong software business," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For summit blog: summitnotebook.reuters.com/)

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, May 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today expanded its support for growing mid-market businesses
by announcing new Tivoli software offerings designed to help customers manage
their
businesses more effectively, and a new Tivoli Deployment Accreditation
initiative that recognizes business partners who have built skills around
Tivoli's
broad suite of service management offerings to better meet the needs of these
customers.

    The new Tivoli software offerings expand upon offerings IBM announced last
October, and is part of IBM's ongoing commitment to assist growing mid-sized
businesses to choose the right solutions to better manage their network
infrastructures. In addition, IBM is delivering innovative tools to help
these customers identify issues such as systems management, asset protection or
data recovery, and find highly skilled Tivoli software resellers who can solve
them.

    Announced today are IBM Tivoli Monitoring for Microsoft Applications and IBM
Maximo Asset Management Essentials which have been customized to meet the
unique requirements of growing businesses. The latter provides all of the
core capabilities for managing critical assets in an enterprise -- including
production equipment, facilities and transportation assets -- with a simple
licensing, pricing and packaging approach.

    These solutions solve some of the most pressing issues today by reducing
operational expense and providing critical IT and business asset management.
They also enable customers to gain many of the same efficiencies that larger
businesses are achieving from IBM's green and service management offerings.

    Like large enterprises, small and medium businesses are faced with the
challenge of improving the efficiency of their IT environments,
controllingenergy consumption and reducing costs while ensuring that their IT
infrastructure is supporting the needs of the business.  With IBM's broad range
of scalable solutions that address data backup &amp; recovery, detection, asset
protection, security and systems automation, growing businesses can get
started at the level of function they need to help grow their business.

    "IBM continues its commitment to developing the right products for growing
mid-sized businesses and is now making it easier to connect with local
accredited Business Partners to help them support their business initiatives,"
said Doug Brown, vice president marketing, IBM Tivoli. IBM generally defines
the growing mid-sized businesses as those having between 1,000 and 5,000
employees.

    The thousands of solution providers -- including resellers, distributors and
independent software vendors -- that IBM partners with, have unique
relationships with small and mid-sized customers and are a key route to
market for IBM in reaching these companies. With today's announcement, IBM is
helping these partners increase their skills around selling and deploying key
products while providing the credentials to represent those skills with
customers.

    The new Tivoli Deployment Accreditation initiative offers IBM Business
Partners
the ability to achieve skills and certify in three levels of accreditation
ranging from expertise in either individual products or a combination of
products that provide an overall solution to customers. A-level Tivoli
Deployment
Accreditation offers certification to firms with one expert in an individual
product and one expert in a solution area, AA-level provides for a total of
four experts, and AAA-level a total of six experts.

    "The Tivoli Deployment Accreditation offers a clear direction for IBM
Business Partners on how to build skills in the Tivoli suite of products and
benefit from opportunities in key growth areas including green IT and service
management," said Michele Grieshaber, director of SMB and channel marketing,
Tivoli Software. "Partners who make this investment will distinguish their
offerings and skills from others in the industry."

    The certification includes a broad range of Tivoli products including
thosecovering the Netcool, Maximo, Enterprise Asset Management, Service Request
Management, Optimization, Storage and Availability portfolios. These offerings
are among the products playing a key role in helping businesses expand their
involvement in green and service management spaces. For example, Tivoli
Monitoring accesses, displays and provides energy management information and
settings that enable the optimization of IT and facility assets. Monitoring
capabilities alert data center managers to energy related situations while
reporting capabilities provides historical trending and forecasting to enable
better
precision in data center and facility planning.

    "We see significant value in the investment we are making to become an IBM
accredited Tivoli business partner," said Mike Fischer, Executive Vice
President, Enterprise Solutions Group, MSI Systems Integrators, IBM Business
Partner. "This presents us with an opportunity to differentiate ourselves in the
marketplace and broaden our exposure to both our clients and prospects, as well
as among IBM sellers and other business partners for joint partnering
opportunities."

    The goal of this initiative is to build an even stronger partner ecosystem
and
offer clients an opportunity to identify IBM business partners with specific
skills to help them choose the right solutions and implement them quickly and
efficiently. With the new Tivoli Deployment Accreditation Partner Finder tool,
customers can now find a list of accredited Business Partner with certified
Tivoli
skills in one or more solution product area in a location near them. The
partner finder tool can be viewed on the Tivoli SMB customer sitelet at
www.ibm.com/tivoli/smb.

    The Tivoli Deployment Accreditation is available to all IBM Business Partner
worldwide. More information on the program can be obtained at
www.ibm.com/tivoli/partners.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than 7,600 Bear Stearns Cos' BSC.N employees, about 55 percent of its staff, are expected to lose their jobs as the troubled investment bank is absorbed into JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While discussing the historic $1.5 billion Bear Stearns takeover during Morgan's annual shareholder meeting, Dimon said "we're retaining 45 percent of Bear Stearns staff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's remarks confirmed months of speculation that half of Bear's employees would lose their jobs as a result of the merger. JPMorgan for weeks played down the speculation as premature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But last week Dimon told a bank investor conference that about 6,000 Bear employees had received job offers, or about 40 percent of the roughly 10,000 employees whose fates have decided so far. Bear had 13,834 employees as of Feb 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Dimon's figures, a total of about 6,300 offers will be extended to Bear employees when the review and integration process is completed. They also indicate only 200 to 300 employees of those still under review will get offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan officials declined immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition, though expected to generate a $1 billion second quarter gain for JPMorgan, is a "very risky and tough proposition," Dimon said. "That's why we say 'Mission: Not accomplished.' Judge us in a year or two."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire-sale transaction, pushed through by the Federal Reserve on March 17 to head off a Bear bankruptcy, is to be completed around June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Dimon said Morgan had identified jobs for about 1,500 Bear employees at other companies through a placement network it created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt;  BUCHAREST, ROMANIA, May 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Researchers from BitDefender(R), an award-winning provider of antivirus
software and
data security solutions, have issued a signature update to protect users
from a newly discovered vulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 7.
BitDefender is the first security vendor to issue an update, protecting
users from targeted hacking attacks that exploit a vulnerability in the way
Microsoft Internet Explorer 7 or higher parses webpages in preparation for
printing. The exploit allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on a
victim's machine if the victim tries to print a specially-crafted webpage, while
including a table of links.

    "The exploitable vulnerability results from a combination of coding mistakes
and
sloppy security thinking," said BitDefender Innovations Product Manager
Alexandru
Balan. "The code has numerous bugs but it is also executed in a lower-security
context than it should be and the combination opens a way for hackers to
compromise a
system."

    BitDefender researchers warn that the exploit is well-suited for use in
targeted attacks and advise all users of Internet Explorer who do not have
BitDefender installed to refrain from printing webpages with the "Print Table of
Links" option enabled until a fix is released. BitDefender is, as of the
time of writing, the only company that has released a signature able to detect
and block malicious code based on this exploit.

    A video demonstration of the IE7 exploit can be found at:
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wf0JAJ29ZRI.

    The vulnerability was discovered by independent security researcher Aviv
Raffon, who also released the proof-of-concept code. An in-depth description can

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, May 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 Pulse 2008 -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced its latest commitment to the
Enterprise Asset Management (EAM) market with the release of the next version
of its industry-leading asset management solution, Maximo Asset Management 7.1.

    IBM Maximo Asset Management 7.1 provides support for linear assets in
addition to the improved ability to manage asset life cycle and
maintenancemanagement for a wider range of assets types including production,
facilities and
transportation assets (This combination of management activities is known as
EAM).
These improvements help customers to automate the management and control of a
greater array of critical assets from a single, Service Oriented
Architecture (SOA) platform.  Known as application consolidation, this trend
allows a
more holistic approach to managing critical assets across the enterprise and
reduces the costs associated with separate asset management systems.  The
addition of Maximo 7.1 to its existing asset and service management
capabilities improves IBM's unique ability to deliver on the vision of
application consolidation.

    Maximo Asset Management 7.1 offers linear management functionality that is
particularly relevant for industries that need to manage the unique attributes
of linear assets.  These industries include: railroads, to manage railways
and signals, municipalities and state governments to manage highways and roads,
utilities to manage power lines and public water pipelines, oil &amp; gas to manage
pipelines and telecommunications companies to manage cables and communications
infrastructure.  These industries all deal with the requirement to manage
critical assets that are part of a distributed system.

    In addition to the ability to manage linear assets, IBM Maximo 7.1 also
offers
enhanced capabilities for work management, job plans, work order tracking,
service requests and reporting.  These additions provide deeper asset management
capabilities across the enterprise and eliminate the need for smaller systems
that manage only one or two asset types.

    Maximo 7.1 also provides benefits to the IT organizations that deploy the
solution.  Because Maximo 7.1 can reduce the number of systems required to
manage enterprise assets, it can free up IT department resources for other
projects.  The improved user interface and system flexibility makes 7.1
configurable with no special training.  The efficient data migration
capabilities
mean a quicker and less costly implementation process to go from development
through test and into production.  Lastly, advancements in managing access
control provides better regulatory compliance and risk management.  These
combine to offer a lower total cost of ownership (TCO) for Maximo 7.1 compared
with separate stand-alone asset management systems.

    "IBM's Maximo 7.1 offers some new functionality that a variety of
customersshould find useful.  Users that need to manage dispersed systems will
especially appreciate Maximo 7.1's support for linear assets," said Houghton
Leroy, Research Director, ARC Advisory Group. "The new offering includes many
enhancements to Maximo's existing capabilities, including work management, job
plans, work order tracking, service requests and reporting.  As EAM solutions
expand to meet growing customer requirements, it's critical that these systems
deliver
real ROI and value to the customer."

    IBM's Maximo Asset Management portfolio includes industry solutions for
theOil &amp; Gas, Nuclear Power, Transportation, Life Sciences, Utilities, and
Government markets.  In the coming quarters, these industry-specific offerings
will be made
available on the new Maximo 7.1 platform.

    A basic version, IBM Maximo Asset Management Essentials, is available for
smaller implementations that require only a subset of the asset management
features
included in IBM Maximo Asset Management.  This version supports IBM's offerings
in
the Small and Medium Business (SMB) markets.

    "Maximo 7.1 is the latest in Maximo's long record of industry-leading
assetmanagement solutions.  The first Maximo solution was introduced more than
20
years ago, and it's been helping customers manage critical assets ever since,"
said Bill Sawyer, VP Maximo Operations, IBM Tivoli Software.   "The additional
IBM resources, in the form of developers, software engineers and industry
experts, which we were able to add to the Maximo 7.1 development effort, meant
delivering to our customers a more-comprehensive offering, sooner.  As part of
the
Tivoli family of products, Maximo is part of a larger set of solutions
including service management, green data centers and mobile solutions, which
deliver additional business improvements.  With this latest release of Maximo
7.1, IBM is building on the legacy of Maximo and it's commitment to the EAM
market."

&lt;p&gt;Citrix Application Delivery Infrastructure Provides Foundation for
  Logistics Optimization and Supports Local and International Growth
HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
Today at Citrix Synergy(TM), the event where virtualization,
networking and application delivery meet, Citrix Systems, Inc.
(NASDAQ:CTXS) announced the 2008 winner of the annual Citrix
Innovation Award: Cocamar Cooperativa Agroindustrial, a leading
agricultural cooperative in Brazil. The Citrix Innovation Award
recognizes companies that are trendsetters in their industries, using
Citrix application delivery and virtualization solutions to gain a
competitive advantage and advance their businesses. Cocamar has set
itself far apart from competing agricultural cooperatives and
positioned itself for growth and increased investment in the global
marketplace by implementing a networked Citrix application delivery
infrastructure for more efficient supply chain and centralized data
management.

   Cocamar was one of three finalists selected by a prestigious panel
of judges, which included the 2007 Innovation Award winner, an
industry analyst and several industry visionaries. The other
innovation finalists were Bechtel Corporation, a top U.S. construction
contractor that provides engineering, construction and project
management services worldwide; and Mutual of Omaha, a leading U.S.
insurance and financial services company. The final decision was made
by popular vote from thousands of IT professionals who attended Citrix
Synergy or voted online for their favorite nominee.

   Cocamar was established in 1963 by a group of Brazilian coffee
growers and has since greatly expanded its offerings beyond coffee.
Today, Cocamar's more than 6,700 agricultural associates deliver
agricultural products such as soy, corn, wheat, coffee and oranges to
the cooperative for commercialization. Before implementing Citrix,
Cocamar previously ran its business across 40 individual IT
environments with extremely limited networking capabilities, and with
no unified network to run its supply chain management software.
Recognizing the great opportunities for its producers in the global
market, Cocamar sought to gain a competitive advantage over other
agricultural cooperatives by moving from its antiquated IT
infrastructure to a modern infrastructure that would support an
end-to-end application delivery system.

   Since adopting Citrix XenApp(TM) Platinum Edition and Wyse thin
client appliances, Cocamar has been able to manage 100 percent of its
supply chain through its ERP system and now connects 40 rural sites
through MPLS. Using Citrix Access Gateway(TM) provides Cocamar
unprecedented remote application access with enhanced security for its
global distributors. Cocamar has set itself apart from the competition
in the global market by adopting a strategic application delivery
infrastructure that provides a strong foundation for future growth and
expansion. With Citrix's support to make Cocamar's operations more
dynamic and flexible, the cooperative is as a result more attractive
to its associates and well-positioned for international business
success.

   "Citrix solutions enabled us to reach a new level of productivity
and communication, providing a foundation for our business that has
made us a formidable competitor in the global agriculture landscape,"
said Alair Aparecido Zago, chief information officer, Cocamar
Cooperativa Agroindustrial. "To be recognized for our implementation
of application delivery not only by the panel of industry-expert
judges but by the many peers who voted for us is a significant
achievement. We're excited to continue to innovate with Citrix to
propel our business forward."

   About Citrix Synergy 2008

with the latest on Citrix products; an application delivery expo of
breakout tracks, products and solutions; an IT 2.0 business symposium
exclusively for C-level professionals; and Geek Speak Live, an
un-conference where tech geeks, analysts and bloggers pick the topics
and facilitate the sessions. Citrix Synergy will be at the George R.
Brown Convention Center in Houston, from May 20 to May 23, 2008. More

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CRUZ, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Software developers ranked IBM's Rational Application Developer
higher than Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) offered by
Microsoft, Oracle, Adobe, and four others in the 2008 Evans Data Corp.
IDE Users' Choice survey announced today and conducted in April of
this year.

   In the worldwide survey of over 1200 developers, only users of
each IDE rated the corresponding product on fifteen different
attributes including ease of use, compiler performance, performance of
resulting apps, quality of tech support, documentation, debugger,
editor, and application modeling tools. In addition, the developers
rated the importance of each attribute to provide relative weighting.
Rational Application Developer took top scores in multiple categories
as well as in combined overall score.

   "IBM has created a true development powerhouse in Rational
Application Developer," said John Andrews, president and CEO of Evans
Data Corp, "RAD's robust development environment and the rich
assortment of tools that are provided sets a standard of excellence in
development tools as evidenced by its users overall satisfaction."

&lt;p&gt;Chevron Should Stop Hiding Behind Bogus PR Campaigns &amp; Use Record Profits to Clean Up Its Toxic Wastes, Says Attorney for Plaintiffs in Lawsuit Against Chevron

QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Chevron should stop hiding behind its bogus public relations
campaign about protecting the environment and start putting its record
profits to work by cleaning up the billions of gallons of toxic waste
it deliberately dumped into Ecuador's rainforest, causing hundreds of
deaths to indigenous peoples, said environmental activist and lawyer
Pablo Fajardo in Quito, in response to Chevron's testimony today about
soaring oil prices before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee in
Washington, DC.

   "Chevron talks a good game about the environment and how it's
plowing back profits into cleaner ways to provide energy, but in
reality Chevron executives have turned their backs on the environment
as well as hundreds of Ecuadorians who are sick or have died from the
toxins left behind in open oil pits scaring our rainforest and
polluting our water," said Fajardo, who is representing 30,000
Ecuadorians who have filed a lawsuit, Aguinda vs Chevron, in Ecuador
against Chevron to force the oil company to pay for an extensive
clean-up of over 900 open oil pits covering an area the size of Rhode
Island in northern Ecuador.

   Fajardo has been named a CNN "Hero" and received the prestigious
Goldman Environmental Prize (considered the Nobel of the environmental
movement) for his work to hold Chevron accountable for creating what
experts believe is the worst oil-related contamination on the planet.

   Purchased by Chevron in 2001, Texaco had admitted that it dumped
over 18.5 billion gallons of toxic waste into the rainforest near the
small town of Lago Agrio from 1964 to 1992 - about 4 million gallons
daily, or 30 times more pure crude than in the Exxon Valdez disaster.
By refusing to utilize clean-up practices required in the US at the
time - such as lining pits and re-injecting toxic water deeply into
the ground - Texaco saved an estimated $4.5 billion during the 26
years (1964 to 1990) that it was the exclusive operator of the large
oil field.

   Scattered through the jungle today are open pits filled with
petroleum and deadly water that continues to seep into the drinking
water. One indigenous tribe in the area (the Tetete) has disappeared,
while three other indigenous groups have seen rapid population
declines as a result of the contamination.

   "Texaco took the oil, took the profits, and walked away from the
one of the worst environmental contaminations in the history of the
world. Chevron should fulfill its corporate governance
responsibilities and clean up the mess it has caused on the land of
other people, just like it would do in the United States," said
Fajardo.

   Fajardo said Chevron's relatively new "Will You Join Us" campaign
to encourage people to discuss new, cleaner ways to produce energy is
a worthy effort, but it should first take care of its own legacy of
environmental problems.

   The trial is being conducted in Lago Agrio and is in its final
stages. The plaintiffs expect a decision this year. A recent
court-ordered report, written by an independent expert, has proposed
that Chevron pay a minimum of $7 billion and up to $16 billion to
compensate for environmental contamination. If the assessment is
accepted, the subsequent judgment likely would be the largest civil
damages awards in an environmental case.

   The higher $16 billion figure could result if the court accepts an
"unjust enrichment" penalty tied to Chevron's actual cost savings over
several decades for failing to use appropriate operational practices.
The lower figure represents actual costs to remediate soils around all
378 of Chevron's former Ecuador production facilities, plus
compensation for health care costs, a water system, loss of indigenous
land, ecosystem impacts, infrastructure improvements, and other
categories of damages.

   Chevron recently told the United States Trade Representative that
it expects an "enormous" adverse judgment in Ecuador, and as a result
it has started to lay the groundwork for an eventual appeal by
criticizing the fairness of the court system. Yet it was Chevron that
sought the trial in Ecuador as a maneuver to remove the case from U.S.
federal court, said Fajardo.

   At the time, Chevron submitted ten expert affidavits to a U.S.
federal court praising the fairness of the Ecuadorian justice system.

   "Chevron has tried for 15 years to evade legal accountability for
its irresponsible drilling practices," said Fajardo. "Only when the
evidence at the trial showed high levels of life-threatening toxins at
Chevron's production sites did Chevron's lawyers suddenly begin to
dislike the Ecuadorian courts they had praised for so many years.

   "We believe that Chevron is a company that for decades has
operated outside the law in Ecuador, and now is trying to cover up
that fact from its shareholders and the U.S. Congress," said Fajardo.

Chevron lawsuit, is part of a regional, national and global struggle

&lt;p&gt;Towers Perrin and Microsoft Unveil High-Performance Computing Solution for Financial Modeling

  MoSes(TM) HPC Integration Supports Windows Computer Cluster Server
                 for Improved Scalability and Run-Time
STAMFORD, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
Towers Perrin, a global professional services firm, is making
available a new software product for insurers, MoSes(TM) HPC
Integration. The software enables MoSes version 6.2 financial modeling
software to work with the Microsoft(R) Windows Computer Cluster Server
(WCCS) 2003 high-performance computing (HPC) system.

   This combination will make possible the rapid completion of MoSes
financial projections, thus giving decision makers analytical results
faster for better decision making. The software also supports 64-bit
processing, providing increased memory capacity, allowing financial
projections to be run with much larger volumes of data and many more
scenarios.

   "Market forces are pressuring insurers to perform more
sophisticated financial analysis in less time," says Mike Oxley,
managing director of software solutions for Towers Perrin. "This
high-performance computing solution will help our customers gain
increased value from their existing MoSes applications and Microsoft
Windows software administration skills while introducing robust
technology to support mission-critical applications well into the
future."

   "We are pleased to work with Towers Perrin to provide Microsoft
high-performance computing solutions to MoSes customers," says Gordon
Ejsmond-Frey, director of Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA)
insurance for Microsoft. "In today's challenging economic climate,
there will be an increased use of analytics among insurers as the
market hardens. HPC-enabled financial modeling solutions such as MoSes
can help companies perform the computations necessary to make
well-informed business decisions and keep abreast of change."

   The Microsoft WCCS is designed to be easy to deploy and operate.
By splitting large computing jobs into several smaller jobs - and
running them in parallel over a networked cluster of computers - these
tasks can be finished in less time. WCCS automatically handles failed
jobs without user intervention. By leveraging Windows software
administration skills, it is as easy, secure and stable as a single
system.

   MoSes provides comprehensive actuarial analysis and reporting for
typical life insurance and annuity products marketed around the world.
The application can be used for a variety of tasks, including product
development, pricing, valuation, cash flow testing, liability and
asset/liability modeling. MoSes applications are fully transparent,
allowing insurers to see the actual code used to make the calculations
and, in turn, to trace the calculations and ease auditability.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comments, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ari Rabinovitch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HERZLIYA, Israel May 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
is not looking to bid to buy all of Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) but is in
talks about other types of deals with the U.S. No. 2 search
engine, Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are not bidding to buy Yahoo," Ballmer said at the
launch of Microsoft's new research and development centre in
Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yet, we are trying to have discussions about deals with
Yahoo that might create value, but not a whole acquisition of
the company," he said without elaborating further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Microsoft walked away from a proposal to
acquire Yahoo for $47.5 billion, or $33 per share, after Yahoo
rebuffed the offer, saying it would only settle for $37 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has now made an alternative offer, proposing to
buy Yahoo's search business and take a minority stake in the Web
firm, a person familiar with the discussions told Reuters this
week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Should a deal be completed, it would forge an alliance
between the two companies that would represent an alternative
means of competing with rival Google Inc (GOOG.O), which has
turned into an online advertising powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its part, Yahoo has said it was considering a "number of
value maximising strategic alternatives" and would evaluate any
proposal made by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo on Sunday confirmed with Microsoft that it was not
interested in pursuing an acquisition of all of the company but
it remained open to pursuing any deal in the best interest of
stockholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investor Carl Icahn last week launched a proxy battle in
order to pressure Yahoo to agree to be sold to Microsoft. A
number of other large Yahoo shareholders have since said they
would back Icahn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft is also believed to be interested in buying social
network site Facebook as a means of expanding its Internet
business. Microsoft already has a small stake in Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's nothing particularly new on that front," Ballmer
said. "We have a great relationship with Facebook and we look to
continue to invest in that partnership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Writing by Steven Scheer, editing by Elizabeth Fullerton)

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) lost a lawsuit that had accused Alcatel-Lucent (ALUA.PA) of violating patents used in business telephone networks, the U.S. International Trade Commission said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had accused Alcatel-Lucent of infringing four patents for software in a system that integrates telephones with computers for calls, messages and videoconferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The commission has determined that there is no violation of section 337," the ITC said in its ruling. Section 337 refers to infringing intellectual property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The administrative law judge hearing the case, Paul Luckern, had initially ruled that Alcatel-Lucent infringed one of the four patents in the initial suit. The full commission said on Tuesday that Alcatel-Lucent did not infringe on the fourth patent either, both companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased with the ITC's decision and had always believed that we had a strong case," said Alcatel-Lucent spokeswoman Mary Ward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft spokesman David Bowermaster said the software giant was disappointed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are disappointed that the International Trade Commission reversed Judge Luckern's ruling that Alcatel-Lucent infringed Microsoft's '439 patent. We look forward to receiving the detailed ruling so we can understand the Commission's reasoning," Bowermaster said in an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Christian Wiessner)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska May 22 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) and its partners will have one more chance to convince
Alaska Natural Resources Commissioner Tom Irwin to allow them
to keep their leases at the long-languishing Point Thomson oil
and gas field on the eastern North Slope, officials said
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Irwin granted the partners' request for a reconsideration
of his decision a month ago to reject the 23rd development plan
for Point Thomson, a plan that the commissioner deemed to be an
empty promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The reconsideration was announced by Marty Rutherford,
deputy natural resources commissioner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a letter going out today to the lessees of point
Thomson that their request for reconsideration will be
accepted, will be considered," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No determination as to what will be done with that yet.
We're just willing to take another look at some of the
materials that they're providing," Rutherford said at a news
conference held by Gov. Sarah Palin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's partners are BP (BP.L), Chevron and ConocoPhillips
(COP.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Point Thomson unit, with leases that date back to as
early as the 1960s, has been a point of contention between the
state and the oil companies. The field holds an estimated 8
trillion to 9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and hundreds
of millions of barrels of gas condensates and oil, but no well
has been drilled there since 1982.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state accuses Exxon, the unit's operator, and Exxon's
partners of warehousing the resources there and violating lease
terms that mandate development or relinquishment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state in 2005 declared the companies to be in default
of lease terms, and since then has been moving to dissolve the
unit and revoke the leases so that they can be sold to other
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2005, Exxon and its partners argued in their 22nd
development plan that Point Thomson could not be developed
until a huge natural gas pipeline is constructed to carry
product from the North Slope to Lower 48 markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon and its partners have also argued that the extremely
high-pressure conditions of Point Thomson's reservoir has made
it too difficult to develop to date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies' 23rd plan -- recently rejected by Irwin --
offered to spend $1.3 billion to drill a series of wells and
start production by 2014 of 10,000 barrels a day of liquids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Point Thomson's vast natural gas reserves are considered
critical to any potential North Slope gas pipeline project, an
ambition of Alaska officials since the early 1970s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the state maintains that Point Thomson's liquids should
be produced before any production of natural gas starts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The truth is that it's too bad for the state of Alaska
that the oils and the condensates haven't been produced over
the past years," Rutherford said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "geologic realities" are that the liquids would most
likely have to be produced first, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's a good chance that liquids would have to be
produced, both because it's the right thing to do in the
formation, in the reservoir to protect the gas and the oil, but
because it's the right thing to do for the state revenue stream
and TAPS (the Trans-Alaska Pipeline system)," she said.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with suit, background details throughout, unable to

&lt;p&gt; By Emily Chasan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 22 (Reuters) - A company saying it owns the
land on which Bear Stearns  Co Inc's BSC.N New York City
headquarters stands sued the bank and JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) on Thursday, accusing them of not upholding its right
to make the first offer to buy the property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the lawsuit, filed in New York state court, 383 Madison
LLC claimed that under a ground lease Bear used for the
property, 383 Madison was supposed to be given an opportunity
to buy the building if Bear ever considered selling it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, when JPMorgan offered to buy Bear Stearns, it was
given an option to purchase the Bear Stearns building for $1.1
billion, even if the deal were to fall apart. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is currently planning to move its investment bank
into the Bear Stearns headquarters after the deal closes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the lawsuit, 383 Madison claimed Bear committed itself
to scenarios under which it would sell the building to JPMorgan
without even attempting to give the land owner notice of the
agreement or engage in negotiations with it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also claimed JPMorgan ignored the company's rights under
the ground lease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan wrongfully and intentionally induced Bear Stearns
to breach the Ground Lease and the Right of first offer for its
own personal gain," the suit claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The land owner is seeking the right to acquire Bear
Stearns' interest in the building or because it believes the
building is worth more than $1.1 billion it is asking for the
fair market value of the building above that price, according
to the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Representatives from Bear Stearn and JPMorgan did not
immediately return calls seeking comment.

&lt;p&gt; (For more on analysts' outlook for U.S. financial institutions, double-click
on [ID:nBNG327142])
 (Adds share prices)

 By Tenzin Pema

 BANGALORE, May 22 (Reuters) - Veteran bank analyst Richard Bove told
clients to sell shares of Goldman Sachs (GS.N), Lehman Brothers LEH.N and
Merrill Lynch MER.N, warning that big investment banks would be slammed by an
economy slowed by rising energy prices and rising rates.

 The analyst, who made news in late March when he declared that the U.S.
financial crisis was over, on Thursday cut his 2008 outlook for these three
investment banks as well as Morgan Stanley (MS.N), but maintained a "neutral"
rating for Morgan.

 Brokers have been helped in recent weeks by signs that the credit crunch
was bottoming out. But Bove, now an analyst with Ladenburg, Thalmann  Co,
predicted in a research note that investment bank stocks would decline this
summer on weak earnings, a cloudy outlook and seasonal weakness.

 At the same time, crude oil soaring north of $130 per barrel will put more
stress on U.S. consumers and could fuel inflation.

 "While I remain convinced that the stress on the financial sector has been
alleviated, I am just as convinced that the pressure on the economy has not
eased," Bove wrote.

 Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc shares were down 2.9 percent, Merrill Lynch 
Co Inc was down 1.7 percent and Goldman Sachs Group Inc shares were 1.5 percent
lower in afternoon trading. Morgan Stanley shares were off 0.2 percent.

 Nearly a year ago, Bove was one of the first banking analysts to recommend
selling financial stocks as credit market problems began. Last July, he
correctly predicted the booming growth of the financial system could not be
sustained by economic growth.

 In more recent months, pressures on the brokerage industry have risen
because of the economy, slowing investment banking activity and, perhaps most
importantly, more evidence of faulty risk management.

 "In the current quarter, it appears that the brokers have not judged risk
appropriately once again," Bove said, adding that brokers have been shorting
popular financial indexes against real world cash holdings. "The hedge is not
working," he said.

 Brokers for several years had benefited from growth of hedge funds as well
as the expansion of the mortgage markets, trends no longer fueling Wall Street
earnings.

 "None of these factors are present at the moment and none of them will be
robust for the next few years," Bove said.

 He expects that the mortgage markets may take five to six years to recover,
and said that hedge funds do not want to borrow aggressively in down markets
when most lenders are tightening their purse strings.

 LOSSES FROM HEDGING

 Bove is the latest in a string of Wall Street analysts to forecast
investment bank losses from ineffective hedging. The cash-market values of many
financial instruments have diverged from indexes meant to mirror cash.

 Also on Thursday, Fox-Pitt Kelton analyst David Trone forecast a
second-quarter loss of 34 cents a share for Lehman Brothers, down from his
previous estimate of a $1.48 profit.

 "For the first time since the credit bust began, Lehman may post a loss in
the second quarter, as it gives back a bit of its huge hedging gains from the
last few quarters, as certain key indices rallied," Trone said.

 Trone rates Lehman shares "outperform" and sees them trading at $62 within
the next year.

 The Amex Securities Broker-Dealer Index .XBD, which was trading just
barely lower on Thursday afternoon, has fallen 20.7 percent this year as the
effects of the subprime mortgage crisis, credit crunch and housing slump
reverberate.

 The following are Bove's ratings, price targets and estimate changes for
the Wall Street investment banks:
COMPANY           RATING         PRICE TARGET   2008 SHR VIEW 2009 SHR VIEW

BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Production is underway for Walt Disney Pictures' "Hannah Montana:
The Movie," starring actress-singer Miley Cyrus in her first
full-length feature film. Filming in and around Nashville, Tenn., and
Los Angeles, "Hannah Montana: The Movie" is slated for a Spring 2009
release.

   Director Peter Chelsom ("Serendipity," "Shall We Dance?") helms
this music-filled comedy adventure based on Disney Channel's
blockbuster television series, "Hannah Montana," in which Cyrus stars
as a teenage girl who lives a secret life as a pop star. The film also
features "Hannah Montana" series regulars Emily Osment ("Spy Kids2:
Island of Lost Dreams"), Jason Earles ("National Treasure"), Mitchel
Musso ("Secondhand Lions") and Moises Arias ("Nacho Libre") and Billy
Ray Cyrus ("Doc").

Bostwick ("Spin City"), Peter Gunn ("Ever After") and Lucas Till
("Walk the Line") and Vanessa Williams ("Ugly Betty").

   Written by Dan Berendsen ("Twitches," "The Initiation of Sarah"),
the film follows Miley Stewart as Hannah Montana's soaring popularity
threatens to take over her life. With a little urging from her father,
the teenager travels back to her hometown of Crowley Corners, Tenn.,
to rediscover what's really important.

   Producers Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, whose film screenwriting
credits include the upcoming "The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,"
"Spider-Man 2" and "Shanghai Noon," are producing the film, marking
the duo's first feature under their Walt Disney-based production
company, Millar/Gough Ink. The duo also created and served as
executive producers of the critically acclaimed action-adventure
series, "Smallville," which is now in its eighth season.

   The film is executive produced by David Blocker ("Don King: Only
In America," "Into the Wild"), Michael Poryes and Steve Peterman.
Director of photography is David Hennings ("Blue Crush") and the
production designer is Caroline Hanania ("Serendipity," "Shall We
Dance?"). The costume designer is Christopher Lawrence ("Cellular"),
the editor is Virginia Katz ("Dreamgirls"), and the choreographer is
Jamal Sims ("Hairspray," "Step Up," "Step Up 2: The Streets"). The
composer is Grammy-winner Alan Silvestri ("Cast Away," "Forrest
Gump").

   The hit Disney Channel series, "Hannah Montana," reaches more than
164 million unique total viewers worldwide and has ranked for two
consecutive years as the #1 series among children 6-14 on U.S. cable
television. Cyrus' #1 ranking "Hannah Montana" and Miley Cyrus debut
soundtracks have combined sales of more than eight million CDs to
date. The sold-out 70-date concert tour, "Hannah Montana &amp; Miley
Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds" was among the top-grossing tours of 2007.
Walt Disney Pictures' 3-D release "Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best
of Both Worlds Concert" was the highest-grossing Super Bowl weekend
release ever, grossing more than $30 million in its opening bow. Cyrus
recently completed her forthcoming solo album, which is scheduled for
release in July on Hollywood Records. She also lends her voice to Walt
Disney Pictures' upcoming animated feature "Bolt."

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON May 22 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) is
still pursuing arbitration with Venezuela over the OPEC
nation's 2007 nationalization of the Cerro Negro heavy oil
project, a company executive told U.S. lawmakers on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We're currently in arbitration regarding the value of
those assets," Stephen Simon, Exxon's senior vice president,
told lawmakers at a hearing in the House Judiciary Committee.
"We are hoping for an amicable solution to that and a
constructive discussion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has filed two arbitration claims against Venezuela
demanding at least $5 billion for the 2007 nationalization of
the Cerro Negro heavy oil project, though Venezuela says Exxon
is due less than $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA has already halted
commercial ties with the Texas company, while Exxon has started
rejecting Venezuelan oil cargoes that supply the Chalmette
refinery in Louisiana, a 50-50 joint venture between the two.

develop midtown Manhattan's Hudson Yards by the site-owning
state agency that stands to reap $1 billion from the deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Metropolitan Transportation Authority's board agreed to

until the 26-acre west midtown tract was fully rezoned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, the agency said the new accord with investment
bank Goldman Sachs and developer Related Companies, which built
Manhattan's Time Warner Center at Columbus Circle, would mirror
its previous pact with Tishman Speyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg says the Hudson Yards is
the city's most important development, and he created an agency
to sell $2 billion of bonds for a new subway connection.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts; adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 22 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Akamai
Technologies (AKAM.O) to "sell" from "neutral" and added the
company's shares to its Americas Sell List on concerns that
increasing competition could hurt the provider of Web
acceleration services, sending the shares down 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Akamai, which helps companies such as Apple Inc (AAPL.O)
deliver online music and video by navigating less-congested
routes over the Web, faces intensifying competition as private
entrants proliferate and selected large network operators begin
to eye the space, the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said there are currently close to 40 content
delivery network (CDN) service providers, many of whom have
started services in the past year. Almost $300 million in
venture capital was raised in the last 18 months, the brokerage
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The sheer volume of new competitors emerging in such a
short period of time draws into question how high barriers to
entry are in the space," analyst Derek Bingham said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bingham said Korea-based CDNetworks Co 073710.KQ, an
established global player, is now making a push into the U.S.
market and adding to the intensity of competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other new entrants include some major network providers,
such as Level 3 Communications Inc LVLT.O and ATT Inc (T.N),
with vast captive customer bases, for whom CDN services should
be of relatively little marginal cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While portions of Akamai's customer base are likely
relatively immune from competitive pressures, we believe that
the majority of Akamai's 2,700 customers will be able to put
increasing pressure on the company as contracts come up for
renewal this year," Bingham added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bingham said the company's shares were expensive and cut
his price target to $33 from $35.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Akamai fell to a low of $35.89, before recovering
some losses to trade down $3.14 at $36.13 Thursday morning on
Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;ST GALLEN, Switzerland (Reuters) - The judge who signed a landmark European antitrust ruling against Microsoft (MSFT.O) said on Thursday he was surprised by the large size of a record 899 million euro ($1.42 billion) fine imposed by the EU executive against the software company after he had retired.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I was surprised at the size of the fine," said the former president of the Court of First Instance (CFI), Bo Vesterdorf. He stressed he had "no concrete knowledge" about the penalty imposed in February, five months after he left the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission imposed the fine for Microsoft's failure to carry out penalties imposed in a 2004 antitrust decision against the firm by the EU's executive arm. Microsoft has appealed against the fine to the Luxembourg-based CFI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vesterdorf was speaking on the sidelines of the St. Gallen International Competition Law Forum, sponsored by the University of St. Gallen, in Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier, he told the conference that although he signed the Microsoft judgment in September and was bound by secrecy, he understood "some of the worries" critics have expressed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vesterdorf said "one should be careful" not to encroach too much on patent rights "by a too-zealous enforcement of competition law".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It may give rise to frivolous private litigation, create legal uncertainty for holders of IP (intellectual property) rights, thereby perhaps diminishing the incentives to sometimes desirable but very expensive research and development," Vesterdorf said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vesterdorf's remarks amplified views he expressed in March during a speech in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 13-judge Grand Chamber of the European Union's second-highest court handed down a sweeping ruling in September, upholding the European Commission's tough 2004 decision saying Microsoft abused its dominance of PC operating systems to crush rivals. It also endorsed a 497 million euro fine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vesterdorf's long-planned retirement took effect later the same day, hours after the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft later announced it would not appeal against the ruling to the European Court of Justice (ECJ), the European Union's highest court, and Vesterdorf said on Thursday that was unfortunate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do quite personally regret that the CFI judgment was not brought before the ECJ on appeal to have its final say on these important issues," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts have said Microsoft's chances on appeal would have been slim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vesterdorf suggested the court would revisit the issue, calling the Microsoft case "unusual".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such cases unfortunately often make for not necessarily bad case law but at least case law that may not necessarily be the lasting or the last word."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dale Hudson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the Carbon Tradeoff Modeler, a first-of-a-kind
tool that enables organizations to analyze and manage the climate impact of
their supply chains.  The tool allows organizations to understand the outcome
of critical tradeoffs to make smarter energy choices and better economic
decisions by optimizing on service levels, quality, cost, and carbon dioxide
emissions.

    Developed by IBM Research and IBM Global Business Services, the Carbon
Tradeoff
Modeler models the complex interaction of factors driving supply chain carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions from both a manufacturing and distribution
perspective. It can also quantify the tradeoffs between CO2 emissions
reductions and other supply chain metrics such as inventory levels, and on-time
delivery. IBM's Carbon Management Analysis Tool also identifies areas where
carbon dioxide emissions and costs can be reduced simultaneously.

    According to the 2008 IBM Global CEO Study and a separate IBM study,
corporate
social responsibility (CSR) is at the top of the agenda for chief executives,
and is fast becoming a revenue growth platform for businesses, as customers
increasingly demand transparency and accountability from organizations they
conduct business with.  With the automated Carbon Tradeoff Modeler,
organizations can incorporate carbon reduction into their overall CSR strategy,
to reduce their carbon emissions and potentially strengthen their brand to gain
a
competitive advantage.  This is an example of IBM's focus on higher value
services and innovative solutions to address client needs.

    "To achieve a carbon efficient supply chain, companies need to assess the
CO2
emissions impact of their end-to-end operations,"  said Sanjeev Nagrath, Global
Leader, Supply Chain Management, IBM Global Business Services. "By incorporating
Research-based tools to model the cost and carbon impact of key steps in the
supply chain, organizations now can take action to reduce CO2 emissions and
influence suppliers' behavior toward reducing their own greenhouse gas
emissions."

    IBM's carbon management analysis tool models the cost and carbon impact of
several key levers and provides insights for balancing cost and carbon
management objectives. Key factors the tool captures include: packaging options,
alternative operational processes, alternative transportation modes and energy
sources,
inventory policies, and sourcing policies.  The Carbon Management Analysis
Tool can identify and recommend the most desirable actions to take among the
many that can be used to achieve carbon dioxide emissions reduction.

    For example, shipment and package consolidation is one of the major
opportunities to reduce CO2 emissions. Quantifying the impact of shipment
frequency on cost and emissions can help establish a more energy efficient
inventory replenishment policy. Some levers such as better routing can create
a win-win case for reducing both CO2 emissions and cost in the supply chain.

    Some of the issues that the tool addresses include:


--  The impact on cost and carbon dioxide emissions when changing package
    sizes and/or packaging materials
--  The impact of lot sizes on transportation requirements, cost and
    carbon dioxide emissions
--  The impact of consolidating orders to reduce the carbon dioxide
    emissions in transportation as well as on-time delivery performance
--  How inventory replenishment policies can influence carbon dioxide
    emissions.
--  How to evaluate alternative supply policies in terms of cost and
    climate impact in the supply chain
    

    
In addition, IBM released today further analysis from the Institute
forBusiness Value, entitled "Mastering Carbon Management." The paper emphasizes
how carbon management, energy consumption and other environmental issues should
be analysed and approached in an integrated manner -- evaluating overall
performance
goals (cost, service, quality and carbon dioxide emissions) in terms of their
relationship to one another.  A trade-off model looks at these areas and
considers relevant factors such as design, packaging and processes. These
options represent the "levers" available to influence cost, quality and service,
as well as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

    There are specific steps companies can take to limit GHG emissions -- from
easy-to-implement local improvements to complex optimizations that involve an
extended supply chain. The further these activities extend and integrate across
the
supply chain, the greater leverage and control they will have over carbon
dioxide emissions. IBM therefore recommends a step-wise
approach:


1. Strategy: Diagnose, assess, plan and operationalize
2. Carbon asset (facility) management:  Implement asset management
   and realize point solutions
3. Functional Optimization:  Address emissions in supply chain functions
4. Internal Horizontal Integration: Find the optimum solution for
   integrating across functions
5. Collaborative, end-to-end Optimization: Collaborate with supply chain
   partners to realize overall potential

&lt;p&gt;Devon IT, CentriServ, and IBM Launch Server and Desktop Enterprise Consolidation Assessment (eCon) Program

   Company experts to assess server and desktop infrastructures of
large enterprises, provide potential ROI, TCO, and green benefits
available through server and client consolidation and virtualization
KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Devon IT, Inc., a leader in alternative desktop computing, and its
integration arm, CentriServ, today announced the launch of their
Enterprise Consolidation Assessment (eCon) program, in conjunction
with IBM. eCon is designed specifically for large enterprises
interested in the ROI and TCO benefits of server consolidation via
blades servers, virtualization technologies, and client consolidation.
The companies are discussing the program at the Citrix Synergy show in
Houston, Texas.

   During initial pilot engagements, Devon IT and CentriServ have
found that, amongst potential and current customers, most enterprises
are unknowingly using only about seven percent of their server
processing capacity and four percent of their desktop power. Companies
with as few as 12 servers and 50 end users have found that performance
and utilization can suffer if hardware and software aren't optimally
allocated.

   "Virtualization allows enterprises to utilize their servers and
desktops much more efficiently," notes Anthony Falsone, president of
CentriServ. "eCon helps companies understand how blade servers,
virtualization, thin clients, and other components of alternative
desktop computing can benefit their IT environments from a number of
angles. Our experts present a detailed analysis of a company's
infrastructure, using proven methodologies from IBM, Citrix, and
VMware, while leveraging experience in deploying virtual servers and
Devon IT thin client terminals."

   How eCon Works

   1. Experts from Devon IT, CentriServ, and IBM perform a high-level
server and desktop "discovery" via proprietary IBM Consulting
Software, noting primary function and location of each device.

   2. Validate any assumptions made to date.

   3. Analyze information on current performance, utilization, and
configurations provided by the enterprise, and compare data to
industry standards.

   4. Recommend the appropriate solution for customer based on:
Application servers, heterogeneous servers, email servers, high-end
workstations, database servers, graphic and Web design workstations,
and desktop and notebook PC sprawl.

   "This initiative is extremely beneficial for enterprises and
businesses because they can see in real-time exactly how
virtualization, servers, and thin desktops can benefit their
environments - and bottom lines," says Joe Makoid, President, Devon
IT. "Cost and centralized management are among the leading benefits,
as well as increased productivity, security, and business flexibility.
We look forward to continuing our strong relationship with IBM with
the eCon program."

   Green Benefits

   eCon also has green implications, as companies choosing to
virtualize their IT infrastructures conserve tremendous amounts of
energy and save money on associated electricity costs.

   "With virtualization, companies can save up to 7,000 kilowatt
hours for every software application put into a virtual machine," says
Falsone. "Each server removed through virtualization saves 12.5 tons
of carbon dioxide emissions, which is equivalent to taking 1.5 cars
off the road."

&lt;p&gt;Barrier Therapeutics Announces Agreement with Procter &amp; Gamble to Market Xolegel
(ketoconazole, USP) Gel, 2 Percent With Head &amp; Shoulders Shampoo as Xolegel Duo

Barrier Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq:BTRX), a pharmaceutical company developing
and commercializing products in the field of therapeutic dermatology, announced
that it will package its seborrheic dermatitis treatment Xolegel(r)
(ketoconazole, USP) Gel, 2%, with The Procter &amp; Gamble Company's (NYSE:PG) Head
&amp; Shoulders(r) (pyrithione zinc 1%) anti-dandruff shampoo as Xolegel Duo(tm).
The kit, which will be available by prescription in June, offers patients a
complete treatment regimen for seborrheic dermatitis, a recurring inflammatory
skin condition characterized by a red, scaly, itchy rash primarily on the face,
scalp, hairline, eyebrows and torso.

"We're pleased to include Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, one of P's most trusted
brands, in our Xolegel Duo," said Al Altomari, Chief Executive Officer of
Barrier Therapeutics. "With an estimated 90% of patients with seborrheic
dermatitis believed to have affected areas on the scalp as well as on the face
and body, this complete treatment system can help patients effectively manage
this irritating and often embarrassing condition."

Under the terms of the deal, P will supply Barrier Therapeutics with 1.7oz
bottles of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo for inclusion in Xolegel Duo(tm) and Barrier
Therapeutics will handle all logistics of assembling the kits, as well as
wholesaler distribution, pricing, and overall marketing, promotion and sale.
Barrier Therapeutics will continue to book sales and receive all proceeds from
the sale of Xolegel Duo.

Xolegel Duo is designed to provide a more complete treatment option for
effectively managing seborrheic dermatitis by providing a prescription gel
formulation of ketoconazole for the face and body plus a medicated shampoo for
the scalp in one convenient package. Barrier Therapeutics launched Xolegel Duo,
a kit containing Xolegel and Xolex(tm) (zinc pyrithione 1%) an anti-dandruff
shampoo, at the American Academy of Dermatology last August. Until then,
physicians typically recommended two distinct products for patients suffering
from seborrheic dermatitis, one product for the scalp and a different product
for the face and body.

About Xolegel Duo(tm)

Xolegel Duo, available by prescription only, consists of Xolegel (ketoconazole,
USP) Gel, 2% (15g tube) and a 1.7oz bottle of Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo.

Xolegel Gel is a cosmetically elegant treatment which offers powerful relief for
seborrheic dermatitis of the face and body in immunocompetent adults and
children 12 years of age and older. Xolegel Gel is a patented topical
formulation of 2% ketoconazole in a translucent, non-greasy gel. Xolegel Gel
applies smoothly and dries clear. With its unique gel formulation, Xolegel Gel
provides patients with a dosing regimen of a once daily application for only 14
days, thus reducing by approximately 75 percent the number of applications
required by some traditional seborrheic dermatitis therapies. Xolegel Gel was
approved by the FDA in July 2006 and is the first and only FDA-approved
prescription gel formulation of ketoconazole. For additional information visit
www.xolegel.com

About Head &amp; Shoulders(r)

One of Procter &amp; Gamble's most trusted billion dollar brands, Head &amp; Shoulders
has helped provide millions of consumers with relief from dandruff symptoms
including visible flakes, redness, dryness, itchiness and irritation for over 40
years. The proprietary zinc pyrithione (ZPT) formula in Head &amp; Shoulders
effectively maximizes the bio-availability of ZPT enabling it to get to the
source of dandruff more effectively. Offering a full line of shampoos and
conditioners, Head &amp; Shoulders provides both scalp and hair care. Head &amp;
Shoulders products are available at food, drug and mass market retailers. For
additional information visit www.headandshoulders.com.

About Seborrheic Dermatitis

Seborrheic dermatitis is a common inflammatory skin condition characterized by a
red, scaly, itchy rash primarily occurring on the face, scalp, hairline,
eyebrows and torso. Seborrheic dermatitis affects approximately three to five
percent of the U.S. population, or 8.5 million people. An estimated 90% of
seborrheic dermatitis patients reportedly have affected areas on the scalp as
well as on the face and/or body. There is no known cause, cure or way of
preventing seborrheic dermatitis but it can be effectively managed. Traditional
prescription therapies for this condition have consisted primarily of shampoos,
topical antifungal creams and topical steroids that typically require two or
more applications per day over periods of up to four weeks to be effective.

About Barrier Therapeutics

Barrier Therapeutics, Inc. is a pharmaceutical company focused on the
development and commercialization of products in the field of dermatology.
Barrier Therapeutics currently markets three prescription pharmaceutical
products in the United States: Xolegel(r) (ketoconazole, USP) Gel, 2%, for

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: LSI Corporation, Seagate Technology, IBM, American Axle and General Motors

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst
Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest
news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks
recently featured in the blog include: LSI Corporation (NYSE: LSI),

   Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:

   LSI Stretched on the Bounceback

   We expect storage and networking chipmaker LSI Corporation's
(NYSE: LSI) leadership in new technologies like Serial Attached SCSI
and RAID on Chip to become meaningful revenue drivers in
late-2008/early-2009, when share gains in the hard disk drive space
begin to accelerate. Until then, headwinds from a deteriorating
macroeconomic environment remain a significant risk for the story.

   Seagate Technology (NYSE: STX) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) accounted for
19 percent and 15 percent, respectively, of LSI's revenue in 2007.
However, STX reported several items for the March quarter that may
hurt revenue growth in the storage semiconductor area for LSI. Again,
although IBM's report recently was robust, the strength noted was
primarily in software and services, not in hardware, which may not
bode well for LSI.

   Despite its current business woes, LSI has significant
opportunities in the storage chip, system and the software markets,
with sufficient depth and breadth of products to compete effectively.
It is also likely that management will eventually be able to extract
potential benefits of the Agere synergy.

   American Axle Fate in GM's Hands

   American Axle &amp; Manufacturing Holdings, Inc.'s (NYSE: AXL)
excessive dependence on General Motors (NYSE: GM) is worrisome, given
that the North American automotive industry is presently characterized
by slow car sales, production cuts, excessive inventories, rising
commodity costs, and loss of market share by leading automakers.

   American Axle is the sole supplier of driveline components to GM
for the life of each GM vehicle program covered by a Lifetime Program
Contract. Despite AXL's attempts to diversify its customer base, GM
still accounts for almost 80 percent of its revenue. To make matters
worse, American Axle is exposed to platforms that have faced the
maximum production cuts at GM.

   Meanwhile, American Axle's earnings are reduced by at least $20
million due to rising commodity costs, as the company does not have
the opportunity to pass them on to OEM (Original Equipment
Manufacturer) customers. In fact, GM and other OEM customers are
demanding constant concessions from suppliers in the form of lower
prices.

   Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:

   Nice Price on Hewlett Packard

   We maintain our Buy recommendation on Hewlett-Packard Company
(NYSE: HPQ) on the back of the company's second-quarter results, as we
believe the world's biggest computer maker is well positioned with 70
percent of its revenue and virtually all its growth coming from
international markets. The company has maintained a strong competitive
position against is closest rivals, IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Dell (Nasdaq:
DELL).

   Behind Chief Executive Mark Hurd, Hewlett-Packard has executed
well on cost cuts leading to improved margins, which gives us
confidence that it will be able to quickly realize cost synergies
associated with the acquisition of technology outsourcing company
Electronic Data Systems (NYSE: EDS).

   We believe that HP has sustainable competitive advantages,
including its broad product line and, strong international and
consumer presence. Moreover, HP is also less sensitive to the U.S.
economy than most of its peers as it derives about 70 percent of its
revenue from international sales.

   Downgrading BJ's Restaurants

   BJ's Restaurants (Nasdaq: BJRI) has grown rapidly with its unique
concept and high-quality food offered at various price points, while
maintaining some of the best unit economics in the industry. We think
it is well positioned to achieve 20-25% EPS growth over the next
several years by growing capacity at 20% long-term, and generating 3%
same-store sales growth.

   However, BJ's shares are richly priced and incorporate what we
believe are overly optimistic same-store sales and earnings estimates.
Our EPS estimates significantly lag the consensus, and we think there
is substantial downside risk in the shares that results fall short of
high investor expectations.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE May 22 (Reuters) - Singapore Exchange (SGXL.SI)
named JPMorgan (JPM.N) as one of the full sponsors to oversee
listed companies at its newly established junior bourse,
Catalist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Catalist now has 11 full sponsors, which can advise on IPOs
as well as compliance, and six continuing sponsors, who could
only render advice to listed firms on how to comply with rules,
the exchange said in a statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sponsors, which also include banks Merrill Lynch
MER.N and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), will be tasked to ensure
that firms they helped list on SGX's Catalist board will comply
with the exchange's rules after their initial public offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Singapore hopes to attract listings from across Asia by
emulating the London Stock Exchange's (LSE.L) Alternative
Investment Market (AIM) for small companies, which has
attracted more than 2,500 listings since its launch in 1995.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than 7,600 Bear Stearns Cos' BSC.N employees, about 55 percent of its staff, are expected to lose their jobs as the troubled investment bank is absorbed into JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), JPMorgan Chief Executive James Dimon said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While discussing the historic $1.5 billion Bear Stearns takeover during Morgan's annual shareholder meeting, Dimon said "we're retaining 45 percent of Bear Stearns staff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon's remarks confirmed months of speculation that half of Bear's employees would lose their jobs as a result of the merger. JPMorgan for weeks played down the speculation as premature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But last week Dimon told a bank investor conference that about 6,000 Bear employees had received job offers, or about 40 percent of the roughly 10,000 employees whose fates have decided so far. Bear had 13,834 employees as of Feb 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Dimon's figures, a total of about 6,300 offers will be extended to Bear employees when the review and integration process is completed. They also indicate only 200 to 300 employees of those still under review will get offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan officials declined immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition, though expected to generate a $1 billion second quarter gain for JPMorgan, is a "very risky and tough proposition," Dimon said. "That's why we say 'Mission: Not accomplished.' Judge us in a year or two."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire-sale transaction, pushed through by the Federal Reserve on March 17 to head off a Bear bankruptcy, is to be completed around June 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Dimon said Morgan had identified jobs for about 1,500 Bear employees at other companies through a placement network it created.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joseph A.

&lt;p&gt; NEW ORLEANS (Hollywood Reporter) - Look out, Miley and 
Hilary, here comes Demi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney Channel has ordered "Welcome to Mollywood," a 
live-action comedy series starring Demi Lovato of the network's 
upcoming Jonas Brothers movie "Camp Rock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a role that could potentially put Lovato on the teen 
queen career path trod so successfully by Miley Cyrus and 
Hilary Duff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tentatively titled series centers on Molly (Lovato), a 
15-year-old small-town girl who, after a nationwide search, is 
chosen to join the cast of the most popular and long-running 
teen sketch comedy show on television. The sitcom will feature 
a show-within-a-show with fully produced comedy sketches.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lovato was introduced to Disney Channel viewers last year

&lt;p&gt;New Analysis Showed That High Dose Lipitor Can Reduce the Risk of Cardiovascular Events in Bypass Surgery Patients

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc announced today that Lipitor(R) (atorvastatin calcium) 80 mg
significantly reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events, including heart
attack and stroke, by 27 percent in patients with heart disease who had previous
coronary bypass surgery compared with patients taking the 10 mg dose of Lipitor.
This analysis, designed and completed following the closure of the five-year
Treating to New Targets (TNT) study, was published in the "Journal of the
American College of Cardiology."

Intensive Lipitor therapy also provided a significant 30 percent reduction in
the need for either repeat coronary bypass surgery or angioplasty, another type
of interventional heart surgery, compared with Lipitor 10 mg.

Each year in the U.S., approximately 470,000 bypass surgeries are performed on
270,000 people. Patients in the TNT study who had undergone previous bypass
surgery had a much higher likelihood of cardiovascular events than those who did
not have prior bypass surgery. This especially high risk population tends to be
under-treated with lipid-lowering therapy.

"Patients may be under the impression that once they have had coronary bypass
surgery, they are no longer at high risk for heart attacks and strokes," said
Dr. Rochelle Chaiken, vice president of Pfizer's global cardiovascular and
metabolic medical team. "Although these patients continue to be at an increased
risk for major cardiovascular events and repeat heart surgery, statins are
considerably underused. This analysis highlights not only the importance of
treating, but also treating aggressively with Lipitor 80 mg."

Both doses of Lipitor (80 mg and 10 mg) were well-tolerated in patients with
prior coronary bypass surgery, and the safety profile of Lipitor 80 mg was
comparable to Lipitor 10 mg, a finding that was consistent with the overall TNT
population.

About the TNT Study

The TNT study was an investigator-led trial coordinated by an independent
steering committee and funded by Pfizer. The primary endpoint was the reduction
of major cardiovascular events, including death from heart disease, non-fatal
heart attacks, resuscitated cardiac arrest, and fatal or non-fatal strokes.

The study enrolled 10,001 men and women with coronary heart disease aged 35
years to 75 years in 14 countries and followed them for an average of five
years. In this analysis, 4,654 patients who had previous coronary bypass surgery
were compared with 5,347 patients who did not. Lipitor 80 mg is not a starting
dose.

About Coronary Bypass Surgery

Coronary bypass surgery is a procedure in which damaged sections of the coronary
arteries (arteries that bring blood to the heart muscle) are replaced with
healthy blood vessel segments. The surgery reroutes, or "bypasses," blood around
clogged arteries to improve blood flow and oxygen to the heart.

This procedure is done because arteries that bring blood to the heart muscle can
become clogged by plaque (a buildup of fat, cholesterol and other substances).
This can slow or stop blood flow through the heart's blood vessels, leading
to chest pain or a heart attack. Increasing blood flow to the heart muscle can
relieve chest pain and reduce the risk of heart attack.

About Angioplasty

Angioplasty is a type of interventional heart surgery which encompasses a
variety of procedures used to treat patients with diseased arteries of the
heart, such as:

    --  Chest pain caused by a build-up of fats and cholesterol.

    --  Other substances from the blood (referred to as plaque) that can reduce
        blood flow to a near trickle.

    --  A heart attack caused by a large blood clot that completely blocks the
        artery.

Typically, angioplasty is performed by threading a slender balloon-tipped
tube - a catheter - from an artery in the groin to a trouble spot in an artery
of the heart. The balloon is inflated, compressing the plaque and widening the
narrowed coronary artery so that blood can flow more easily. This is often
accompanied by inserting an expandable metal stent (a small mesh tube) to keep
the artery open.

About Lipitor

Only Lipitor offers these three benefits important in a statin: FDA approval to
reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other cardiovascular events in
patients with or without heart disease; the ability to reduce "bad" cholesterol
(LDL) by 39 percent to 60 percent; and a well-established safety profile across
a broad range of patients.

It is the most prescribed cholesterol-lowering therapy in the world, with nearly
151 million patient-years of experience. Lipitor is supported by a 15-year
clinical trial program involving more than 400 ongoing and completed trials with
more than 80,000 patients.

Important U.S. Prescribing Information

Lipitor is a prescription medication. It is used in patients with multiple risk
factors for heart disease such as family history, high blood pressure, age, low
HDL ("good" cholesterol) or smoking to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke,
certain kinds of heart surgery, and chest pain.

Lipitor is used in patients with existing coronary heart disease to reduce the
risk of heart attack, stroke, certain kinds of heart surgery, hospitalization
for heart failure, and chest pain.

Lipitor is also used in patients with type 2 diabetes and at least one other
risk factor for heart disease such as high blood pressure, smoking or
complications of diabetes, including eye disease and protein in urine, to reduce
the risk of heart attack and stroke.

When diet and exercise alone are not enough, Lipitor is used along with a
low-fat diet and exercise to lower cholesterol.

Lipitor is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is
not for women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant.

Patients taking Lipitor should tell their doctors if they feel any new muscle
pain or weakness. This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle side effects.
Patients should tell their doctors about all medications they take. This may
help avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check
liver function before and during treatment and may adjust the dose. The most
common side effects are gas, constipation, stomach pain and heartburn. They tend
to be mild and often go away.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds analyst's comment, updates share prices)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Fayen Wong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PERTH May 22 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N), the
world's biggest oil company, and its partners have agreed to
begin initial engineering work on an $11 billion LNG project in
Papua New Guinea, a key step in moving it towards final
approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Major oil and gas producers are racing to complete the
building of liquefied natural gas plants between 2011-2015,
when supply is forecast to be at its tightest amid burgeoning
global demand due to economic growth and environmental
concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Initial engineering work, also known as front end
engineering and design (FEED), is expected to take about 16
months to complete. A final investment decision is expected in
late 2009, with the first LNG deliveries expected in 2014,
venture partner Oil Search (OSH.AX) said in a statement.
Australia's Santos Ltd (STO.AX) is the other main partner in
the venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon last month forecast LNG, a cleaner alternative to oil
and coal, would account for a third of Asia's energy needs by
2030.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It may be only FEED phase and there's still final
investment decision to be made, but the project has very robust
economics so this is expected to be a tick in the box for
them," said Andrew Williams, an oil and gas analyst at Credit
Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This project will also be important for Exxon in terms of
its overall strategy in developing its LNG portfolio in Asia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have said Exxon's project has a very good chance
of being approved for development given its high rate of
return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global oil and gas consultant Wood MacKenzie said last
month the project has an estimated internal rate of return of
19 percent, compared with Chevron's (CVX.N) proposed Gorgon
project of 12 percent and Woodside Petroleum Ltd's (WPL.AX)
A$12 billion Pluto project at 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project's move into FEED phase will help Oil Search to
commercialise its large gas resources in Papua New Guinea, and
will increase Santos' exposure to the lucrative LNG market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Oil Search, which gained as much as 6 percent,
were up 2.7 percent at A$6.41 by 0341 GMT, while Santos' shares
gained 4 percent to A$20.62, having earlier hit a record peak
at A$20.87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; $11 BILLION PROJECT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project, estimated to cost between $10-$11 billion,
proposes to commercialise the Hides, Angore and Juha gas fields
and the associated gas resources in the oil fields of Kutubu,
Agogo, Gobe and Moran in the southern highlands and western
provinces of Papua New Guinea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed two-train LNG plant will have a production
capacity of 6.3 million tonnes a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's Papua New Guinea LNG project is likely to beat
rival ventures in the Australian region to production given its
economics and unity between partners, said Mark Greenwood, an
analyst from JPMorgan Chase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Australia has two operating LNG ventures, with another in
construction and as many as 12 more proposed, including four
planned coal seam gas-fueled LNG plants on the eastern
seaboard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some analysts say Exxon's progress on the LNG project in
Papua New Guinea was unlikely to have a negative impact on
Chevron's Gorgon project off Western Australia, in which Exxon
has a 25 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The projects are very independent and have their own
feasibility metrics. Besides, a company like Exxon can
certainly multi-task," Credit Suisse's Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement for the project to move forward came after
Exxon agreed fiscal terms on the project with the government,
ExxonMobil said in an e-mailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil Search said the government agreement included a 30
percent tax rate and an additional profits tax, which will
apply once a certain threshold level of return has been
achieved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement also sets the terms for the Papua New Guinea
government's equity participation in the project, which is
capped at 22.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Project operator ExxonMobil has a 41.5 percent interest.
Oil Search has 34 percent, Santos has 17.7 percent. Energy
retailer AGL Energy Ltd (AGK.AX), Nippon Oil Corp 5001.T and
PNG landowners own the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AGL said on Thursday that, following the agreement, it now
intended to sell its oil, gas and LNG project assets in PNG. It
said it targeted to complete the sale by the end of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp is pulling contributions to several groups that have downplayed the risks that greenhouse gas-emissions could lead to global warming, continuing a policy started in 2006 by Chief Executive Rex Tillerson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon will not contribute to some nine groups in 2008 that it funded in 2007. It said in its corporate citizenship report that the groups' "position on climate change could divert attention from the important discussion on how the world will secure the energy required for economic growth in an environmentally responsible manner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The groups Exxon has stopped funding include the Capital Research Center, Committee for a Constructive Tomorrow, Frontiers of Freedom Institute, the George C. Marshall Institute, and the Institute for Energy Research, according to Exxon spokesman Gantt Walton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's tone on climate change has softened since Tillerson took the reins of the company at the beginning of 2006, replacing the often-combative Lee Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson has said that nations should work toward a global policy to fight climate change and in 2006 the company stopped funding a handful of groups that were climate change skeptics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But environmental activists charged that Exxon continued to fund other groups working against policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, with Greenpeace arguing that the company gave more than $2 million to climate change skeptics in 2006 alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company cut its spending again in 2007 on such groups, including the Heartland Institute, which hosted a conference in March with the theme, "Global warming is not a crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman; Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move followed news earlier on Friday that Expro had received a higher approach at 1,525p per share from U.S. rival Halliburton (HAL.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The independent directors of Expro said they recommended the new cash offer from Candover and Goldman Sachs, having on April 17 agreed to a bid of 1.61 billion pounds worth 1,435 pence per share from the same party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fast-growing Expro had said the proposal from Halliburton, the world's second-biggest oil services company behind Schlumberger (SLB.N), was subject to conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Expro shares, up six fold in the past four years, were up 5.1 percent at 1,620 pence following the revised agreement with Candover and Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas industry services providers such as Expro have benefited as record energy prices prompt companies to boost spending on exploration and development of reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This has attracted bidding interest from private equity firms and trade buyers for oil field services firms, with the tussle for Expro following other deals in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On April 18, the day after Expro agreed to the Candover and Goldman bid, Halliburton announced it was mulling a counter bid, saying, "The offer would be based on Halliburton's analysis of synergy and other benefits that could be derived from combining its business with Expro and consistent with the company's previously espoused strategy of making acquisitions which are accretive to shareholder value".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evolution Securities analyst Keith Morris said that from a share price point of view "we are there, or thereabouts" and that Halliburton, as a trade buyer, should be able to pay more than private equity which cannot extract any synergies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW TECHNOLOGY APPEAL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Export's key attraction is its proprietary technology for oil-well maintenance, which is still in testing and whose value depends on bidders taking a gamble on its future, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Export's system could dramatically cut the costs of fixing oil wells because it allows this to be done from a supply ship, rather than from rigs that are expensive to hire and take a long time to move to site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halliburton, through its leading role in offering oilfield services to a global client base of oil companies, is in a stronger position than most to exploit the benefits of Export's new technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Halliburton had faced a de facto deadline of June 2, when Expro is due to hold a shareholder meeting to vote on the Candover deal, the latest in a series in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last September General Electric (GE.N) agreed to buy UK oil services company Sounded, while in December U.S. private equity firm First Reserve agreed to buy Abbot Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Mike Elliott; Editing by Richard Hubbard, Greg Malice)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to its Americas conviction buy list, saying shares will likely benefit from the launch of the company's third-generation iPhone next month, as well as from the sharply higher projections of iPhone sales for the second-half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyst David Bailey also raised his target on the stock to $220 from $185, and said Apple should be able to increase its available iPhone subscriber base by more than 80 percent this year due to aggressive expansion into international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to expect Apple to beat its 10 million unit goal for calendar year 2008 driven by broader global distribution and the availability of third-party applications, which should keep Apple well ahead of the competition," Bailey wrote in a note dated May 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has signed deals to bring the iPhone to Singapore, India, Australia and the Philippines this year. Earlier this month, an Apple spokeswoman said the iPhone would make its debut in those countries "later this year," but declined to comment on plans to bring the iPhone to Japan and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey, who rates the stock "buy," expects iPhone unit shipments to increase to 11 million in 2008 from 3.7 million in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also expect Apple to continue to drive Mac unit growth 3 times the PC market this year," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, theflyonthewall.com reported that Merrill Lynch had raised its price target on Apple stock to $215 from $186, and maintained its "buy" rating. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple shares rose nearly 3 percent to $181.68 in trading before the bell Friday. The stock has soared 42 percent in the past three months as investors regain confidence that Apple can sustain growth even in a weakening economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said on Friday that buying Yahoo was not a strategy in itself, and dropping the bid meant it now had $50 billion to spend on other acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo was never the strategy we were pursuing, it was a way to accelerate our online advertising business," he told a packed hall at a technology conference in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will spend money on some acquisitions. You can do a whole lot of things with 50 billion dollars," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer was responding to questions about what he planned to do with Microsoft's huge cash pile after it walked away from a proposal to buy Internet media company Yahoo for $47.5 billion, or $33 a share earlier this month. Yahoo had rebuffed the offer, saying it would only settle for $37 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's top executive was echoing a refrain heard from him in recent weeks: At a May 1 employee meeting, he said Yahoo was valuable as part of a strategy to beat Microsoft arch-rival Google, but there were limits on the price it would pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo's not a strategy, it's a part of a strategy," Ballmer had said three weeks ago in Redmond, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're interested to pay for it (Yahoo) at some level and beyond that level we're not willing to pay for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks broke down May 3 and Microsoft said it had "moved on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early this week, the two companies said new talks were underway on a more limited deal but neither side disclosed the terms. A source familiar with the discussions said Microsoft had proposed buying Yahoo's search business and taking a stake in Yahoo after Yahoo sheds its substantial Asian assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Israel this week, Ballmer said Microsoft was now not in talks to acquire Yahoo, but was looking at other types of deals with Yahoo, the world's No. 2 Web search service after Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Internet start-ups sector, which has recently seen a new class of instant-messaging tools, is not being used to its full potential, Ballmer added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are many businesses that are in some senses under-appreciated by the market," he said, noting particularly healthcare start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's an aging population -- it's one of the biggest-growing parts of the world economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in New York; Editing by Jason Neely)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, recasts, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 23 (Reuters) - BMO Capital Markets began coverage of
International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) with an
"outperform" rating and a $138 price target, and said shares of
the top computer services provider will perform well in 2008
despite the weak economic backdrop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM has a diverse revenue stream and derives two-thirds of
its revenue from outside the United States, offering some
measure of insulation against a U.S. recession, the brokerage
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this week, IBM Chief Financial Officer Mark
Loughridge said in the Reuters Global Technology, Media and
Telecoms Summit that the company is not counting on recovery in
established G7 markets for growth this year, and is looking
instead to emerging markets like India and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loughridge said IBM is optimistic that it can hit its 2010
profit goal as a focus on emerging markets helps insulate the
company from the U.S. credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BMO Capital, which is forecasting earnings of $8.64 per
share for 2008, said IBM's reduced pension expense and stock
buyback together can deliver about 62 percent of its projected
EPS growth for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N) is its top
pick in the sector and has an "outperform" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares were down 41 cents at $124.29 in morning trade
on the New York Stock Exchange.

under-appreciated by the market," he said, noting particularly
healthcare start-ups. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's an aging population -- it's one of the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) has said it is likely to sever its links with the leading international banking lobby over its call for changes in "fair value" accounting, the Financial Times reported on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The newspaper cited an unnamed Goldman Sachs official as calling an Institute of International Finance plan to relax accounting standards as "Alice in Wonderland accounting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS.N)is also defending fair value accounting -- a way of accounting for assets and liabilities based on how much they are worth now as opposed to using historical values -- but hasn't decided if it will leave the IIF over the issue, the Financial Times reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IIF is creating voluntary guidelines in a bid to influence regulators' response to the banking industry's woes and prevent a repeat of the credit crunch that has cost banks over $300 billion in losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the proposals is that fair value accounting standards should be relaxed, the Financial Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such a move would ease pressure on banks and brokerages to immediately recognize some of the losses on their books from securities that are hard to value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Christian Plumb, editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PRAGUE (Reuters) - The first thing Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer thought of when a Hungarian student attacked him with eggs this week was that he had to keep his suit clean, he said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The student threw three eggs at Ballmer, the head of the world's largest software maker, while he spoke at a university in Budapest on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said on Thursday he was later told the student was angry over a Hungarian government tender in which Microsoft was not involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought it was a joke... maybe some prank, some theatre from the university. Then I heard a sound -- Boom! And I looked at the board behind me, and I said 'uh oh, I have a problem'," Ballmer said during the Czech leg of his tour through Europe and Israel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I thought, 'I have to keep this suit clean' so I ducked under the table because I was worried, egg doesn't clean off very easily."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A video circulated widely on the Internet showed the student shouting and throwing three eggs at Ballmer, who crouched behind the podium. The student then left, escorted by university staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer then continued his speech.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Oh, he waved to me on the way out, and I waved back," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was not the first food attack on a Microsoft executive. Protesters hit company founder Bill Gates with four custard pies in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Winfrey; Editing by David Fogarty)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights: Hewlett-Packard, IBM, Dell, Electronic Data Systems and BJ's Restaurants

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst

news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks

   Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog:

   Nice Price on Hewlett Packard

   We maintain our Buy recommendation on Hewlett-Packard Company
(NYSE: HPQ) on the back of the company's second-quarter results, as we
believe the world's biggest computer maker is well positioned with 70
percent of its revenue and virtually all its growth coming from
international markets. The company has maintained a strong competitive
position against is closest rivals, IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Dell (Nasdaq:
DELL).

   Behind Chief Executive Mark Hurd, Hewlett-Packard has executed
well on cost cuts leading to improved margins, which gives us
confidence that it will be able to quickly realize cost synergies
associated with the acquisition of technology outsourcing company
Electronic Data Systems (NYSE: EDS).

   We believe that HP has sustainable competitive advantages,
including its broad product line and, strong international and
consumer presence. Moreover, HP is also less sensitive to the U.S.
economy than most of its peers as it derives about 70 percent of its
revenue from international sales.

   Downgrading BJ's Restaurants

   BJ's Restaurants (Nasdaq: BJRI) has grown rapidly with its unique
concept and high-quality food offered at various price points, while
maintaining some of the best unit economics in the industry. We think
it is well positioned to achieve 20-25% EPS growth over the next
several years by growing capacity at 20% long-term, and generating 3%
same-store sales growth.

   However, BJ's shares are richly priced and incorporate what we
believe are overly optimistic same-store sales and earnings estimates.
Our EPS estimates significantly lag the consensus, and we think there
is substantial downside risk in the shares that results fall short of

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) Chief Executive 
Steve Ballmer said on Friday that buying Yahoo (YHOO.O) was not 
a strategy in itself, and dropping the bid meant it now had $50 
billion to spend on other acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Yahoo was never the strategy we were pursuing, it was a 
way to accelerate our online advertising business," he told a 
packed hall at a technology conference in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will spend money on some acquisitions. You can do a 
whole lot of things with 50 billion dollars," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer was responding to questions about what he planned 
to do with Microsoft's huge cash pile after it walked away from 
a proposal to buy Internet media company Yahoo for $47.5 
billion, or $33 a share earlier this month. Yahoo had rebuffed 
the offer, saying it would only settle for $37 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's top executive was echoing a refrain heard from 
him in recent weeks: At a May 1 employee meeting, he said Yahoo 
was valuable as part of a strategy to beat Microsoft arch-rival 
Google (GOOG.O), but there were limits on the price it would 
pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Yahoo's not a strategy, it's a part of a strategy," 
Ballmer had said three weeks ago in Redmond, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're interested to pay for it (Yahoo) at some level and 
beyond that level we're not willing to pay for it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks broke down May 3 and Microsoft said it had "moved 
on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early this week, the two companies said new talks were 
underway on a more limited deal but neither side disclosed the 
terms. A source familiar with the discussions said Microsoft 
had proposed buying Yahoo's search business and taking a stake 
in Yahoo after Yahoo sheds its substantial Asian assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Israel this week, Ballmer said Microsoft was now not in 
talks to acquire Yahoo, but was looking at other types of deals 
with Yahoo, the world's No. 2 Web search service after Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Internet start-ups sector, which has recently seen a 
new class of instant-messaging tools, is not being used to its 
full potential, Ballmer added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are many businesses that are in some senses 
under-appreciated by the market," he said, noting particularly 
healthcare start-ups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's an aging population -- it's one of the 
biggest-growing parts of the world economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in New York; Editing

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON May 25 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N)

&lt;p&gt;Olympic Athletes and NASCAR Stars 'Connect with the World over a Coke' at Coca-Cola 600

    Olympians Yao Ming and Steven Lopez Experience NASCAR and Share
       their Olympic World with Coca-Cola Racing Family Drivers

    Athletes Join to Celebrate New Collectible Olympic-Themed Cans
            Featuring Coca-Cola Logo in Different Languages
CONCORD, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Before the green flag dropped to start the 49th Coca-Cola 600 at
Lowe's Motor Speedway, one pit crew performance already stood head and
shoulders above the rest - literally. Seven-foot, six-inch
international basketball superstar Yao Ming and two-time U.S. Olympic
taekwondo Gold Medalist Steven Lopez experienced the world of NASCAR
today and invited NASCAR drivers and fans to "Connect with the World
Over a Coke."

   To mark the launch of the new Coca-Cola Olympic program, Yao and
Lopez served as honorary pit crew members for Kyle Petty's No. 45
Coca-Cola team. In return, the two Olympians gave members of the
Coca-Cola Racing Family a glimpse into their world - with Yao
challenging drivers such as Jeff Burton and Michael Waltrip at
basketball and Lopez demonstrating a few taekwondo moves.

   The Coca-Cola summer program celebrating the Beijing 2008 Olympic
Games features a series of limited edition, Olympic-themed collectible
cans bearing the iconic Coca-Cola logo in different languages. The
five different cans highlight the languages of Ethiopia, Russia,
Thailand, the U.S. and China, giving Americans a "taste" of how
Coca-Cola is recognized around the world. With new designs appearing
every few weeks, the cans mark the first appearance of the Coca-Cola
script in different languages in the U.S.

   Lopez is one member of a special Coca-Cola "Six Pack" of U.S.
athletes that is prominently featured on packaging and in-store
materials throughout the summer.

   Petty, whose No. 45 Coca-Cola car features a special paint scheme
showcasing all five can designs, hosted Yao and Lopez as they
participated in simulated pit stops prior to the race. The Olympians
donned crew uniforms and learned what it takes to get some of the
world's fastest cars back on the track, trying everything from
changing tires to refueling.

   "Yao and Steven may not be the quickest tire changers in the
garage, but they were great sports and everyone had a lot of fun,"
said Petty. "Actually, with Yao's reach, he might be able to perform
some of the crew duties without ever going over the wall."

   Later, the six-time NBA All-Star and member of the Chinese Olympic
basketball team took to more familiar turf, challenging drivers from
the Coca-Cola Racing Family to a fun, yet lopsided, game of "Around
the World" on a hoop set up in Victory Lane.

   Recounting his attempt to shoot baskets against Yao, Burton said,
"While I probably didn't give Yao much of a challenge at the hoop, I'd
like to see how he'd fare swapping paint with me at 200 mph on the
track. Unfortunately, I don't think he'll fit into a stock car!"

   "The Coca-Cola 600 is my first NASCAR race and it's been awesome
to meet the drivers, change a few tires and feel the passion of the
fans," said Yao. "It was also great to share the new Coca-Cola Olympic
cans with NASCAR fans and drivers. By bringing together NASCAR and the
Olympics I know we've definitely 'Connected with the World Over a
Coke' today."

   Meanwhile, Lopez - who will join his brother Mark and sister Diana
as the first trio of siblings in more than 100 years to compete for
the U.S. in the same Olympic Games - taught the Coca-Cola Racing
Family drivers a few taekwondo techniques.

   "These Coca-Cola Racing Family drivers are tough and competitive,"
Lopez said. "I could see them using some of the taekwondo moves I
taught them to help psyche out the competition."

   The first of five Coca-Cola Olympic can designs, which showcases
the Coca-Cola logo in Russian, is now available on shelves across the
country. Lopez is featured on FridgePack packaging for the cans.

   About Coca-Cola and NASCAR

   Coca-Cola is the official soft drink of NASCAR and has been
involved with stock car racing for more than 40 years. A signature
part of Coca-Cola's innovative NASCAR program is the Coca-Cola Racing
Family - a group of top drivers that includes Greg Biffle, Clint
Bowyer, Jeff Burton, Denny Hamlin, Kevin Harvick, Dale Jarrett, Bobby
Labonte, Mark Martin, Jamie McMurray, Kyle Petty, David Ragan, Elliott
Sadler, Tony Stewart and Michael Waltrip. Now in its 24th year, the
Coca-Cola 600, held at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Concord, N.C., is the
longest continuous sponsorship of any NASCAR race.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of software giant Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) are likely to remain at current levels until its bid to buy Yahoo in whole or part is resolved, said an article in the May 26 edition of Barron's.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At current price levels, Microsoft fetches just about 13.2 times its earnings guidance of $2.13 to $2.19 a share for the June 2009 fiscal year, the report in the weekly financial publication said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's valuation looks odd when compared to other big software and Internet stocks like Oracle Corp ORCL.O and SAP AG (SAPG.DE), which trade at above 15 times expected earnings, said the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft down about 21 percent for the year and trading close to a 52-week low, the downside seems limited. But the stock is unlikely to gain much ground until the Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) situation plays out, said the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Euan Rocha, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added Apple Inc (AAPL.O) to its Americas conviction buy list, saying shares will likely benefit from the launch of the company's third-generation iPhone next month, as well as from the sharply higher projections of iPhone sales for the second-half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyst David Bailey also raised his target on the stock to $220 from $185, and said Apple should be able to increase its available iPhone subscriber base by more than 80 percent this year due to aggressive expansion into international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to expect Apple to beat its 10 million unit goal for calendar year 2008 driven by broader global distribution and the availability of third-party applications, which should keep Apple well ahead of the competition," Bailey wrote in a note dated May 22.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has signed deals to bring the iPhone to Singapore, India, Australia and the Philippines this year. Earlier this month, an Apple spokeswoman said the iPhone would make its debut in those countries "later this year," but declined to comment on plans to bring the iPhone to Japan and China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bailey, who rates the stock "buy," expects iPhone unit shipments to increase to 11 million in 2008 from 3.7 million in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also expect Apple to continue to drive Mac unit growth 3 times the PC market this year," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Friday, theflyonthewall.com reported that Merrill Lynch had raised its price target on Apple stock to $215 from $186, and maintained its "buy" rating. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple shares rose nearly 3 percent to $181.68 in trading before the bell Friday. The stock has soared 42 percent in the past three months as investors regain confidence that Apple can sustain growth even in a weakening economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Sanford C. Bernstein slashed its earnings outlook for Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc LEH.N, Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to reflect weaker fixed income sales and trading results, and a tough investment banking environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New DR specialists in Argentina, Brazil and Singapore

         JPMorgan says DR trading volumes increased nearly 70% in 1Q'08
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


JPMorgan announced today the expansion of Depositary Receipts (DR) staff in Asia
and Latin America anticipating growth in global and local DRs. The firm also
reported significant increases in DR trading volumes and values compared to the
same period last year.

JPMorgan's new DR specialists in Argentina, Brazil and Singapore will provide a
full range of services to companies that want to have their equity traded on
exchanges beyond their home markets. The team includes three vice presidents:
Bettina Garcia, who will head the local DR sales office in Buenos Aires and is
also responsible for DR sales in Chile and Peru, Marcos Yokota, who will head
local DR sales in Sao Paulo, and Sharon Tang, who will head the DR sales office
in Singapore.

JPMorgan's newest team members join a global team of more than 100 people in DR
sales, client relationship management and investor relations and shareholder
advisory services specialists located in Amsterdam, Beijing, Delhi, Hong Kong,
London, Mumbai, New York, Seoul, Shanghai, Singapore, Taipei and Tokyo.

"We are adding specialists in Argentina, Brazil and Singapore to deepen our
global reach, strengthen our local presence and continue to expand our
leadership in the DR industry," said Claudine Gallagher, global head of
JPMorgan's Depositary Receipts business. "We anticipate an increase in DR
issuances and stand ready with our market-leading investor relations and
shareholder advisory services to provide companies with everything they need to
launch a successful DR."

Meanwhile, the firm reported that trading volumes and values of DRs increased
globally in the first quarter 2008, according to figures from JPMorgan and
Bloomberg:

    --  1Q08 Trading volumes totaled 30.3 billion shares, a 69% increase from
        the same period in the prior year (17.9 billion)

    --  1Q08 Trading values amounted to $1,211 billion, more than double the
        value for the same period in the prior year ($585 billion)

Regionally, the bulk of DR activity still comes from issuers in Europe, the
Middle East and Africa, however, the total share of trading activity in Asia
Pacific and Latin America has increased.

China is expected to have an active DR market in 2008, following the
establishment of a number of DR programs by Chinese companies in 2007, including
the establishment of DR programs for China Sunergy, LDK Solar, Linktone, WuXi
PharmaTech and Yingli Green Energy, among others.

JPMorgan acted as depositary for 45% of all new DR programs for Chinese based
issuers in 2007.

"Asia's economies have been growing very rapidly over the past few years, with
strong capital needs across the region. The DR team will continue to expand its
footprint and resources in the region to ensure that corporate issuers are well
supported in their overseas fund raising activities," said Kenneth Tse, Head of
JPMorgan's Asia Pacific Depositary Receipts business.

William Kirst, the new head of JPMorgan's Latin America DR business, added:
"Equity markets in Latin America are rapidly evolving and more local companies
want to have access to investors beyond their home markets. At the same time,
there is growing interest from a broader universe of investors to invest in
Latin America. JPMorgan's new local staff adds to our ability to marshal the
resources of a global firm to help build clients' DR market capitalization,
trading liquidity and investor ownership."

JPMorgan launched the first DR in Latin America in 1960 (Telefonos de Mexico)
and serves as depositary for the largest DR program in Latin America
(Petrobras). In 2007, the firm launched a global depositary shares (GDS) program
for Grupo Clarin, the first Argentine company to have a DR listing on the London
Stock Exchange and global depositary receipt (GDR) program for Almacenes Exito
S.A., the first primary offering of equity securities by a Colombian company
outside of the home market in over 10 years.

JPMorgan created the first-ever DR in 1927 (Selfridges). Today the overall DR
market comprises more than 1,800 companies from over 75 countries which sponsor
over 2,200 DR programs in the form of American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) that
list on U.S. exchanges or Global Depositary Receipts (GDRs) which typically list
in London or Luxembourg.

JPMorgan provides a full complement of ADR and GDR services to issuers seeking
to have their equity traded on exchanges beyond their home markets. JPMorgan's
primary services include DR Issuances and Cancellations, Stock Transfer, Tender
and Exchange Offer and Subscription Rights Agency services, and Tax Reclamation
services for investors.

JPMorgan also offers a range of value-added Investor Relations and Advisory
services to issuers, with the singular goal of facilitating the DR's highest
potential liquidity, ownership and visibility.

&lt;p&gt;Expanding Global Payments Opportunities Prompt Companies To Take
                   Successful Joint Venture In House
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) and First Data announced today they have
agreed to end their joint venture, Chase Paymentech Solutions(TM), a
global payments and merchant acquiring entity, by the end of 2008. In
the interim, the two companies will continue to operate their joint
venture (JV) and provide outstanding service to their customers.

   In reviewing the Chase Paymentech joint venture, both JPMorgan
Chase and First Data concluded that the payments and
merchant-acquiring businesses were core to their strategies and each
owner's share of the venture should be operated independently by their
respective companies.

   After the transition, JPMorgan Chase and First Data will operate
separate payment businesses. JPMorgan Chase will provide global
payment solutions for allocated merchants by retaining 51 percent of
the JV's assets, including most of its employees and the JV's Canadian
and European operations. The bank will name its payments and merchant
acquiring business Chase Paymentech and retain the JV's Dallas
headquarters.

   First Data will continue to provide transaction processing and
data commerce solutions for allocated merchants through its current
technology platforms. First Data will assume management of the
full-service ISO and Agent Bank unit of the JV and will integrate 49
percent of the JV's assets and a portion of the JV employees into its
existing merchant acquiring business.

   "With emerging opportunities in the global payments business, it
makes good sense to bring our stake in Chase Paymentech business fully
in-house. Merchants are moving beyond traditional payment vehicles and
we expect to be at the forefront of the industry, developing and
investing in new forms of payments and related transactions that bring
value to merchants," said Gordon Smith, chief executive of JPMorgan
Chase's Card Services group. He added, "We appreciate our successful
partnership with First Data Corp. and look forward to working with the
company on other areas of joint interest in the future."

   "Throughout this transition, we are committed to ensuring that
there is no disruption to our allocated merchant partners. First Data
will continue to focus on our core business of providing data-driven
solutions and insight for our customers while delivering
market-leading services and technologies that advance global
commerce," said Brian Mooney, president of First Data's Merchant
Services group. "In addition, we remain committed to the bank alliance
model and value the successful relationships we have with our
financial institution partners. We look forward to working with
JPMorgan Chase in other areas of business."

   Mike Duffy, president and CEO of Chase Paymentech, added, "During
this transition, we will ensure that our customers continue to receive
the high-quality support they expect from us. Our focus will continue
to be on the delivery of the most secure and reliable global payments
via our state-of-the-art, multi-channel proprietary payment platform."

&lt;p&gt;May 27 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities added Private
Bancorp Inc (PVTB.O) to the U.S. Equity Analysts' Focus List

2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He, however, lowered his 2008 and 2009 estimates for the

&lt;p&gt;May 27 (Reuters) - Deutsche Bank cut General Electric Co

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, quotes, analyst comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Sheena Lee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI May 27 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) expects
global unit sales of its Windows Mobile software for cellphones
to grow at least 50 percent per year in fiscal years 2008 and
2009 as demand for smartphones rises rapidly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Fifty percent growth is the minimum," Eddie Wu, the
software company's managing director of OEM embedded devices
Asia, told Reuters on the sidelines of a news conference on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said Microsoft expects to sell 20 million units in its
2007/2008 fiscal year ending in June, and expects to grow at
least 50 percent annually over the next two years. It sold over
11 million units of its Windows Mobile software in its
2006/2007 fiscal year ended June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're actually still seeing very good growth (for our
mobile software) in markets like Europe and the United States,"
said Wu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wu added that growth of Windows Mobile is seen fastest in
Asia-Pacific, Middle East, Brazil, Russia and India.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's mobile communications division provides
operating systems for smartphones and other mobile devices
based on the Windows Mobile platform. Its clients include South
Korea's Samsung Electronics (005930.KS), Motorola MOT.N, High
Tech Computer (HTC) (2498.TW) and Asustek Computer (2357.TW).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft competes against Symbian-based operating systems
which are used by vendors such as Nokia (NOK1V.HE) and LG
Electronics (066570.KS).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also faces stiff competition from other players such as
Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Blackberry maker Research in Motion
RIMM.O RIM.TO, and Palm Inc PALM.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even if Microsoft is growing at a rate of 50-60 percent,
it doesn't mean they can gain that much share since Microsoft
and Apple's mobile operating system is still much smaller
compared to the Symbian system," said Citigroup analyst Kevin
Chang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But they (Microsoft) are one of the few players which are
offering touchscreen platforms so that is helping them grow,"
said Chang, adding that vendors such as Sony Ericsson may soon
also launch touchscreen smartphones with Windows Mobile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global smartphone unit shipments grew 52.5 percent from a
year ago to hit around 12 million units in 2007, based on data
by Gartner, and the market is set to continue to increase in
high double-digits in 2008 and in 2009, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also said earlier this year that it would offer
full Web browsing capabilities for mobile phones in the third
quarter this year, following in the footsteps of Apple's
iPhone, which has won praise for the way it displays Web sites
as they would appear on a computer.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Microsoft CEO comments, other details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Eric Auchard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARLSBAD, Calif. May 28 (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O)
Chief Executive Jerry Yang said on Wednesday a potential deal
with Microsoft (MSFT.O) has tremendous power, but the software
giant appears no longer interested in a full merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In his most public comments to date about his thinking on
the four-month-old, on-again, off-again Microsoft merger saga,
Yang signaled his company remained open to a potential deal,
but said Microsoft had ruled out a merger for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Microsoft walked away from a proposal
to acquire Yahoo for $47.5 billion, or $33 per share, after
Yahoo rebuffed its offer, saying it would only settle for $37 a
share.     "We did not walk away from that proposal. Microsoft
did," Yang said during an on-stage interview at the D: All
Things Digital conference taking place near San Diego on
Wednesday. He said he had felt a combination with Microsoft
would have had a "tremendous amount of power."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In mid-May the two companies said they had begun
discussions on an unspecified deal that is short of a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft is no longer interested in buying the company,
and we are talking about other things. We definitely have to
understand what they're proposing...they clearly have an
interest in Yahoo, and we need to understand more," Yang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, a source familiar with the latest round of
discussions said Microsoft has proposed buying Yahoo's search
business and taking a minority stake in the Web pioneer, but
has stopped stopping short of reinitiating full merger
negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of such a deal, Yahoo would sell its Asian assets
including significant minority stakes in Yahoo Japan (4689.T)
and China's Alibaba Group, while Microsoft would buy a chunk of
what remains of the company, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an on-stage interview at the "D" conference on Tuesday,
Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer suggested discussions
had broken down largely over price. "It became clear there was
a difference between the bid and ask," he said, using stock
trader terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In its original unsolicited takeover offer in late January,
Microsoft offered $31 a share in a half-cash, half-stock bid,
to buy Yahoo, which valued it at $44.6 billion. Yahoo responded
by saying it was open to a deal but the offer was too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer repeated on Tuesday that Microsoft had "moved on"
but stopped short of saying the mating dance between Microsoft
and Yahoo was over. "We are not rebidding for the company," he
said, but added: "We reserve the right to do so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the Wednesday interview conducted by Wall Street Journal
technology columnist Walt Mossberg, Yang said a merger with
Microsoft would involve a variety of issues beyond price. He
said discussions between the two had never thoroughly explored
such non-price hurdles, including regulatory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo President Susan Decker, appearing alongside Yang on
stage, said price had always been the biggest barrier to
reaching agreement on a deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We never got through the price door ... once we could have
gone through it, then other issues could have been discussed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang argued a competing deal between Yahoo and Google made
sense but no deal had been reached. Last month, the companies
conducted a two-week test where Yahoo hired Google to run
advertising sales alongside Yahoo search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It makes a lot of sense, but if we do something, we will
talk about it," Yang said, adding the "level at which Yahoo can
fully partner with Google has not been fully appreciated by the
marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the wake of the breakdown of the Microsoft takeover
talks, Yang defended his one year on the job as CEO and said he
believed he was the right person to lead Yahoo into a new era
of growth, even if the company must invest heavily to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I do think I am the best person to lead Yahoo," Yang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He compared conflicting media reports about who was
responsible for the failure to reach a deal to a romance gone
bad: "It's like you break up with your girlfriend in high
school ... it pretty quickly becomes 'he said, she said'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang reiterated what the company has been saying over the
past year: that it "has a lot of work to do" and needs to make
investments to reach management's vision of a new Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its strategy involves tapping the underlying social
connections of its roughly 500 million monthly visitors to
become a "must buy" for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One audience member complained to Yang she was having a
hard time finding Yahoo mobile services on U.S. smartphones.
She was apologetic for drifting off the topic of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang was only too happy to answer: "Of all the questions I
have been getting for the past four months, I am glad to get a
technical question."

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) shareholders on Wednesday rejected a proposal by dissident investors, including Rockefeller family members, that urged Exxon to hire an independent chairman to lead its board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 60 percent of the shares voted at Exxon's annual meeting opposed the proposal recommending Exxon split its chairman and chief executive jobs, both of which are held by Rex Tillerson. Dissident shareholders have been critical of Exxon's lack of investment in alternative energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 39.5 percent of the shares voted were in favor of the proposal, down from 40 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Rockefeller family backed the call for change at the top of Exxon, closely tied to the family's vast fortune since John D. Rockefeller founded the Standard Oil Co, Exxon's precursor, in 1870, although no Rockefeller has served on the board of Exxon or of a predecessor company since 1911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With oil hovering at around $130 a barrel and gas prices soaring, oil companies have become targets for criticism from lawmakers and consumer groups. They have also been targeted by environmentalists and shareholder activists who worry that the companies' promotion of fossil fuels will worsen global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, Tillerson made an effort to promote Exxon's environmental record, speaking at length about the company's efforts to lower its "environmental footprint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he made clear that Exxon's focus would stay true to its highly profitable past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Continuing to do everything we can to supply oil and natural gas is the core of our business. That's what we have been doing for 125 years and in my view we do it better than anyone else," Tillerson said at a press conference after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not going to abandon that when we know that is a requirement society has in the future," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon rival Chevron Corp (CVX.N) faced similar questions at its annual meeting on Wednesday in San Ramon, California, where shareholders and activists peppered the company with questions about its environmental and human rights record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOOM TO BUST?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon recorded two of the largest-ever corporate profits in history in 2006 and 2007. Still, some shareholders have argued that the company's lack of investments in alternative energy could leave the world's largest publicly traded company behind its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissidents have also criticized the company for having a monolithic corporate culture, which prevents it from moving in new and innovative directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's vote makes it clear that Exxon Mobil must respect the views of the shareholders and take account of the changing world outside the doors of its executive suite," Rockefeller family representatives Peter O'Neill and Neva Rockefeller Goodwin said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to have played a role in sending a wake-up call to Exxon Mobil's management and its board of directors," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson took the helm of the company at the beginning of 2006 and has steered a course similar to that set by his predecessor, the often combative Lee Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tillerson's first 9 quarters as CEO, Exxon has brought in around $91 billion in profits. The company has also raised its spending on oil and gas projects, but has not made any significant moves into renewable or alternative energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon Mobil's performance has been so strong that I think it was hard for a lot of mainstream investors to say that the current status quo hasn't been working well," said Howard Sherman, CEO of GovernanceMetrics International, a corporate governance ratings firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most large U.S. companies that have decided to separate the two positions do so either when there's a natural transition when the current chairman and CEO is retiring or even more often when there is some clear financial performance problem, or a question about the company's strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the meeting, a small group of about 20 protesters chanted slogans like "No more war for oil" and "Exxon: Enough!" But inside, many shareholders seemed content with the company's surging profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors rejected all 17 shareholder proposals at the annual meeting, which included seven proposals about the company's environmental policies and impact and three proposals on Exxon's executive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while shareholders pressing the company to change its strategy dominated the meeting, others took the floor to defend the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of our distinguished shareholder colleagues seem to have lost sight of why we hired you and why we elected this wonderful slate of directors, and that is to make us money," one investor told Tillerson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've been quite successful at it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ed Stoddard in Dallas and Martha Graybow in New York; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amazon Watch Says ''Systemic'' Human Rights Abuses Dominate Chevron Annual General Meeting, Casting Shadow over CEO and Record Profits

    Chevron's Victims from Burma, Ecuador and Nigeria Confront CEO
                 David O'Reilly at Shareholder Meeting

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
In a dramatic face-to-face showdown at Chevron's annual general
meeting, victims of the company's grave human rights abuses from three
continents today told shareholders and senior executives that the oil
major must live up to its corporate rhetoric on human rights and the
environment, and also take decisive action to make amends to the
communities it has devastated.

   Community representatives from Burma, Ecuador and Nigeria traveled
for days to participate in the meeting as proxy shareholders, calling
on Chevron CEO David O'Reilly to stop hiding behind lawyers and PR
misinformation, and to recognize and rectify the suffering the company
has caused.

   In Burma, revenues from a Chevron pipeline props up the repressive
military dictatorship while pipeline security forces have been accused
of murder, rape and forced labor. In Ecuador, the company is facing a
potential $16 billion damages payout for dumping 18 billion gallons of
toxic wastewater and leaving local communities to suffer a wave of
cancers. In Nigeria, Chevron is accused of massive environmental
contamination and having soldiers shoot and kill peaceful protestors.

   Mr. O'Reilly's response today was to deny any wrongdoing by
Chevron and instead blame the victims.

   Mercedes Jaramillo, who had traveled by days from her home on a
former Texaco oil concession in the Ecuadorian Amazon, had her
microphone turned off by Mr. O'Reilly who claimed, inaccurately, that
Texaco had cleaned up the area, and attempted to blame Ecuadorian
company PetroEcuador, despite the fact that the overwhelming majority
of the pollution in the area was caused by Texaco, which only handed
over the concession to PetroEcuador once it was largely exhausted. Ms.
Jaramillo is disfigured by a skin ailment doctors have been unable to
diagnose.

   Atossa Soltani, Executive Director of Amazon Watch, a US
environmental group working on the Ecuador case, then told the meeting
that Ms. Jaramillo, who lives on a former site supposedly "remediated"
by Chevron, had wanted to say that her skin condition covers most of
her body. Ms. Soltani then asked Mr. O'Reilly how he wants the legacy
of his reign at Chevron to be remembered. "Chevron was the sole
operator," she added, noting that Chevron designed, constructed and
operated the outdated technology that caused devastating toxic
contamination in Ecuador.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on Texaco, paragraphs 7, 8)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Amanda Beck&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif. May 28 (Reuters) - Despite higher
profits on record oil prices, the board of directors at Chevron
Corp (CVX.N), the No. 2 U.S. petroleum producer, was lambasted
at the company's annual meeting on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shareholders and activists urged company officials to take
responsibility for the environmental and human costs of oil
production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They harangued the board on a range of human rights abuses
in such countries as Ecuador, Nigeria and Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You are here comfortably, while other people are dying ...
Imagine if you were one of them," said Naw Musi, 30, a Myanmar
refugee affiliated with Earth Rights International, a human
rights group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has a lucrative partnership with the Myanmar
government but has not used its influence to demand the junta
introduce human rights reforms or force the government to admit
aid workers since the country's recent devastating cyclone,
Musi said. The cyclone has left 134,000 dead or missing and 2.4
million destitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speakers from other countries where Chevron has operations
also fired a barrage of human rights complaints. Before the
meeting, many had stood outside the company headquarters in San
Ramon, California, near San Francisco, with 50 other protesters
dressed in hazardous materials suits and holding signs that
read, "Clean Up Chevron."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Chairman David O'Reilly sought to be conciliatory
with several speakers from Ecuador, who urged the company to
remediate areas of the Amazon where Texaco, later purchased by
Chevron, dumped water that residents claim is toxic and linked
to thousands of cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron bought Texaco in 2001 and is now facing a lawsuit
potentially worth up to $16 billion in damages and pending in
an Ecuadorean court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Before the oil company arrived, our people lived without
any contamination," said Emergildo Criollo, 48, who traveled
from Ecuador to speak at the meeting with members of Amazon
Watch, an environmental group. "Today, the streams are
contaminated with oil that flows into the rivers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly admitted that there was an environmental problem
in Ecuador but said, "Chevron is the wrong target here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has spent $40 million to clean contaminated
areas and has been absolved of further responsibility by the
Ecuadorean government, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company showed a video that claimed Petroecuador, the
state-run oil company, is responsible for current problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the most emotional exchange involved company
actions that Nigerian residents say led to bloodshed in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron has used violence as a way of doing business,"
said Larry Bowoto, a Nigerian community leader and a plaintiff
in a lawsuit against Chevron now pending in a U.S. court. "I
was shot several times, and my arm is permanently damaged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Residents claimed a protest over polluted drinking water
disintegrated into violence when Nigerian security forces hired
by Chevron fired on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron countered that protesters had taken 150 hostages
and that the forces were sent by the Nigerian government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly said the company should not be criticized for
asking Nigerian authorities to handle the situation and called
Bowoto's comments "the most outrageous presentation that I have
seen in my years as chairman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most speakers remained critical. "This is about your
legacy, Mr. O'Reilly," said Atossa Soltani, executive director
of Amazon Watch. "Really, it's about moral responsibility from
Ecuador to Burma: There's a trail of systematic violations of
human rights."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some shareholders said they were also concerned about
whether the company was evaluating environmental and human
rights risks during a time of record profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Chevron reported that first-quarter
earnings rose 10 percent to $5.17 billion, or $2.48 a share,
from $4.72 billion, or $2.18 a share, a year before. Analysts,
on average, had expected $2.41 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Company officials, speaking at the annual meeting, said
Wednesday Chevron would invest $23 billion in oil and gas
exploration and production in 2008, an increase of $3 billion
over 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with decision to shelve)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 28 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) efforts
to launch a new kind of "blank-check" company, Liberty Lane
Acquisition Corp LLACU.O, got the cold shoulder both from
hedge funds and the traditional stock buyers the bank hoped to
win over, and the deal was pulled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liberty Lane, a special purpose acquisition company, was
Goldman's first foray into setting up the companies known as
SPACs, and it was designed to prevent hedge fund investors from
messing with the structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even with Goldman's endorsement, Liberty Lane's unique
terms made it a tough sell -- especially in a SPAC market that
has cooled in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pricing for the planned $350 million deal was postponed
twice, first last week and again on Tuesday, before the
offering was shelved late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liberty Lane said in a statement "it has decided not to
proceed with its proposed initial public offering at this time
due to market conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPACs are companies that raise money and hunt for
takeovers. They pay a rich dividend and have to liquidate after
a specified period -- usually two years -- if they do not
identify an acquisition that wins shareholder approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, Wall Street managed offerings for 60 SPACs,
raising more than $12 billion, representing a quarter of
domestic IPO activity. But recently the market has cooled off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No blank-check company with a market cap over $50 million
has priced since late February, according to Renaissance
Capital, a Greenwich, Connecticut, firm that tracks the IPO
market. Meanwhile, many of the blank-check shares issued over
the past year have traded down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liberty Lane was designed to appeal to traditional
buy-and-hold stock investors. The problem with most SPACs,
analysts said, is that hedge funds and other traders could buy
the shares when they traded below net asset value and then
reject every deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This strategy guaranteed a rate of return for short-term
traders but worked against the original purpose of the blank
check, which was to give investors a chance to profit from
smart deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Goldman changed the terms of Liberty Lane to fend off
short-term investors -- management put up just 1 percent of
capital and was to receive a smaller stake than normal. The new
company had a smaller "trust pool," the escrow account that
holds IPO proceeds until a deal is completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each unit was to contain one share and half a warrant,
rather than the usual one share and one warrant, reducing
potential dilution to shareholders. Management was supposed to
receive just 7.5 percent of the company, below the usual 20
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By making shares that are less attractive to traditional
SPAC buyers, Goldman gambled it could be first to sell a
blank-check offering to an audience of long-term investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman Sachs reached out to fundamental investors to fill
their book, and there wasn't enough interest at this moment in
time," said Michael Tew, co-founder of SPAC Research Partners
in Palo Alto, California.

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif. May 28 (Reuters) - Despite higher
profits on record oil prices, the board of directors at Chevron
Corp (CVX.N), the No. 2 U.S. petroleum producer, was lambasted
at the company's annual meeting on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shareholders and activists urged company officials to take
responsibility for the environmental and human costs of oil
production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They harangued the board on a range of human rights abuses
in such countries as Ecuador, Nigeria and Myanmar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You are here comfortably, while other people are dying ...
Imagine if you were one of them," said Naw Musi, 30, a Myanmar
refugee affiliated with Earth Rights International, a human
rights group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has a lucrative partnership with the Myanmar
government but has not used its influence to demand the junta
introduce human rights reforms or force the government to admit
aid workers since the country's recent devastating cyclone,
Musi said. The cyclone has left 134,000 dead or missing and 2.4
million destitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speakers from other countries where Chevron has operations
also fired a barrage of human rights complaints. Before the
meeting, many had stood outside the company headquarters in San
Ramon, California, near San Francisco. Some 50 other protesters
dressed in hazardous materials suits held signs that read,
"Clean Up Chevron."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Chairman David O'Reilly sought to be conciliatory
with several speakers from Ecuador, who urged company to
remediate areas of the Amazon basin where it dumped toxic water
that they claim is linked to thousands of cancer cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is facing a lawsuit potentially worth up to $16
billion in damages that is pending in an Ecuadorean court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Before the oil company arrived, our people lived without
any contamination," said Emergildo Criollo, 48, who traveled
from Ecuador to speak at the meeting with members of Amazon
Watch, an environmental group. "Today, the streams are
contaminated with oil that flows into the rivers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly admitted that there was an environmental problem
in Ecuador but said, "Chevron is the wrong target here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has spent $40 million to clean contaminated
areas and has been absolved of further responsibility by the
Ecuadorean government, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company showed a video that claimed Petroecuador, the
state-run oil company, is responsible for current problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Perhaps the most emotional exchange involved company
actions that Nigerian residents say led to bloodshed in 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron has used violence as a way of doing business,"
said Larry Bowoto, a Nigerian community leader and a plaintiff
in a lawsuit against Chevron now pending in a U.S. court. "I
was shot several times, and my arm is permanently damaged."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Residents claimed a protest over polluted drinking water
disintegrated into violence when Nigerian security forces hired
by Chevron fired on them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron countered that protesters had taken 150 hostages
and that the forces were sent by the Nigerian government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly said the company should not be criticized for
asking Nigerian authorities to handle the situation and called
Bowoto's comments "the most outrageous presentation that I have
seen in my years as chairman."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most speakers remained critical. "This is about your
legacy, Mr. O'Reilly," said Atossa Soltani, executive director
of Amazon Watch. "Really, it's about moral responsibility from
Ecuador to Burma: There's a trail of systematic violations of
human rights."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some shareholders said they were also concerned about
whether the company was evaluating environmental and human
rights risks during a time of record profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Chevron reported that first-quarter
earnings rose 10 percent to $5.17 billion, or $2.48 a share,
from $4.72 billion, or $2.18 a share, a year before. Analysts,
on average, had expected $2.41 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Company officials, speaking at the annual meeting, said
Wednesday Chevron would invest $23 billion in oil and gas
exploration and production in 2008, an increase of $3 billion
over 2007.

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp shareholders on Wednesday rejected a proposal by dissident investors, including Rockefeller family members, that urged Exxon to hire an independent chairman to lead its board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over 60 percent of the shares voted at Exxon's annual meeting opposed the proposal recommending Exxon split its chairman and chief executive jobs, both of which are held by Rex Tillerson. Dissident shareholders have been critical of Exxon's lack of investment in alternative energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 39.5 percent of the shares voted were in favor of the proposal, down from 40 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Members of the Rockefeller family backed the call for change at the top of Exxon, closely tied to the family's vast fortune since John D. Rockefeller founded the Standard Oil Co, Exxon's precursor, in 1870, although no Rockefeller has served on the board of Exxon or of a predecessor company since 1911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With oil hovering at around $130 a barrel and gas prices soaring, oil companies have become targets for criticism from lawmakers and consumer groups. They have also been targeted by environmentalists and shareholder activists who worry that the companies' promotion of fossil fuels will worsen global warming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the meeting, Tillerson made an effort to promote Exxon's environmental record, speaking at length about the company's efforts to lower its "environmental footprint."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, he made clear that Exxon's focus would stay true to its highly profitable past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Continuing to do everything we can to supply oil and natural gas is the core of our business. That's what we have been doing for 125 years and in my view we do it better than anyone else," Tillerson said at a press conference after the meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not going to abandon that when we know that is a requirement society has in the future," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon rival Chevron Corp faced similar questions at its annual meeting on Wednesday in San Ramon, California, where shareholders and activists peppered the company with questions about its environmental and human rights record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BOOM TO BUST?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon recorded two of the largest-ever corporate profits in history in 2006 and 2007. Still, some shareholders have argued that the company's lack of investments in alternative energy could leave the world's largest publicly traded company behind its competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissidents have also criticized the company for having a monolithic corporate culture, which prevents it from moving in new and innovative directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's vote makes it clear that Exxon Mobil must respect the views of the shareholders and take account of the changing world outside the doors of its executive suite," Rockefeller family representatives Peter O'Neill and Neva Rockefeller Goodwin said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased to have played a role in sending a wake-up call to Exxon Mobil's management and its board of directors," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson took the helm of the company at the beginning of 2006 and has steered a course similar to that set by his predecessor, the often combative Lee Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tillerson's first 9 quarters as CEO, Exxon has brought in around $91 billion in profits. The company has also raised its spending on oil and gas projects, but has not made any significant moves into renewable or alternative energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon Mobil's performance has been so strong that I think it was hard for a lot of mainstream investors to say that the current status quo hasn't been working well," said Howard Sherman, CEO of GovernanceMetrics International, a corporate governance ratings firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most large U.S. companies that have decided to separate the two positions do so either when there's a natural transition when the current chairman and CEO is retiring or even more often when there is some clear financial performance problem, or a question about the company's strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside the meeting, a small group of about 20 protesters chanted slogans like "No more war for oil" and "Exxon: Enough!" But inside, many shareholders seemed content with the company's surging profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors rejected all 17 shareholder proposals at the annual meeting, which included seven proposals about the company's environmental policies and impact and three proposals on Exxon's executive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And while shareholders pressing the company to change its strategy dominated the meeting, others took the floor to defend the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some of our distinguished shareholder colleagues seem to have lost sight of why we hired you and why we elected this wonderful slate of directors, and that is to make us money," one investor told Tillerson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You've been quite successful at it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ed Stoddard in Dallas and Martha Graybow in New York; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Screenvision, a leader in cinema advertising, has entered into an
agreement with the Disney Channel to help promote the cable network's
upcoming original movie "Camp Rock," starring teen pop sensations the
Jonas Brothers. Through the deal, a 30-second spot for the
highly-anticipated TV movie will run in Screenvision's Premium
Pod(TM). Only Screenvision offers this ad placement right before the
previews. The ad began May 23rd and will run through June 19th before
all G and PG rated films, including such anticipated summer
blockbusters as "Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian" and "Kung Fu
Panda." The "Camp Rock" campaign marks Disney Channel's first foray
into cinema advertising.

   Screenvision's cinema advertising network is comprised of more
than 14,000 screens across 2,300 theatres nationwide and reaches 92%
of U.S. DMAs. Screenvision produces the only host-format entertainment
preshow in the cinema advertising industry, which airs across
Screenvision's High Definition digital network of approximately 7,000

   "We're thrilled that Disney Channel is working with us to help
promote 'Camp Rock' and have chosen to run their spot in our Premium
Pod," said Michael Chico, executive vice president, sales and
marketing, Screenvision. "Through our Premium Pod we're able to offer
marketers such as Disney Channel, prime advertising real estate, with
the maximum exposure possible in cinema in terms of available audience
for viewing. This is a great way for Disney Channel to first
experience the power of cinema advertising."

   Debuting on Disney Channel June 20, "Camp Rock" centers on a teen
girl named Mitchie Torres who desperately wants to spend her summer at
a prestigious rock camp, but can only attend if she works in the
kitchen as one of the cooks. When she's overheard singing - but not
seen - by a teen pop star at the camp, he is completely taken and sets
out to find the girl behind the beautiful voice. But first she must
confront her fears, step out of the kitchen and into the spotlight.

   Added Richard Loomis, Senior Vice President, Marketing and
Creative, Disney Channel: "'Camp Rock' is a huge priority for the
network and in order to maximize the reach of the targeted kids and
tween audience during the summer timeframe, we will reach them in one
of the main places they will be - at the movies. With Screenvision's
Premium Pod(TM), we feel we are best able to optimize our advertising
in cinema."

   Screenvision's new deal with Disney Channel follows other
successful partnerships the cinema advertising leader has forged with
top television brands including: MTV, ABC Family, ABC Network, E!, Fox
Home Entertainment, HBO and Showtime Networks.

goals and expected timing of clinical studies and data from studies, statements
regarding the potential benefits and mechanisms of action of drug candidates,
statements concerning the timing of seeking regulatory approval of our product
candidates (including with respect to telavancin statements regarding any
expectation (i) regarding the results of the additional site evaluations
underway by the FDA, (ii) that the third-party manufacturer will successfully
address the cGMP issues the FDA noted in the approvable letter, or (iii) that
the FDA will approve the telavancin NDA on the basis of existing preclinical and
clinical data or at all), and the enabling capabilities of Theravance's approach

results of clinical or preclinical studies indicate product candidates are
unsafe or ineffective, our dependence on third parties in the conduct of our
clinical studies, delays or failure to achieve regulatory approvals, risks of
relying on third-party manufacturers for the supply of our product candidates
and risks of collaborating with third parties to develop and commercialize
products. These and other risks are described in greater detail under the
heading "Risk Factors" contained in Item 1A of Theravance's Quarterly Report on
Form 10-Q filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on May 8, 2008

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 28 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) efforts
to launch a new kind of "blank-check" company, Liberty Lane
Acquisition Corp LLACU.O, is getting the cold shoulder both
from hedge funds that had snapped up these takeover vehicles
and from the traditional stock buyers they hoped to win over.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The initial pricing of Liberty Lane shares has been
postponed twice, first last week and again on Tuesday night, as
Goldman struggles to fill out its order book. Goldman, the sole
underwriter, was still marketing some 35 million units at $10 a
unit on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Experts on the blank-check market, saying they are
reluctant to bet against a powerhouse like Goldman, said a deal
could still get done Wednesday night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even so, the delays show that Liberty Lane's unique terms
have made it a tough sell, even with Goldman's endorsement --
especially in a SPAC (special purpose acquisition company)
market that has cooled in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The delay may be a sign of a tepid investor response to
the revised structure," said Linda Killian, manager of
Renaissance Capital's IPO Plus fund. "It's also not exactly a
great time to launch a deal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokeswoman declined immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPACs are shell companies that raise money and hunt for
takeovers. They pay a rich dividend and have to liquidate after
a specified period -- usually two years -- if they do not
identify an acquisition that wins shareholder approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, Wall Street managed offerings for 60 special
purpose acquisition companies, or SPACs, raising more than $12
billion last year, or a quarter of domestic IPO activity. But
recently the market has cooled off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No blank-check company with a market cap over $50 million
has priced since late February, according to Renaissance, a
Greenwich, Connecticut, firm that tracks the IPO market.
Meanwhile, many of the blank-check shares issued over the past
year have traded down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Liberty Lane, Goldman's first foray into the field, was
designed to appeal to traditional buy-and-hold stock investors.
The problem with most SPACs, analysts said, is that hedge funds
and other traders could buy the shares when they traded below
net asset value and then reject every deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This strategy guaranteed a rate of return for short-term
traders but worked against the original purpose of the blank
check, which was to give investors a chance to profit from
smart deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So Goldman changed the terms of Liberty Lane to fend off
short-term investors -- management is putting up just 1 percent
of capital and receiving a smaller stake than normal. The new
company has a smaller "trust pool," the escrow account that
holds IPO proceeds until a deal is completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each unit will contain one share and half a warrant, rather
than the usual one share and one warrant, reducing potential
dilution to shareholders. Management will receive just 7.5
percent of the company, below the usual 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By making shares that are less attractive to traditional
SPAC buyers, Goldman is gambling it can be the first to sell a
blank-check offering to an audience of long-term investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The question is can Goldman sell a deal almost entirely to
fundamental buyers? If they can, it will revolutionize the SPAC
market," said Michael Tew, co-founder of SPAC Research Partners
in Palo Alto, California. "And right now, this is an incredibly
challenging environment for new SPAC issuance."

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) achieved another year of record
earnings and continued to build on its financial strength, Chevron
Chairman and CEO Dave O'Reilly said at the company's 2008 Annual
Meeting of Stockholders.

   "We are delivering on our commitments and moving in the right
direction," O'Reilly stated. "We have the right strategies to create a
strong platform for long-term growth and to deliver value to our
stockholders."

   In his remarks, O'Reilly highlighted technology among several key
elements contributing to Chevron's success. He credited technology for
transforming not only how and where Chevron produces energy, but also
how much the company can produce.

   O'Reilly said technology also can create new opportunities for the
company. He noted that Chevron's technology leadership in sour natural
gas led to a new opportunity with the China National Petroleum
Corporation in developing the Chuandongbei natural gas area in central
China. In 2007 the company also opened two new global technology
centers to expand its research and development capability and
established alliances with government and academic institutions to
pursue technology to convert nonfood sources into commercially viable
biofuels.

   Peter Robertson, vice chairman of the board, elaborated on
Chevron's strong financial performance in 2007. He said the company's
net income of $18.7 billion in 2007 represented the fourth consecutive
year of record earnings. Return on capital employed for 2007 was 23
percent.

   "Our strong earnings and cash flows are enabling us to return cash
to our stockholders through dividends and stock buybacks and to fund a
robust capital program," Robertson said. "In 2007, we repurchased $7
billion of our common shares and increased our quarterly dividend by
11.5 percent. And last month, we announced a 12.1 percent quarterly
dividend increase for 2008, the 21st consecutive year Chevron will
have increased its annual dividend rate."

   Robertson also stressed the company's unrelenting focus on safety.
"I am very proud that in 2007 we continued improving our safety
performance. We are closing in on our goal to be the industry leader,"
he said.

   Robertson then presented an overview of Chevron's $23 billion
capital and exploratory expenditure program for 2008, which represents
a 15 percent increase from expenditures in 2007. About 75 percent of
the 2008 budget is for worldwide crude oil and natural gas exploration
and production projects, with another 20 percent dedicated to the
company's downstream businesses that manufacture, transport and sell
gasoline, diesel fuel and other refined products.

   George Kirkland, executive vice president, Global Upstream and
Gas, cited the company's strong upstream position in nearly all the
world's key basins, and the diversity and breadth of its asset
portfolio as the foundation for future growth plans.

   "Production and reserves growth begins with exploration success,"
Kirkland said. "Over the past six years, our exploration program has
achieved a success rate of 45 percent." He noted that in 2007 Chevron
added approximately 1 billion barrels of new oil-equivalent resources
to its portfolio.

   Kirkland also spoke about Chevron's growth opportunities and
described the company's queue of 40 major capital projects, each of
which represents a Chevron investment of more than $1 billion. He said
these projects are key to Chevron bringing on new production to help
meet the world's energy needs.

   Mike Wirth, executive vice president, Global Downstream, said
important achievements in 2007 included enhancements to the scale and
flexibility of the company's refining system made progress in
improving refinery reliability.

   He told stockholders that Chevron is well positioned to meet
energy demand in high-growth markets and is focused on delivering
strong returns and profitable growth. Wirth said the company is
focused on ensuring the long-run reliability of its refineries, and
emphasized Chevron is committed to maintaining its product quality and
brand strengths as the foundation of a more focused and profitable
marketing business.

   In closing he stated, "We're executing the right strategies,
making tangible progress in the business and advancing solid
opportunities for growth in volumes and margins."

   Nine proposals were voted on by Chevron stockholders, and the
preliminary report of the Inspector of Election was as follows:

   Item 1: More than 1.7 billion shares, or approximately 94 percent
of the votes cast, were voted for each of the 15 nominees for election
to the board of directors.

   Item 2: More than 1.7 billion shares, or approximately 97 percent
of the votes cast, were voted to ratify the appointment of
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as the independent registered public
accounting firm.

   Item 3: Approximately 82 percent of the outstanding shares
approved the board's proposal to amend Chevron's Restated Certificate
of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of
Chevron common stock from 4 billion to 6 billion.

   Item 4: Approximately 14 percent of the votes cast were voted for
the stockholder proposal to separate the CEO and chairman of the board
positions.

   Item 5: Approximately 24 percent of the votes cast were voted for
the stockholder proposal to adopt a human rights policy and issue a
report to the stockholders by October 2008 on the plan for
implementing the policy.

   Item 6: Approximately 25 percent of the votes cast were voted for
the stockholder proposal to report on the environmental impact of
expanding oil sands operations in the Canadian boreal forest.

   Item 7: Approximately 9 percent of the votes cast were voted for
the stockholder proposal to adopt quantitative goals for reducing
greenhouse gas emissions and issue a report to stockholders by Sept.
30, 2008, on the company's plans to implement the goals.

   Item 8: Approximately 8 percent of the votes cast were voted for
the stockholder proposal regarding the adoption of guidelines for
investing in or withdrawing from individual countries and reporting of
these guidelines to the stockholders and employees by October 2008.

   Item 9: Approximately 7 percent of the votes cast were voted for
the stockholder proposal to report on the policies and procedures that
guide the company's assessment of the adequacy of host country laws to
protect human health, the environment and the company's reputation.

   Final voting results will be reported in Chevron's second quarter
2008 Form 10-Q, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in early August. Specific information about the proposals
before Chevron stockholders this year may be found in the Investor
Relations section of the company's Web site under Stockholder Services

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp's attempt to strike a deal with Yahoo Inc is an "accelerator" of its online strategy, but not the entire vision, the company's top software executive said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray Ozzie, Microsoft's chief software architect, said at a Bernstein investor conference that a deal with Yahoo would help advance the build-out of a strong online advertising platform and increase the company's base of engaged users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Yahoo was not a strategy onto itself," said Ozzie, who replaced Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as the company's top software visionary. "Yahoo is an accelerator. We'd love to still discuss possibilities with Yahoo."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He did not elaborate on the nature of current discussions with Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had said in recent weeks that it was engaged in new talks with Yahoo over a deal that stopped short of a full acquisition. Yahoo's board rejected Microsoft's previous takeover proposal, saying the $47.5 billion offer undervalued the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the discussions said Microsoft, in more recent talks, has proposed buying Yahoo's search business and taking a stake in the rest of the company after Yahoo sheds its substantial Asian assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a question-and-answer session with Bernstein Research analyst Charles Di Bona, Ozzie said Web search leader Google Inc's financial strength and savvy made it a formidable, but not unfamiliar, rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft ... by necessity had to build up a culture of crisis," Ozzie said. "Ever since the early, early days, Microsoft has always faced some amazing competitor that looked like it was going to be some roadblock to success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cited Microsoft's early rivalry with Lotus, where he once worked, in spreadsheets and word processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But competition has strengthened Microsoft, according to Ozzie. He noted that online gaming platform Xbox Live was born out of the fight against Sony Corp in the video game console business, and the company began making software compatible with rivals to take on open-source products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Similarly, Ozzie said Google's model of "cloud computing," an industry term to describe the trend by Internet powerhouses to arrange huge numbers of computer in centralized data centers to deliver Web-based applications to far-flung users, will lead to significant changes at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ozzie believes that Microsoft's hybrid model -- adopting elements of cloud computing with traditional software running on a computer's hard drive -- is where the industry is going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Software plus services is an industry trend, not just a Microsoft trend," said Ozzie, noting that even cloud-computing advocates like Google and Salesforce.com Inc are also developing offline applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell 32 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $28.12 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Lisa Von Ahn)&lt;/p&gt;

formidable, but not unfamiliar, rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft ... by necessity had to build up a culture of
crisis," Ozzie said. "Ever since the early, early days,
Microsoft has always faced some amazing competitor that looked
like it was going to be some roadblock to success."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He cited Microsoft's early rivalry with Lotus, where he
once worked, in spreadsheets and word processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But competition has strengthened Microsoft, according to
Ozzie. He noted that online gaming platform Xbox Live was born
out of the fight against Sony Corp (6758.T) in the video game
console business, and the company began making software
compatible with rivals to take on open-source products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Similarly, Ozzie said Google's model of "cloud computing,"
an industry term to describe the trend by Internet powerhouses
to arrange huge numbers of computer in centralized data centers
to deliver Web-based applications to far-flung users, will lead
to significant changes at Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ozzie believes that Microsoft's hybrid model -- adopting
elements of cloud computing with traditional software running
on a computer's hard drive -- is where the industry is going.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Software plus services is an industry trend, not just a
Microsoft trend," said Ozzie, noting that even cloud-computing
advocates like Google and Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N) are also
developing offline applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Microsoft fell 32 cents, or 1.1 percent, to
$28.12 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 28 (Reuters) - The chief executive of General
Electric Co (GE.N) bought 115,000 shares of the conglomerate on
Wednesday, according to a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Jeffrey
Immelt said he bought the shares for prices ranging from $30.59
to $30.66 a share, for a total of about $3.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is the third time Immelt has directly bought shares in
GE on the open market this year, according to insider filing
tracker InsiderScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  The purchase comes as General Electric named five non-US
appliance manufacturers, including China's Haier and South
Korea's LG Electronics, as potential bidders for the company's
century-old appliance business. For details see
[ID:nSEO173147].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After stunning investors in April with an unexpected drop
in quarterly earnings, GE said this month it would look to sell
or spin off its appliances unit, saying the business was too
focused on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GE shares, which were little changed at $30.38 on
Wednesday, are down 18 percent year-to-date. Most of the drop
in GE's shares this year came in the wake of the first quarter
earnings shortfall.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Beverage bottler Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc (CCE.N) said on Wednesday it expects a mid- to high-single-digit percentage decline in second-quarter profit, excluding one-time items, citing the weak North American economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analysts, on average, expected earnings for the quarter to be up 5 percent, and shares of the company fell 5.1 percent on Wednesday to a 14-month low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises also said it would be hard to meet its full-year earnings forecast of $1.50 to $1.55 a share if current economic and market trends did not improve. Analysts, on average, forecast $1.51 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) beverages said the weakening North American economy was cutting into sales volume, especially in higher-margin 20-ounce bottles, which are sold in convenience stores. Higher gasoline prices have cut into convenience store traffic, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are taking action to meet the persistent challenges created by these weakening economic and marketplace conditions in the U.S., including initiatives to strengthen cold drink sales, increase revenue, and reduce expenses," John Brock, chairman and chief executive, said in a news release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it was unclear what impact the steps would have as the company heads into the key summer selling season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts said the company's issues may go beyond macroeconomic factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is also because CCE is not executing as well as other Coke bottlers in North America, growing volume at a slower rate" than the other bottlers on a combined basis, said Stifel Nicolaus analyst Mark Swartzberg in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The recent addition of Glaceau beverages to the Coca-Cola distribution system may also have caused some "distraction," said J.P. Morgan analyst John Faucher in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises also said it expects modest volume and operating income growth in the second quarter in Europe despite the impact of a recently resolved two-week labor disruption in France.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Coca-Cola Co on Wednesday said it was still confident in its outlook for the second quarter and full year, citing strength in international markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Enterprises shares were trading down $1.09 at $20.22 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange. Coca-Cola Co shares fell 67 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $57.92.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Brad Dorfman; Editing by Brian Moss and Mark Porter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that businesses are taking advantage of
WebSphere
Virtual Enterprise to manage software applications and service oriented
architecture(SOA) environments with minimal human interaction. The software
increases
application performance and lowers operational and energy costs required
tocreate, run, and manage applications across an enterprise.

    WebSphere Virtual Enterprise provides application infrastructure
virtualization
capabilities that dynamically deliver application server resources where they
are needed most.  The software separates applications and services from the
underlying
infrastructure.  Workloads can then be dynamically placed and migrated
across a pool of application server resources allowing the infrastructure to
automatically adapt and respond to business needs. Requests are then
prioritized and routed to respond to the most critical applications and users.

    Rotech and Osaka Gas are two companies already benefiting from WebSphere
Virtual
Enterprise. Both companies are using the product to improve application and
service performance, ensure business process integrity, decrease time associated
with management and maintenance, and reduce energy consumption and costs within
the data center.

    Rotech, a home healthcare provider based in Orlando, is using WebSphere
Virtual
Enterprise within its SOA to provide consistent access to treatment programs and
health information. In order to achieve this, Rotech needed to eliminate
application server failures, which had previously taken up to fifty percent
of its staff time. WebSphere Virtual Enterprise provides Rotech with dynamic
clustering of application servers, so that service requests can be assessed and
deployed according to availability, policy and priority.

    "Virtualizing the application infrastructure has helped us eliminate
maintenance
headaches, improve application performance and simplify management through a
single centralized point of control," said Marlin Clark, Director of Information
Systems Technology, Rotech Healthcare Inc. "Not only has WebSphere Virtual
Enterprise become an integral part of our SOA strategy, it's also allowing us
to reduce the energy costs associated with running our IT infrastructure. We
talked
with BEA and IBM, but only IBM showed a commitment to helping us make this
level of change."

    Osaka Gas, a leading energy supplier in Japan serving 6.7 million customers,
is
using WebSphere Virtual Enterprise to enhance application performance and
integrate
its previously siloed application servers. The company has over 200
enterprise Java applications in a shared services infrastructure.  When an
application failed, it negatively impacted other applications creating an
unstable environment.

    To rectify the situation, Osaka Gas enlisted WebSphere Virtual Enterprise to
visualize and understand the behavior of its Java applications and implement
autonomic control of the infrastructure, while keeping its existing
environment unchanged. Osaka Gas saw immediate benefits from WebSphere Virtual
Enterprise, including increased application availability and better integration
across
the business with no impact to their existing systems.

    "Virtual Enterprise provided us an entry point for application
infrastructure
virtualization. Because of the success of this project, we plan to move to a
fully virtualized environment as part of our larger SOA strategy," said
Hiroshi Nakauchi, Professional IT Architect and Technical Director, Osaka Gas
Information System Research Institute. "We estimate that we'll be able to reduce
our hardware costs significantly now that we're maximizing workloads on our
existing servers."

    Virtualization Improves the Bottom Line

    IBM WebSphere Virtual Enterprise complements server, storage and network
virtualization by providing application infrastructure virtualization
capabilities that
can result in tangible cost savings in reduced hardware and energy costs,
reduced
administrative operational costs, planned maintenance cost savings, and
reduction
in unplanned outages.

    "Companies with an SOA strategy can drastically improve performance of the
infrastructure with WebSphere Virtual Enterprise in ways that translate to
tangible financial benefits," said Tom Rosamilia, general manager, IBM
WebSphere. "Application infrastructure virtualization can be a key component
in taking an IT organization to new levels of energy efficiency and brings real
value to the business."

    Rotech and Osaka Gas are the newest additions to IBM's SOA customer base,
which
numbers more than 6,550 worldwide, representing a fifty percent increase from
2007 to 2008.

&lt;p&gt;Millions of Shareholders Benefit From Company Performance
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is outpacing its competitors in
providing shareholder value and is well positioned to deliver vital
energy to meet growing global demand while protecting the environment,
the corporation said today at its Annual Meeting of Shareholders.

   "The past year was an outstanding year and a record for our
corporation by nearly every measure," Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and
chief executive officer, said in a presentation to shareholders. "We
achieved these results by delivering industry-leading safety
performance, excellence in operations and environmental protection,
strong governance and disciplined investment performance."

   The annualized return on investment for ExxonMobil shareholders
was more than 24 percent per year over the past five years, tripling
the value of an investment during the period. Put another way, $1,000
invested in ExxonMobil in 1987 is now worth nearly $19,000, double the
growth of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Index and ahead of the average of
ExxonMobil's competitors.

   "We generated greater shareholder value than our industry
competition and greater value than the broader market," said
Tillerson. "Millions of people have benefited financially by holding
ExxonMobil shares either directly or indirectly through their pension,
insurance and mutual funds."

   Tillerson outlined the company's efforts to protect the
environment, by reducing greenhouse gas emissions, preventing spills
and protecting biodiversity.

   "Energy security, economic growth and environmental impacts are
increasingly on the minds of people today," he said. "We're focused on
safely and reliably meeting the growing energy demand while working to
reduce our impact on the environment."

   ExxonMobil has spent more than $2 billion over the past five years
on initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve
efficiency, and plans to spend another $1 billion by 2010. Through
actions taken in 2006 and 2007, the company reduced greenhouse gas
emissions by about 5 million metric tons in 2007.

   "We have the same concerns as people everywhere - and that is how
to provide the world with the energy it needs while reducing
greenhouse gas emissions."

   Reporting financial results, Tillerson said ExxonMobil led the oil
and gas industry with average return on capital employed of 32
percent, almost 40 percent greater than its closest competitor.

   The company started production at seven major projects, adding
production capacity of nearly 220,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day.
The year also marked the 14th consecutive year that ExxonMobil
replaced more than 100 percent of its production with new reserves for
future production.

   Shareholders heard that the corporation expects 12 major
developments to begin production in 2008, adding an additional 375,000
oil-equivalent barrels per day to ExxonMobil's production. That
includes the start up in Qatar of two of the world's largest
facilities to produce liquefied natural gas, which will yield nearly
2.5 billion cubic feet of clean-burning natural gas every day for
power stations, factories and homes around the world.

   Between 2008 and 2010, ExxonMobil expects to participate in the
start up of 19 new projects which, at peak, would collectively add
more than 725,000 oil-equivalent barrels per day to ExxonMobil's
production.

   In all, ExxonMobil's industry-leading portfolio of more than 100
projects is expected to support development of more than 24 billion
oil-equivalent barrels of energy.

   Cautionary Note: Statements in this release relating to future
plans, expectations, events or conditions are forward-looking
statements. Actual results, including project plans, capacities, and
timing; production rates; efficiency expenditures; and resource
recoveries could differ materially due to changes in long-term oil or
gas prices or other market conditions affecting the oil and gas
industry; political events or disturbances; timely completion of
development projects; the outcome of commercial negotiations; wars and
acts of terrorism or sabotage; changes in technical or operating
conditions; and other factors discussed under the heading "Factors
Affecting Future Results" on the "Investors" section of our website
(www.exxonmobil.com) and in Item 1A of ExxonMobil's 2007 Form 10-K.
The reserve replacement ratio is on the pricing basis the Corporation
uses to make investment decisions, not on the single-day year-end
pricing basis used for SEC reporting purposes. References to
oil-equivalent barrels and other quantities of oil and gas may include
amounts not yet classified as proved reserves but that we believe will
ultimately be produced. Information on how we calculate return on
average capital employed is included in the "Frequently Used Terms"
and related tables available on the Investors section of our website
and in the Financial Section of our 2007 Form 10-K.

&lt;p&gt;LibreDigital Internet Warehouse Accepts Microsoft Scans and
                                Content
AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
LibreDigital, a division of NewsStand, Inc., today announced a new
migration program for publishers affected by the end of the Microsoft
(MSFT) Live Search Books Publisher Program. Beginning June 2008,
LibreDigital will offer services to assist book and periodical
publishers to transfer their scans and text from Microsoft into their
own repositories hosted by the LibreDigital Internet Warehouse
solution.

   After transferring the content to the LibreDigital Internet
Warehouse for Publishers (LDW), former users of the Live Search Books
Publisher Program will not only secure ownership of their digitized
books and journals but they will also be able to leverage the growing
variety of Internet-facing promotional functions LDW offers, such as
widgets for social networks, search and discovery, Rights and
Permissions and BookBuild, the powerful LibreDigital eCompile service.

   "Publishers have become accustomed to changes in the world of
digital publishing," said Craig A. Miller, Vice President and General
Manager at LibreDigital. "This migration program we're launching today
was designed to offer a secure and high-performance repository for the
content they need to migrate from Microsoft's Live Search Books
Program."

   "Microsoft's decision to migrate away from their Live Book Search
projects is partly a result of the company's decision to focus on
their Core Search initiatives. Their move opens up opportunities for
Internet Digital Warehouse solutions, like LibreDigital's, that can
connect directly to other repositories, like Microsoft's, while
offering control and protections for Publishers," said Frank Gilbane,
CEO at the Gilbane Group.

   LibreDigital solutions are used by some of the world's top
publishers, including Bloomsbury, HarperCollins, Harlequin and
Hachette. The company's offerings include the LibreDigital Internet
Digital Warehouse solution which allows publishers to deliver
searchable book content in a variety of digital formats while
protecting control of content and copyrights.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities cut its profit view on three large U.S. investment banks and suggested investors avoid the brokerage sector as earnings estimate continue to appear "too bullish" in the second half of 2008 and 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

KING OF PRUSSIA, Pa.--(Business Wire)--
Devon IT, a leading alternative desktop solution company and the
fastest-growing provider of thin client solutions, demonstrated its
TC10 thin client, alternative desktop growth forecasts, and the latest

   Joe Makoid, president of Devon IT, Stephane Verdy, chief

customers, and partners to outline the companies' various alternative
desktop solutions and components, including the IBM Virtual
Infrastructure Access Services.

China," says Makoid. "We have gauged significant interest for
alternative desktop solutions from various verticals in this country
and worldwide. There is no better partner to work with in server-based
computing than IBM, and we look forward to supporting their virtual
infrastructures with our thin clients."

   The TC10 is one of the industry's most powerful thin clients and

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON May 28 (Reuters) - Citadel Investment Group said on
Wednesday it had hired another JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
banker -- the third in three months -- to oversee securitized
products.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bill King will join the $20 billion hedge fund group as a
senior managing director and head of Securitized Products,
Citadel said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; King joined JP Morgan Chase eight years ago and was the
company's head of Pass Through Trading, head of Mortgage
Trading, and co-head of U.S. Securitized Products before being
promoted to global co-head of Securitized Products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, Citadel said it had hired former JP Morgan banker
Derek Kaufman to run its U.S. fixed-income business. In March,
it said Patrik Edsparr, former head of fixed income at
JPMorgan, would join this summer to run the hedge fund's
European division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hedge funds have long been attractive places to work for
former bankers because the pay is often better; hedge funds
managers earn hefty compensation fees on top of management
fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pull may be even stronger now that many hedge funds are
considered to be financially sounder than many large banks that
face problems from the credit crisis.

   Weakening economic trends have continued to limit volume
performance in North America, particularly in higher margin 20-ounce
packages of sparkling beverages and water, negatively affecting
operating income. In Europe, CCE expects modest volume and operating
income growth in the second quarter despite the impact of a recently
resolved two week labor disruption in France.

   Given these factors, CCE now expects a mid to high single-digit
decline in second quarter comparable earnings per share versus the
second quarter of 2007.

   "We are taking action to meet the persistent challenges created by
these weakening economic and marketplace conditions in the U.S.,
including initiatives to strengthen cold drink sales, increase
revenue, and reduce expenses," said John F. Brock, chairman and chief
executive officer. "We are entering the key summer selling season, and
the net impact of these initiatives against the background of the
uncertainties in the marketplace remains unclear. As a result, we will
update our full year guidance on our second quarter earnings call in
July.

   "We are working to deliver our full-year 2008 earnings guidance of
$1.50 to $1.55 earnings per share. However, this will be challenging
if current economic and market trends do not improve," Mr. Brock said.
"Even as we work through these difficult conditions, we remain focused
on our vision and long-term strategic objectives. We are confident
that these strategies are vital in our work to maximize the
performance of our company and ultimately deliver long-term
sustainable growth."

   Mr. Brock will present at the Sanford C. Bernstein Strategic
Decisions Conference at 2 p.m. ET today. The public can access the
live webcast through the company's website, www.cokecce.com.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to additional subscribers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Erman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DALLAS May 28 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) has
scrapped with Venezuela's Hugo Chavez over nationalized oil
projects and sparred with U.S. senators over high oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the toughest challenge that Exxon, the world's largest
oil company, may be facing in recent years comes from its own
ranks: A group of dissident shareholders pushing a proposal to
split Exxon's chairman and chief executive positions at
Wednesday's annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rex Tillerson currently holds both jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company recorded two of the largest-ever corporate
profits in history in 2006 and 2007, but a growing group of
shareholders has publicly backed the proposal, citing Exxon's
lack of investments in alternative energy as their main
motive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Rockefeller family is leading the charge, calling for a
change at the top of the company that is closely tied to their
famous fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; John D. Rockefeller founded the Standard Oil Co, Exxon's
precursor, in 1870, but the family has not been actively
involved at Exxon for years. The company said no Rockefeller
has served on its board, or the board of any of its predecessor
companies, since 1911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Peter O'Neill, great-great-grandson of Rockefeller, said 66
of the 78 adult Rockefellers currently supported their stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is unclear how many shares the Rockefeller family
controls. Exxon was able to identify 12 of the 15 Rockefellers
associated with the shareholder resolution, and said they
collectively own around 332,000 of the company's 5.4 billion
shares -- or about 0.006 percent of outstanding shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The family has been moved to act, driven by Exxon's
passivity in what they see as an important emerging market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neva Rockefeller Goodwin, a great granddaughter of John D.
Rockefeller and a Tufts University economist, called on Exxon
to reconnect with the forward-looking vision of her ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Part of John D. Rockefeller's genius was in recognizing
early the need and opportunity for a transition to a better,
cheaper and cleaner fuel," Goodwin said in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has urged shareholders not to support the proposal to
split the top jobs, saying it believes the most effective
leadership structure for the current company is for Tillerson
to continue in both roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson took the helm of the company at the beginning of
2006 and has steered a course similar to that set by his
predecessor, the often combative Lee Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Tillerson's time as CEO, Exxon has raised its spending
on oil and gas projects, but has not made any significant moves
into renewable or alternative energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dissidents have also criticized the company for having a
monolithic corporate culture, which prevents it from moving in
new and innovative directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon also faces 16 other shareholder proposals at the
annual meeting, all of which the company suggested shareholders
vote against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They include seven proposals about the company's
environmental policies and impact and three proposals on
Exxon's executive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another proposal asks shareholders to vote to prohibit
nonbinding or advisory shareholder proposals, unless the board
takes specific action to approve such proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon rival Chevron Corp (CVX.N) will also hold its annual
meeting on Wednesday in San Ramon, California.

&lt;p&gt;Zacks Analyst Interview Highlights: Pfizer, Bristol Myers Squibb, Sanofi-Aventis and Merck

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Analyst Interview. Today's interview
is with senior analyst Jason Napodano, who discusses Pfizer (NYSE:
PFE), Bristol Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), Sanofi-Aventis (NYSE: SNY) and
Merck (NYSE: MRK).

   Jason, why does big pharma seem to be stuck in its rut?

   It's pretty simple: revenue growth has slowed due to patent
expirations. And, for many companies, it's only going to get worse.

   Last year, the industry saw almost $13 billion in lost sales due
to loss of exclusivity on blockbuster drugs. That figure should stay
about even in 2008, and peak in 2012 when some of the world's biggest
drugs like Pfizer's (NYSE: PFE) Lipitor and Viagra, Bristol (NYSE:
BMY) and Sanofi's (NYSE: SNY) Plavix, and Merck's (NYSE: MRK) Singular
all lose exclusivity. That makes it difficult for big pharma names to
grow their top-line when they could lose as much as $2-3 billion in
sales in one year from a key drug going off-patent.

   What are some of these companies doing to combat the patent issue?

   Well, speaking on an industry-wide basis, most are cutting costs
and buying back shares to maintain earnings growth. I've been saying
for a while now that big pharma is no longer a growth industry. It's a
mature industry with slowing top-lines and tough new competition from
small biotech firms. We have been analyzing historical and projected
income statements for the largest players in the sector and we found
some interesting trends.

   Firstly, product gross margins (PGM) have been extremely stable.
The industry-wide average hasn't changed much since 2005 (77.8%). In
2006 it was 78.0%. Last year the industry-wide average was 77.9%. We
forecast 77.8% for 2008, and then steady at 77.9% through 2012. That
means the days of driving earnings growth by improvements in
manufacturing scale are over.

   It also means that price becomes more important. PGMs are what
they are, and thanks to small contract manufacturing organizations
(CMOs), small biotech can compete with big pharma on price. In fact,
most profitable biotech firms have higher PGMs than the industry's
largest players.

   Another interesting trend we discovered is that the myth of lower
R spending is just that - a myth. R as a percentage of revenues
has been pretty stable at around 16.5% to 17.0% since the boom days of
late-1990s. For both big pharma and biotech, this level of spending on
R should remain stable through 2012. Pharma companies are spending
as much on new product development now as they ever did.

&lt;p&gt;CARLSBAD, California (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp plans to give users of the next version of its Windows operating system touch screen controls as one option for controlling the software, its top executives said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chairman Bill Gates and Chief Executive Steve Ballmer showed off new Windows features based on software it calls "multi-touch" that will be part of Windows 7, the next version of Windows, which Ballmer said was due out in late 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ability to use touch to give users fingertip control of their screens could help revolutionize how computer desktops and mobile phones are controlled and would be an alternative to existing mice, keyboard and pen-based user controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During a joint interview that kicked off the Wall Street Journal's three-day D: All Things Digital conference, an annual gathering of the computer industry elite taking place north of San Diego, Ballmer said touch screen controls was one example of how Microsoft would improve on existing Windows software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is seeking to one-up Apple Inc, which made touch-screen software central to the success of its iPhone mobile device, which combines computer, phone and Web features and has sold around 6 million units in its first 11 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After more than a decade of slow development, Gates said new ways of interacting with computers other than keyboards and mice have matured to the point where they are ready to go mainstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are at an interesting juncture where almost all of the interaction is with the computer and mouse, today, and, over the years to come, the role of speech, vision, ink, all of those will become huge," Gates said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was referring to technologies that gives users the ability to control computers with voice commands, detect and sort different kinds of images and use electronic ink instead of typing for computer input.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SURFACE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-touch software builds on existing capabilities Microsoft has introduced in recent years including Surface, for interacting with large tabletop computer displays, TouchWall for mounted screens and Tablet PCs for touch-screen notebooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a demonstration of touch-screen capabilities to be offered in Windows 7, Microsoft showed a new application called "Touchable Paint" that lets a user paint with their fingers, as well as software to organize photos or navigate maps by touch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not about complete replacement of the mouse," Julie Larson-Green, Microsoft's corporate vice president in charge of Windows Experience Program Management, said in a first-time demonstration of multi-touch features to run inside Windows 7.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said Microsoft is trying to learn from the reaction to Windows Vista, the latest version of its operating system, which was introduced in January 2007 but faced initial criticism for being incompatible with many older applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft has sold 150 million copies of Vista, up from 140 million the company reported it had sold a month ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you read the customer research, the No. 1 people found jarring is that we changed the user interface," Ballmer said. "People take a while to get used to it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said Microsoft had learned lessons about making dramatic changes in the way users interact with new versions of Windows. Conference co-host Walter Mossberg asked Ballmer whether Microsoft was done changing the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will polish it," Ballmer replied. "We will change it, but there are ways to change it and there are times to do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vista followed five years after the previous Windows upgrade and was beset by delays due to the complexity of updating a piece of software with some 50 million lines of code that runs on more than 90 percent of the world's computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the problems of releasing Vista in a timely manner, Ballmer pledged to never again wait so long between releases of its Windows operating system. Microsoft has said it expected to release the new operating system code-named Windows 7 around three years after the early 2007 release of Windows Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer acknowledged that Microsoft considered Apple a formidable competitor. But he said the two companies' audiences were vastly different in scale, with Apple supplying around 10 million computers this year versus the roughly 290 million machines which PC makers will sell running Microsoft Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Whether Apple has a PC with touch in it to market first, we'll see," Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi in Seattle; editing by Sue Thomas)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Australian Full Federal Court Upholds Basic Lipitor Patent, Preventing Launch of Generic Ranbaxy Product

       Lipitor Protected from Generic Competition in Australia until 2012
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc said today that the Australian Full Federal Court in Victoria has
upheld on appeal the exclusivity of its basic patent covering atorvastatin, the
active ingredient in Lipitor. The ruling, the culmination of a lawsuit filed in
2005 by generic drug manufacturer Ranbaxy, preserves Lipitor's patent coverage
in Australia through May 2012. Ranbaxy can appeal the decision.

The court found that a proposed Ranbaxy generic product would infringe Pfizer's
basic Lipitor patent (AU 601,981). A second patent covering the calcium salt of
atorvastatin (AU 628,198), which expires in September 2012, was ruled invalid by
the court. Pfizer has the opportunity to appeal that ruling.

The Australian decision will not impact ongoing Lipitor patent actions in other
countries, including the United States. Pfizer said it will continue to
vigorously defend against challenges to its intellectual property, noting that
patents provide the necessary incentive to invest in new and life-saving
medicines that benefit millions of patients globally.

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) has scrapped with Venezuela's Hugo Chavez over nationalized oil projects and sparred with U.S. senators over high oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the toughest challenge that Exxon, the world's largest oil company, may be facing in recent years comes from its own ranks: A group of dissident shareholders pushing a proposal to split Exxon's chairman and chief executive positions at Wednesday's annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rex Tillerson currently holds both jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company recorded two of the largest-ever corporate profits in history in 2006 and 2007, but a growing group of shareholders has publicly backed the proposal, citing Exxon's lack of investments in alternative energy as their main motive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Rockefeller family is leading the charge, calling for a change at the top of the company that is closely tied to their famous fortune.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John D. Rockefeller founded the Standard Oil Co, Exxon's precursor, in 1870, but the family has not been actively involved at Exxon for years. The company said no Rockefeller has served on its board, or the board of any of its predecessor companies, since 1911.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter O'Neill, great-great-grandson of Rockefeller, said 66 of the 78 adult Rockefellers currently supported their stance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is unclear how many shares the Rockefeller family controls. Exxon was able to identify 12 of the 15 Rockefellers associated with the shareholder resolution, and said they collectively own around 332,000 of the company's 5.4 billion shares -- or about 0.006 percent of outstanding shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The family has been moved to act, driven by Exxon's passivity in what they see as an important emerging market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neva Rockefeller Goodwin, a great granddaughter of John D. Rockefeller and a Tufts University economist, called on Exxon to reconnect with the forward-looking vision of her ancestor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Part of John D. Rockefeller's genius was in recognizing early the need and opportunity for a transition to a better, cheaper and cleaner fuel," Goodwin said in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has urged shareholders not to support the proposal to split the top jobs, saying it believes the most effective leadership structure for the current company is for Tillerson to continue in both roles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson took the helm of the company at the beginning of 2006 and has steered a course similar to that set by his predecessor, the often combative Lee Raymond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tillerson's time as CEO, Exxon has raised its spending on oil and gas projects, but has not made any significant moves into renewable or alternative energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dissidents have also criticized the company for having a monolithic corporate culture, which prevents it from moving in new and innovative directions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon also faces 16 other shareholder proposals at the annual meeting, all of which the company suggested shareholders vote against.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They include seven proposals about the company's environmental policies and impact and three proposals on Exxon's executive compensation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another proposal asks shareholders to vote to prohibit nonbinding or advisory shareholder proposals, unless the board takes specific action to approve such proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's rival Chevron Corp (CVX.N) will also hold its annual meeting on Wednesday in San Ramon, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michael Erman; editing by Jeffrey Benkoe)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Walt Disney Co CEO 
Robert Iger said Wednesday that "The Chronicles of Narnia: 
Prince Caspian" is underperforming at the box office because of 
competition from "Iron Man" and "Indiana Jones."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Since its May 16 release, the "Narnia" sequel has earned 
$99.6 million in North America, according to Box Office Mojo. 
Its 2005 predecessor, "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the 
Witch and the Wardrobe," had earned $122.7 million in the same 
period. It went on to make date $291.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney originally had "Caspian" set for last Christmas, but 
delayed it in deference to "The Water Horse: Legend of the 
Deep," a fantasy vying for the same audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The studio might also have been taking into account the 
feelings of Walden Media, its production partner on "Narnia" 
and the production company behind "Water Horse." That film, 
distributed by Sony, earned just $40 million domestically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger, speaking at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions 
Conference in New York, said "Prince Caspian" is a better movie 
than the first installment but because it was released between 
a couple of the year's biggest hits, audiences are overlooking 
it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Prince Caspian" was released less than two weeks after 
"Iron Man" and just six days before "Indiana Jones and the 
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." Both those pictures are headed 
into the $300 million area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger lamented the "very delicate, very fragile marketplace" 
for movies in general, given that "there's just too much out 
there." As of now, the next movie in the "Narnia" series is set 
for release May 7, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney is getting into 
the graphic novel business with a plan to adapt the works into 
movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Studios has created Kingdom Comics, and signed 
a multiyear deal with writer-actor Ahmet Zappa, TV executive 
Harris Katleman and writer-editor Christian Beranek to oversee 
the division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The aim is to create titles that will be the basis of new 
film projects for the studio as well as to reimagine and 
rejuvenate movies from Disney's library of live-action films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No writers or artists have been announced, though the trio 
is on the hunt for new and established talent to create the 
books. Kingdom, which will be located on the Disney lot, has a 
first-look deal with Disney Publishing Worldwide to distribute 
the publications. If Disney chooses not to publish a book, 
Kingdom will explore other venues. Also, there is no set number 
of graphic novels that are mandated to be published per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The studio will pluck titles, putting them into development 
on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The creation of Kingdom Comics positions the studio as a 
player in the scorching comic book scene. Many studios have 
aligned themselves to the big companies -- Warner Bros. owns DC 
Comics, Marvel has a distribution deal with Paramount, 
Universal has a first-look deal with Dark Horse Comics --

&lt;p&gt;  PERM, RUSSIA, May 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the opening of a client center in the city
of Perm in the Russian Federation as part of the company's regional
expansion.

    The center, which is IBM's 7th in Russia, is aimed at supporting its
customers and business partners in the Perm region of Russia. IBM is
actively investing in hiring and training new staff, establishing new centers
of competence and supporting the education of local business partners across the
country. Last year, IBM opened client centers in St. Petersburg, Kazan,
Rostov-on-Don, Samara and Novosibirsk. IBM's Russian operation is headquartered
in Moscow where IBM has been present for 35 years.

    "The next 10 years of economic growth in Russia will be a period where the
regions become of increasing importance as the fastest growth moves out of
Moscow and St. Petersburg and businesses tap into opportunities and resources
across the country," said Kirill Korniliev, country general manager of IBM in
Russia. "Given the growth of the local markets and the increasing complexity
of IT projects that we are involved in, it is essential for us to have
direct presence in Russia's most important cities."

    Perm, which is in the Urals region of Russia to the west of the country,
isimportant for Russian industry. IBM is supporting the transformation of some
of the biggest companies in Perm across key industries such as chemicals,
metals, mining, energy, oil and gas, telecommunications and banking.

    For example, IBM business consultants currently are supporting the Perm city
administration in creating an IT-strategy focused on the reallocation of the
government's information technologies and services. The strategy is designed
to increase the efficiency and value of Perm's IT resources and create a
single, integrated IT platform for all government departments and
applications. The platform, based on SOA technologies, also would support the
development of e-government services such as online procurement and an
information portal for citizens of the region.

    "We turned to IBM to help us define our IT strategy due to its international
experience in combination with its local knowledge and expertise," said
Michael Bobrov, head of IT, Perm city administration. "We are confident that
this piece of work will help us to boost the effectiveness of all our
administrative processes."

    In another project, IBM, in collaboration with its local business partner
CROC,
has provided Kamabank -- one of the biggest banks in the Perm region -- with
core data center technologies. Kamabank is using the new data center as the
backbone for its new automated banking system for the processing of financial
data.

    IBM also announced details today of an agreement with the Perm municipal
government
to launch the KidSmart Early Learning Program to schools in the Perm region
aimed at increasing the computer literacy of children and teachers in primary
education. As part of the agreement IBM will donate 52 KidSmart PC units
with special educational software in Russian language.

&lt;p&gt;SANTA MARGHERITA LIGURE, Italy (Reuters) - Mediaset will 
add Disney and a new sports channel to its pay-TV service, 
whose revenue growth in May and April was in line with that for 
the first quarter, one of its top executives said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mediaset, Italy's biggest private broadcaster owned by 
Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, will offer the two 
extra channels from July, Deputy Chairman Pier Silvio 
Berlusconi said at a presentation in this seaside town.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The monthly price for the enriched pay-TV offering -- 
called Premium -- will rise to 10 from 8 euros, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Active users of the service stood at about 2.6 million, he 
said, adding that the figure often varied because the cards 
bought to get the service expired after two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "From January till today around 4,000 (pay-TV) cards a day 
have been activated," Berlusconi told reporters attending the 
presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Financial Officer Marco Giordani confirmed a 2008 
target for a loss of 70 million euros at the pay-TV service, 
with revenue at about 400 million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first quarter, its revenues more than doubled to 109 
million euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The service -- which aims to offer viewers a slimmer, 
low-cost alternative to satellite television provided by Sky 
Italia -- is expected to break even in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berlusconi said talks on the sale of content to Rupert 
Murdoch's Sky Italia continued, but did not give any indication 
on the timing of an agreement. "We are in no rush, it is a 
complicated negotiation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Claudia Cristoferi; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
SOMERSET, N.J., May 29, 2008 (PRIME NEWSWIRE) -- inVentiv Health, Inc.
(Nasdaq:VTIV), a leading provider of commercialization services to the global
pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, today announced that its board of
directors has approved the appointment of Blane Walter as chief executive
officer. Walter will assume his new role effective June 11 following the
company's 2008 annual shareholder meeting. Eran Broshy, the company's long-term
chief executive officer and chairman, has been appointed to the newly-created
position of executive chairman of the board and will work closely with Walter to
shape the company's future. The board expects a smooth transition and no change
to inVentiv's strategy.

"We have successfully transformed inVentiv over the last several years to its
current leadership position and delivered five consecutive years of record
profitability and growth," said Broshy. "Blane's leadership, business acumen and
industry experience have contributed greatly to our success and I couldn't
imagine a better successor to take inVentiv to the next level. This is a natural
evolution in our phased leadership succession plan. I look forward to working
closely with Blane and serving inVentiv's shareholders as executive chairman."

Walter, currently president of inVentiv Health, joined the company in
conjunction with inVentiv's acquisition of inChord Communications in 2005, where
he was the long-standing chairman and CEO. Walter built inChord over a period of
eleven years from a 35-person advertising agency to become the largest
privately-held healthcare communications company in the world with a staff of
over 1,000 professionals. Upon joining inVentiv in 2005, Walter became president
and CEO of inVentiv Communications, and further grew the business to its current
staff of over 1,300 professionals. In 2007, Walter was promoted to president of
inVentiv Health with oversight responsibility for all of inVentiv's operating
divisions.

"It has been our goal to build a strong and diversified business model that
excels in providing healthcare clients with a comprehensive range of service
offerings to accelerate their success," said Walter. "It is a tribute to Eran's
vision and leadership that we are now uniquely positioned to take advantage of
the current market dynamics. Our focus is and continues to be to leverage our
unique combination of best-in-class services to effectively innovate and execute
for our clients. In the last year, we have demonstrated positive progress on
delivering integrated services, but there are many more opportunities available
to us. I am excited to be assuming the CEO role at this juncture, and leading
our highly talented team to fully realize these opportunities for our clients."

Under Broshy's leadership, inVentiv Health's revenues grew from $215 million in
2002 to $977 million in 2007, and its market capitalization increased from under
$65 million in 2002 to over $1.1 billion today. Broshy led the growth and
development of inVentiv as it became one of the world's preeminent providers of
commercialization services to the global pharmaceutical and healthcare
industries. In addition to delivering 17% pro-forma organic annual growth in net
revenues from 2002 to 2007, he led an aggressive acquisition strategy that
included over 15 deals over the last four years.

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Selects URS To Provide Engineering, Procurement and Construction Management for New Natural Gas Treatment Facility

SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
URS Corporation (NYSE: URS) today announced that the Company has
been awarded a contract by ExxonMobil to provide detailed engineering,
procurement and construction management services for a commercial
demonstration plant that will use ExxonMobil's Controlled Freeze
Zone(TM) (CFZ(TM)) technology. CFZ(TM) seeks to expand the use of
carbon capture and storage by reducing the cost of removing carbon
dioxide from natural gas.

   Developed by ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company, the CFZ(TM)
process accomplishes low-cost, energy-efficient separation of
high-purity methane from CO(2) and H(2)S in a single step. Process and
mechanical features establish a controlled freezing environment that
overcomes the typical solidification barrier for methane-CO(2)
separation by distillation. The technology is a significant
advancement for removing CO(2) and other contaminants from highly sour
gas resources around the world and facilitates their reinjection
either for geosequestration or enhanced recovery purposes.

   Construction on the treatment facility, which will be located at
ExxonMobil's Shute Creek Treating Facility near LaBarge, Wyoming, will
commence this summer, and operational startup is expected in late
2009.

   Commenting on the contract award, Tom Zarges, President of URS'
Washington Division, said: "We have worked very closely with
ExxonMobil in the conceptual and detailed engineering for this
innovative plant and are very pleased to have been awarded this
assignment. The award underscores the strength of URS in the oil and
gas market, including our ability to provide the full range of E
services to support our clients on critical and complex projects. We
look forward to helping ExxonMobil build this important facility."

   URS Corporation (NYSE: URS) is a leading provider of engineering,
construction and technical services for public agencies and private
sector companies around the world. The Company offers a full range of
program management; planning, design and engineering; systems
engineering and technical assistance; construction and construction
management; operations and maintenance; and decommissioning and
closure services. URS provides services for power, infrastructure,
industrial and commercial, and federal projects and programs.
Headquartered in San Francisco, the Company operates through three
divisions: the URS Division, the EG Division and the Washington
Division. URS Corporation has more than 50,000 employees in a network
of offices in more than 30 countries (www.urscorp.com).

&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK (Reuters) - Myanmar is handing out more visas to foreign aid workers to help in the cyclone aid effort, but red tape is still hampering access to the devastated Irrawaddy Delta area, a U.N. official said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nearly a week after junta supremo Than Shwe promised he would allow in "all" legitimate foreign aid workers, the United Nations said the military government had approved 45 remaining visa requests from U.N. agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But only seven U.N. expatriate staff had made it out of the former capital, Yangon, on Wednesday, Dan Baker, U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Myanmar, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Following what's been agreed during the last week, I mean that's just really not acceptable," Baker said of bureaucratic red tape hampering their access to the delta where up to 2.4 million people were left destitute by Cyclone Nargis on May 2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cooperation with some government departments was good, but "it's not clear that every ministry has gotten the message," Baker said in a telephone interview from Yangon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said it was not unreasonable to want to keep tabs on the movements of international staff, "but that should not stop anybody from going and going in a timely way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The regime has been criticized for dragging its feet on allowing a large-scale international relief effort in the wake of Cyclone Nargis, which left 134,000 dead or missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts say it may be out of fear that opening up the country would loosen the grip on power the army has held since a 1962 coup.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other aid groups also faced problems getting out of Yangon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Federation of the Red Cross, which has some 30 foreign experts in Yangon, is still waiting for a green light to us them to establish aid hubs in the delta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Red Cross spokesman John Sparrow said Myanmar Red Cross workers were doing a tremendous job but they had little experience in handling such a complex major disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The people we have who we can deploy have seen this before," he said of the foreign staff who have expertise in areas such as health, water, sanitation and shelter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They can quickly make decisions, advise and evaluate. They bring experience and know how," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Baker, who visited the delta on Tuesday on a government-sponsored trip, said larger towns such as Bogale and Labutta appeared to be getting a steady stream of supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in one town there only appeared to be enough rice for a couple of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People were making signs like putting their fingers to their mouth as though they were hungry," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There were no indications of major outbreaks of disease, beyond some cases of diarrhoea and respiratory infections, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said a joint assessment by the United Nations, Southeast Asia's regional body ASEAN and the Myanmar government was expected within 2 weeks and will "hopefully solve this question of, are there people who haven't been reached at all? If so, where are they?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Darren Schuettler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sanjeev Miglani)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARLSBAD, California (Reuters) - Yahoo Inc Chief Executive Jerry Yang said on Wednesday a potential deal with Microsoft has tremendous power, but the software giant appears no longer interested in a full merger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In his most public comments to date about his thinking on the four-month-old, on-again, off-again Microsoft merger saga, Yang signaled his company remained open to a potential deal, but said Microsoft had ruled out a merger for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Microsoft walked away from a proposal to acquire Yahoo for $47.5 billion, or $33 per share, after Yahoo rebuffed its offer, saying it would only settle for $37 a share. "We did not walk away from that proposal. Microsoft did," Yang said during an on-stage interview at the D: All Things Digital conference taking place near San Diego on Wednesday. He said he had felt a combination with Microsoft would have had a "tremendous amount of power."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In mid-May the two companies said they had begun discussions on an unspecified deal that is short of a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is no longer interested in buying the company, and we are talking about other things. We definitely have to understand what they're proposing...they clearly have an interest in Yahoo, and we need to understand more," Yang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, a source familiar with the latest round of discussions said Microsoft has proposed buying Yahoo's search business and taking a minority stake in the Web pioneer, but has stopped stopping short of reinitiating full merger negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of such a deal, Yahoo would sell its Asian assets including significant minority stakes in Yahoo Japan and China's Alibaba Group, while Microsoft would buy a chunk of what remains of the company, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an on-stage interview at the "D" conference on Tuesday, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer suggested discussions had broken down largely over price. "It became clear there was a difference between the bid and ask," he said, using stock trader terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its original unsolicited takeover offer in late January, Microsoft offered $31 a share in a half-cash, half-stock bid, to buy Yahoo, which valued it at $44.6 billion. Yahoo responded by saying it was open to a deal but the offer was too low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer repeated on Tuesday that Microsoft had "moved on" but stopped short of saying the mating dance between Microsoft and Yahoo was over. "We are not rebidding for the company," he said, but added: "We reserve the right to do so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Wednesday interview conducted by Wall Street Journal technology columnist Walt Mossberg, Yang said a merger with Microsoft would involve a variety of issues beyond price. He said discussions between the two had never thoroughly explored such non-price hurdles, including regulatory issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo President Susan Decker, appearing alongside Yang on stage, said price had always been the biggest barrier to reaching agreement on a deal with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We never got through the price door ... once we could have gone through it, then other issues could have been discussed."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang argued a competing deal between Yahoo and Google made sense but no deal had been reached. Last month, the companies conducted a two-week test where Yahoo hired Google to run advertising sales alongside Yahoo search results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It makes a lot of sense, but if we do something, we will talk about it," Yang said, adding the "level at which Yahoo can fully partner with Google has not been fully appreciated by the marketplace."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the wake of the breakdown of the Microsoft takeover talks, Yang defended his one year on the job as CEO and said he believed he was the right person to lead Yahoo into a new era of growth, even if the company must invest heavily to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I do think I am the best person to lead Yahoo," Yang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He compared conflicting media reports about who was responsible for the failure to reach a deal to a romance gone bad: "It's like you break up with your girlfriend in high school ... it pretty quickly becomes 'he said, she said'."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang reiterated what the company has been saying over the past year: that it "has a lot of work to do" and needs to make investments to reach management's vision of a new Yahoo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its strategy involves tapping the underlying social connections of its roughly 500 million monthly visitors to become a "must buy" for advertisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One audience member complained to Yang she was having a hard time finding Yahoo mobile services on U.S. smartphones. She was apologetic for drifting off the topic of Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yang was only too happy to answer: "Of all the questions I have been getting for the past four months, I am glad to get a technical question."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Leslie Gevirtz and Lincoln Feast)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Yahoo (YHOO.O) rose in extended-hours trading after Chief Executive Jerry Yang said Microsoft (MSFT.O) "has a lot of interest in buying the company and we are listening." &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares rose 2.4 percent to $27.80 after the closing bell.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARLSBAD, California (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) 
and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) seem to hang out in all the same places 
but somehow keep missing each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; That's turned speculation over what it will take to get the 
two of them together into something of a CEO parlor game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Media magnate Rupert Murdoch said this week he is 
"mystified" the two have not come to terms. E-commerce mogul 
Barry Diller said Microsoft should never have fired a hostile 
shot at Yahoo if they didn't plan to stick it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo board member Bobby Kotick joked that he had tried to 
get top executives from Microsoft and Yahoo together to play 
Guitar Hero 4, the hit video game from the company he runs, 
Activision Inc (ATVI.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In separate appearances at the D: Conference this week, the 
top executives of Microsoft and Yahoo said no progress had been 
made on a merger, though they were discussing lesser deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two had held abortive takeover talks over a three-month 
period that ended May 3, Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft walked away from a proposal to buy Yahoo for 
$47.5 billion, or $33 a share, after Yahoo rebuffed it, saying 
it wanted $37 a share. Then in mid-May, the companies said they 
had begun talks on an unspecified deal short of a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, Yahoo's co-founder and chief executive, Jerry 
Yang, threw cold water on speculation that they might be edging 
back into merger discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft is no longer interested in buying the company, 
and we are talking about other things. We definitely have to 
understand what they're proposing ... they clearly have an 
interest in Yahoo, and we need to understand more," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an on-stage interview at the conference, Microsoft Chief 
Executive Steve Ballmer said talks had broken down largely over 
price. Appearing with Yang, Yahoo President Susan Decker agreed 
price had always been the biggest barrier to reaching a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diller, who runs the company behind rival Ask.com (IACI.O), 
believes a merger of Microsoft and Yahoo is necessary to gain 
the scale to take on Google in Web search and advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diller expressed surprise at Microsoft's decision to 
withdraw its offer and "move on" after pursuing Yahoo at 
regular intervals over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems to me if you fire a gun in a hostile offer, the 
bullet has to land in the heart," he said in his own on-stage 
appearance at the conference on Wednesday. "Otherwise, I can't 
imagining firing at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murdoch agreed, saying that given the original 62 percent 
premium Microsoft was willing to pay for Yahoo, Ballmer should 
be more patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You aim the gun and you fire," Murdoch said, echoing 
Diller. "They are not used to big deals, so they backed off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N has gotten nowhere in its own 
efforts to talk to both sides in recent months about 
alternative deal arrangements involving his MySpace Web 
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wily 77-year-old deal-maker ruled out prospects for an 
alternative deal between Yahoo and Google Inc (GOOG.O) to 
succeed, saying regulatory issues would likely derail it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he dismissed activist investor Carl Icahn's campaign to 
replace the Yahoo board in a proxy fight at the company's July 
annual shareholder meeting as "helpful noise" to Microsoft and 
a threat that Yahoo shouldn't bother worrying about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That is not serious," Murdoch said of Icahn. "Look, he 
wants to make a few hundred-million dollars for himself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murdoch's conclusion is that Microsoft and Yahoo need to 
lock themselves in a room and put their last respective offers 
on the table and settle on a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking as if he were one of the negotiators, Murdoch said 
"Look, if it is complicated, we will clean it up afterward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anticipating the flood of free advice from other 
executives, Yahoo made up its own joke video in which Yang and 
Decker are seen being inundated with unsolicited advice from 
top technology industry CEOs, investors and media pundits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Warren Buffett's advice to Yang? "Buy low, sell high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Braden Reddall)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Walt Disney Co CEO 
Robert Iger said Wednesday that "The Chronicles of Narnia: 
Prince Caspian" is underperforming at the box office because of 
competition from "Iron Man" and "Indiana Jones."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Since its May 16 release, the "Narnia" sequel has earned 
$99.6 million in North America, according to Box Office Mojo. 
Its 2005 predecessor, "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the 
Witch and the Wardrobe," had earned $122.7 million in the same 
period. It went on to make date $291.7 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney originally had "Caspian" set for last Christmas, but 
delayed it in deference to "The Water Horse: Legend of the 
Deep," a fantasy vying for the same audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The studio might also have been taking into account the 
feelings of Walden Media, its production partner on "Narnia" 
and the production company behind "Water Horse." That film, 
distributed by Sony, earned just $40 million domestically.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger, speaking at the Bernstein Strategic Decisions 
Conference in New York, said "Prince Caspian" is a better movie 
than the first installment but because it was released between 
a couple of the year's biggest hits, audiences are overlooking 
it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Prince Caspian" was released less than two weeks after 
"Iron Man" and just six days before "Indiana Jones and the 
Kingdom of the Crystal Skull." Both those pictures are headed 
into the $300 million area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Iger lamented the "very delicate, very fragile marketplace" 
for movies in general, given that "there's just too much out 
there." As of now, the next movie in the "Narnia" series is set 
for release May 7, 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bear Stearns' two top economists, David Malpass and John Ryding, will not join JPMorgan Chase  Co, which is set to close its purchase of Bear, a source familiar with the situation said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was not known whether Malpass and Ryding have accepted positions at another company, according to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malpass and Ryding declined to comment. JPMorgan also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, JPMorgan had said that Bruce Kasman remained its chief economist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Malpass and Ryding have been with Bear since the early 1990s. In 2001, Malpass was named the firm's chief global economist and Ryding chief market economist, after the retirement of then-Chief Economist Wayne Angell, a former Federal Reserve Governor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before joining Bear, Malpass held a series of top economic positions in the Reagan and Bush administrations, while Ryding was an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and the Bank of England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, Bear Stearns BSC.N shareholders approved a plan to sell the company to JPMorgan (JPM.N) for less than $10 a share. The deal is expected to close on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roughly 6,500 of the 14,000 Bear Stearns' employees are expected to join J.P. Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In March, Bear, which had been the No. 5 U.S. investment bank, was at the brink of collapse due to hefty losses tied to exposure to bad mortgage loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Ryding's no comment, paragraph 3)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Richard Leong&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK May 30 (Reuters) - Bear Stearns' two top
economists, David Malpass and John Ryding, will not join
JPMorgan Chase  Co, which is set to close its purchase of
Bear, a source familiar with the situation said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was not known whether Malpass and Ryding have accepted
positions at another company, according to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Malpass and Ryding declined to comment. JPMorgan also
declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, JPMorgan had said that Bruce Kasman remained its
chief economist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Malpass and Ryding have been with Bear since the early
1990s. In 2001, Malpass was named the firm's chief global
economist and Ryding chief market economist, after the
retirement of then-Chief Economist Wayne Angell, a former
Federal Reserve Governor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before joining Bear, Malpass held a series of top economic
positions in the Reagan and Bush administrations, while Ryding
was an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and
the Bank of England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, Bear Stearns BSC.N shareholders approved a
plan to sell the company to JPMorgan (JPM.N) for less than $10
a share. The deal is expected to close on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roughly 6,500 of the 14,000 Bear Stearns' employees are
expected to join J.P. Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, Bear, which had been the No. 5 U.S. investment
bank, was at the brink of collapse due to hefty losses tied to
exposure to bad mortgage loans.

&lt;p&gt;NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico (Reuters) - U.S. customs officials have seized a statue of Jesus Christ made from plaster mixed with cocaine -- the latest sophisticated attempt to smuggle drugs from Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sniffer dogs at the border crossing in Laredo, Texas, alerted officials to the smell of narcotics in the 6.6 pound (3 kilo) statue, which was in the trunk of a car being driven by a Mexican woman into the United States last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The statue tested positive for cocaine," Nancy Herrera, an official at the U.S. Attorney's Office Southern District of Texas said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. border police arrested a 61-year-old Mexican man accused of offering the woman $80 to carry the statue to the bus station in downtown Laredo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The woman escaped back to Mexico, Herrera said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tighter U.S. security and Mexico's deployment of thousands of soldiers along the border are pushing smugglers to try increasingly sophisticated techniques like hiding drugs in sealed beer cans, U.S. officials say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average price of a gram of pure cocaine in the United States is around $130, according to U.S. government data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Robin Emmott)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Figures in U.S. dollars)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta May 30 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N)
has canceled the planned sale of its gas storage operations in
British Columbia, saying on Friday that bids came in shy of
what the company believes the business is worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the No. 2 U.S. oil company, said it received a
number of offers for its Aitken Creek storage facility since it
put the business on the block in November. However none was
rich enough to convince the firm to part with the operation and
the company canceled the sale last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had multiple bids and significant interest, but none
that met our expectations," said Leif Sollid, a spokesman for
the company. "So we're not looking to sell it at this time. It
is still a valuable asset to us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some reports had pegged the value of the operation at more
than $1 billion, though Chevron has not said how much it
believes it is worth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aitken Creek is the largest gas storage facility in British
Columbia and connected to Spectra Energy Corp's (SE.N) pipeline
to British Columbia and U.S. Pacific Northwest markets, and to
the Alliance pipeline to the U.S. Midwest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The facility has the capacity to hold 71 billion cubic feet
of gas, and some reports have indicated that it could be
potentially expanded to hold as much as 118 bcf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the sale was announced, northeastern British Columbia
has become one of the hottest gas-exploration regions on the
continent, after producers announced massive unconventional gas
discoveries trapped in the shale of the Horn River area.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States pressed Israel on Friday to let seven Gaza Strip Palestinians travel to the United States to study on coveted U.S. government Fulbright fellowships and Israel said it was working on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Israel tightened its cordon of the Gaza Strip after the Hamas Islamist group took over the  coastal Mediterranean territory nearly a year ago and it gives few Palestinians, besides some who are gravely ill, permission to leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. State Department this week told the seven that their Fulbright grants had been withdrawn and it has taken steps to be able to direct the money to other Palestinians in the West Bank because of the trouble getting the exit visas from Gaza.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, after The New York Times published a report on the issue on Friday, U.S. officials said they were redoubling their efforts to get the Israeli exit visas for the students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs William Burns, the third-ranking U.S. diplomat, spoke to the Israeli ambassador to the United States on Friday to emphasize the U.S. desire to see the matter resolved, the State Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Frankly, a decision to let people that have been vetted for what is perhaps the most prestigious foreign educational program run by the United States ... it ought to be falling off a log for them to be able to do this," said U.S. State Department spokesman Tom Casey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I expect that we'll have some positive outcome for this in the not-too-distant future," he told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesman Arye Mekel said a few of the Fulbright students had recently left Gaza through the Erez crossing but Casey said he could not verify this. It was not immediately possible obtain independent confirmation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're trying to get them out," Mekel said. "Obviously the situation, with Hamas shooting at the border crossings, it is not such an easy thing to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are regular rocket attacks from Gaza into Israel and the Israeli government argues that its travel restrictions are designed to prevent suicide bombings or other attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRESTIGIOUS AWARDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department spokesman said the money for the Gaza residents had not been given to other students and that if the seven received their exit visas, they would be given the Fulbright fellowships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top U.S. officials appeared to have been taken by surprise by the incident and embarrassed that their initial efforts to get Israel to allow the students to leave had not worked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice suggested she disapproved of the move to reallocate the money for the seven Gaza students, who hope to pursue advanced degrees at American institutions in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a surprise to me and I am definitely going to look into it," Rice said at a news conference with Iceland's Foreign Minister Ingibjorg Gisladottir in Reykjavik. "I am a huge supporter of Fulbrights."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fulbright grants are the U.S. flagship program in international educational exchange and are used to help promote a better understanding of U.S. values abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rice is expected to return to the Middle East next month to continue the Bush administration's uphill push to broker an Israeli-Palestinian peace deal by the end of the year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has taken the following rating actions on the
mezzanine/subordinate bonds in the J.P. Morgan transactions listed
below:

   --J.P. Morgan Alternative Loan Trust 2006-A1 Pool 1

   --J.P. Morgan Alternative Loan Trust 2006-A1 Pools 2-5

in question is available on the Fitch Ratings web site at
www.fitchratings.com under the following headers:

   Structured Finance then RMBS then Research Highlights

   The rating actions taken today reflect Fitch's analysis of
expected default and loss from delinquent loans, in addition to
projected losses from the currently performing pool. Fitch generates
its expectations using its ResiLogic default and loss model. These
expectations are adjusted based on actual performance to-date versus
model projected performance. The model incorporates the impact of
historical home price movements on mortgage performance, in addition
to projecting further stress for many regions of the U.S. The model
also reflects the demonstrated high default rates for loans that
exhibit risk-layering.

   The details of the application of ResiLogic to seasoned mortgage
pools, and the specific assumptions used for the Alt-A review, will be
described in research to be released shortly.

   Fitch is completing its review of the 2005-2007 Alt-A transactions
in two separate phases. The first phase will be a review of all
mezzanine and subordinated bonds, which are more immediately exposed
to delinquency losses. This phase is currently nearing completion. The
second phase, which will begin shortly, will be a review of all the
senior bonds that, in many instances, require additional cash flow
analysis to evaluate the risk of the various individual classes within
the senior tranche. Most notably, the use of super-senior structures
will be considered in evaluating senior bonds.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;May 30 (Reuters) - JP Morgan upgraded Citi Trends Inc
(CTRN.O) and raised its 2008 and 2009 earnings estimates as the
brokerage expects the family apparel retailer's lean
inventories to protect margins and comparable store sales
trends to improve, sending its shares up as much as 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Evren Dogan Kopelman upgraded the stock to
"overweight" from "neutral" and raised the 2008 earnings
estimate to $1.14 a share from $1.12. The analyst also raised
2009 earnings estimates to $1.34 a share from $1.32 a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kopelman expects the company's 2008 comparable store sales
to increase 2 percent to 3 percent, boosted by improved fashion
trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stimulus checks should also help Citi Trends as its
customers tend to spend more of their discretionary income on
apparel, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the Savannah, Georgia-based company rose to a
high of $21.83 before paring some of their gains to trade up
$2.40 at $21.65 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;CARLSBAD, California (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) seem to hang out in all the same places but somehow keep missing each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's turned speculation over what it will take to get the two of them together into something of a CEO parlor game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media magnate Rupert Murdoch said this week he is "mystified" the two have not come to terms. E-commerce mogul Barry Diller said Microsoft should never have fired a hostile shot at Yahoo if they didn't plan to stick it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo board member Bobby Kotick joked that he had tried to get top executives from Microsoft and Yahoo together to play Guitar Hero 4, the hit video game from the company he runs, Activision Inc (ATVI.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In separate appearances at the D: Conference this week, the top executives of Microsoft and Yahoo said no progress had been made on a merger, though they were discussing lesser deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two had held abortive takeover talks over a three-month period that ended May 3, Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft walked away from a proposal to buy Yahoo for $47.5 billion, or $33 a share, after Yahoo rebuffed it, saying it wanted $37 a share. Then in mid-May, the companies said they had begun talks on an unspecified deal short of a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Yahoo's co-founder and chief executive, Jerry Yang, threw cold water on speculation that they might be edging back into merger discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is no longer interested in buying the company, and we are talking about other things. We definitely have to understand what they're proposing ... they clearly have an interest in Yahoo, and we need to understand more," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In an on-stage interview at the conference, Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said talks had broken down largely over price. Appearing with Yang, Yahoo President Susan Decker agreed price had always been the biggest barrier to reaching a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diller, who runs the company behind rival Ask.com (IACI.O), believes a merger of Microsoft and Yahoo is necessary to gain the scale to take on Google in Web search and advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diller expressed surprise at Microsoft's decision to withdraw its offer and "move on" after pursuing Yahoo at regular intervals over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems to me if you fire a gun in a hostile offer, the bullet has to land in the heart," he said in his own on-stage appearance at the conference on Wednesday. "Otherwise, I can't imagining firing at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murdoch agreed, saying that given the original 62 percent premium Microsoft was willing to pay for Yahoo, Ballmer should be more patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You aim the gun and you fire," Murdoch said, echoing Diller. "They are not used to big deals, so they backed off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N has gotten nowhere in its own efforts to talk to both sides in recent months about alternative deal arrangements involving his MySpace Web business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wily 77-year-old deal-maker ruled out prospects for an alternative deal between Yahoo and Google Inc (GOOG.O) to succeed, saying regulatory issues would likely derail it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And he dismissed activist investor Carl Icahn's campaign to replace the Yahoo board in a proxy fight at the company's July annual shareholder meeting as "helpful noise" to Microsoft and a threat that Yahoo shouldn't bother worrying about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That is not serious," Murdoch said of Icahn. "Look, he wants to make a few hundred-million dollars for himself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Murdoch's conclusion is that Microsoft and Yahoo need to lock themselves in a room and put their last respective offers on the table and settle on a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Speaking as if he were one of the negotiators, Murdoch said "Look, if it is complicated, we will clean it up afterward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anticipating the flood of free advice from other executives, Yahoo made up its own joke video in which Yang and Decker are seen being inundated with unsolicited advice from top technology industry CEOs, investors and media pundits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warren Buffett's advice to Yang?

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM) today introduced new industry workshops, expanded solution
centers and business partner resources to help clients plan and execute
enterprise-wide information on demand strategies that will allow them to use
information to innovate, compete and grow their businesses.

    The new offerings unveiled today are derived from a powerful combination
ofmarket leadership, technical know-how and industry expertise developed in
hundreds of software, IT services and consulting engagements.  They are
designed to help clients address industry-specific business needs such as
customer loyalty, globalization, mergers and acquisitions, cost efficiency and
risk
and compliance, and to accelerate their business optimization efforts.

    "Organizations today face business challenges that require more effective
use of
information," said Ambuj Goyal, general manager, IBM Information Management. "To
succeed, they must make information a strategic asset before they can begin
optimizing their business for competitive advantage. IBM's approach to
delivering
Information on Demand helps organization unlock the business value of their
information and brings value to organizations of all sizes."

    The industry workshops are designed to enable organizations to jumpstart the
development of a personalized "Information Agenda," a comprehensive,
enterprise-wide plan that helps them achieve both short-term and long-term
strategic changes. The goal is to transform the organization and unlock the
business value of information for competitive advantage, enabling
organizations to deliver trusted, accurate information to optimize business
performance.

    IBM is already working with retailers to establish an Information Agenda
that
will address their need for better integrated, dynamic merchandising and supply
chains
driven by consumer insights.  Similarly, IBM also is helping
telecommunications service providers create a strategic roadmap for the use
of information to provide targeted services to clients while managing line of
business convergence in a market that is going through numerous consolidations.

    IBM today also announced the expansion of the IBM Solutions Centers in
Barcelona, Spain; La Gaude, France; Rome, Italy and Bangalore, India to
showcase industry-specific Information on Demand solutions that clients
canuse to address their growing information management challenges.

    For example, the solution center in Barcelona has been extended to help
banking and financial services organizations learn how to improve
financialrisk insight and deliver enhanced customer care through the use of
Cognos, InfoSphere software and other Information on Demand offerings.  The
solutions center at La Gaude is now providing government and law enforcement
agencies with the ability to see the value of IBM's proven Real-Time Crime
Center solution, and helping telecommunications service providers get more
insight
into how they can enhance the customer experience, improve operational
efficiencyand address convergence and consolidation challenges. Industry
solutions that use
IBM's Information on Demand capabilities will also soon be accessible from
the IBM Solution Center in Rome, Italy.

    The new Information on Demand Technical Center of Excellence in Bangalore,
India
joins two other Centers recently opened in Germany and Japan. The Centers
enable clients to work with local technical and industry experts to promote
more successful IT projects, and deliver better access to information within
their organizations.

    Information on Demand Business Partners Accredited

    With rising demand for information management projects for business
intelligence,
data warehousing, information integration, master data management and
enterprise content management, organizations are increasingly relying upon
IBM Business Partners to help them get more value out of their business
information. Last fall, IBM responded to this need with the Information on
Demand Specialty Program, which combined with the Information on Demand
Community Program now consists of more than 2,200 partner members.

    Several IBM Business Partners have recently qualified for the IBM
Information
on Demand Specialty Program designed to provide accreditation of partners across
multiple IBM Information on Demand product offerings. Among these partners are
Fourth Millenium Technologies, Highweb &amp; Page Group, Novell, Triton
Consulting, and xkoto.

    In the areas of content and discovery, two partners -- McLaren Software
andThunderhead -- have qualified for the Information on Demand Specialty
program. 
McLaren was recognized for its successful delivery of Enterprise Engineer, a
suite
of applications for managing engineering documentation and associated business
processes on the IBM FileNet P8 content management platform, Thunderhead was
certified for its XML-based solution for multi-channel document composition,
which is integrated with the IBM suite of content management and business
process management products. In addition, Alpine Consulting and independent
software vendor Telesis Global Solutions have been recognized for their
offerings around a variety of IBM Information Management products.

    These and other new industry-specific capabilities to provide clients better
insight from their data, improved decision-making and optimized business
performance will be unveiled at the Information on Demand EMEA
Conference, June 2-6, 2008, the Hague, Netherlands.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats story from late on Thursday)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Eric Auchard&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARLSBAD, Calif. May 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) seem to hang out in all the
same places but somehow keep missing each other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That's turned speculation over what it will take to get the

"mystified" the two have not come to terms. E-commerce mogul
Barry Diller said Microsoft should never have fired a hostile
shot at Yahoo if they didn't plan to stick it out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo board member Bobby Kotick joked that he had tried to
get top executives from Microsoft and Yahoo together to play
Guitar Hero 4, the hit video game from the company he runs,
Activision Inc (ATVI.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In separate appearances at the D: Conference this week, the
top executives of Microsoft and Yahoo said no progress had been
made on a merger, though they were discussing lesser deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two had held abortive takeover talks over a three-month
period that ended May 3, Yahoo Chairman Roy Bostock has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft walked away from a proposal to buy Yahoo for
$47.5 billion, or $33 a share, after Yahoo rebuffed it, saying
it wanted $37 a share. Then in mid-May, the companies said they
had begun talks on an unspecified deal short of a merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, Yahoo's co-founder and chief executive, Jerry
Yang, threw cold water on speculation that they might be edging
back into merger discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft is no longer interested in buying the company,

price. Appearing with Yang, Yahoo President Susan Decker agreed
price had always been the biggest barrier to reaching a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diller, who runs the company behind rival Ask.com (IACI.O),
believes a merger of Microsoft and Yahoo is necessary to gain
the scale to take on Google in Web search and advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Diller expressed surprise at Microsoft's decision to
withdraw its offer and "move on" after pursuing Yahoo at
regular intervals over the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It seems to me if you fire a gun in a hostile offer, the
bullet has to land in the heart," he said in his own on-stage
appearance at the conference on Wednesday. "Otherwise, I can't

Diller. "They are not used to big deals, so they backed off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Murdoch's News Corp NWSa.N has gotten nowhere in its own
efforts to talk to both sides in recent months about
alternative deal arrangements involving his MySpace Web
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wily 77-year-old deal-maker ruled out prospects for an
alternative deal between Yahoo and Google Inc (GOOG.O) to
succeed, saying regulatory issues would likely derail it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And he dismissed activist investor Carl Icahn's campaign to
replace the Yahoo board in a proxy fight at the company's July
annual shareholder meeting as "helpful noise" to Microsoft and
a threat that Yahoo shouldn't bother worrying about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That is not serious," Murdoch said of Icahn. "Look, he

"Look, if it is complicated, we will clean it up afterward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anticipating the flood of free advice from other
executives, Yahoo made up its own joke video in which Yang and
Decker are seen being inundated with unsolicited advice from
top technology industry CEOs, investors and media pundits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Warren Buffett's advice to Yang? "Buy low, sell high."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, May 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
 IBM (NYSE: IBM)

    -- $4.50 per gallon gas is driver "break point"

    -- 35% have cancelled a vacation trip in the last month due to anticipated
traffic

    -- 63% say traffic has gotten worse

    -- 27% have "turned around and gone home"

    -- Los Angeles drivers experience the most pain, Minneapolis drivers the
least

    The first IBM Commuter Pain Survey released today shows a substantial number
of
drivers in U.S. metropolitan areas are fed up with longer commutes, higher fuel
prices and increased pollution and are seeking to reduce the daily toll on
their emotional well-being and wallets.

    The survey of 4,000 drivers in 10 U.S. cities, conducted by IBM's
Institutefor Electronic Government, revealed that $4.50 per gallon of gas is the
break
point at which many drivers will seek alternatives to driving; and overall
findings showed that commuter pain is highest in Los Angeles and lowest in
Minneapolis.

    Analysis of the commuter responses indicated that a substantial percentage
of daily
commuters in New York, Boston, Washington, D.C., Atlanta, Miami/Ft. Lauderdale,
Chicago, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Dallas/Fort Worth, Los Angeles, and San
Francisco are seeking transportation alternatives via more flexible working
hours, better mass transit and other commuting solutions.

    "Traffic is choking our cities and our economy, causing a significant drag
on
productivity and reduced quality of life," said John Nyland, Managing Partner,
IBM
Public Sector, and responsible for the company's Intelligent Transportation
initiatives. "To reverse this trend, we need a systemic approach that
incorporates
everything from new congestion management technologies to effective work-at-home
programs that can ultimately improve environmental and economic conditions in
our
cities."

    "These new insights from U.S. commuters highlight the urgent need for the
use
of technology and creative policies to reduce congestion on our community
roadways," says Scott Belcher, President and CEO of Intelligent Transportation
Society of America.  "We believe relief is in sight for those cities that
implement congestion fighting programs that combine technology, tolling, and
public transportation."

    IBM Commuter Pain Survey -- Key Findings

    Analysis of the survey results indicated a number of key findings related to
how
traffic impacts commuters:

    -- 25% will reconsider driving if fuel prices near $4.00 per gallon (and
46%,
if prices near $4.50).  Looking for new options to driving is occurring
fastest in Atlanta, Dallas and Minneapolis, and slowest in San Francisco.

    -- 19% say traffic has negatively impacted work or school performance, and
that reaches 27% in Los Angeles (the highest).

    -- 45% report increased stress (above 50% in Dallas, Los Angeles and Miami),
and 28% reported increased anger (36% in Los Angeles, the highest).

    -- 12% report less sleep (18% in Los Angeles, the highest).

    -- 63% say traffic has gotten worse in the last three years, and 24% think
it
has gotten much worse.

    -- If commuting time could be reduced, 43% would spend more time with
family/friends, 34% would enjoy recreation, 31% would exercise, 31% would sleep
more, and 9% would work more.

    -- 30% say they want the option to work from home.  (42% report that they
can
work from home now one or more days per week.)

    -- 27% report that roadway traffic has been so bad within the last three
years
that they turned around and went home.  This figure is highest in Miami
(33%) and Los Angeles (32%).

    -- 35% decided not to make a driving trip in the last month due to
anticipated traffic. (46% in Los Angeles, the highest.)

    IBM Commuter Pain Index

    IBM has compiled the results of the survey into an Index that ranks the
emotional and economic toll of commuting in each city on a scale of one to
10, with 10 being the most onerous.

    The Commuter Pain Survey was conducted by IBM to better understand
consumerthinking toward traffic congestion as the issue reaches crisis
proportions
nationwide, the price of gas continues to rise without letup and higher levels
of auto emissions stir environmental concerns. These events are impacting
communities in the U.S. and abroad, where governments, citizens and private
sector
organizations are looking beyond traditional remedies like additional roads and
greater access to public transportation to reverse the negative impacts of
increased road congestion.

    "Transportation congestion is one of the single largest threats to U.S.
economic prosperity, and the problem reaches to cities around the world," said
Gerry Mooney, IBM General Manager, Global Government.  "Less traffic is
certainly
more convenient for citizens, but it is also a key factor in how cities
improve economic competitiveness by fostering greater access to goods,
increasing business investments and expanding the ability for communities to
develop highly-skilled workforces."

    IBM is actively working in the area of 'intelligent transportation' using
ateam of 150 scientists and a group of IT services professionals to research,
test and deploy new traffic information management capabilities in cities such
as
Brisbane, London, Singapore and Stockholm.  Findings from the Commuter Pain
Survey will be used to assess citizen concerns about traffic and commuter
issues; expand solutions like automated tolling, real-time traffic prediction,
congestion charging, and intelligent route planning; and serve as a basis for
pioneering innovative new approaches to traffic mitigation.

    IBM's Institute for Electronic Government has compiled the survey findings
into a
report, which also details how the Commuter Pain Index was determined. It is
available by visiting

    Founded in 1996, IBM's Institute for Electronic Government is a research
organization based in Washington, DC that focuses on timely government topics,
specifically those related to technology in the context of benefits to citizens,
the economy and society.

    IBM Commuter Pain Index

    IBM has compiled the results of the survey into an Index that ranks the
emotional and economic toll of commuting in each city on a scale of one to
10, with 10 being the most onerous.

    The Commuter Pain Survey was conducted by IBM to better understand
consumerthinking toward traffic congestion as the issue reaches crisis
proportions
nationwide, the price of gas continues to rise without letup and higher levels
of auto emissions stir environmental concerns. These events are impacting
communities in the U.S. and abroad, where governments, citizens and private
sector
organizations are looking beyond traditional remedies like additional roads and
greater access to public transportation to reverse the negative impacts of
increased road congestion.

    "Transportation congestion is one of the single largest threats to U.S.
economic prosperity, and the problem reaches to cities around the world," said
Gerry Mooney, IBM General Manager, Global Government.  "Less traffic is
certainly
more convenient for citizens, but it is also a key factor in how cities
improve economic competitiveness by fostering greater access to goods,
increasing business investments and expanding the ability for communities to
develop highly-skilled workforces."

    IBM is actively working in the area of 'intelligent transportation' using
ateam of 150 scientists and a group of IT services professionals to research,
test and deploy new traffic information management capabilities in cities such
as
Brisbane, London, Singapore and Stockholm.  Findings from the Commuter Pain
Survey will be used to assess citizen concerns about traffic and commuter
issues; expand solutions like automated tolling, real-time traffic prediction,
congestion charging, and intelligent route planning; and serve as a basis for
pioneering innovative new approaches to traffic mitigation.

    IBM's Institute for Electronic Government has compiled the survey findings
into a
report, which also details how the Commuter Pain Index was determined. It is
available by visiting

organization based in Washington, DC that focuses on timely government topics,
specifically those related to technology in the context of benefits to citizens,
the economy and society.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON--(Business Wire)--
An effective motion sickness pill which has been developed
specifically to prevent travel sickness in dogs is now available to
owners from their veterinarian. The newly available tablet means that
thousands of families will be able to take their pet on journeys in
the car, or even on a boat, without the worry and mess of motion
sickness.

   Market research conducted among European dog owners in February
this year revealed that about 1 in 3 dogs that travel suffer from
motion sickness of some kind (1). Nearly half (47%) of dog owners said
they would travel more with their pet if it didn't suffer. This common
problem is distressing for the dog and can make owners feel that they
are missing out on the pleasures of travelling with their pet.

   Unlike some other remedies, the new option does not work by
sedating the dog, so the animal remains alert during the journey and
arrives at the destination ready to interact with its owner. The new
tablet will give dog owners the freedom to travel with their pet for
the day - so they can enjoy a long, relaxing day out without having to
remember to give another dose.

   In the past, owners have had to rely primarily on veterinary
sedatives and drugs developed for use in humans, or unproven products
bought over the counter. The survey showed a high level of
dissatisfaction with current therapies, with owners having tried an
average of 3.9 different products each in an attempt to deal with the
problem.

   Although vomiting is the most obvious sign that a dog is suffering
from motion sickness, if it starts to show any of the following signs
when it's in the car, then it may be suffering the early effects of
seasickness:

   --  Hypersalivation/drooling

   --  Panting/sweating/licking its lips

   --  Restless/anxious behaviour, trembling

   --  Retching

   As well as the motion sickness pill designed specifically for
dogs, owners may also be interested in a new website where they can
get advice about this common problem, including tips on how to deal
with it. Visit www.dogcarsickness.com. For more information about
travel sickness in dogs, owners should consult their veterinarian.

&lt;p&gt; (Writes through, adds details, quote, shares)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI May 30 (Reuters) - Shares in Finnish department
store group Stockmann Oyj (STCBV.HE) fell on Friday after
Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to "sell", citing
uncertainties in its Russian operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In our view, its current valuation does not discount the
riskier and slower than expected expansion in Russia," Goldman
analysts said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Stockmann were 2.1 percent lower at 24.58 euros by
0713 GMT, compared with firmer Helsinki bourse general index
.OMXHPI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman cut its target price for the share to 21.50 euros
from 30 euros, while slashing earnings estimates for the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stockmann said earlier this week it would take a one-off hit
of 14 million euros ($22 million) in its second-quarter earnings
due to the possible closure of one of its department stores in
Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stockmann closed one of its Moscow department stores earlier
in May after lessors cut off the electricity supply following a
court decision over a rental agreement which favoured Stockmann.

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney is getting into 
the graphic novel business with a plan to adapt the works into 
movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Walt Disney Studios has created Kingdom Comics, and signed 
a multiyear deal with writer-actor Ahmet Zappa, TV executive 
Harris Katleman and writer-editor Christian Beranek to oversee 
the division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The aim is to create titles that will be the basis of new 
film projects for the studio as well as to reimagine and 
rejuvenate movies from Disney's library of live-action films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No writers or artists have been announced, though the trio 
is on the hunt for new and established talent to create the 
books. Kingdom, which will be located on the Disney lot, has a 
first-look deal with Disney Publishing Worldwide to distribute 
the publications. If Disney chooses not to publish a book, 
Kingdom will explore other venues. Also, there is no set number 
of graphic novels that are mandated to be published per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The studio will pluck titles, putting them into development 
on a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The creation of Kingdom Comics positions the studio as a 
player in the scorching comic book scene. Many studios have 
aligned themselves to the big companies -- Warner Bros. owns DC 
Comics, Marvel has a distribution deal with Paramount, 
Universal has a first-look deal with Dark Horse Comics -- 
leaving very few players up for grabs. It also will put the 
company in business with established and untapped talent in 
what essentially will be a RD division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Zappa, the younger son of late musician Frank Zappa, sold 
the rights to his first novel, "The Monstrous Memoirs of a 
Mighty McFearless," to Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer Films in 
2006. He is writing the second installment in that series and 
is executive producing a feature version of "Fraggle Rock" with 
the Jim Henson Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Katleman, a former president and CEO of 20th Century Fox 
Television, working on such syndicated shows as "House Calls" 
and "Dirty Rotten Cheater." Beranek formed his own publishing 
company, Silent Devil, in 1996, producing such titles as 
"Dracula vs. King Arthur" and "Super Frat."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co said on Saturday it completed its $1.4 billion Bear Stearns Cos takeover, capping the demise of a Wall Street firm that survived the Depression and numerous slumps in its 85 years but could not navigate the mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Weakened by its massive exposure to mortgage markets and the embarrassing blow-up of two of its hedge funds, Bear was driven to the brink of bankruptcy in March by traders who&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;drained about $17 billion of the firm's cash in a matter of days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal officials, worried a Bear bankruptcy would drag the rest of the markets down with it, strong-armed the bank to accept JPMorgan's $2-a-share offer, backed by a Federal Reserve bailout of $30 billion in Bear assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A week later JPMorgan raised its offer five-fold to 0.21753 of a share for each Bear share. Based on JPMorgan's current market price of $43, that bid valued Bear at $9.35 a share, well below the $57 those shares fetched before traders began their run on Bear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In exchange for the higher price, Bear had to sell a 39.9 percent stake to JPMorgan. Combined with other purchases, JPMorgan amassed a controlling 49.5 percent stake and effectively locked up Bear for good.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, JPMorgan, which under CEO Jamie Dimon largely steered clear of credit losses that hobbled its rivals last year, has been sorting through Bear's people and assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a fire-sale price, JPMorgan will gain a new headquarters tower in Midtown Manhattan, some of Wall Street's largest clearing, prime brokerage and energy trading arms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear's name will survive on Wall Street through its retail brokerage business, which Morgan is keeping.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal dealt a crushing blow to Bear employees, who collectively held 33 percent of the firm's stock and saw billions of dollars in their personal wealth wiped out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Only 6,500 staffers were offered jobs, casting about 7,000 analysts, bankers and traders into the streets at a time when the rest of Wall Street is shrinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan now faces many significant and some unknown risks. Dimon disclosed this month that the cost of shedding Bear assets, litigation expenses and other merger-related costs would soar to $9 billion from an earlier rough guess of $6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a result, JPMorgan expected to record a second-quarter gain of $1 billion, though it is expanding during a period that Dimon worries could be a prolonged recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bear Stearns' two top economists, 
David Malpass and John Ryding, will not join JPMorgan Chase  
Co, which is set to close its purchase of Bear, a source 
familiar with the situation said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It was not known whether Malpass and Ryding have accepted 
positions at another company, according to the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Malpass and Ryding declined to comment. JPMorgan also 
declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, JPMorgan had said that Bruce Kasman remained its 
chief economist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Malpass and Ryding have been with Bear since the early 
1990s. In 2001, Malpass was named the firm's chief global 
economist and Ryding chief market economist, after the 
retirement of then-Chief Economist Wayne Angell, a former 
Federal Reserve Governor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before joining Bear, Malpass held a series of top economic 
positions in the Reagan and Bush administrations, while Ryding 
was an economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and 
the Bank of England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, Bear Stearns BSC.N shareholders approved a 
plan to sell the company to JPMorgan (JPM.N) for less than $10 
a share. The deal is expected to close on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roughly 6,500 of the 14,000 Bear Stearns' employees are 
expected to join J.P. Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In March, Bear, which had been the No. 5 U.S. investment 
bank, was at the brink of collapse due to hefty losses tied to 
exposure to bad mortgage loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Dan Grebler)&lt;/p&gt;
