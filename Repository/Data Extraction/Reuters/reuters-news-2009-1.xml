&lt;p&gt;In a statement on the Zune website posted late on Wednesday, the company blamed "a bug in the internal clock driver related to the way the device handles a leap year," adding: "The issue should be resolved over the next 24 hours as the time change moves to January 1, 2009."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The year 2008 had 366 days instead of the usual 365.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early on Wednesday, thousands of users found they could not use the 30-gigabyte Zune model, made in 2006.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
The New Year's parties are over, but the likes of Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and
PepsiCo (NYSE: PEP) have already begun to turn their attention to the upcoming
Super Bowl parties, where their products will be sitting front and center once
again. Despite the lackluster economic environment, everyone knows that a party
isn't a party without chips and soda. 

Yet, despite this widely known premise, traders have not been kind to the
beverage kings. The Coca-Cola Company remains the world's No. 1 soft drink
company, with 4 of the top 5 soft-drink brands (Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Fanta, and
Sprite). Its other brands include Barq's, Minute Maid, POWERade, and Dasani
water. In North America, it sells Groupe Danone's Evian. Coca-Cola sells brands
from Dr Pepper Snapple Group (Crush, Dr Pepper, and Schweppes) outside
Australia, Europe, and North America. In fact, the firm makes or licenses more
than 400 drink products in more than 200 nations.

&lt;p&gt; SINGAPORE, Jan 6 (Reuters) - Shares of Yanlord Land
(YNLG.SI) rose as much as 8.8 percent on Tuesday after Goldman
Sachs upgraded the property firm to "buy" from its previous
"neutral" rating, citing a healthy financial position and
attractive valuation.

 "We expect its gross margin to remain at over 50 percent in
the coming two years, thanks to its high-margin Shanghai
Yanlord Riverside City Ph III project," said Goldman Sachs said
in a client note on China real estate developers on Tuesday.

 Goldman said Yanlord's current valuation suggests a 50-60
percent decline in property prices in its key Chinese markets
including Shanghai, which the U.S. bank said was unlikely.

 Shares of Hong Kong property counters also rose sharply on
Tuesday after recent land registry data showed a significant
improvement in December 2008 home sales as compared with the
previous month. [ID:nHKG315930]

 Yanlord has gained around 17 percent so far this year after
its shares slumped 73 percent in 2008, underperforming the
benchmark Straits Times Index, which fell by almost half.

 By 0350 GMT, Yanlord was up 2.9 percent to S$1.05, while
Singapore's top property firm CapitaLand (CATL.SI) was down 5.9
percent.

 The benchmark Straits Times Index was down 0.73 percent.

on Monday it has promoted longtime executive Bob Muglia to

to the company's growth, Chief Executive Steve Ballmer said in a
memo to employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As senior vice president, Muglia helped build Microsoft's
server and tools business from "virtually nothing a decade ago" to
worth more than $13 billion last year, Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The server and tools business, which makes it money mostly
from Windows server operating systems and related services, now

About VBLOC Therapy 

EnteroMedics developed VBLOC vagal blocking therapy to offer bariatric surgeons
and their patients a less invasive alternative to existing surgical weight loss
procedures that may present significant risks and alter digestive system
anatomy, lifestyle and food choices. VBLOC Therapy is delivered via the Maestro
System through laparoscopically implanted leads to intermittently block the
vagus nerves using high-frequency, low energy electrical impulses. VBLOC Therapy
is designed to target the multiple digestive functions under control of the
vagus nerves and to affect the perception of hunger and fullness. Preliminary
results from the feasibility study conducted outside the U.S., which includes 33
patients, indicate that the Maestro System may provide durable and ongoing
weight-loss for people with obesity. Follow up data show excess weight loss, or
EWL, of 29.1% in 12 patients at 12 months of VBLOC Therapy, 27.4% in 17 patients
at nine months of therapy and 21.4% in 28 patients at six months of therapy. 

About EnteroMedics Inc. 

EnteroMedics is a development stage medical device company focused on the design
and development of devices that use neuroblocking technology to treat obesity
and other gastrointestinal disorders. EnteroMedics' proprietary neuroblocking
technology, VBLOC vagal blocking therapy, is designed to intermittently block
the vagus nerves using high-frequency, low-energy, electrical impulses.
EnteroMedics has met its enrollment goal under an FDA-approved investigational
device exemption (IDE) for the EMPOWER Study using the Maestro System, its
initial product for the treatment of obesity. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;  BANGALORE, INDIA, Jan 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has signed a US$5 million IT
services agreement with Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited (Kotak) -- one of
India's leading banking &amp; financial services providers. IBM will design,
build and maintain a highly scalable, energy-efficient green data center
as well as the converged IP network infrastructure for the client. The
solution being implemented by IBM will also help Kotak save over US$1.2
million in operational efficiency and reduced energy costs over the next
five years. This implementation will help Kotak move towards a shared
technology infrastructure services model across all its businesses. Kotak
Mahindra Bank and all the group companies, including Kotak Securities and
Kotak Life Insurance, will benefit from this consolidated data center and
network infrastructure.

    Vikram Sud, Group COO, Kotak Mahindra Bank Limited, speaking about the
shared Data Center implementation, said, "In our aspiration towards
building a world class, integrated banking and financial services
institution, we are rolling out several initiatives which include a shared
services utility model to leverage economies of scale and adopting more
environmentally friendly processes including the reuse of materials, waste
recycling and using renewable energy sources."

&amp; General Manager, Global Technology Services, IBM India/S Asia, said,
"IBM is committed to helping clients bring greater efficiency in their
operations by deploying solutions that can highly optimize their IT and
hence reduce costs. IBM has a unique value proposition to offer to clients
in these difficult times and we are excited about this partnership with
Kotak Mahindra Bank."

    The two agreements, signed in September and October 2008, will help Kotak
further strengthen its position as one of the leading banking and
financial services provider in India. The 7,000 sq ft raised floor data
center being deployed for Kotak is one of the most energy-efficient in
the country and uses a chilled water-based cooling and an automatic floor
pressurization system.

    To bring greater value to its customers, Kotak has been relying on
best-in-class technology solutions. They wanted to put in place a robust
network infrastructure and consolidate its distributed server rooms into
one centralized data center which is green and can scale up to the growing
needs of its group companies. The solution designed by IBM offers 100
percent concurrent maintainability in its power and cooling design and an
optimal uninterruptible power supply (UPS) configuration for energy
efficiency. IBM will also be deploying a new-generation switching
technology and IP convergence solution for over 3,000 users.

    IBM continues to command a strong leadership in the data center space and
has built over 300,000 sq ft raised floor of data center space in the
country. The company has already deployed green data centers for over a
dozen clients in the country.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ISIS) as Bull of
the Day and LeapFrog Enterprises (NYSE: LF) as Bear of the Day. In addition, the
analysts at Zacks Equity Research discuss the latest on Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:
JNJ), Exxon-Mobil (NYSE: XOM) and iPass Inc. (Nasdaq: IPAS). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: ISIS) is a drug discovery and development
company focused on the therapeutic target RNA and developing products from
RNA-based technologies, such as "antisense." We believe that antisense
technology represents an exciting and potentially revolutionary platform for
developing therapeutic candidates to treat a wide margin of diseases. 

The company`s leading candidates are mipomersen for high cholesterol and
ISIS-113715 for diabetes, along with several other proprietary and partnered
programs for oncology, inflammatory disease, asthma, and viral infections. Our
financial model forecasts sustained profitability in 2011. 

We are reiterating or rating on Isis Pharmaceuticals of a Buy and maintaining
our price target of $22. 

Bear of the Day

Headquartered in California, LeapFrog Enterprises (NYSE: LF) is a leading
provider of technology-based learning products and proprietary content. The
company designs and develops educational products, as well as related
interactive software and content, under multiple product platforms, including
the LeapFrog, LeapPad, Leapster, and Quantum Leap brands. 

Management's actions to improve long-term operating results through increased
R and incremental marketing spending resulted in another year of negative
earnings in 2007. Management expects that 2008 will be a turnaround year with
new products introduced in the last two years generating sales and earnings
growth. 

However, turnarounds usually take longer than initial expectations. In addition,
the economic weakness in the U.S. is negatively impacting spending on
discretionary products and is currently a headwind for the company's progress.
Therefore, the stock is rated a Sell. 

Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

Indexes Point to Bleakness

There is nothing in this report that would cause the market to be up the way
that it is today. That may, after all, be the best news there is. The market has
started to ignore all bad news, which is often a healthy development. 

On the other hand, it could just mean that the market is being overly
optimistic. CNBC came out with a survey this morning of money managers, and 26%
of them expect the market to be up over 20% in 2009, while only 6% expect the
market to be down in 2009. This is EXTREMELY disturbing news, as an overwhelming
consensus of money managers is almost ALWAYS WRONG. 

The economy is going to be very ugly in 2009, and I would advise sticking to
firms with products that people need, not want, and which have fortress balance
sheets. A solid dividend yield that is well covered, even by the low estimate of
2009 earnings, is also a plus. Two examples of such companies would be Johnson &amp;
Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and Exxon-Mobil (NYSE: XOM). 

iPass Results Expected In-Line

We believe iPass Inc. (Nasdaq: IPAS) is close to creating a marginally
profitable business with its subscription-based model for enterprise
connectivity. We expect iPass to benefit from increased bookings. 

However, the true investment case for the stock is the company's broadband and
3G software and services offering. This could serve to differentiate iPass from
traditional network access and drive meaningful margin improvement into 2009 as
well as 2010. 

In the meantime, iPass is hitting its targets and meeting expectations. But we
continue to expect the fourth quarter to be flat equentially and believe the
company will report in-line 2008 results.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Univision breached its contract with partner Grupo Televisa by failing to pay more $100 million in royalties, a Televisa attorney claimed on Tuesday in the opening of a much-anticipated court battle between the two Spanish-language TV titans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Univision was secretly not paying everything it owed," said Marshall Grossman, an attorney for Spanish-language show producer Grupo Televisa, in his opening argument.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial, which has been postponed four times, has the potential to change the landscape of the lucrative Hispanic television market in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Televisa's auditors were stalled, delayed and misled," said Grossman in outlining the Mexican company's reasons for wanting out of a 25-year programing contract with privately-held Univision Communications Inc, a U.S.-based Spanish language broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Televisa is saying no more, no more, no more lawsuits. We hope to put an end to this relationship and each go our own way," Grossman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If Televisa triumphs, it will be able to either renegotiate its terms with Univision, demanding more money for programing, or turn to Univision rivals like Telemundo, the Spanish-language TV division of General Electric Co's NBC Universal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such an outcome would hurt Univision since it fills about 80 percent of the prime time slots on its three U.S. networks with Televisa content. Advertising from Televisa programing generates about 35 percent of Univision's $1.6 billion in television revenue, according to analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his opening arguments, Univision's lawyer, John Keker, said that despite some accounting mistakes made in "good faith" by Univision, the evidence will show Univision was right on most counts, specifically regarding disputed payments involving unsold advertising time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Univision is not violating its contract, not cheating," he said, noting that Univision has paid Televisa more than $1 billion in royalties over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each of these companies has profited hugely and made billions of dollars on this contract," he said, adding that Televisa's audits were conducted in a way to stir up trouble and turn "molehills into mountains."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPARRING SINCE 2005&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies have been sparring since 2005 when Televisa filed a lawsuit demanding royalty payments it said Univision, its U.S. partner, had withheld as part of a programing deal that expires in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa alleges that Univision wrongly excluded some programs from the deal it was supposed to share ad revenue on, even from shows that weren't made by Televisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal battle started after Jerrold Perenchio, former CEO of Univision, made one of his lieutenants his successor, crushing Televisa's hopes of putting one of its own at the helm of the U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight escalated the following year after Televisa lost a bid for Univision against a group of investors led by media tycoon Haim Saban, which offered $12.3 billion for the U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa later sold its 11 percent stake in Univision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the judge favors Univision, the U.S. company will lock in its leading position in the U.S. Hispanic television market at a very attractive price, analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under this scenario, Televisa would have to get more creative with new products and programing bundling to reach U.S. Hispanics without breaching the exclusivity deal with Univision. Televisa inked three deals with Telemundo in 2008 looking for ways to increase its reach in the U.S. market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hispanics account for about 14 percent of the United States' 300-million strong population.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Univision's strength lies with its in-house talk shows and newscasts. But it leans on Televisa for hit soap operas and other entertainment productions that lure viewers for its three networks: Univision, Galavision and Telefutura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sue Zeidler; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Jan 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
At Macworld, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced the availability of Lotus
Notes 8.5 collaboration software with social computing features for all
Mac OS X Leopard-powered computers. In addition, IBM's free Lotus Symphony
document, spreadsheet and presentation software will be available later
this month for the Mac.

    IBM Lotus Notes and Domino software, celebrating its 20th year in 2009,
has grown to more than 140 million licenses sold worldwide.

    Lotus Notes 8.5 provides significant storage savings over previous
versions. Notes has an intelligent storage savings feature that ensures
that only one copy of an attachment is kept on the mail server, resulting
in an estimated 40 percent space savings.

    "To ease the mounting pressure on businesses to constrain costs, Notes 8.5
provides 'open' social computing benefits at substantial savings to
businesses because less storage space is needed," said Kevin Cavanaugh,
vice president, messaging and collaboration, IBM.

    "The blazing speed of Apple's award-winning hardware combined with Mac OS
X, the world's most advanced operating system creates an ideal platform
for collaboration software applications like Notes," said Ron Okamoto,
Apple's vice president of Worldwide Developer Relations. "We're excited
to see IBM's continued commitment to the Mac platform with its latest
release."

    Lotus Notes 8.5 has several notable characteristics, including a
user-friendly look that neatly arranges all collaboration tools on one
screen in fewer clicks. This screen shows links to team rooms, instant
messaging, to do lists, calendar, Internet browsers and other tools.

    Social characteristics include new integration with Google, Yahoo, and
hundreds of other public Internet calendars -- blending the work and
personal lives of busy professionals. Using Notes, with just a check of a
box, a worker can display the Lotus Notes work calendar and the family
Internet calendar, with a customer meeting, lunch with the boss,
parent-teacher conference, son's basketball game, and spa appointment --
all in one view.

    "Notes 8.5 has allowed our Mac users to make full use of a non-Microsoft
environment with all the advances of the latest Notes functionality," said
Mark Calleran, Chief Information Officer, The Salvation Army,
International Headquarters.

    Discovery Communications is another leading organization, among others,
using Lotus Notes 8.5 for the Macintosh.

    IBM also announced new Lotus iNotes 8.5 software, which allows anyone with
a Notes user license to access Notes through a Safari browser from
anywhere. iNotes allows the user to integrate the Notes calendar with
Google calendar and also supports most standard widgets. One example of a
widget is the mapping of a street address in an e-mail note.

    In addition to availability for the Mac, IBM Lotus Notes 8.5 software is
also available for Windows and Linux devices. It also works more
efficiently with Lotus Sametime for collaboration and unified
communications and Lotus Quickr for file sharing among work teams at
various levels.

    The new innovations built into Lotus Notes 8.5 reflect ongoing and
anticipated changes in business, society and culture -- results of
Tomorrow at Work, an IBM initiative that examines a changing work world.

    Lotus Notes 8.5 works closely with Lotus Sametime software, allowing
individuals to see who is available, and to begin instant message and
voice over IP (VOIP) conversations with a click of the mouse. The
real-time community tools in Sametime make it easier to find information
and share expertise in real time with groups of people. Instead of
spending time trying to figure out who can help solve a problem,
individuals can reach out to a community of people instantly, take part
in persistent chats and share screens with many others.

    IBM sells Lotus Notes and Domino in a variety of ways, including packaged
with hardware for small and medium businesses; via a hosted service, where
the software is stored on a server at IBM; and through Passport Advantage
on http://www.ibm.com/lotus/notesanddomino.

    Macworld Expo attendees can visit IBM at Booth #3418 in the North Hall at
the Moscone Center in San Francisco this week.

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Jan 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Emilio Azcarraga, Chief Executive Officer, Grupo Televisa, will speak on
"Continuing the Latin Media Legacy" with TOWN HALL Los Angeles at the
Millennium Biltmore Hotel on Tuesday, January 13, 2009. Attendees will
learn about new trends in Spanish-language media from this industry
leader.

    Viewed as one of the world's most powerful media moguls, Azcarraga became
CEO of Grupo Televisa in 1997 at the age of 29 and turned the
company-in-debt around. Azcarraga stated, "I believe first that media
doesn't shape the world, the people shape the world... We try to deliver
information to the people so that they can make their own choices, in
terms of culture or in terms of causes."

    Founded in 1955, Grupo Televisa is Mexico's No. 1 television broadcaster
with four networks and 260 affiliate stations, in addition to the
company's holdings in publishing, pay-television and Internet television,
with new sports and entertainment portals. Recent agreements struck in
2008 with US Spanish-language network Telemundo will increase Televisa's
links with the US Latino market delivering Telemundo's programming,
including its popular telenovelas, to all its digital platforms.

    Throughout its 72 years TOWN HALL has hosted numerous leaders of the media
industry including Ted Turner, Sumner Redstone, and Richard Parsons. Los
Angeles' creative industries, including media, account for approximately
452,000 jobs in LA County and state revenues of $4 billion annually
according to a 2007 study conducted by the Los Angeles Economic
Development Corporation.

    One of the Top 10 Leadership Forums in the nation, TOWN HALL Los Angeles
has been a nonprofit, nonpartisan membership organization since 1937,
supported by Angelenos, foundations and corporations that believe in open
public discussion. Our mission is to provide a forum for ideas -- a place

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds background about saboteurs)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS Jan 6 (Reuters) - U.S. energy giant Chevron (CVX.N)
said on Tuesday it had lifted a force majeure on oil output
from its Escravos terminal in Nigeria a month and a half after
saboteurs forced it to shut in around 90,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it had lifted the measure, declared on
Nov. 19 and which frees it from contractual obligations, with
effect from Jan. 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Production and lifting operations have resumed," it said
in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Saboteurs attacked a main supply pipeline to the Escravos
terminal in November in Delta state, one of three main states
in Nigeria's restive Niger Delta region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The vast network of mangrove creeks is home to Africa's
biggest oil industry, which is currently producing around 2
million barrels per day of crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Attacks by militants who say they are fighting for a fairer
share of the natural wealth and by criminal gangs engaged in a
lucrative trade in stolen oil have cut Nigeria's crude
production by around a fifth since early 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron operates onshore in Nigeria in a joint venture with
state-run oil firm the Nigerian National Petroleum Corp (NNPC).
Chevron holds 40 percent while NNPC holds 60 percent.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Garmin (GRMN.O)
to "sell" from "neutral," noting 2009 will likely usher in a
multi-year decline in its core portable navigation device
market, and added the stock to its conviction sell list.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of the largest U.S. maker of navigation devices were
down 4 percent at $21.02 in morning trade on Nasdaq. They fell
as much as 11 percent earlier in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the current economic slowdown plus increased
smartphone GPS usage and limited diversification options will
drive material revenue/EPS decline over the next several
years," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage lowered its 12-month price target on the
stock to $15 from $21.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 6 (Reuters) - IntercontinentalExchange Inc (ICE.N) fell
more than 15 percent, after Goldman Sachs cut its rating on the
futures exchange to "neutral" from "buy" and removed the stock
from its conviction buy list, citing lower commissions from
energy business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On Jan 5, Atlanta-based ICE said its fourth-quarter
commissions from the energy business had lagged both the
previous quarter and the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The announcement of the first year-over-year decline in
OTC commissions since 2003 cast a shadow over our favorable
view of ICE," Goldman analyst Daniel Harris said in a research
note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jefferies  Co also cut its price target on ICE to $75 from
$80, citing slowing volumes in the exchange's energy markets.
The brokerage, however, maintained its "hold" rating on the
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jefferies analyst Daniel Fannon said while the exchange had
several initiatives lined up for 2009, volumes within its core
energy markets have been slowing for months, fuelling the
brokerage's concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its over-the-counter energy business, ICE posted average
daily commissions of $870,934, a fall of 22 percent from the
$1.1 million it reported in the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Goldman and Jefferies slashed their fourth-quarter and
2009 estimates for the futures exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ICE shares were down more than 15 percent at $61.80 in
early trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 6 (Reuters) - Diversified company Walter Industries Inc
(WLT.N) said it would close its loss-making homebuilding unit,
Jim Walter Homes, that would affect about 230 jobs, sending its
shares up as much as 13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Walter, which produces metallurgical coal for the steel
industry, expects to incur a related pretax charge of about $8
million to $10 million in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company, which has about 2500 employees, said the unit
has not been profitable for years and efforts to sell it were
unsuccessful due to a weak housing industry and tight credit
markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jim Walter Homes will meet all of its obligations but will
cease all sale efforts, Walter said. At Dec. 31, 2008, Jim
Walter Homes had about 150 homes under construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the last few years, Walter has been trying to
re-position itself as a pure play natural resources and energy
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It completed the spin-off of Mueller Water Products
(MWA.N), a maker of flow-control products, in December 2006. In
2008, Walter closed nearly half of Jim Walter Homes' sales
centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spin-off of its financing business is expected to be
completed in early 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter's shares, which touched a high of $111.87 in June
last year, were up $2.03 at $25.19 Tuesday morning on the New
York Stock Exchange. They touched a high of $26.07 earlier in
the session.

&lt;p&gt;  COPENHAGEN, DENMARK, Jan 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Grundfos, one of the world's leading pump
manufacturers, today announced an agreement for IBM to provide servers
and storage infrastructure for its two data centers in Denmark, and to
deliver a new infrastructure for Grundfos' SAP environment.

    With this new agreement, Grundfos has selected IBM's high-end Power
Systems servers and IBM System Storage DS8300 and TS3500 disk and tape
systems to operate their SAP environment. The solution covers capacity
for operating SAP for more than 8,000 users worldwide and more than 70
SAP systems. The existing non-IBM storage and tape systems are being
phased out.

    Grundfos selected IBM after an overall evaluation of IBM as an IT and
services provider, and based on the advantages of IBM's virtualization
technology that enables optimization and consolidation to fewer hardware
units through a single hardware provider.

    "This agreement with IBM marks the continuation of years of co-operation
between Grundfos and IBM for IT infrastructure, hardware, software and
services. With one overall agreement for enterprise servers and storage
for Grundfos' business critical applications, we expect to obtain
synergies and operational advantages," said Karsten Steen Soerensen, IT
Director, Grundfos.

    With annual production of more than 16 million pump units, Grundfos
manufactures circulator pumps for heating and air-conditioning and other
centrifugal pumps for industry, water supply, wastewater and dosing.
Today, Grundfos is the world's largest manufacturer of circulator pumps,
covering approximately half of the global market.

    "With this agreement, IBM provides Grundfos with further modernization of
its infrastructure that will meet the company's growth needs, while
offering a high level of flexibility and simplicity," said Bent Larsen,
Sales Director, Distribution, Industrial &amp; Communications Sector, IBM
Denmark.

&lt;p&gt;
ATLANTA, Jan. 6, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global supply chain optimization
provider Manhattan Associates, Inc. (Nasdaq:MANH) today announced that its
Distributed Order Management (DOM) solution will feature certified integration
with WebSphere Commerce from IBM. DOM, part of Manhattan's Order Lifecycle
Management suite within the Manhattan SCOPE(tm) portfolio, enables customers to
fill orders from multiple inventory channels and provide packaged capabilities
for buying products online with pickup in stores, shipping online orders from
stores and orchestrating  vendor-drop shipments.

This certified integration between WebSphere Commerce and DOM provides retailers
with a complete stack of cross-channel solutions: Commerce for cross-channel
marketing and selling and DOM for order fulfillment from an extended supply
network, including distribution centers, stores and drop-ship vendors.

"Solutions like Manhattan's DOM are the future for cross-channel order
management, especially given the certified integration with a leading eCommerce
solution like WebSphere Commerce," said John Morrow, chief information officer
for David's Bridal. "This technology allows us to have complete order and
inventory visibility along with better communication with our customers in every
selling channel. As you'd expect, having absolute certainty over ability to
deliver by our customers' wedding day is core to the David's Bridal culture, and
Manhattan DOM gives us the tools we need to make this happen."

Manhattan's DOM solution is also certified for the IBM Retail Integration
Framework, which leverages open standards to unlock communications between
services, information sources, and business processes, making the store and the
retail enterprise one seamless landscape rather than disconnected islands. This
integration enables DOM to provide web customers or call center agents with a
complete view of all available inventory for real-time order promising and order
reservation.

Additionally, DOM is fully integrated with the entire Manhattan Associates SCOPE
portfolio, thus providing real-time integration with applications like Warehouse
Management, Extended Enterprise Management and Transportation Planning &amp;
Execution. This new integration with WebSphere Commerce now provides customers
with an integrated best-in-class eCommerce and order fulfillment suite.

"Today's leading retailers are looking to enable cross-channel processes to
create a business with a retail brand, not a channel inside a retail brand,"
said Karen Lowe, General Manager of IBM's Global Retail Industry. "Manhattan's
Distributed Order Management enables these processes by handling complex
cross-channel inventory, value added service provision and in-store fulfillment
processes. These capabilities, coupled with IBM's WebSphere Commerce will enable
retailers to jumpstart their cross-channel selling and promotional efforts."

"Winning retailers know that a seamless cross-channel experience is critical to
winning and keeping customers, and RSR's research shows that some of the biggest
issues that retailers face in trying to build that experience come from
integration, particularly around distributed order management," said Nikki
Baird, managing partner at RSR Research. "By offering packaged integration
between the Commerce and DOM applications, this joint offering from IBM and
Manhattan will help retailers implement critical customer service strategies
faster and for less cost."

concerning the company`s sales, marketing and operational initiatives, future
financial results, operating performance, development efforts, and the benefits
provided by Eclipsys software and services. Actual results may differ from those
projected due to a variety of risks and uncertainties. Future performance
expectations are predicated upon achievement of various sales and performance
targets that may be difficult to meet. Sales may be slower than expected due to
market conditions, competition, and other factors. Costs may be greater than
anticipated due to the potential need to increase spending to ensure performance
in accordance with commitments to clients and other factors. Software
development may take longer and cost more than expected, and incorporation of
anticipated features and functionality may be delayed, due to various factors
including programming and integration challenges and resource constraints. The
market is highly competitive. Implementation and customization of Eclipsys
software is complex and time-consuming. Results depend upon a variety of factors
and can vary by client. Each client`s circumstances are unique and may include
unforeseen issues that make it more difficult than anticipated to implement or
derive benefit from software, implementation or consulting services. The success
and timeliness of the company`s services will depend at least in part upon
client involvement, which can be difficult to control. Eclipsys is required to
meet specified performance standards, and clients can terminate contracts,
assess penalties or reduce contract scope under certain circumstances. More
information about company risks is available in recent Form 10-K and other
filings made by Eclipsys from time to time with the Securities and Exchange
Commission. Special attention is directed to the portions of those documents
entitled "Risk Factors" and "Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations." Eclipsys Corporation and The Outcomes

&lt;p&gt;BURLINGTON, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Laboratory Corporation of America&#174; Holdings (LabCorp&#174;) (NYSE: LH) today
announced that David P. King, Chief Executive Officer, is scheduled to speak at
the Goldman Sachs Healthcare Conference in New York City, NY. LabCorp`s
presentation is planned for Wednesday, January 7, 2009 at 4:30 p.m. (Eastern). 

A live audio webcast of the presentation will be available via the Company Web
site at www.labcorp.com and archived for replay. 

The Company also reaffirmed its prior non-GAAP full 2008 year diluted earnings
per share guidance of between $4.57 and $4.61, excluding restructuring and other
special charges and share repurchase activity after September 30, 2008.1 The
Company continues to expect 2008 revenue growth of approximately 11%, EBITDA
margins of approximately 25%, operating cash flow of approximately $750 million
to $770 million (excluding any transition payments to UnitedHealthcare), capital
expenditures of approximately $140 million to $160 million, and net interest
expense of approximately $70 million. The Company expects to report final 2008
results in its 4th quarter earnings release, scheduled for February 12th, 2009. 

Additionally, the Company updated its preliminary 2009 full year guidance. The
company now expects revenue growth of 2.0% to 4.0% (versus previous guidance of
3.5% to 5.5%). Diluted EPS is now expected to be in the range of $4.75 to $4.95
(versus prior guidance of $5.00 to $5.25), excluding the impact of any share
repurchase activity after September 30, 2008. The Company will provide more
detailed 2009 guidance in its 4th quarter earnings release. 

"Given the ongoing deterioration in the economy, it seems prudent to forecast
lower growth for 2009," said David P. King, CEO. "Our revised guidance reflects
the expected impact on earnings from economic factors that worsened during the
fourth quarter. Nevertheless, looking forward, we continue to believe our
industry and our company are more important than ever to the U.S. healthcare
system, which provides us confidence that more normal economic times will lead
to enhanced growth and profitability in 2010 and beyond." 

The Company also announced that because the common stock trading price
conversion feature of its zero coupon subordinated Liquid yield Option Notes due
2021 (LYONS) and Zero Coupon Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2021(Zero Coupon
Notes) was not triggered by fourth quarter 2008 trading prices, the LYONS and
Zero Coupon Notes may not be converted during the period of January 1, 2009
through March 31, 2009 based on this conversion feature. The Company also
announced that the amount of notes presented for conversion during the fourth
quarter of 2008 was not material.

&lt;p&gt;CRIX`s New Service Will Leverage Electronic Medical Records and Enable Easier
and More Accurate Reporting of Adverse Drug Events
RESTON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
The Clinical Research Information eXchange (CRIX) International today announced
their participation with Pfizer, Partners HealthCare and the Clinical Data
Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) in the ASTER (Adverse Drug Event
Spontaneous Triggered Electronic Reporting) study, which is exploring ways to
improve the current spontaneous reporting system (SRS), the primary source of
information for adverse drug events. The ASTER study is exploring how a
combination of standards, technology and a new business model can improve drug
safety by helping physicians better recognize and report adverse events, and by
improving the quality of data in safety reports. 

The healthcare industry has long understood the need for computerized monitoring
and technologies that ease - or automate - reporting of adverse medical
reactions. 

"Analyzing data on adverse events is only effective if the data is accurate and
complete, which is not always the case with the current SRS," said James Bland,
Executive Director of CRIX International. "By making the reporting system easier
and broadening the pool of reporters, we will create a database that will vastly
improve the system." 

The study is using CDISC`s Retrieve Form for Data Capture (RFD) standard to
automatically recognize adverse drug events recorded in the Longitudinal Medical
Record (LMR), an electronic health record system currently in use at Brigham and
Women`s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital, founding members of
Partners HealthCare. The system will automatically populate an ADE report from
the LMR thereby eliminating the burden of transcribing data from one system to
another. 

An essential part of the study is to pilot a new business model for safety
reporting which uses CRIX International to provide the data collection,
processing and reporting services. CRIX will be able to receive the ADE reports
directly from Partners HealthCare and will forward them electronically to FDA
and to drug manufacturers. This will result in a time from recognition of the
event until FDA receives the report of a matter of minutes. The project will run
through 2009 pending quarterly performance benchmarks. 

"Working collaboratively with Partners HealthCare and CDISC through CRIX, we are
exploring innovative methods to improve the information flow about patient
experiences with medicines. The goal is to advance the quality of data relating
to benefits and risks of medicines, thereby giving physicians and patients
better treatment options," said Michael Ibara, Pfizer`s Head of
Pharmacovigilance Information Management. 

"This project has the potential to greatly improve patient safety by
streamlining adverse drug event reporting for all healthcare organizations while
closely guarding patient privacy," said Jeffrey A. Linder, MD, MPH, Assistant
Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women`s Hospital
and Principle Investigator of the ASTER study. 

CDISC`s work on SRS is an extension of work begun with Integrating the
Healthcare Enterprise (IHE), Health Level 7 (HL7) and The Healthcare Information
and Management Systems Society (HiMSS), three of the leading healthcare industry
organizations.

&lt;p&gt;
MANITOWOC, Wis., Jan. 6, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc.
(NYSE:CCE) will receive an Environmental Stewardship Award on Jan. 9 from Orion
Energy Systems Inc. to acknowledge the beverage company's relentless commitment
to corporate responsibility and sustainability.

The event will take place at Coca-Cola Enterprises' Downey, Calif., facility.
Officials from Southern California Edison, Coca-Cola Enterprises and Orion will
speak at the event, and public officials and utility professionals are expected
to attend.

Orion Energy Systems Inc. (Nasdaq:OESX), of Manitowoc, Wis., will present the
award, which is designed to recognize companies that reduce energy consumption -
and associated greenhouse gases - through the use of Orion's energy management
systems.

In California alone, Coca-Cola Enterprises has decreased energy consumption by
113 million kilowatt-hours by using Orion's high-intensity fluorescent lighting
technology. As a result of the energy reduction, Coca-Cola Enterprises will
decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 74,301 tons over the life of Orion's
replacement lighting.

The energy savings frees enough electricity to power 537 homes a year, is the
air-scrubbing equivalent of a 1,038-acre forest, or equates to saving more than
9.3 million gallons of gasoline over the life of the fixtures, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency.

Coca-Cola Enterprises has been unrelenting in its environmental efforts. The
company has installed solar power generating panels, uses energy efficient
vending equipment, utilizes hybrid vehicles and recycles.

Orion's energy-efficient lighting platform is near completion in 24 Coca-Cola
facilities in California and more than 300 Coca-Cola facilities nationwide.

The awards ceremony will be illuminated by Orion's integrated lighting system,
which won the 2008 prestigious Platts Global Energy award for Sustainable
Technology Innovation of the Year as "the single most innovative technology
advance in the area of green technology," according to Platts.

The integrated system, which combines light fixtures, controls and direct
renewable solar light pipes, can reduce a customer's lighting costs up to 80
percent in comparison to traditional, high-intensity discharge lights.

The media is invited to attend the event and luncheon, which will be held at
10:00 a.m. on Friday, January 9 at Coca-Cola Enterprises, 11536 Patton Road,
Gate 6, in Downey, California. To register, please log on to

Award on Jan. 9 from Orion Energy Systems Inc. to acknowledge the beverage
company`s relentless commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability. 

The event will take place at Coca-Cola Enterprises` Downey, Calif., facility.
Officials from Southern California Edison, Coca-Cola Enterprises and Orion will
speak at the event, and public officials and utility professionals are expected
to attend. 

Orion Energy Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: OESX), of Manitowoc, Wis., will present the
award, which is designed to recognize companies that reduce energy consumption -
and associated greenhouse gases - through the use of Orion`s energy management
systems. 

In California alone, Coca-Cola Enterprises has decreased energy consumption by
113 million kilowatt-hours by using Orion`s high-intensity fluorescent lighting
technology. As a result of the energy reduction, Coca-Cola Enterprises will
decrease carbon dioxide emissions by 74,301 tons over the life of Orion`s
replacement lighting. 

The energy savings frees enough electricity to power 537 homes a year, is the
air-scrubbing equivalent of a 1,038-acre forest, or equates to saving more than
9.3 million gallons of gasoline over the life of the fixtures, according to the
Environmental Protection Agency. 

Coca-Cola Enterprises has been unrelenting in its environmental efforts. The
company has installed solar power generating panels, uses energy efficient
vending equipment, utilizes hybrid vehicles and recycles. 

Orion`s energy-efficient lighting platform is near completion in 24 Coca-Cola
facilities in California and more than 300 Coca-Cola facilities nationwide. 

The awards ceremony will be illuminated by Orion`s integrated lighting system,
which won the 2008 prestigious Platts Global Energy award for Sustainable
Technology Innovation of the Year as "the single most innovative technology
advance in the area of green technology," according to Platts. 

The integrated system, which combines light fixtures, controls and direct
renewable solar light pipes, can reduce a customer`s lighting costs up to 80
percent in comparison to traditional, high-intensity discharge lights. 

The media is invited to attend the event and luncheon, which will be held at
10:00 a.m. on Friday, January 9 at Coca-Cola Enterprises, 11536 Patton Road,
Gate 6, in Downey, California. To register, please log on to

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the latest Industry Outlook. Today`s outlook from Zacks
Equity Research analyst Jason Napodano discusses the pharmaceutical sector.
Highlighted stocks include: Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:
BMY), Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE: MRK), and Eli Lilly
(NYSE: LLY). 

Get the most recent insight from Zacks Equity Research with the free Profit from
the Pros newsletter: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Here is the latest on the Pharmaceutical sector:

The industry`s cash position has never been stronger. Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), one of
our top-picks for 2009, is sitting on over $30 billion in cash. Other buy rated
names, including Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE:
JNJ), are sitting on $8 billion and $15 billion, respectively. This should allow
for a significant deal activity later in the year. 

Given the difficult cash-raising environment during the second half of 2008,
most small to mid-sized biotech firms are eager to partner with pharmaceutical
companies in 2009. Asset prices for early-to-mid stage product candidates are
very cheap, and pharmaceutical companies are now willing to look at phase I and
phase II candidates in 2009 - something most managements have been hesitant to
do in the past. This should create a much better environment for the entire
industry to push higher in 2009 as sentiment on small biotech turns positive
perhaps later in the year. 

Finally, large-cap pharmaceutical names are paying hefty dividends. That`s
something all investors should be looking for given the rocky financial markets.
Pharmaceutical companies are well-capitalized with financial sound business
models. Pfizer`s huge dividend of 7% is not only very attractive, it is also
safe. Bristol, Merck &amp; Co. (NYSE: MRK), and Eli Lilly (NYSE: LLY) are all
yielding 5%.

SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

This news release may contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of
the federal securities laws. Statements regarding future events, developments,
the Company's future performance, as well as management's expectations, beliefs,
intentions, plans, estimates or projections relating to the future (including,
without limitation, statements concerning revenue and net income), are
forward-looking statements within the meaning of these laws and involve a number
of risks and uncertainties. Management believes that these forward-looking
statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions and forecasts,
however, undue reliance should not be placed on such statements that speak only
as of the date hereof. Moreover, these forward-looking statements are subject to
a number of risks and uncertainties, some of which are outlined below. As a
result, actual results may vary materially from those anticipated by the
forward-looking statements. Among the important factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking
statements are: volume and timing of systems sales and installations; length of
sales cycles and installation process; the possibility that the products will
not achieve market acceptance; seasonal patterns of sales and customer buying
behavior; the development by competitors of new or superior technologies; the
timing, cost and success or failure of new product and service introductions,
development and product upgrade releases; undetected errors or bugs in software;
product liability; changing economic, political or regulatory influences in the
health-care industry; changes in product-pricing policies; availability of
third-party products and components; competitive pressures including product
offerings, pricing and promotional activities; the Company's ability or
inability to attract and retain qualified personnel; possible regulation of the
Company's software by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; uncertainties
concerning threatened, pending and new litigation against the Company including
related professional services fees; uncertainties concerning the amount and
timing of professional fees incurred by the Company generally; changes of
accounting estimates and assumptions used to prepare the prior periods'
financial statements; general economic conditions; and the risk factors detailed
from time to time in Quality Systems' periodic reports and registration
statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A significant
portion of the Company's quarterly sales of software product licenses and
computer hardware is concluded in the last month of the fiscal quarter,
generally with a concentration of such revenues earned in the final ten business
days of that month. Due to these and other factors, the Company's revenues and
operating results are very difficult to forecast. A major portion of the
Company's costs and expenses, such as personnel and facilities, are of a fixed
nature and, accordingly, a shortfall or decline in quarterly and/or annual
revenues typically results in lower profitability or losses. As a result,
comparison of the Company's period-to-period financial performance is not
necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator of future
performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any
forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future
events or otherwise.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc has chosen Microsoft Corp to provide Internet search services for cell phones, in what is seen as a blow to rivals Google Inc and Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verizon Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg said on Wednesday that Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer would announce the deal later in the day at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Seidenberg, speaking at a Citigroup conference, gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement follows more than a year of speculation on whom would become the default mobile search provider for Verizon Wireless, which is set to surpass ATT Inc as the No. 1 U.S. mobile carrier after it closes its purchase of smaller operator Alltel later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's certainly a feather in Microsoft's cap. Tough news for Google and tougher news for Yahoo," CCS Insight analyst John Jackson said of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made a bid for Yahoo last year, but walked away after they disagreed on price. Investors have been skeptical about whether the software company can win online advertising revenue away from Google and Yahoo, which are both stronger than Microsoft in the Internet search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft really needed to win that," Nielsen's head of telecom research, Roger Entner, said about the Verizon deal. "It gives them a good fighting chance.

While the details of the agreement have yet to be revealed, he said Google may have been a better choice to help Verizon offer personalized Web services, such as delivering ads that are relevant to users' interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ultimate goal in mobility is contextual awareness and the delivery of highly personalized experiences," Jackson said. "These are competencies Google has in spades, so it may be that Verizon's customers ultimately end up with an inferior experience relative to what Google might enable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported the two companies were in negotiations and that Microsoft would share with Verizon revenue from advertisements shown in response to cell phone Web searches.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Jan 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Tensoft http://www.tensoft.com, a leading end-to-end ERP and supply chain
solution provider for the high tech industry, expanded its line of
revenue enhancement solutions today with the announcement of the Revenue
Cycle Management (RCM) family of products. Each of the three solutions is
designed for companies with specific, challenging revenue management
needs. All three versions improve the efficiency and accuracy of
multifaceted revenue models, increasing visibility into revenue drivers.
Management of complex customer contracts and billing is streamlined,
using fully auditable and traceable processes. The RCM family of products
includes:


    Tensoft Revenue Cycle Management (RCM) Suite is designed for software
    and other high tech firms that have highly complex revenue and/or
    billing needs. Sophisticated sell-to or sell-through models, complex
    contractual billing arrangements, compliance-dictated revenue
    recognition models, and revenue or billing complexity are all managed
    by the Tensoft RCM Suite. It is a strong fit for companies that utilize
    enterprise license models, royalty or OEM contract management, complex
    billing driven by usage and sophisticated pricing terms, large account
    business management needs or high-level models such as those by the
    online gaming industry.

    Tensoft Revenue and Deferral Management (RDM) supports sophisticated
    revenue management from the invoice forward for software or high tech
    companies that provide internet-based subscriptions or services, or
    which have an external system to manage billing. The solution targets
    web advertising or services companies that have sophisticated customer
    account management built into their web presence, as well as product-
    based companies that need to segment revenue streams or manage revenue
    timing.

    Tensoft Revenue and Deferral Management for Distribution Channels
    (RDM/D) is designed for companies that sell through distribution
    channels, such as electronic component manufacturers and other
    companies that leverage distributors and point-of-sale (POS) data.
    RDM/D's distributor contracts management, POS data integration, rebate
    management and insight into channel sales to end customers are
    invaluable for streamlined, transparent, and effective revenue
    management.

    
"Tensoft's RCM family of products has been designed to support
technology companies' most critical and complex needs regarding revenue,
billing, and contract management," said Caprice Murray, Tensoft's
Director of Sales and Marketing. "Combined with the core financial and
reporting capabilities of Microsoft Dynamics GP, Tensoft RCM Suite, RDM
and RDM/D provide one central location -- and one integrated system --
which automates a company's lifecycle business processes such as billing
and contract renewals, as well as revenue recognition and management. No
other company offers such an elegant, streamlined revenue cycle
management solution."

    According to Andrew Chen, Corporate Controller of PlanetOut, an online
media and entertainment firm, RDM has helped to produce compelling
business results. "PlanetOut needed a solid solution to handle revenue
deferral and management for its high volume of subscription transactions,
as well as for advertising revenue. We were pleased to find that Tensoft
RDM automates the processes for us, and integrates seamlessly with our
existing financial and accounting software. Because we're a publicly
traded company, the auditability and compliance functions of Tensoft RDM
are critical to our SOX compliance plans."

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Shares of computer giant Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) are off nearly 3%
today, after Jefferies cut its price target from $28 to $26, but kept its "buy"
rating. Today's performance is nothing new for the world's No. 1 software
company, as the shares have slipped 46% from their November 2007 high. 

The equity is seeing some support in the 19-20 region, but resistance from its
descending 60-day moving average could pressure the shares below this level.

&lt;p&gt;-- Toshiba to Launch AV Devices with Network Player Capabilities Integrating
Widget Channel Developed by Intel and Yahoo! (Running on Intel Media Processor)
and Microsoft`s Extender for Windows Media Center Technology in 2nd Half of 2009
--


LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
Today, Toshiba Corporation (TOKYO:6502) announced a major product initiative
that will reinforce its collaboration with Intel Corporation and Microsoft
Corporation respectively and allow users to quickly and easily access and enjoy
a diverse range of high quality content and information services in the home. 

The full potential of digital convergence, can only be achieved through the
integration of key software platforms. Toshiba is taking the lead in attaining
this goal by launching AV devices including LCD TV, LCD TV/DVD Combo, and
standalone network player, that support the Widget Channel applications
framework promoted by Intel and Yahoo! and include Extender for Windows Media
Center technology. Toshiba will bring the new products to the U.S. market in the
second half of 2009, and will exhibit and demonstrate a concept system at the
2009 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. 

The combination of TV Widgets and Extender for Windows Media Center technology
deliver on the long promised, simple to use superior solution that consumers
expect from a network device. Until now, devices have been dedicated to software
implemented by the manufacturer. With TV Widgets and Extender for Windows Media
Center technology, the consumer will have the greater flexibility to customize
and enhance their entertainment experience. Each of Toshiba`s line of network
devices will act as the hub for content delivery into the entertainment space of
the home. 

TV Widgets which run on the Widget Channel applications framework developed by
Intel and Yahoo! and driven by Intel`s consumer electronics media processors,
allow viewers to access rich content library over the Internet (the latest
movies, music and sports programs) and information services (stock prices,
weather forecasts, on-line communities) via a user-friendly interface that
appears on their TV screen. While some TV Widgets will be pre-installed on the
devices, consumers will have access to a growing universe of TV widgets as they
become available. 

By integrating Extender for Windows Media Center technology, the new Toshiba AV
devices including LCD TV, LCD TV/DVD Combo, and standalone network player, will
be able to access a wide range of digital content from Windows Media Center on
the PC through their big screen TV using the home network. Included in every
copy of Windows Vista Home Premium and Ultimate, Windows Media Center, with the
addition of a TV tuner, turns the PC into a powerful DVR. Windows Media Center
also delivers an extensive amount of Internet TV and movie content, plus photos,
music, home videos and more. Toshiba`s network player solution will be developed
to be compatible with Windows Vista Home Premium, Windows Vista Ultimate and
Windows 7. 

Toshiba`s new line-up of AV devices including LCD TV, LCD TV/DVD Combo, and
standalone network player, will feature the company`s picture enhancement
technologies, allowing viewers to enjoy a wide range of content at near HD
picture quality. 

Eric B. Kim, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Digital Home Group,
Intel Corporation, says, "Intel`s consumer electronics platform, including the
Intel Media Processor CE 3100 and Widget Channel, provide performance,
flexibility and Internet compatibility, which help Toshiba to develop a new
generation of connected devices. These new services will extend the Internet
into the TV viewing experience, and transform the way consumers enjoy personal
entertainment." 

"Innovation is changing the definition of TV -change powered by software and web
services. People now want to easily find and enjoy their PC and
Internet-delivered content on all their screens," said Enrique Rodriguez,
Corporate Vice President, Connected TV Division at Microsoft. "Toshiba's
integration of Extender for Windows Media Center technology in their products
will deliver rich experiences including the aggregation and intuitive navigation
of content or the blending of information and services from the Web." 

Yoshihide Fuji, Toshiba Corporate Senior Vice President and President and CEO of
the Digital Media Network Company, said: "By strengthening our collaboration
with Intel and Microsoft, Toshiba can deliver the new experience of the
connected digital home, allowing consumers to enjoy content, anytime and
anywhere. This is a paradigm shift that will establish the TV as an essential
gateway to emerging entertainment content. We look forward to providing our
customers, around the world, with advanced platforms that will allow them the
flexibility to enjoy diverse content on their TVs at home."

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) may post a loss in the fourth quarter and incur write-downs of $2.5 billion on its leveraged loans, mortgages and structured notes, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares fell as much as 4 percent to a low of $28.78 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The primary driver of our estimate reduction is capital market related losses in the investment bank stemming from dramatic intra-quarter asset price declines," analyst Jeff Harte wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, significantly wider credit spreads made for a difficult fixed income trading environment, Harte said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He previously saw write-downs for the bank at $1.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harte expects JPMorgan to post a loss of 10 cents a share in the fourth quarter of 2008, compared with his prior profit view of 16 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Reuters Estimates, analysts on average expect the bank to earn 5 cents a share in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On December 11, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon had warned of a "terrible" fourth quarter, blaming mortgages, credit, and high yield bonds and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Harte also cut his 2009 earnings estimate to $2.25 a share from $2.85 to reflect increased credit costs, sluggish investment banking volumes and additional asset write-downs in early 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harte rates the stock "hold," and has a price target of $33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Anil D'Silva)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funding to Help Rebuild C.J. Peete Apartments Destroyed by Hurricane Katrina
NEW ORLEANS--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today announced a significant
investment in the rebuilding of the C.J. Peete Apartments Housing Complex. The
announcement was made at a groundbreaking ceremony for the new development,
which was also attended by Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Steve
Preston, New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin, General Douglas O`Dell, federal
coordinator for Gulf Coast Rebuilding, as well as representatives of the Housing
Authority of New Orleans, the state of Louisiana, and the City of New Orleans. 

The firm`s investment will help develop a residential rental community
consisting of 460 units in 116 residential buildings, as well as a community
center. A substantial portion of the project will consist of rent restricted
units that will be set aside for low income households and former C.J. Peete
residents. 

"We recognize the potential new capital can play in overlooked and
underdeveloped sections of urban America," said Lloyd C. Blankfein, Chairman and
Chief Executive Officer of the Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. "The C.J. Peete project
is a compelling opportunity to invest not only for an economic return, but also
in the revitalization and growth of a community." 

The C.J. Peete Apartments were originally built in 1941 and grew into one of the
largest public housing communities in New Orleans. Hurricane Katrina left much
of the complex uninhabitable. Today, the reconstruction of affordable housing is
a critical component in the redevelopment of New Orleans. 

The Goldman Sachs investment was coordinated by the firm`s Urban Investment
Group. 

"Natural disaster has exacerbated an urgent need for high quality, affordable
housing in New Orleans," said Alicia Glen, Managing Director and head of Goldman
Sachs` Urban Investment Group. "We are honored to be a part of this joint effort
between the public and private sectors to invest capital that will also create
jobs and catalyze the revitalization of this community."

investment banking, securities and investment management firm. Goldman Sachs
provides a wide range of services worldwide to a substantial and diversified
client base that includes corporations, financial institutions, governments and

corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable

braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align

Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign,
Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers.

&lt;p&gt;SAN CARLOS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Alvine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. today announced that its President and Chief
Executive Officer, Abhay Joshi, Ph.D., will present at the J.P. Morgan 27th
Annual Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, California on January 12, 2009 at
11:30 a.m. PST. 

In October 2008, Alvine announced positive proof of concept in a Phase I Trial
of ALV003, an oral protease therapy in development to detoxify gluten, intended
for use by patients with celiac disease. The trial results confirmed that single
doses of up to 1,800 mg of ALV003 were safe and tolerable in healthy volunteers.
Doses at the 300 mg level achieved up to a 96% reduction of gluten in a meal in
the stomach at 30 minutes, and were well tolerated by patients with celiac
disease. In addition, doses as low as 100 mg were shown to be biologically
active in degrading gluten in the stomach. Based on these results, Alvine plans
to initiate Phase I/IIa multidose trials in early 2009. 

About Alvine 

Alvine Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is a privately held biopharmaceutical company
dedicated to developing and commercializing therapeutics for
autoimmune/gastrointestinal diseases. Alvine`s lead product candidate, ALV003,
is a combination protease engineered to degrade gluten, and is being developed
to treat patients with celiac disease. For additional information about the
company, please visit www.alvinepharma.com.

About ALV003 

ALV003 is an orally administered combination of two recombinant proteases
engineered to degrade gluten into non-immunotoxic fragments, by targeting the
glutamine and proline residues that are common in gluten. ALV003 consists of a
glutamine specific cysteine protease (EP-B2) and a proline specific prolyl
endopeptidase (PEP). 

About Celiac Disease 

Celiac disease is the most common hereditary autoimmune disease with prevalence
as high as 2% in the U.S. and E.U. Celiac disease is triggered by the ingestion
of gluten in genetically susceptible individuals. Gluten is a protein found
naturally in wheat, rye, and barley, and is one of the most common and
nutritionally significant ingredients in the human diet. Patients with celiac
disease mount an immune response to gluten and gluten fragments, resulting in
systemic immune mediated damage in the gut and other organs. Gluten ingestion
can be associated with symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea, constipation and rash.
Complications of celiac disease can include osteoporosis, anemia, dermatitis,
weight loss, diabetes, central nervous system conditions, other autoimmune
diseases and malignancies. The only available option for individuals diagnosed
with celiac disease today is a life-long adherence to a strict gluten-free diet,
which is difficult to follow.

&lt;p&gt;CALABAR, Nigeria Jan 7 (Reuters) - Armed men attacked an
oil platform belonging to U.S. energy giant ExxonMobil (XOM.N)
off Nigeria early on Wednesday, the latest sign that criminal
gangs are extending their reach in Africa's top oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Gunmen in a flat-bottomed vessel raided the facility, which
lies some two hours by boat off the coast of the southern
Nigerian state of Akwa Ibom, shortly after midnight. They also
attacked a nearby barge and an oil services vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They shot into the air and water and ordered everyone on
the platform into one room and threatened to kill us," a witness
told Reuters, adding the raid had lasted two hours.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A private security contractor said the gunmen had stolen
phones, valuables and money. They were initially thought to have
taken three hostages, but all the occupants of the three
locations had since been accounted for, the contractor said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said there was no impact on production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mobil officials confirmed the incident but gave no details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insecurity in Nigeria's Niger Delta has focused on the three
main oil-producing states of Rivers, Delta and Bayelsa, but
kidnappings and robberies appear to be on the increase in Akwa
Ibom, further east towards Cameroon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is the second time in just over a month that Exxon's
local unit Mobil Producing Nigeria (MPN) has been targeted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gunmen attacked an MPN convoy in early December in Akwa Ibom
as it travelled towards the Qua Iboe oil terminal, killing one
soldier in what appeared to have been a failed kidnap attempt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Militants who say they are fighting for a fairer share of
the oil wealth in the Niger Delta launched a campaign of
sabotage and kidnappings three years ago which have cut
Nigeria's oil production by around a fifth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Criminal gangs have taken advantage of the unrest, seizing
prominent Nigerians and expatriate workers for ransom in the
creeks of the delta, or hijacking vessels at sea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Offshore oil facilities have generally been considered
beyond the reach of all but the most organised militant gangs
and therefore relatively secure, but attacks in deep water
appear to be on the increase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A vessel belonging to French oil services firm Bourbon
(GPBN.PA) was hijacked with nine crew members on Sunday but all
have been released unharmed, the company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two Russians working for aluminium giant RUSAL were seized
from their housing compound in the port town of Ikot Abasi in
Akwa Ibom more than two weeks ago. They are still being held.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That attack came hours after two oil services vessels were
attacked near crude oil facilities off Akwa Ibom operated by
Canada's Addax Petroleum AXC.TO ACX.L. A Filipino captain on
one of the vessels was killed, one security source said.

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co on Thursday threw its weight behind a new Intel chip that lets TV viewers interact with their favorite programs, underscoring a continuing effort to merge computers and media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anne Sweeney, president of the Disney-ABC Television group, said viewers may be able to access complementary content during the series finale of the hit TV series "Lost" next year through the chip, designed to power Internet applications on TVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new chip from Intel could offer content providers like Disney and electronics manufacturers new ways to collaborate on programing, Sweeney said at the Consumer Electronics Show [ID:nN05368327] in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The chip, which Intel launched last year to specifically target the consumer electronics industry, is designed to be included in TV sets and contains software that lets networks, content creators and other developers add their own applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has the "potential to make TV viewing more functional and more fun," Sweeney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABC's popular "Good Morning America" and "Lost" were good candidates for this type of interactive, add-on programing, she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney said they could work on widgets -- small software applications -- that allow GMA viewers to cast votes or comment in real-time on stories being broadcast. ABC could even build widgets that take viewers through the step-by-step instructions for recipes shown on GMA's cooking segment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And ABC may also develop an application specifically for the series finale of "Lost" next year that could heighten the audience's involvement, say, providing clues to the plot. The series follows the lives of plane crash survivors on a tropical island and will kick off a new season this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know fans of Lost have a huge appetite for insight and information into the show," Sweeney said. "Using the Intel Widget for the series finale could be a great way to give our fans an extraordinary viewing experience for the end of a truly iconic show."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she added there are legal issues to be sorted out before Disney can introduce such widgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. households are rapidly accessing content through channels other than traditional broadcasting. About 30 percent of U.S. homes have a digital video recorder and 39 percent have video-on-demand, Sweeney said, citing recent research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 38 percent of wireless subscribers have a video-capable cell phone, and U.S. viewers watch as many as 7.5 billion online video streams in any given month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not just about great content and cool technology," said Sweeney, dressed in a black pantsuit and pink blouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People like easy-to-use interfaces and simple navigation, she said, pointing to Apple Inc's iPhone and iPod as devices that "(get) this fundamental fact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney, which has traditionally been quick to adopt new platforms to distribute its content, signed a deal with the Macbook maker in 2005 to let people download episodes of its TV shows on iTunes, Apple's music software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sweeney also said Disney-ABC launched a new state-of-the-art research facility in Austin, Texas, last month to study what content works best on the variety of viewing gadgets in the market. The Ad Lab will research consumer behavior and responses to media, advertising and new technology, she said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Anupreeta Das&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS Jan 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) on
Thursday threw its weight behind a new Intel (INTC.O) chip that
lets TV viewers interact with their favorite programs,
underscoring a continuing effort to merge computers and media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anne Sweeney, president of the Disney-ABC Television group,
said viewers may be able to access complementary content during
the series finale of the hit TV series "Lost" next year through
the chip, designed to power Internet applications on TVs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new chip from Intel could offer content providers like
Disney and electronics manufacturers new ways to collaborate on

[ID:nN05368327] in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The chip, which Intel launched last year to specifically
target the consumer electronics industry, is designed to be
included in TV sets and contains software that lets networks,
content creators and other developers add their own
applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has the "potential to make TV viewing more functional
and more fun," Sweeney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABC's popular "Good Morning America" and "Lost" were good
candidates for this type of interactive, add-on programming,

billion online video streams in any given month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's not just about great content and cool technology,"
said Sweeney, dressed in a black pantsuit and pink blouse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People like easy-to-use interfaces and simple navigation,
she said, pointing to Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) iPhone and iPod as
devices that "(get) this fundamental fact."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney, which has traditionally been quick to adopt new
platforms to distribute its content, signed a deal with the
Macbook maker in 2005 to let people download episodes of its TV
shows on iTunes, Apple's music software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sweeney also said Disney-ABC launched a new

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be significantly lower than the previous quarter due to the impact of lower energy prices on its exploration and production business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil and gas company also said on Thursday its U.S. oil-equivalent production in October and November was 608,000 barrels per day, down from 647,000 the previous quarter and 730,000 in the fourth quarter of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares fell 0.8 percent to $73.62 in after-hours trading, having closed 0.4 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors will now be looking for updates from ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) to see how their performance last quarter compared with Chevron's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the downstream side, Chevron said refining margins fell sharply in December across its reported regions compared with the previous two months, when they turned negative in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude oil prices averaged about $59 a barrel in the fourth quarter, down by a third from the year before and well below the $147 record seen in July, and these fluctuations have made the refining business less predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Refining has been kind of Jekyll and Hyde for everybody from one month to the next," said Brian Youngberg, senior energy and utilities analyst at Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because market conditions had changed significantly, Chevron delayed the unveiling of 2009 capital spending plans until later this month from December. It made $15.8 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in the first nine months of 2008, out of $22.9 billion budgeted in December 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youngberg said he would be looking out for possible cuts to 2009 spending plans, even though the oil majors had so far avoided any drastic curtailing of projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rex Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), said on Thursday the U.S. oil industry leader was sticking with its $125 billion capital spending budget over the next five years, despite all the market turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEMICALS DOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with troubles throughout the petrochemical industry, Chevron said its chemicals segment would see fourth- quarter earnings decline due to lower volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said international oil-equivalent production in the first two months of the quarter rose to 1.92 million barrels per day from 1.80 million the prior quarter and it expects upstream earnings to benefit by about $625 million from an asset-exchange transaction, without giving details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company also said charges related to corporate and other activities would be well above the high end of its standard guidance of $250 million to $300 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts had been expecting a fourth-quarter profit of $3.66 billion, or $1.84 per share, on revenue of $59.2 billion, according to averages on Reuters Estimates.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson said on Thursday it would be difficult to meet President-elect Barack Obama's goal to significantly boost U.S. alternative energy production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a speech at George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, Obama said he wanted the United States to double its output of alternative energy sources during the next three years as part of his plan to revive the American economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that's going to be very challenging to do," Tillerson told reporters following a speech at the Woodrow Wilson Center in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the United States will not be able to double biofuels output during that period and there was not enough manufacturing capacity to build the wind turbines needed to meet Obama's goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not wanting to be critical of his aspirational goal. Aspirational goals are good because they challenge us all to go out and find the right answer," Tillerson said of Obama's plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he added: "Let's be realistic about timeframes. Let's not fool ourselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite calls for more alternative energy use, he said, "for the foreseeable future" the world will rely on oil and natural gas for 60 percent of its energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Renewable energy sources, which include solar, wind, hydroelectric, geothermal, biofuels and other biomass, accounted for 7 percent of U.S. energy supplies in 2007, according to the Energy Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson said the slowdown in the global economy would be temporary and then strong energy demand from emerging nations will return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said that even with the weak economy, Exxon remained committed to investing in projects to meet future energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the  company was sticking with its $125 billion capital spending budget planned for the next five years, despite the steep drop in oil prices and the global economic slowdown. Any changes to the capital spending budget will be announced in March at a meeting with analysts, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Tillerson reiterated that it would be better for Congress to pass climate change legislation that levies a carbon tax to curb greenhouse gas emissions, instead of imposing a complicated cap-and-trade system that allows businesses to buy and sell pollution permits to spew emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tackling climate change is a top priority for the incoming Obama administration and the Democratic-majority Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson said a carbon tax, which could be tacked on to fuel supplies and electricity consumption, was the most efficient way to reflect the cost of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, a cap-and-trade system is difficult to verify, requires new government regulators and "a Wall Street of emissions brokers," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tom Doggett; Editing by Walter Bagley)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. home price depreciation slowed in November, marking a trend that will result in steady values by year-end 2009, according to analysts at JPMorgan Chase  Co., citing new LoanPerformance data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home prices registered a 16.74 percent year-over-year decline in November, slightly better than previous months' drops that had ranged from 17 percent to 18 percent, the analysts said.

House price depreciation may also reduce the effectiveness of a Federal Reserve program that is lowering rates, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Price depreciation will probably peak at 35 percent from mid-2006, as lower prices and interest rates boost affordability, the analysts said. LoanPerformance data shows total depreciation at 27.42 percent in November, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average 30-year fixed mortgage rate has plunged since October as the Fed announced and launched a plan to buy up to $500 billion in mortgage-backed securities, pushing down yields that influence rates lenders offer to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The mortgage rate dropped for a 10th consecutive week as of Thursday, to 5.01 percent, the lowest since at least 1971, according to a Freddie Mac survey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Al Yoon; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today reported in its interim update that
earnings for the fourth quarter 2008 are expected to be significantly lower than
in the 2008 third quarter. The company indicated that most of the decline is
associated with lower prices for crude oil and natural gas that negatively
affect earnings for the upstream business. 

Basis for Comparison in Interim Update

The interim update contains certain industry and company operating data for the
fourth quarter 2008. The production volumes, realizations, margins and certain
other items in the report are based on a portion of the quarter and are not
necessarily indicative of Chevron's quarterly results to be reported on January
30, 2009. The reader should not place undue reliance on this data. 

Unless noted otherwise, all commentary is based on two months of the fourth
quarter 2008 versus full third quarter 2008 results. 

UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

The table that follows includes information on production and price indicators
for crude oil and natural gas for specific markets. Actual realizations may vary
from indicative pricing due to quality and location differentials and the effect
of pricing lags. International earnings are driven by actual liftings, which may
differ from production due to the timing of cargoes and other factors.

1 The Avg. Brent Spot Price is based on Platts daily assessments, using
Chevron`s internal formula to produce a quarterly average. Previously it was
based on daily prices provided by WSJ Market Data Group. 

Total U.S. oil-equivalent production during the first two months of the fourth
quarter was 39,000 barrels per day lower than in the third quarter due mainly to
the residual impact of the September hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico.
International liquids production increased roughly 10 percent, primarily the
result of the completion of the expansion project and annual turnaround
activities at the Tengiz Field in Kazakhstan, along with the continued ramp-up
of production at the Agbami Field offshore Nigeria. 

U.S. crude oil realizations for the first two months of the fourth quarter
declined about $50 per barrel to $61.70. International liquids unit realizations
of $53.29 per barrel for the two-month period were also approximately $50 per
barrel lower. Crude-oil realizations worldwide in December 2008 are expected to
be significantly lower than the average for October and November. U.S. natural
gas realizations decreased $3.66 to $4.98 per thousand cubic feet during the
first two months of the fourth quarter, while average international natural gas
realizations were off slightly to $5.30 per thousand cubic feet. 

U.S. upstream earnings in the fourth quarter are expected to benefit by about
$625 million from an asset-exchange transaction. U.S. earnings in the third
quarter included gains of $350 million on asset sales. Additionally, full fourth
quarter hurricane-related charges are projected to be lower than in the third
quarter. 

DOWNSTREAM - REFINING, MARKETING AND TRANSPORTATION

The table that follows includes industry benchmark indicators for refining and
marketing margins. Actual margins realized by the company may differ
significantly due to location and product mix effects, planned and unplanned
shutdown activity and other company-specific and operational factors.

Refining indicator margins worldwide for the full fourth quarter declined
significantly from the third quarter. Marketing indicator margins in the U.S.
increased somewhat in the full fourth quarter. Comparing October and November to
the third quarter, marketing indicator margins outside the U.S. were mixed. 

As in the third quarter, full fourth quarter downstream earnings are expected to
include sizeable gains from provisionally priced crudes and derivatives,
resulting from sharply falling commodity prices. 

During the first two months of the fourth quarter, U.S. refinery crude-input
volumes increased 19,000 barrels per day partly due to the absence of
hurricane-related constraints at the company`s refinery in Pascagoula,
Mississippi. Outside the U.S., refinery crude-input volumes declined 13,000
barrels per day largely reflecting planned maintenance at refineries in Thailand
and South Korea.

In the Chemicals segment, full fourth quarter earnings are expected to decline
in part due to lower petrochemical volumes. 

ALL OTHER

The company`s general guidance for the quarterly net after-tax charges related
to corporate and other activities is between $250 million and $300 million. For
the full fourth quarter, these charges are expected to be well above the high
end of the range. Due to foreign currency effects and the potential for
irregularly occurring accruals related to income taxes, pension settlements and
other matters, actual results may significantly differ from the guidance range
or current projections.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds breakdown of U.S. renewable energy supplies, comment on
a carbon tax)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tom Doggett&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Jan 8 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) CEO Rex
Tillerson said on Thursday it would be difficult to meet
President-elect Barack Obama's goal to significantly boost U.S.
alternative energy production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a speech at George Mason University in Fairfax,
Virginia, Obama said he wanted the United States to double its
output of alternative energy sources during the next three
years as part of his plan to revive the American economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think that's going to be very challenging to do,"
Tillerson told reporters following a speech at the Woodrow
Wilson Center in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the United States will not be able to double
biofuels output during that period and there was not enough
manufacturing capacity to build the wind turbines needed to
meet Obama's goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm not wanting to be critical of his aspirational goal.
Aspirational goals are good because they challenge us all to go
out and find the right answer," Tillerson said of Obama's
plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he added: "Let's be realistic about timeframes. Let's
not fool ourselves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite calls for more alternative energy use, he said,
"for the foreseeable future" the world will rely on oil and
natural gas for 60 percent of its energy needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Renewable energy sources, which include solar, wind,
hydroelectric, geothermal, biofuels and other biomass,
accounted for 7 percent of U.S. energy supplies in 2007,
according to the Energy Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson said the slowdown in the global economy would be
temporary and then strong energy demand from emerging nations
will return.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also said that even with the weak economy, Exxon
remained committed to investing in projects to meet future
energy demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the the company was sticking with its $125 billion
capital spending budget planned for the next five years,
despite the steep drop in oil prices and the global economic
slowdown. Any changes to the capital spending budget will be
announced in March at a meeting with analysts, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Tillerson reiterated that it would be better
for Congress to pass climate change legislation that levies a
carbon tax to curb greenhouse gas emissions, instead of
imposing a complicated cap-and-trade system that allows
businesses to buy and sell pollution permits to spew
emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tackling climate change is a top priority for the incoming
Obama administration and the Democratic-majority Congress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tillerson said a carbon tax, which could be tacked on to
fuel supplies and electricity consumption, was the most
efficient way to reflect the cost of carbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By comparison, a cap-and-trade system is difficult to
verify, requires new government regulators and "a Wall Street
of emissions brokers," he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc has chosen Microsoft Corp to provide Internet search services for cell phones, in what is seen as a blow to rivals Google Inc and Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verizon Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg said on Wednesday that Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer would announce the deal later in the day at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. Seidenberg, speaking at a Citigroup conference, gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement follows more than a year of speculation on whom would become the default mobile search provider for Verizon Wireless, which is set to surpass ATT Inc as the No. 1 U.S. mobile carrier after it closes its purchase of smaller operator Alltel later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's certainly a feather in Microsoft's cap. Tough news for Google and tougher news for Yahoo," CCS Insight analyst John Jackson said of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made a bid for Yahoo last year, but walked away after they disagreed on price. Investors have been skeptical about whether the software company can win online advertising revenue away from Google and Yahoo, which are both stronger than Microsoft in the Internet search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft really needed to win that," Nielsen's head of telecom research, Roger Entner, said about the Verizon deal. "It gives them a good fighting chance. Otherwise they would have been almost insurmountably behind Google" in mobile search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the deal was not likely to change how many Verizon Wireless customers use their phones to surf the Web, Jackson said. While the details of the agreement have yet to be revealed, he said Google may have been a better choice to help Verizon offer personalized Web services, such as delivering ads that are relevant to users' interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ultimate goal in mobility is contextual awareness and the delivery of highly personalized experiences," Jackson said. "These are competencies Google has in spades, so it may be that Verizon's customers ultimately end up with an inferior experience relative to what Google might enable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported the two companies were in negotiations and that Microsoft would share with Verizon revenue from advertisements shown in response to cell phone Web searches. Other previous reports had said Verizon was exploring a deal with Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verizon shares rose 1.27 percent to $31.90 in on the New York Stock Exchange. Amid a broad tech slump following a revenue warning from bellwether Intel Corp, Microsoft shares fell 6.02 percent to $19.51 on the Nasdaq, where Google shares fell 3.61 percent to $322.01 and Yahoo shares fell 2.23 percent to $12.71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Tiffany Wu; Editing by Derek Caney and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pre-Show Events Including Ballmer Keynote and Major Product Launches Build
Excitement on Eve of 2009 CES
LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
A first time keynote address from Microsoft`s Steve Ballmer and cutting-edge
product launches fueled momentum on the eve of the 2009 International CES&#174;.
Produced by the Consumer Electronics Association (CEA)&#174;, the 2009 International
CES, the world`s largest tradeshow for consumer technology, opened today in Las
Vegas and runs through Sunday, January 11. 

"The pre-CES events created an incredible buzz throughout Las Vegas and around
the globe as the world waits in anticipation for the innovative products that
will launch this week from the International CES," said Gary Shapiro, president
and CEO, CEA. "With 2,700 exhibitors, including 300 new technology companies,
spanning 1.7 million net square feet of exhibit space, the products introduced
at this year`s CES will change the shape of our industry and energize the global
economy." 

During a market research presentation on Tuesday afternoon, CEA released the
Global CE Sales and Forecast. According to new data from CEA and the Gfk Group,
CEA projected worldwide revenue for consumer electronics will grow more than
four percent to reach $724 billion in 2009. 

On Tuesday evening, the fifth annual CES Unveiled: The Official Press Event of
the International CES, launched the pre-CES media events at the Sands Expo and
Convention Center/The Venetian. The event hosted a record number of more than
900 media, which was a 10 percent increase over the 2008 event. With 56
exhibitors, including AMD, Boxee, Lenovo and Phoenix Technologies, CES Unveiled
showcased the latest products and technologies in home networking, text to sign
language technologies, innovative gaming keyboards, embedded technologies,
digital imaging and more. 

Product debuts continued on Wednesday with CES` Press Day, which featured 11
exhibitor press conferences. CES exhibitors making product announcements
included LG, which announced a wireless wristwatch phone with video chat and
text messaging capabilities; NETGEAR, which introduced an Internet TV player and
a 3G Mobile Broadband router and Panasonic, which unveiled the world`s thinnest
Plasma TV, measuring one third of an inch thick, with NeoPDP technology making
the product very energy efficient. 

Steve Ballmer, CEO of Microsoft Corporation, delivered his first CES keynote
address on Wednesday evening. Ballmer discussed the economy and noted that the
challenges we face today should be viewed with optimism. "No matter what happens
with the economy, our digital lives will only get richer," he said. 

Ballmer outlined three opportunities that lay ahead for the technology industry
- the convergence of the PC, phone and TV; a more natural consumer interaction
with devices that will incorporate speech and hand gestures and the connected
experience between devices. 

Ballmer announced that Windows 7 is on track to deliver the ultimate Windows
experience, complete with "simplicity, reliability and speed." A beta version
will be available for worldwide download on Friday. Ballmer also announced
exciting partnerships with Facebook, Verizon and Dell, which will pre-install
Windows Live and Live Search on its entire consumer line of PCs. 

Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft`s Entertainment &amp; Devices Division, returned
to the CES keynote stage to discuss the latest in Microsoft gaming. Bach
announced the upcoming release of two new Halo titles, Halo Wars in February,
and Halo 3ODST in the fall.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Jan 8 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) CEO Rex
Tillerson said on Thursday it would be difficult to meet U.S.
President-elect Barack Obama's goal to double alternative
energy production over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "I think that's going to be very challenging to do,"
Tillerson told reporters following a speech to the Woodrow
Wilson Center. He said the U.S. will not be able to double
biofuels output during that period and there is not enough
manufacturing capacity to build the wind turbines needed to
meet Obama's goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Tillerson said the the company is sticking with
its $125 billion capital spending budget planned for the next
five years, despite the steep drop in oil prices and the global
economic slowdown. Any changes to the company's capital
spending budget will be announced in March at a meeting with
analysts, he said.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Eight of the largest companies in the world familiar with the challenges of
corporate blogging and social media will be presenting case studies at BlogWell
on January 22 in Chicago. 

Social media executives from Allstate, H Block, The Home Depot, Mayo Clinic,
Procter &amp; Gamble, Walmart, Sharpie, and the US Coast Guard will discuss how they
engage fans, create content, deploy internal social media tools, handle BtoB
blogging, and work with agencies. 

"Large corporations face a different set of questions when they engage in social
media," said Andy Sernovitz, CEO of GasPedal and the Blog Council. "BlogWell is
the only event where the executives who actually are doing this can share advice
on coordinating social media across the enterprise." 

The Chicago event is the second of its kind, following the initial BlogWell in
San Jose last October where representatives from companies such as
Alcatel-Lucent, Allstate, Charles Schwab, Cisco Systems, eBay, FedEx, Google,
Graco, The Home Depot, HP, Humana, IBM, Intel, Intuit, Kaiser Permanente,
Mashable, Mayo Clinic, Meritage Homes, Nokia, Oracle, Orange, PayPal,
Petro-Canada, Progressive Insurance, RE/Max, Sage Software, SanDisk, Siemens,
Sony, Sun Microsystems, Symantec, TiVo, Tyson Foods, UPS, VMware, Wal-Mart,
Wells Fargo, Weyerhaeuser and Yahoo! joined in the social media discussions. 

Past case studies have focused on video blogging (vlogging), using blogging to
build brand trust, allowing employees to engage independently in social media,
using Twitter as a customer service tool, disclosure policies, social media
monitoring, managing the quickly changing technology of social media and
connecting with hundreds of millions of customers. 

The event is sponsored by GasPedal and the Blog Council. Learn more about

&lt;p&gt;  ISSAQUAH, WA, Jan 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
McObject(R) today announced its eXtremeDB(TM) in-memory and on-disk
embedded database has received IBM's "Ready for IBM Rational Software"
validation, demonstrating eXtremeDB's ability to integrate as a plug-in
for IBM Telelogic Rhapsody and enable faster time-to-market of embedded
software that requires embedded data management.

    With Rhapsody configured to work with eXtremeDB, developers can visually
model their application or system, access eXtremeDB's application
programming interfaces (SQL/ODBC or native), and generate code that
interacts with the database from within Rhapsody.

    McObject's plug-in addresses all integration issues between eXtremeDB and
Rhapsody, providing seamless access to database features after a quick and
fully automated installation. The integration incorporates eXtremeDB steps
into Rhapsody's code generation and compilation steps, and makes eXtremeDB
functions available via the Rhapsody Intellivisor.

    Rhapsody projects often must share data between software components. The
eXtremeDB in-memory database system is a safe way to meet this requirement
without resorting to global variables, shared memory, and "homegrown" code
to manage concurrent access. The eXtremeDB plug-in adds a handset project
to Rhapsody's example programs, illustrating how the embedded software in
a mobile phone would append a 'recent calls' list.

    "Complex embedded systems development projects gain software quality and
shorten development cycles by using Rhapsody's automated,
graphically-driven approach to modeling and code generation. But
increasingly, Rhapsody users working in military, aerospace,
telecommunications and other embedded systems fields find that their
applications must also manage large volumes of complex data. That's when
developers turn to eXtremeDB for a solution," McObject Chief Operating
Officer Chris Mureen said

    "McObject's relationship with IBM, and the resulting Rhapsody-eXtremeDB
plug-in, ensure that clients can capture the benefits of both companies'
technologies in a seamlessly integrated tool set," he said.

    "eXtremeDB's 'Ready for IBM Rational' validation clearly signals to
organizations using IBM Rational software tools that they can easily
integrate McObject's tiny-footprint embedded database with Rhapsody in C,"
said Stephen Lauzon, senior manager, ISV Strategy and Ready for IBM
Rational Software. "We're pleased that this plug-in is available to
customers."

    Users of IBM Rational's Rhapsody in C can download the free eXtremeDB
integration from McObject's Web site.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc picked Microsoft Corp to provide Internet search services for cell phones, in what is seen as a blow to rivals Google Inc and Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Verizon Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg announced the deal at a Citigroup conference on Wednesday and Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer confirmed it later in the day at the Consumer Electronics Show. Neither executive gave any details of terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm also thrilled to announce a new long-term partnership with Verizon to offer our (Windows) Live services on all Verizon phones," Ballmer said at CES in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement follows more than a year of speculation on who would become the default mobile search provider for Verizon Wireless, which is set to surpass ATT Inc as the No. 1 U.S. mobile carrier after it closes its purchase of smaller operator Alltel later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's certainly a feather in Microsoft's cap. Tough news for Google and tougher news for Yahoo," CCS Insight analyst John Jackson said of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made a bid for Yahoo last year, but walked away after they disagreed on price. Investors have been skeptical about whether the software company can win online advertising revenue away from Google and Yahoo, which are both stronger than Microsoft in the Internet search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft really needed to win that," Nielsen's head of telecom research, Roger Entner, said about the Verizon deal. "It gives them a good fighting chance. Otherwise they would have been almost insurmountably behind Google" in mobile search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the deal was not likely to change how many Verizon Wireless customers use their phones to surf the Web, CCS Insight's Jackson said. While the details of the agreement have yet to be revealed, he said Google may have been a better choice to help Verizon offer personalized Web services, such as delivering ads that are relevant to users' interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ultimate goal in mobility is contextual awareness and the delivery of highly personalized experiences," Jackson said. "These are competencies Google has in spades, so it may be that Verizon's customers ultimately end up with an inferior experience relative to what Google might enable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported the two companies were in negotiations and that Microsoft would share with Verizon revenue from advertisements shown in response to cell phone Web searches. Other previous reports had said Verizon was exploring a deal with Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Verizon shares rose 1.27 percent to $31.90 in on the New York Stock Exchange. Amid a broad tech slump following a revenue warning from bellwether Intel Corp, Microsoft shares fell 6.02 percent to $19.51 on the Nasdaq, where Google shares fell 3.61 percent to $322.01 and Yahoo shares fell 2.23 percent to $12.71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the economy, Ballmer said the tech industry faced some really big challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It feels like we've entered a period of reduced expectation, a time when we may be tempted to temper our optimism and scale back our ambition," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Companies and industries that continue to pursue innovation during tough economic times will achieve significant competitive advantage positioning themselves for growth far more effectively than companies that pull back," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He noted that Microsoft would continue to spend more on research and development than others. It invested more than $8 billion last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Franklin Paul and Tiffany Wu; Editing by Derek Caney and Matthew Lewis.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) plans to let consumers test the next generation of its computer operating system, Windows 7, starting on Friday and said the new software is "absolutely on track."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wall Street has identified the timely launch of retail sales of Windows 7 as one of the critical challenges for Microsoft this year, after Windows Vista debuted 12 to 15 months late in January 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7 is "absolutely on track," Robbie Bach, president of entertainment  devices at Microsoft, told Reuters in an interview at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined to give a specific release date beyond the beta testing on January 9, though he reiterated Microsoft's pledge to deliver Windows 7 around three years after Vista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Collins Stewart analyst Sandeep Aggarwal, the market expects Windows 7 to debut in November 2009. "However, Vista was (late) and it did cost Microsoft dearly in terms of loss of many senior executives, pressure from partners, and increasing competition," he said in a research note this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, the world's biggest maker of software, has said Windows 7 will incorporate touch screen technology and allow users to more easily personalize the system. It promised more user-friendly features, such as a new taskbar that previews all open windows from a single application by hovering over the program's icon. Another new feature, "Jump Lists," provides updated lists of recently worked-on documents or oft-visited websites without first having to open Microsoft Word or an Internet browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At CES, Microsoft also announced a series of new deals designed to show its ability to ride out the economic crisis that has hurt spending on personal computers. Shares of Microsoft fell 6 percent on Wednesday after chip giant Intel Corp (INTC.O) alarmed tech investors by issuing yet another revenue warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bach said he expects Microsoft to emerge from the economy's troubles "a much stronger company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The economy is going through a reset," Bach said. "In the short term, that means that every business is having some impact. We are going to manage through that and come out the other end of that reset a much stronger company with a great product lineup."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer is expected later on Wednesday to give details of the company's deal to provide mobile Internet search services to Verizon Communications Inc (VZ.N), a contract that it won over rivals Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bach also said Dell Inc DELL.O had agreed to put Windows Live -- an online hub for personal services ranging from e-mail, instant messaging, and photos to Web applications and links to social networking site such as Facebook and LinkedIn -- on all new Dell computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also introduce a new "Halo Wars" video game for the XBox console in March, and an online game show channel on XBox Live, Bach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You are going to see us continue to invest in technologies," he said. Microsoft has "tremendous optimism about where the market is going and what the opportunities are over the next five years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(To see blog posts from the Consumer Electronics Show, please visit MediaFile at blogs.reuters.com/mediafile.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 08 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded four real
estate investment trusts (REITs), saying it remained cautious
on the commercial real estate industry and expected flat to
negative 15 percent total returns in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage removed Public Storage (PSA.N) from its
conviction buy list and downgraded Vornado Realty Trust (VNO.N)
to "neutral" from "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also downgraded CBL  Associates Properties Inc (CBL.N)
and UDR Inc (UDR.N) to "sell" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a note to clients, analyst Jonathan Habermann said he
expects REITs to deliver sub-par returns for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The continuing turmoil in the credit markets has resulted
in a sharp reduction in the availability of debt capital for
the CRE (commercial and real estate) industry, even for assets
with performing loans, not to mention record wide spreads," he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broker also cited limited financing options, even for
REITs with better-positioned balance sheets, along with
deteriorating fundamentals as the reason for forecasting yet
another negative year for the industry.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 8 (Reuters) - The Nasdaq turned positive to
trade little changed on Thursday, helped by a rise in Microsoft

dim outlook kept the Dow and the SP 500 in negative

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jan 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Sky IT Group are helping fashion and apparel
suppliers, such as New York-based Theory, take advantage of consumer
trends more intelligently by equipping them with a powerful software as a
service (SaaS) offering.

    For many years, consumer product companies have relied on manually
intensive reporting techniques, such as spreadsheets, that do not
automatically update information or combine data from several sources,
making it difficult to track sales trends and make business decisions.
These methods also have not proven to be cost effective as companies grow
their businesses.

    Utilizing IBM's DB2 database software and IBM BladeCenter server
technology, Sky IT Group has developed SkyPAD, a SaaS-based dashboard for
the consumer products industry designed to allow manufacturers,
distributors and retailers to view their product sales performance at the
store level. It provides statistical, graphical and image views of
products sold at retail stores, allowing suppliers and retailers to make
production, sales and merchandising decisions based on real-time facts.

    SkyPAD brings a huge amount of data together from the user's enterprise
resource planning (ERP) system, allowing sales executives and
merchandisers to "slice and dice" information and make informed
production, orders and markdown decisions based on real-time product
sales performance. As a SaaS-based offering, it eliminates the cost of
purchasing and maintaining an in-house solution for its users.

    After integrating SkyPAD in less than four weeks, the apparel company
Theory used the Web-based tool to improve the efficiency of running its
business. Theory fully linked its ERP data with its retailers' data to
better identify marketplace trends. For example, if data indicated that
sales of a certain color cardigan steadily increased while sales of
another color decreased, the company is able to follow the trend and
increase shipments of the more popular color cardigan in a more timely
manner.

    "Prior to implementing SkyPAD, we had a static service that would be
updated only once per week and it wasn't readily accessible by all who
needed the information," said Keitaro Shigemasa, chief information officer
for Theory. "We now have a much more flexible platform where information
sharing has improved, we are able to easily integrate data from retailers
with our internal ERP data, and our overall running costs have
significantly decreased."

    With SkyPAD, merchandisers, sales groups and others are better equipped
with information to deal with both customers and retail buyers, and it
helps users make more informed decisions on merchandise allocations within
customers' retail stores.

    "It was our goal to help our customers achieve greater visibility of the
supply chain and increase their revenues by efficiently managing their
inventory," said Jay Hakami, president and CEO of Sky IT Group. "Through
our partnership with IBM, we extended our value proposition for our
consumer products customers and help them see greater return on their IT
investment."

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI, Taiwan--(Business Wire)--
CyberLink Corporation (TSE:5203.TW) is pleased to announce that PowerDVD will be
utilized by Microsoft Corp. in a demonstration of their newest version of
Windows Media Center, for Windows 7. This demo will be shown in the Microsoft
booth (7144), in the Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center. Additional
demonstrations of the forthcoming version of PowerDVD will be available to PC
and Consumer Electronic manufacturers and members of the press by appointment,
in CyberLink`s private suite in the Hilton Hotel. 

CyberLink has been working closely with Microsoft to support many of the
advanced capabilities of Windows 7. PowerDVD Cinema mode has been designed to
automatically integrate with Windows Media Center to enable full Blu-ray
playback capability on PC equipped with the appropriate hardware. PowerDVD
Cinema mode integrates seamlessly with the advanced user experience that Windows
Media Center provides and allows consumers to be able to use a remote control to
select and watch Blu-ray titles from the comfort of their couch. PowerDVD also
provide a great user experience when launched directly from Windows, with new
and exciting ways for everyone to browse and enjoy movies and video files on any
Windows desktop or laptop PC. 

TrueTheater HD, one of the new video technology CyberLink will demonstrate in
PowerDVD, provides the capability to up-sample videos and transform standard
definition video files, or DVD titles into high-definition quality. This would
allow users to enjoy DVDs today in high definition quality. 

"We are proud that PowerDVD is Microsoft`s choice to support Blu-ray Disc
playback for Windows 7," said Alice H. Chang, CEO of CyberLink. "PowerDVD is the
leading DVD, Blu-ray Disc and AVCHD movie player software application, chosen by
top-brand PCs and optical disc drives purchased by consumers and businesses
around the world. We are excited to demonstrate the smooth integration and the
incredible sights and sounds of Blu-ray disc movies for Windows 7 at the coming
CES."

&lt;p&gt;Jan 8 (Reuters) - J. P. Morgan Securities upgraded Lennar
Corp (LEN.N) as it expects the homebuilder to perform
relatively better than peers, while downgrading Pulte Homes Inc
(PHM.N) on recent outperformance of the company's shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lennar is not likely to take large impairments in 2009,
given its above average core profitability, and as a result is
estimated to have a lower level of book value contraction by
the end of the year, JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lennar's 2009-end book value is expected to contract 13
percent, below the group's 19 percent average decline, the
brokerage said and raised the stock to "overweight" from
"neutral".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan, which expects Pulte's 2009-end book value to
contract 29 percent, downgraded the stock to "neutral" from
"overweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite Pulte's above-average owned land position, it has
taken relatively lower impairments to date, and is therefore
more likely to take larger impairments over the next several
quarters, the brokerage added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pulte shares have gained 33 percent and Lennar shares have
lost as much in the last 12 months, versus the group's 23
percent decline, JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage has a price target of $8.50 on both Lennar
and Pulte stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lennar shares closed at $10.57, while Pulte stock closed at
$12.05 Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Ballmer quotes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Ritsuko Ando and Sinead Carew&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LAS VEGAS Jan 7 (Reuters) - Verizon
Communications Inc (VZ.N) picked Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) to
provide Internet search services for cell phones, in what is
seen as a blow to rivals Google Inc (GOOG.O) and Yahoo Inc
(YHOO.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Verizon Chief Executive Ivan Seidenberg announced the deal
at a Citigroup conference on Wednesday and Microsoft CEO Steve
Ballmer confirmed it later in the day at the Consumer
Electronics Show. Neither executive gave any details of terms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm also thrilled to announce a new long-term partnership
with Verizon to offer our (Windows) Live services on all
Verizon phones," Ballmer said at CES in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement follows more than a year of speculation on
who would become the default mobile search provider for Verizon
Wireless, which is set to surpass ATT Inc (T.N) as the No. 1
U.S. mobile carrier after it closes its purchase of smaller
operator Alltel later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's certainly a feather in Microsoft's cap. Tough news
for Google and tougher news for Yahoo," CCS Insight analyst
John Jackson said of the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft made a bid for Yahoo last year, but walked away
after they disagreed on price. Investors have been skeptical
about whether the software company can win online advertising
revenue away from Google and Yahoo, which are both stronger
than Microsoft in the Internet search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft really needed to win that," Nielsen's head of
telecom research, Roger Entner, said about the Verizon deal.
"It gives them a good fighting chance. Otherwise they would
have been almost insurmountably behind Google" in mobile
search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the deal was not likely to change how many Verizon
Wireless customers use their phones to surf the Web, CCS
Insight's Jackson said. While the details of the agreement have
yet to be revealed, he said Google may have been a better
choice to help Verizon offer personalized Web services, such as
delivering ads that are relevant to users' interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The ultimate goal in mobility is contextual awareness and
the delivery of highly personalized experiences," Jackson said.
"These are competencies Google has in spades, so it may be that
Verizon's customers ultimately end up with an inferior
experience relative to what Google might enable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, The Wall Street Journal reported the two
companies were in negotiations and that Microsoft would share
with Verizon revenue from advertisements shown in response to
cell phone Web searches. Other previous reports had said
Verizon was exploring a deal with Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Verizon shares rose 1.27 percent to $31.90 in on the New
York Stock Exchange. Amid a broad tech slump following a
revenue warning from bellwether Intel Corp (INTC.O), Microsoft
shares fell 6.02 percent to $19.51 on the Nasdaq, where Google
shares fell 3.61 percent to $322.01 and Yahoo shares fell 2.23
percent to $12.71.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the economy, Ballmer said the tech industry faced some
really big challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It feels like we've entered a period of reduced
expectation, a time when we may be tempted to temper our
optimism and scale back our ambition," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Companies and industries that continue to pursue
innovation during tough economic times will achieve significant
competitive advantage positioning themselves for growth far
more effectively than companies that pull back," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He noted that Microsoft would continue to spend more on
research and development than others. It invested more than $8
billion last year.

deals that could get done -- or that at least make sense to us -- in 2009. 

1.) Pfizer Ltd. (NYSE: PFE) is sitting on over $30 billion in cash and the
Lipitor patent expiration in 2012 is bearing down like a freight train.
Management needs to find new areas of growth. Pfizer has also mentioned in the
past that they are keen on expanding the biologic business. 

With "all deal sizes" on the table, the best move we see for Pfizer in 2009 is
to acquire big-cap biotech firm Biogen Idec (Nasdaq: BIIB). We have heard rumors
of a Pfizer-Amgen (Nasdaq: AMGN) combination, but Biogen would be a lot easier
to swallow. The deal would give Pfizer several new revenue drivers and an
enormous biologic pipeline for about a fourth of the price of Amgen. Biogen's
core focus in central nervous system disorders, oncology, and inflammatory
disease is just what Pfizer is looking for. Biogen also bring a massive biologic
manufacturing footprint that will help Pfizer commercialize its next-generation
portfolio. 

Intel: 3 Concerns Plus Another

Intel Corp. (Nasdaq: INTC) has experienced very slow growth over the last four
years. This was mainly due to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NYSE: AMD) emerging
as a competitor in the microprocessor, motherboard and chipset markets. 

Costs have continued to outpace revenue growth. Against the 12.1% revenue
increase in the 2004-2007 period, COGS [cost of goods sold] increased 24.9%,
while operating expenses (R and SG) increased 10.8%. This brought down the
operating margin from 30.1% in 2004 to 25.6% in 2007. While 2008 could develop
into a good year in terms of operating margins, we expect margins to decline
again in 2009. 

Although notebooks are growing strongly, the company is seeing increasing demand
for the lower-end variety. This is mainly due to the increasing demand from
several emerging economies. 

It now appears as though you can add macro economic and inventory concerns to
the mix, as the firm warned for the 2nd time this quarter that revenue would be
falling to levels not seen since the June of 2006 quarter. ($8.2 billion).

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY), Sanofi (NYSE: SNY), Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), St.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Bristol a Good Buyout Candidate

Growth of mega-blockbuster Plavix is helping Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY)
drive EPS growth up near 16% in 2008. Patent expirations loom very large in
Bristol's future starting in 2011 when the Plavix patent expires. 

That being said, the company does have an attractive mid-to-late-stage pipeline,
and the company has been dramatically working to reduce costs and shed less
profitable and non-core businesses. We believe the company is an attractive
take-over candidate at this level for a larger pharma name such as Sanofi (NYSE:
SNY) or Pfizer (NYSE: PFE). EPS growth rate is near the top of bigpharma. We
expect the shares to trade up near $27. 

St. Jude Medical Trends Favorable

Headquartered in St. Paul, Minnesota, St. Jude Medical, Inc. (NYSE: STJ) was
founded in 1976 and designs, manufactures and distributes medical devices to
treat cardiovascular and neurological conditions. The company employs
approximately 12,000 employees. In 2007, the company had net sales of $3.8
billion. In first quarter 2008, 53% of the company's revenue came from the
domestic market with 47% outside the U.S. 

We look for global demographic trends -- aging populations in developed nations
and the rapid urbanization of developing countries to fuel long-term growth in
this stock. These trends both give rise to growing demand for cardiovascular
health care. 

Hold EBAY Ahead of Earnings

Online auctioneer eBay Inc. (NASDAQ: EBAY) is the world's largest online trading
community. The company provides niche online services that generated $7.6
billion in sales in 2007. 

We are leaving our fourth quarter estimate at $0.38, but we are lowering our
estimates for 2009. We now expect eBay to earn $1.68 in 2008 and $1.56 in 2009.
While the stock is trading at less than 10x our 2009 EPS estimate, we are not
recommending investors buy shares at this time. That's because growth eBay's
core business continues to slow, as macro headwinds and competitive pressures
continue to weigh on the company's gross merchandise volume.

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS--(Business Wire)--
The Associated Press today unveiled two new concept applications for Microsoft
Mediaroom-based connected TV services that gives TV viewers a new way to blend
original news content with rich interactive services from the Internet. The
concept applications are designed to complement the traditional TV viewing
experience with more immersive and engaging capabilities. 

AP built a fast, flexible and automated AP news ticker widget with ES3, a
Canadian software development company specializing in applications that leverage
broadband Internet. The ticker delivers headlines directly through the Mediaroom
TV Dashboard - an application that enables subscribers of Mediaroom-powered
services to access local news and information instantly while watching other TV
programming content. 

At the same time, AP is debuting AP red carpet events - acelebrity news
application featuring up-to-the-minute information, photos and video clips from
the hottest red carpet events. Both the AP news ticker widget and AP red carpet
events applications could be accessed through a Mediaroom-powered service at a
service providers' discretion. 

International CES attendees can see demos of both AP concept applications on the
Microsoft Mediaroom platform, which is on display at booth No. 7144 in the
Central Hall of the Las Vegas Convention Center through Jan. 11.

"With Microsoft Mediaroom, AP is crossing a significant milestone in its mission
to explore new digital outlets for AP and its member news organizations," said
Jeffrey Litvack, general manager for mobile and emerging products for AP. "By
breaking ground in the digital home entertainment space, we are pushing forward
with the development of AP products tailored to the consumer`s connected,
digital lifestyle. With these applications, viewers could simultaneously access
breaking news from across the nation without missing a second of their favorite
television program, movie, live entertainment or sporting event." 

"The definition of TV is changing as we move from traditional linear consumption
to a two-way experience that`s on the viewers` terms - when and where they want
it," said Christine Heckart, general manager of marketing for the Connected TV
Business Group at Microsoft Corp. "Microsoft`s collaboration with AP offers a
glimpse into how Mediaroom can power content scenarios that embrace this change
to deliver richer, more engaging TV experiences for consumers." 

AP`s entry into the Internet Protocol Television (IPTV) space follows its recent
success in the burgeoning mobile market with the Mobile News Network
(www.apnews.com). The Mobile News Network is the first product resulting from
the AP Digital Cooperative and covers the entire 100 top designated market areas
and boasts a growing number of content contributors -- more than 1,000 news
organizations signed up to provide local news stories. 

About The AP 

The Associated Press is the essential global news network, delivering fast,
unbiased news from every corner of the world to all media platforms and formats.
Founded in 1846, AP today is the largest and most trusted source of independent

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Jan 8 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co (DIS.N) has

the two sides achieved a consensus on the project, the

immediately be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan calls for Shanghai Disneyland to open to the
public in 2013, the newspaper said, citing an expert involved
in the feasibility study for the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney has engaged in on-again, off-again talks for more
than a decade with the Chinese government over plans to build a
large theme park and hotel complex in the southern outskirts of
Shanghai's Pudong district.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those talks were stalled by a Shanghai government scandal
in 2006 and Disney's need to focus on Hong Kong Disneyland,
which opened in 2005 to a string of operational problems and
lacklustre attendance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Shanghai Securities News also said Shanghai Lujiazui
Group and Shanghai Waigaoqiao Group would take part in the
construction of the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in their listed units Shanghai Lujiazui Finance 
Trade Zone Development Co (600663.SS) and Shanghai Wai Gaoqiao
Free Trade Zone Development Co (600648.SS) rose their 10
percent daily limits in morning trade on Thursday, although by
the end of the morning session Shanghai Lujiazui Development
had pared its gains to about 4.6 percent.

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Jan 8 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil
(XOM.N) said on Thursday it has submitted a plan to develop the
giant Natuna D-Alpha gas field, the latest move in a dispute
with Indonesia over its right to participate in the project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Natuna D-Alpha block on Java island has around 222
trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 46 tcf of these are thought to be commercially
recoverable, accounting for roughly a quarter of Indonesia's
total commercially recoverable gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Exxon Mobil and the Indonesian government have been
locked in a dispute over the U.S. major's role in the project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has said that Exxon Mobil's contract giving it a
76 percent share has already expired, whereas the energy major
has said that the contract is valid until January 9, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Maman Budiman, a senior vice president at Exxon Mobil
Indonesia, told Reuters the firm had submitted a development
plan to BPMIGAS, the energy watchdog, and to the director
general of oil and gas at the energy ministry, at the end of
December, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We firmly believe that Natuna D-Alpha contract remains in
force. Natuna is still feasible to be developed, commercially
and technically," Budiman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said that according to the contract, the submission of
the development plan is the next step that must take place
before the deadline on January 9.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has said talks with Exxon Mobil, which has
controlled the block since the 1990s, had stopped on the
offshore gas project due to disagreements on how to split the
gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other unresolved issues with Exxon Mobil on the block,
which is about 1,100 kilometres (680 miles) north of Jakarta
and 200 km east of the West Natuna fields that feed gas to
Singapore, included the length of the U.S. firm's contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia's government has appointed state oil firm
Pertamina as the operator of Natuna, but the state company does
not have the capacity to develop the gas field alone, which is
estimated to need $40 billion in investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pertamina' upstream director Karen Agustiawan has said the
company will keep a 40 percent stake in the Natuna D-Alpha gas
project, while 60 percent will be shared among the partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pertamina has named eight international oil and gas
companies, including Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Chevron (CVX.N) and
France's Total (TOTF.PA), as its potential partners to develop
the giant Natuna D-Alpha gas field.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co intends to submit a plan for a Shanghai theme park to Chinese government officials, the company said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney said it will submit plans for the park, which would be its second resort in China, together with the Shanghai government, but that no deal has been signed and no project has yet been approved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Disney spokesman declined to comment on when the plan will be submitted to government officials and how long it would take the Chinese government to approve the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project must be approved by China's central government in order for it to move forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney proposes to own a 43 percent equity stake in the Shanghai theme park and a local government-owned joint venture holding company would own 57 percent, The Wall Street Journal reported on Friday, citing a person familiar with the matter.

&lt;p&gt;Smart energy management practices drastically reduce greenhouse gas emissions,
earn local bottler environmental award
DOWNEY, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
As part of its global commitment to corporate responsibility and sustainability,
Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE) is nearly complete with a major lighting
retrofit project to reduce energy consumption in its California facilities. The
project will decrease CCE`s energy consumption for lighting by 5.6 million
kilowatt-hours (kWh) a year, with the potential to decrease 113 million
kilowatt-hours over the 20-year life of the new system. This is enough
electricity to power 537 homes annually. The project has earned CCE the Orion
Energy Systems (Nasdaq: OESX) Environmental Stewardship Award, which was
presented today by Orion`s executive vice president Michael Potts to Coca-Cola
Enterprises` executives during a ceremony at its Downey, Calif., production
facility. 

Public officials who attended the event and addressed the audience included the
Mayor of the City of Downey, California, Dn. Mario Guerra, 27th District
California State Senator Alan Lowenthal (D-Long Beach), California Governor
Arnold Schwarzenegger`s Deputy District Director Araceli Gonzalez and U.S.
Senator Dianne Feinstein`s Field Representative Elizabeth Delgado. Also in
attendance were City of Downey 3rd District Councilman Roger Brossmer and 5th
District Councilman Luis Marquez. 

Campbell Hawkins, manager of energy efficiency for Southern California Edison,
the utility that provides power to many of Coca-Cola Enterprises` California
facilities, applauded CCE for its commitment to energy efficiency. Hawkins also
cited the importance of working together with companies like Coca-Cola
Enterprises and Orion Energy Systems to reduce pressure on California`s strained
electrical grid. 

The project entailed replacing more than 4,000 high-intensity discharge (HID)
and fluorescent lights with Orion`s Compact ModularTM, high-intensity
fluorescent (HIF) system at 24 Coca-Cola Enterprises facilities throughout
California. CCE also has installed solar power generating panels on the roof of
its Los Angeles facility, has committed to make all sales and marketing
equipment on average 20 percent more energy efficient by 2010, and has ten
hybrid electric trucks delivering product to customers throughout Los Angeles.
In all, CCE has 142 hybrid electric delivery trucks, giving it the largest fleet
of heavy-duty hybrid delivery trucks in North America. 

Coca-Cola Enterprises has established five strategic focus areas, three of which
- energy conservation/climate change, water stewardship, and sustainable
packaging/recycling - are related to the environment. CCE remains focused on
conserving water in its operations and is in the process of installing
water-efficient technology such as container rinsers that use ionized air rather
than water, silicon-based dry lubricants on its production lines and water
reclamation upgrades. Additionally, the company has worked to increase recycling
rates nationwide through the work of Coca-Cola Recycling. 

"At Coca-Cola Enterprises, corporate responsibility and sustainability is where
the world touches our business and where our business touches the world," said
Terry Fitch, general manager and vice president of Coca-Cola Enterprises` West
Business Unit. "We`re doing everything we can to help reduce our carbon
footprint in California and across the country, because we believe that
responsible and sustainable business practices like this will not only help us
manage through these complex times but will also ensure the long-term growth of
our company, sustainable development in our communities, and protection of the
environment." 

As a result of the 5.6 million kWh annual reduction generated from the lighting
retrofit, Coca-Cola Enterprises will help to divert 3,715 tons of carbon dioxide
(CO2) from entering the atmosphere each year, according to the Environmental
Protection Agency. Also, Coca-Cola Enterprises will reduce the amount of sulfur
dioxide (SO2) released by 15 tons per year and the amount of nitrogen oxides
(NOX) by five tons per year. The power use reduction is the air-scrubbing
equivalent of planting a 1,038-acre forest or the energy equivalent of saving
466,962 gallons of gasoline each year. 

The environmental benefits and energy cost savings of the Coca-Cola Enterprises
project are possible because Orion fixtures are engineered based on the dual
principles of optimizing input energy and maximizing lighting output. Orion`s
patented high-intensity fluorescent lighting platform uses about 50 percent less
energy and provides 50 percent more light than traditional high-intensity
discharge lights, which have been the industry norm since approximately 1960.
Orion systems turn on instantly, provide a more natural type of light, and
operate at a relatively cool 110 degrees. 

"Coca-Cola Enterprises is fast becoming one of the leaders in responsible and
sustainable business practices," said Michael Potts, executive vice president of
Orion. "The State of California benefits from the environmental attributes of
Coca-Cola Enterprises` efforts, including taking significant power off the
electrical grid which tends to lessen the upward pressure that exists on power
prices and the need for new power plants." 

"Lighting accounts for 55 percent of the energy we use in our sales and
distribution centers and ten percent in our production facilities. Therefore,
reducing our lighting energy use by half makes good economic sense for us
because it creates operational efficiencies while protecting the environment,"
added Fitch. 

"This is an historic moment," said California State Senator Alan Lowenthal.
"What we are experiencing here today is a major paradigm shift. Corporate
citizens such as Coca-Cola Enterprises and Orion Energy Systems are saying the
solution to pollution is prevention. The solution to pollution is
sustainability. The solution to pollution is reducing our carbon footprint.
Great corporate citizens like Coca-Cola Enterprises - that is how the United
States will lead the world, so I am just really pleased to be here." 

Orion`s energy efficient technology platform includes its Compact ModularTM
high-intensity fluorescent lighting system, the InteLiteTM wireless control
system and the direct renewable ApolloTM solar light pipe, all of which are
installed as an integrated system in the Downey facility warehouse. The
integrated system was recently internationally recognized with the prestigious
Platts Global Energy award for the single most innovative and sustainable
technology of 2008. The system can reduce energy consumption for lighting in a
commercial/industrial facility for up to ten hours a day during daylight hours
when the electric grid is operating at or near peak capacity. 

Orion has deployed its energy management systems in 4,068 facilities across
North America including 108 of the Fortune 500 companies. Since 2001, Orion
technology has displaced more than 386 megawatts, saving customers more than
$455 million and reducing indirect carbon dioxide emissions by 4 million tons.

 (Adds context to Dow)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday
after government data showed the labor market deteriorated
further in December, raising investor concerns about the
outlook for profits, spending and a deepening recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Citigroup Inc (C.N) fell 5.7 percent after the
Wall Street Journal said the bank may sell its Smith Barney
brokerage, with Morgan Stanley (MS.N) a possible suitor,
prompting question about why it would want to sell one of its
relatively healthier businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Payrolls were cut slightly less than expected, but the U.S.
jobless rate climbed to its highest in nearly 16 years and the
number of jobs lost in October and November was increased,
pressuring already weak consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy shares fell after Chevron Corp (CVX.N) joined a
growing list of bellwether companies warning about profits. It
slid 1.9 percent, making it one of the top drags on the Dow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology shares also took a beating, causing the Nasdaq
to briefly wipe out its 2009 gains, led by shares of Apple Inc
(AAPL.O), off 2.3 percent. Microsoft MSFT.O slid 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rambus (RMBS.O) shares fell as much as 40 percent, its
biggest slide since becoming a public company in 1997, after a
judge ruled on Friday against the company in a patent case with
rival memory chip maker Micron Technologies MU.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is still a lot of bad news in housing and

points, or 1.64 percent, to 8,599.18. The Standard  Poor's 500
Index .SPX slid 19.38 points, or 2.13 percent, to 890.35. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC fell 45.42 points, or 2.81
percent, to 1,571.59.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thus far in 2009, the Dow is off 2 percent, while the SP
500 is down about 1.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sell-off caused the benchmark SP 500 to mark its worst
week since its Nov. 21 intraday bear market low, trimming its
advance since then to about 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. employers slashed 524,000 jobs from payrolls in
December, less than the 550,000 seen in a Reuters poll, but
still bringing total job losses for 2008 to 2.6 million, the
most since 1945. For more see [ID:nN09282664].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Underscoring weakness in the labor market, Boeing (BA.N)
said it would cut 4,500 workers or about 7 percent of the
workforce in its commercial airplane unit. [ID:nN09303414].
Shares slipped 0.8 percent to $44.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In warning about its outlook, Chevron, the second-largest
U.S. oil and gas company, cited the impact of lower energy
prices on exploration and production business. [ID:nN0844693].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares fell to $72.82, while those of rival Exxon
Mobil Corp (XOM.N) declined 1.9 percent to $77.57. On Nasdaq,
shares of Apple, maker of the iPhone, dropped 2.3 percent to
$90.58. The semiconductor index .SOXX was off 3.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. President-elect Barack Obama cited the faltering jobs
market as a reason for his push for a new stimulus plan, set to
include tax cuts and major public works spending that could
total nearly $800 billion. [ID:nN09277196].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Share of Rambus tumbled after a U.S. District Court ruled
it had destroyed documents and so may not enforce patents
against Micron Tech. [ID:nN09276712]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the chip interface maker dropped 39.2 percent to
$11.24 while Micron slid 3.5 percent to $3.29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shortly before reports of the possible Smith Barney sale,
Citigroup (C.N) said former U.S. Treasury secretary Robert
Rubin resigned as senior counselor following months of
criticism of his performance. [ID:nN09307380]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup fell 5.7 percent to $6.75 while Morgan Stanley
rose over 1.3 percent to $19.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another standout was a plunge in shares of Lennar Corp
(LEN.N), the second-largest U.S. home builder, after a letter
questioning a late 1990s transaction involving the company
surfaced on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The letter to the FBI and other authorities from California
pastor Barry Minkow, who served time in jail for stock fraud,
concerned a joint venture between Lennar and a private
developer to build a high-end housing project and golf course
in California. [ID:nN09291128] The company said Minkow had
acted as an agent for a disgruntled litigant and posted false
and inflammatory accusations against the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lennar dropped almost 20 percent to $9.15. The Dow Jones
home construction index .DJUSHB fell 5.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the week, the Dow fell 4.8 percent, the SP shed 4.5
percent and the Nasdaq slid 3.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow has fallen three straight sessions and four of the
last five, and is down nearly 32 percent from 52 weeks ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Volume was light on the New York Stock Exchange, where
about 1.16 billion shares changed hands, below last year's
estimated daily average of 1.49 billion. On the Nasdaq, about
1.93 billion shares traded, also below last year's daily
average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Decliners outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a ratio of
about 5 to 2, while on the Nasdaq about three stocks fell for
every one that rose.

 (Updates to midafternoon, changes byline&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday
after government data showed the labor market deteriorated
further in December, raising investor concerns about the
outlook for profits and a deepening recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Payrolls were cut slightly less than expected, but the U.S.
jobless rate climbed to its highest in nearly 16 years,
pressuring already weak consumer spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Energy shares fell after Chevron Corp (CVX.N) joined a
growing list of bellwether companies warning about their profit
outlooks. Its stock slid as much as 1.2 percent and was off
0.75 percent in midafternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology shares also took a beating, causing the Nasdaq
to briefly wipe out its 2009 gains, led lower by shares of
Apple Inc (AAPL.O) , off 1.45 percent. Cisco Systems (CSCO.O)
slid over 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rambus (RMBS.O) shares fell as much as 40 percent, its
biggest slide since becoming a public company in 1997, after a
judge ruled against the company in a patent case with rival
Micron Technologies MU.N.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The newsflow isn't going to be good," said Kevin
Kruszenski, head of Listed Trading at KeyBanc Capital Markets
in Cleveland. "There is still a lot of bad news in housing and
employment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While the credit situation is beginning to thaw, we're
still a sick patient."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 92.47
points, or 1.06 percent, to 8,649.99. The Standard  Poor's 500
Index .SPX fell 12.81 points, or 1.41 percent, to 896.92. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC stumbled 31.39 points, or 1.94
percent, to 1,585.62.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thus far in 2009, the Dow is off 1.6 percent, while the SP
500 is down about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sell-off caused the benchmark SP 500 to trim its
advance since its Nov. 21 intraday bear-market low to about 19
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Employers slashed 524,000 jobs from their payrolls in
December, less than the 550,000 seen in a Reuters poll,
bringing the total job losses for 2008 to 2.6 million, the most
since 1945. For more see [ID:nN09282664].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Underscoring the weak labor market was news that Boeing
(BA.N) would cut 4,500 workers in its commercial airplane unit
this year, representing about 7 percent of the unit total.
[ID:nN09303414]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When warning about its outlook, Chevron, a Dow component
and the second-largest U.S. oil and gas company, cited the
impact of lower energy prices on its exploration and production
business. [ID:nN0844693].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares fell to $73.46, while those of rival Exxon
Mobil Corp (XOM.N) declined 0.54 percent to $78.66. On Nasdaq,
shares of Apple, the maker of the iPhone, dropped as much as
1.7 percent to $91.15. The semiconductor index .SOXX was off
nearly 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. President-elect Barack Obama cited the faltering jobs
market as a reason in his push for a new stimulus plan set to
include tax cuts and major public works spending that could
total nearly $800 billion. [ID:nN09277196].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rambus shares tumbled after a U.S. District Court ruled on
Friday that the company destroyed documents in a court case and
therefore may not enforce patents against memory chip maker
Micron Tech MU.N. For more, see [ID:nN09276712]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the chip interface maker dropped 36 percent to
$11.76 while Micron slid 2.3 percent to $3.33.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another standout on the day was a plunge in the shares of
Lennar Corp (LEN.N) , the second-largest U.S. home builder,
after a letter questioning a late 1990s transaction involving
the company surfaced on the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The letter to the FBI and other authorities from California
pastor Barry Minkow, who served time in jail for stock fraud,
concerned a joint venture between Lennar and a private
developer to build a high-end housing project and golf course
in California. [ID:nN09291128]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the stock pared losses after the company responded
that Minkow had acted as an agent for a disgruntled litigant
and posted false and inflammatory accusations against the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lennar was off 11.8 percent at $10.07 after dropping more
than 20 percent earlier in the session. The Dow Jones home
construction index .DJUSHB fell 2.24 percent.

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds quotes from spokeswoman, remarks from oil trader)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters)- Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on
Friday it has shut down key processing units, including the
fluid catalytic cracker, at its 150,000-barrel-per-day refinery
in Torrance, Calif., for "few weeks" of planned maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The FCC, the hydrotreater, the alkylation unit, one of the
flare devices and one sulfur recovery unit are down for
maintenance, but the crude unit is not down," Carolin Keith, a
spokeswoman for the refinery, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She said the shutdowns started Dec. 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier, a source familiar with the refinery operations
said the crude unit of the Los Angeles-area refining complex
was included in the planned maintenance work which was expected
to last to the end of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keith did not provide specifics on the duration of the
maintenance work but added: "Officially we're saying it will be
a few weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An oil trader told Reuters that the gasoline-making FCC
unit, which has a capacity of about 100,000 bpd, was expected
to be down until mid-February at Torrance.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 9 (Reuters) - Enron Creditors Recovery Corp, the
successor to the bankrupt energy trader Enron Corp ECSPQ.PK,
settled a five-year legal battle over commercial paper with
Goldman Sachs  Co (GS.N) on Thursday, court filings showed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a bankruptcy court filing in New York, Enron said
Goldman had agreed to pay about $7 million to settle the
lawsuit. Enron had originally sought to recover $383 million
plus interest from Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined to comment on the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In court documents, Enron said Goldman was one of several
investors that had bought and later prematurely redeemed Enron
commercial paper in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the five weeks preceding Enron's Chapter 11 filing, the
company paid out more than $1 billion to fund redemption
requests for the commercial paper before it matured, the court
papers showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enron brought the lawsuit against Goldman and other
investors in 2003, seeking recovery of the funds so that the
money could be shared equally by its creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Enron had sought to recover as much as $870 million from
the investors, according to court papers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once the seventh-largest U.S. company, Enron filed for
Chapter 11 protection from creditors in December 2001 amid an
accounting scandal in which it hid billions of dollars of debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It emerged from bankruptcy in November 2004 and now exists
mainly to sell assets, pay debts and litigate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bankruptcy case is In re: Enron Creditors Recovery
Corp., U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York.

&lt;p&gt;Disney Design-A-Tee Presented by Hanes Store Opens at Downtown Disney Allowing
Guests to Design, Personalize and Immediately Purchase Their Special Vacation
T-Shirts
WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
Hanesbrands Inc. (NYSE:HBI) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) today
officially opened DisneyDesign-a-Tee presented by Hanes, an innovative
next-generation store for apparel souvenirs at the Walt Disney World Resort in
Orlando, Fla. 

The first-of-its-kind interactive T-shirt design and printing store enables
Disney guests to enhance their magical Disney experience with a personalized
custom-designed Hanes T-shirt printed while they wait that is as easy to buy as
souvenir apparel off the rack. And much more fun! 

Guests at Disney Design-a-Tee presented by Hanes, which is located in Downtown
Disney, use touch-screen kiosks for an interactive experience to design their
custom shirts, selecting long-sleeve or short-sleeve T-shirts, choosing from
multiple colors, picking artwork from more than 100 selections featuring Disney
animation and movie characters, and crafting their own text message using a wide
selection of type fonts and colors. 

The design possibilities are infinite, and the shirts are printed on site while
guests wait using premium environmentally friendly water-based ink. Art
selections include multiple designs featuring not only famous characters such as
Mickey and Minnie Mouse, Snow White and others from classic Disney films, but
also characters such as Crush from Finding Nemo, Princess Belle from Beauty and
the Beast, and Tow Mater from Cars. 

"At the Design-a-Tee store, visitors can dream it, design it and watch their
custom Hanes T-shirts being made," said Sidney Falken, senior vice president of
the Hanes brand. "The store combines all the magic of Disney and Hanes to create
immediate one-of-a-kind keepsakes and souvenirs of their visit to Walt Disney
World." 

The grand opening event was attended by guests who were treated to a festive
d&#233;cor, confetti cannons, a giant T-shirt cake and a visit from Disney`s most
famous star, Mickey Mouse. 

Kevin Lansberry, vice president, Downtown Disney operations, and Falken spoke at
the event and invited guests to try their hand at designing their own special
T-shirts. 

"We are thrilled to create another exciting new Downtown Disney venue for our
guests," Lansberry said. "The Disney Design-a-Tee store fits perfectly with our
What Will You Celebrate 2009 campaign. Whether guests are celebrating an
anniversary, a birthday or a special reunion, they can create a special Hanes
t-shirt to show how they feel." 

Disney Design-a-Tee uses a unique application of state-of-the-art technology and
printing equipment in a process designed by Hanesbrands` research and
development team. This is the first application of printing technology that
allows consumers to walk up, design and print a custom message on a T-shirt of
any color with screen-print quality. 

Disney Design A Tee presented by Hanes is one of several critical brand
investments for Hanes as part of a 10-year strategic marketing alliance with
Disney. 

"Hanes is consistently ranked as one of the most recognized and loved apparel
brands in the world, and that brand equity increases when the brand is partnered
with the equally strong Disney brand," Falken said. "Our alliance with Disney
provides a broad range of new and exciting consumer interactions for Hanes and
allows this iconic brand to grow and reach new audiences." 

Disney Design-a-Tee is open every day from 9:30 a.m. to 11 p.m. and is located
at 1790 East Buena Vista Drive. Downtown Disney is open to the general public
and resort guests and is accessible by car and by the Walt Disney World Resort
guest shuttle system. 

T-shirts are available in a wide variety of colors and styles, including long
and short sleeve versions, and come in infant, toddler, youth and adult sizes.
Prices range from $18 to $31. The company expects to add additional apparel
product offerings at a later date at the store. 

In addition to Disney Design-a-Tee presented by Hanes, the Hanesbrands marketing
alliance with Disney includes category exclusivity for select Hanes and Champion
apparel at Walt Disney World Resort, Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, Calif., and
ESPN Zone stores across the country. Naming rights include the Rock `n` Roller
Coaster Starring Aerosmith presented by Hanes and Champion Stadium located in

 (Updates to late morning)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks fell on Friday
after government data showed the labor market crumbled further
in December, adding to worries about the profit outlook and a
deepening recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Payrolls were slashed a bit less than expected but the U.S.
jobless rate climbed to its highest in nearly 16 years, further
pressuring consumer spending and corporate profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Top drags included energy shares after Chevron Corp
(CVX.N), down 1.6 percent, joined a growing list of companies
warning about their profit outlooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology shares also took a beating, causing the Nasdaq
to briefly wipe out its year-to-date gains amid a slide in the
shares of such bellwethers as Apple Inc, off over 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The economic numbers are going to get worse before they
get better. It fits in line with the notion of about a six
percent hit to GDP," said Michael Strauss, chief economist at
Commonfund in Wilton, Connecticut, referring to U.S. gross
domestic product, which measures output of goods and services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Does the market react to today's numbers or does it react
to what today's numbers will mean for fiscal monetary stimulus
and how conditions might change six to nine months from now?
That's going to be the tug of war today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI slid 138.19 points,
or 1.58 percent, to 8,604.27. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX tumbled 16.27 points, or 1.79 percent to 893.46 after
being down 2 percent. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC
plunged 41.96 points, or 2.59 percent, to 1,575.05.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More bleak news on the employment front presents a major
headwind for any recovery in the market. The sell-off caused
the benchmark SP 500 to trim its advance since its Nov. 21
intraday bear-market low to 18 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While payrolls were slashed a bit less than expected --
524,000 people lost their jobs rather than the 550,000 seen in
a Reuters poll -- December's cuts put losses for 2008 at 2.6
million, the most since 1945. For more see [ID:nN09282664].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When warning about its outlook, Chevron, a Dow component
and the second-largest U.S. oil and gas company, cited the
impact of lower energy prices on its exploration and production
business. [ID:nN0844693].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares fell to $73.02. On Nasdaq, shares of Apple
(AAPL.O), the maker of the iPhone, dropped to $90.53. The
semiconductor index .SOXX was off more than 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Responding to recession's grip on the economy, U.S.
President-elect Barack Obama is pushing for a new stimulus plan
set to include tax cuts and major public works spending that
could total nearly $800 billion. [ID:nN09277196].

&lt;p&gt;  REDMOND, WA and LITTLETON, MA, Jan 09 (MARKET WIRE) --

Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Marathon Technologies Corporation
today announced a development and marketing agreement designed to address
the fault tolerant and high availability computing needs for business
customers running Windows Server-based applications in enterprise
information technology departments and data centers. The collaboration is
focused in three areas:


--  Help provide customers who deploy Windows Server 2008 and Marathon
    everRun(R) software a seamless path to extend high availability protection
    to their critical applications.
--  Help provide Windows Server and Marathon everRun customers with the
    ability to select the appropriate level of availability, from failover
    clustering all the way up to system fault tolerance, for each application.
--  Help customers deploying a future version of Hyper-V, Microsoft's
    hypervisor-based virtualization technology, to use Marathon everRun for a
    fault-tolerant virtual infrastructure.
    

    
"Marathon has been working for years to take the complexity and cost
out of fault tolerant computing to bring business resiliency to the
mainstream," said Gary Phillips, president and CEO of Marathon
Technologies. "This expanded relationship with Microsoft will help
provide customers with practical fault tolerance for Windows Server 2008
today and for those customers wishing to consolidate mission critical,
Windows-based applications on Hyper-V in the future."

    The development work is designed to benefit customers in the
following
ways:


--  Streamline setup and installation - Windows Server administrators will
    be able to install Marathon everRun's additional levels of availability in
    minutes.
--  Seamless integration between levels of availability - When
    administrators add Marathon everRun, it will automatically provide them
    with a choice of availability levels.
--  Confidence to run the most critical applications - Windows Server and
    Marathon everRun customers, in both physical and virtual environments, will
    be able to select the business and mission critical applications to get
    component-level and system-level fault tolerance protection.
    

    
The combination of Windows Server and Marathon everRun will help
enable customers to deploy an appropriate level of availability for
each
application:


--  Level One: Failover Clustering included with the Enterprise and
    Datacenter Editions of Windows Server 2008 for high availability that helps

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) expects its fourth-quarter earnings to be significantly lower than the previous quarter due to the impact of lower energy prices on its exploration and production business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil and gas company also said on Thursday its U.S. oil-equivalent production in October and November was 608,000 barrels per day, down from 647,000 the previous quarter and 730,000 in the fourth quarter of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares fell 0.8 percent to $73.62 in after-hours trading, having closed 0.4 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors will now be looking for updates from ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) to see how their performance last quarter compared with Chevron's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the downstream side, Chevron said refining margins fell sharply in December across its reported regions compared with the previous two months, when they turned negative in Latin America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude oil prices averaged about $59 a barrel in the fourth quarter, down by a third from the year before and well below the $147 record seen in July, and these fluctuations have made the refining business less predictable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Refining has been kind of Jekyll and Hyde for everybody from one month to the next," said Brian Youngberg, senior energy and utilities analyst at Edward Jones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because market conditions had changed significantly, Chevron delayed the unveiling of 2009 capital spending plans until later this month from December. It made $15.8 billion in capital and exploratory expenditures in the first nine months of 2008, out of $22.9 billion budgeted in December 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Youngberg said he would be looking out for possible cuts to 2009 spending plans, even though the oil majors had so far avoided any drastic curtailing of projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rex Tillerson, chief executive of Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), said on Thursday the U.S. oil industry leader was sticking with its $125 billion capital spending budget over the next five years, despite all the market turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEMICALS DOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In line with troubles throughout the petrochemical industry, Chevron said its chemicals segment would see fourth- quarter earnings decline due to lower volumes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said international oil-equivalent production in the first two months of the quarter rose to 1.92 million barrels per day from 1.80 million the prior quarter and it expects upstream earnings to benefit by about $625 million from an asset-exchange transaction, without giving details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company also said charges related to corporate and other activities would be well above the high end of its standard guidance of $250 million to $300 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts had been expecting a fourth-quarter profit of $3.66 billion, or $1.84 per share, on revenue of $59.2 billion, according to averages on Reuters Estimates. The company had reported a profit of $2.32 per share a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The quarter's going to be OK -- people weren't expecting a whole lot -- but it's going to come in weaker than expected," Youngberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The San Ramon, California-based company will report on January 30, the first results for new chief financial officer Patricia Yarrington, who took over from Steve Crowe at the start of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Chevron shares have recovered from a two-year low of $55.50 in October, they are still down 10 percent since the start of the fourth quarter, compared with a 15 percent decline in the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index .OIX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Investors await Dec. non-farm payrolls for direction&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron joins companies warning about profit outlook&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * For up-to-the-minute market news, click [STXNEWS/US]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 9 (Reuters) - U.S. stock index futures fell
on Friday on investor unease ahead of government data expected
to show that more than half a million jobs disappeared in
December as recession tightened its grip on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stocks to watch include Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which
forecast fourth-quarter earnings to be significantly lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caution was also apparent overseas, with European benchmark
indexes flat to slightly lower. The key U.S. nonfarm payrolls
report is due at 8:30 a.m. (1330 GMT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A loss of 550,000 jobs, as forecast in a Reuters poll of
economists, would mark the worst single month of job losses in
34 years, while the unemployment rate is expected to rise to a
15-year high of 7.0 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We know the number is not going to be good," said Paul
Mendelsohn, chief investment strategist at Windham Financial
Services in Charlotte, Vermont. "The question is how bad it's
going to be."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 shed 2.90 points, and were below
fair value, a formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract. Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 fell 18
points while Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures fell 2.50 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the forecasts prove correct, 2008 will be the biggest
year of payroll losses since 1945. More bleak news on the
employment front would present a major headwind for any
recovery in the market, with the benchmark SP 500 up 20
percent from its Nov. 21 intraday bear-market low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors worry mounting unemployment will make consumers
more cautious, compounding the fallout from the prolonged
housing downturn and dimming the profit outlook further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When warning about its outlook, Chevron, a Dow component
and the second-largest U.S. oil and gas company, cited the
impact of lower energy prices on its exploration and production
business. For details, see [ID:nN0844693].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares were down nearly 1 percent at $73.51 before
the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S stocks ended mixed on Thursday as news that Citigroup
Inc (C.N) had agreed to support legislation aimed at stemming
home loan foreclosures offset Wal-Mart Stores Inc's (WMT.N)
disappointing sales and outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gloomy economy has U.S. President-elect Barack Obama
making a push for an economic stimulus plan set to include tax
cuts and public works spending that could total nearly $800
billion.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

Intel: 3 Concerns Plus Another

Intel Corp. (NASDAQ: INTC) has experienced very slow growth over the last four
years. This was mainly due to Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NYSE: AMD) emerging
as a competitor in the microprocessor, motherboard and chipset markets. 

Costs have continued to outpace revenue growth. Against the 12.1% revenue
increase in the 2004-2007 period, COGS [cost of goods sold] increased 24.9%,
while operating expenses (R and SG) increased 10.8%. This brought down the
operating margin from 30.1% in 2004 to 25.6% in 2007. While 2008 could develop
into a good year in terms of operating margins, we expect margins to decline
again in 2009. 

Inventories Weigh on Oil Prices

In its weekly report, the Energy Information Administration (EIA) reported
substantial crude oil inventory build. The agency reported that total crude oil
stocks for the week ended January 2 increased by 6.7 million barrels from the
preceding week, significantly above expectations. Current stocks are 15.1% above
the comparable period last year. As such, current stock levels provide for 22.5
days of supply, significantly above the year-earlier level of 18.4 days. 

While the supply overhang remains a critical near-term headwind, we believe that
oil prices have more upside potential than downside risk from current levels. In
the energy space, we would prefer to stay with large-cap integrateds, such as
Exxon (NYSE: XOM), Chevron (NYSE: CVX) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP). We
continue to believe that these names not only have defensive attributes in the
current turbulent market, but also provide for plenty of upside potential from
current depressed levels.

&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO (Hollywood Reporter) - Every kid in Brazil will have an igloo to live in if the Walt Disney Co. has its way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Mouse House isn't trying to bring a new Ice Age to the biggest country in South America; the igloo is a digital fixture of Club Penguin, a virtual world for which Disney paid $350 million 18 months ago, a deal that could cost another $350 million if the property hits performance targets. Its first non-English-language version, operating out of Sao Paulo, launched in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's just one of the signs Disney is in expansion mode on the franchise, aimed squarely at kids 6-14 and once restricted to the U.S, U.K. and Australia. The Brazilian edition will be followed by virtual worlds for other Latin American countries and France. Disney's first Penguin merchandise and videogame extensions rolled out in October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the Penguin brand just starting to feel the power of Disney's infrastructure, now is the time for Disney to make good on its investment. But that will mean competing for kiddie mindshare all over the globe and putting the same weight behind the brand that Disney usually devotes to homegrown properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Does that mean a Pixar movie devoted to the site is coming? Maybe a Disney World ride? Disney isn't saying, but in November, Disney CFO Tom Staggs acknowledged that the company was happy with the acquisition: "Club Penguin actually is doing quite well for us," he said on an earnings call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Launched in late 2005 by three Canadian entrepreneurs under the banner New Horizon Interactive, Penguin allows kids to create and customize their own penguin avatars and then enter a snow-covered virtual world where they can chat, play mini-games or just explore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wasn't just kids who found Penguin appealing-parents who control online access in most households also liked the site's efforts to provide a safe environment for children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within two years of launch, Penguin claimed more than 12 million registered users, of which about 900,000 were premium subscribers typically paying $5.95-$6.95 per month for access to additional features and virtual collectibles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The premium service option has been wildly effective in driving revenue," noted Joey Seiler, editor of Virtual World News. "From what I can tell Club Penguin has been profitable almost since its inception."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lane Merrifield, one of the co-founders of Penguin who joined Disney following the acquisition, suggested one of the reasons they opted to link up with the Mouse House was to drive expansion of the Penguin brand, including internationally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're in a unique position where a lot of international growth has already happened, completely unintentionally," he said. "More than 30% of the Club Penguin audience is outside of North America -- we have kids who are playing English-only game, buying memberships in US dollars from around the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Over the past year, Disney has been busy taking some of its most popular licenses, such as "Pirates of the Caribbean," "Cars" and Tinkerbell and creating virtual worlds around them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with Penguin, that strategy has been somewhat reversed, giving the property the chance to leverage Disney's retail muscle. The recent launch of a toy line includes plush versions of popular characters, a set of figurines as well as an Igloo Playset. The brand was also extended into the lucrative game field with the introduction of "Club Penguin: Elite Penguin Force" for the Nintendo DS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Internet toys are the hottest trend in the toy industry," said Chris Heatherly, vice president of technology and innovation, Disney Consumer Products. "Kids want to play with their toys online as well as in the real world,"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course merchandising is not new in virtual worlds and has already proven to be far more than a branding play. Toronto-based Ganz is estimated to be earning more than $100 million annually from collectible plush toys and accessories kids buy that allow them to unlock virtual goods online at Webkinz World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teemu Huuhtanen, president-North America for the teen-centric global virtual world Habbo Hotel, pointed out that virtual worlds essentially have a choice: either go with an advertising-based model or figure out some way for consumes to foot the bill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with more than 150 virtual worlds for the 18-and-under set already up and running globally according to a recent study by Virtual Worlds Management, companies are getting increasingly sophisticated in figuring out ways to make it all pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Penguin won't likely alter the formula of subscriptions and merchandise even as it expands into new markets. Portuguese may not be the most obvious choice for a first non-English site, but Seiler noted that with markets such as North America and Korea already crowded, South America is quickly emerging as the next big growth opportunity. "We're seeing a lot of global brands getting into markets like Brazil," he added. "There's not a lot of activity for virtual worlds yet, but it's a hugely connected country with a plenty of interest in online social communities."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"South America is one of major growth markets right now, Huuhtanen added. "With the current financial situation, I don't think there will be that many companies capable of building global virtual world brands."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Seiler adds that if anyone can do it, it's likely a U.S. entertainment giant, noting, "Companies like Disney, or a Viacom through MTV and/or Nickelodeon, are able to push internationally because the have well-known brands that can be rolled up into their virtual worlds."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrifield, who earlier this year was named executive VP of Disney Interactive Media Group, also noted the inclusion of multiple languages within Penguin will have benefits in the domestic market as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As language learning is such an important thing right now, we have parents that say, 'If you launch in Spanish, I would love to tell my child that they can play for a half hour in English but then have to play for a half-hour in Spanish," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrifield is keenly aware that eventually most of the current Penguin audience will eventually age out of the virtual world at some point, but suggested other many in that audience could graduate into other Disney branded worlds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we first set out we very obviously built Club Penguin for the youngest users," he said. "But we already have Pirates in that next older stage and we have others in development that we haven't announced yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Merrifield suggested that many of these in-house virtual worlds will end up reinforcing the Disney philosophy of creating content that appeals primarily to kids, but also has something entertaining for parents as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have is a lot of parents and grandparents who play with their kids in our virtual worlds," he said. "One of the things that I challenge our studios to do is make sure there are elements for parents and grandparents, much like what Pixar's done in 3D animation with its scripts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Billboard) - It was 15 years ago when Adolfo and Gustavo Angel -- the sibling duo known as Los Temerarios -- signed to independent label Fonovisa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were other options for the group, which sold well on its own label, but Los Temerarios -- who sing romantic grupero fare -- went with Fonovisa, the maverick label that at the time belonged to Televisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a company that has a profound knowledge of the market where we were born and where we grew," Adolfo Angel says. "If we look at its history, it has housed the most successful regional Mexican acts. And after so many years, they're still the most important in the genre."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, Fonovisa turns 25 and will celebrate the anniversary with an ambitious, yearlong schedule of releases commemorating the company's history as a bastion of Latin music. Fonovisa's storied roster includes the leading names in regional Mexican music, among them Marco Antonio Solis, Los Tigres del Norte, Banda El Recodo and Huracanes del Norte.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the slogan "Fonovisa 25th Aniversario: La Historia de Los Exitos," Fonovisa plans to reintroduce entire catalogs of artists' work into the marketplace. In addition, the label will dedicate each month of the year, beginning in February, to a single act, starting with Los Temerarios.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It will also release a series of multi-artist compilations throughout the year; first up is "La Historia de los Exitos," featuring one hit for each of Fonovisa's 25 years. The album goes on sale January 20 and will be followed by other concept releases, including "Las 25 Mas Romanticas Con Los Supergrupos," slated for February 10, and "La Historia de Los Exitos-Banda" on March 24. A yet-to-be-named Mother's Day compilation is in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We want to talk about Fonovisa as the single most influential independent record company in the U.S. that grew and developed stars," Fonovisa/Disa president Gustavo Lopez says. "We're going to mine its 25 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now part of Universal Music Latin Entertainment, Fonovisa's share of the Latin marketplace in 2008 was 16.3 percent, second only to Sony BMG. Since its acquisition by Universal, Fonovisa's roster is exclusively regional Mexican, but historically, it also has been home to leading pop artists like Enrique Iglesias (who was introduced by Fonovisa in Spanish), Christian Castro and Thalia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its 25th-anniversary releases will reflect that diversity, Lopez says. The label is counting on the excitement generated by the rerelease of original titles to generate sales. In a depressed market, Lopez says, "what will drive the sales is the pricing of the catalog. And the presentation of the product will be critical. It is moving away from doing 10 compilations (by the same act) and driving people to buy those original, classic albums."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Billboard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson said on Thursday it would be difficult to meet U.S. President-elect Barack Obama's goal to double alternative energy production over the next three years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"I think that's going to be very challenging to do," Tillerson told reporters following a speech to the Woodrow Wilson Center. He said the U.S. will not be able to double biofuels output during that period and there is not enough manufacturing capacity to build the wind turbines needed to meet Obama's goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, Tillerson said the company is sticking with its $125 billion capital spending budget planned for the next five years, despite the steep drop in oil prices and the global economic slowdown. Any changes to the company's capital spending budget will be announced in March at a meeting with analysts, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tom Doggett; Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DHAKA Jan 11 (Reuters) - U.S. energy major Chevron (CVX.N)
has raised natural gas production in Bangaldesh by more than 11
percent to about 500 million cubic feet (mmcf) per day to meet
shortages, a senior official said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bangladesh faces shortages of upto 250 mmcf per day, leaving
it unable to supply hundreds of newly-built manufacturing firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have asked them to produce more gas from Bibiyana field
to meet rising demand," said Jalal Ahmed, chairman of the
state-run Bangladesh Oil, Gas and Mineral Corporation or
Petrobangla.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some experts have suggested that production from current
proven reserves of 2.51 trillion cubic feet at the field should
not exceed the present quantum of 450 mmcf per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As per the contract with Chevron, the firm may extract 497
mmcf per day," Jalal told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said that the government was pressing Petrobangla to
produce up to 600 mmcf per day but it had not agreed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Such over extraction would result in damage to the
reservoir of one of the country's largest gas reserve," said an
expert who asked not to be identified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said on Sunday the Bibiyana field had produced
better than expected since its start-up in March 2007,
indicating that field was likely to be bigger than originally
thought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The firm said an assessment of reserves by a third party 
indicated reserves were much higher than the initial assessment,
conducted in 2000 before the field was developed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bangladesh, with 13.54 trillion cubic feet of proven and
recoverable gas reserves, can now supply up to 1,800 mmcf of gas
daily against a daily demand of 2,050 mmcf, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Serajul Islam Quadir; Editing by David Cowell)

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Jan 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Gemcom Software International Inc., the largest global supplier of
specialised mining productivity solutions, today announced it has
attained Gold Certified Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program
with competencies in both Networking Infrastructure Solutions and
ISV/Software Solutions. As a Gold Certified Partner, Gemcom has
demonstrated expertise with Microsoft-based technologies. Microsoft Gold
Certified Partners receive a rich set of benefits, including access,
training and support, helping to give them a competitive advantage in the
channel.

    "Technology partners like Gemcom Software International Inc., that
achieve Microsoft Gold Certified Partner status have a deep understanding
of Microsoft-based solutions and a passion for Canada's growing
technology industry," said Lora Gernon, senior director Partner Group,
Microsoft Canada Co.

    "Gemcom's worldwide customers have realised significant cost savings and
productivity gains by partnering with us and adopting our enterprise
solutions which incorporate industry-leading systems like Microsoft SQL
Server(R)," said Rick Moignard, president and CEO of Gemcom.
"Microsoft-based technology plays a key role in our solutions and in our
customers' success. With centralised data management, our customers have
overcome the data chaos inherent to mining operations. This has enabled
them to improve operational decision-making and collaboration by
establishing on-demand access to a single, managed source of data,
wherever and whenever it is needed. Gemcom's achievement of Gold
Certified Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program further
underlines our ability to deliver effective, value-adding enterprise
solutions."

    As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status,
Gemcom had to declare a Microsoft Competency. Gemcom has attained two
Microsoft Competencies: Networking Infrastructure Solutions and
ISV/Software Solutions, which are detailed below. Microsoft Competencies
are designed to help differentiate a technology partner's capabilities
with specific Microsoft-based technologies to customers looking for a
particular type of solution. Each competency has a unique set of
requirements and benefits, formulated to accurately represent the
specific skills and services that partners bring to the technology
industry.

    Microsoft Gold Certified Partners enrolled in the Networking
Infrastructure Solutions Competency have proved their expertise in
implementing technology solutions based on either the Microsoft Windows
Server(R) 2003 or Windows 2000 Server operating system, with a particular
focus on Microsoft Small Business Server 2000 and Windows(R) Small
Business Server 2003. These implementations may include crafting
solutions that connect Windows-based servers, PC locations and the
Internet; installing a server farm; or building a small-business Windows
Server stand-alone solution that includes file and print capabilities.

    The ISV/Software Solutions Competency recognises the skill and focus
technology partners bring to a particular solution set. Microsoft Gold
Certified Partners that have obtained this competency have a successful
record of developing and marketing packaged software based on
Microsoft-based technologies.

    "Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to better
enable ISVs to help meet customer needs," said Sanjay Parthasarathy,
corporate vice president of the Developer &amp; Platform Evangelism Group at
Microsoft. "They allow ISVs to keep and win customers through their deep
knowledge of solutions-based Microsoft platform technologies. Microsoft
has a long history of working closely with ISV partners to help them
deliver compelling solutions and applications to our mutual customers,
and the Microsoft Competencies are an important step in continuing to
enhance vital relationships with ISVs worldwide."

    The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and represents
Microsoft's ongoing commitment to the success of technology partners
worldwide. The program offers a single, integrated framework that
recognises technology partner expertise, rewards the total impact that
technology partners have in the technology marketplace, and delivers more
value to help technology partners' businesses be successful.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co never had a chance to bid for Citigroup Inc's Smith Barney business, two people familiar with the matter said, but it may still build a retail brokerage business by acquiring smaller companies, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are combining their retail brokerages into a joint venture controlled by Morgan Stanley, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That deal, expected to be announced this week, may be a setback for JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has said frequently that he would like to acquire a retail brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup never spoke to JPMorgan about buying Smith Barney because it would not have been a good match, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup was looking for a joint-venture partner that it could merge its business with. It was hoping its joint venture partner could buy Citigroup's stake over a period of years, so that it would not have to sell the entire business in a depressed market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has just a small brokerage from its May 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos, did not meet these requirements, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is increasing interest among banks to boost assets under management in their brokerage businesses to diversify their sources of revenue. Many analysts believe JPMorgan does not need to increase brokerage business if it does not want to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can JPMorgan succeed without a retail brokerage operation? Absolutely," said Brad Hintz, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if the bank does not absolutely need a retail brokerage business, it may still choose to buy one, Hintz said. "Dimon would be very comfortable with that, it would be one of his favorite businesses to play in," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are not many large brokerages for JPMorgan to buy, after Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo  Co snapped up Merrill Lynch  Co and Wachovia Corp respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank could buy smaller, regional brokerages, and JPMorgan's recent acquisitions could provide a good foundation, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Certainly, Bear Stearns and JPMorgan Securities gives JPMorgan the infrastructure to build a retail brokerage firm from smaller pieces," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago in a speech to the CFA Society of Chicago, Dimon said he would love to have a retail brokerage, but that its absence is "not going to cripple" JPMorgan. "We can build a great bank without it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the third quarter, JPMorgan had 323 brokers from Bear Stearns, and the Bear brokerage contributed $131 million to revenue, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Dan Wilchins; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CardPartner Program Is New Twist on Old Model
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
People who support Hale House Center can now use their everyday spending to help
this Harlem institution help children. 

Hale House today began offering the new Hale House Visa affinity credit card at
www.halehouse.org. Hale House earns $50 each time a Hale House card is
activated, plus an ongoing share of the monthly charge volume. Funds help Hale
House operate an early childhood learning center and a transitional housing
program. 

"Hale House begins its 40th year of service to the community by delivering
child-centered, family-focused programs that meet community needs," said Randy
McLaughlin, Executive Director of Hale House. "By carrying and using the Hale
House Visa card, our many friends in the greater New York area and throughout
the country can support Hale House at this important time in our history." 

Hale House offers the card in cooperation with CardPartner
(www.cardpartner.com), a New York-based company that helps small and mid-sized
non-profits establish the kind of affinity credit card programs once reserved
for much larger groups. CardPartner is changing the old affinity credit card
business model by operating virtually and offering groups customized,
self-service marketing tools. 

"CardPartner clients love how quickly their programs get started, the fact that
they control the marketing, and that proceeds help fund their operations and not
someone else`s overhead," says Doug Davis, CardPartner senior director of sales
&amp; marketing. 

The launch of the Hale House card follows the recent New York debut of the
Gilda`s Club NYC Visa card. More than 115 other nonprofits and small groups have
launched a CardPartner Visa credit card program since early 2008. 

About Hale House

Founded in 1969 by "Mother" Clara McBride Hale and based in Harlem, New York
City, Hale House Center, Inc. is a nationally-recognized non-profit dedicated to
building a better future for children and families in need. Hale House Center
delivers child-centered, family-focused programs, including a learning center
for children ages six weeks to five years and a transitional housing program for
single parent families. 

About CardPartner

CardPartner, Inc. (www.cardpartner.com) is an online company that specializes in
helping smaller U.S.-based membership organizations and nonprofits create free,
customized Visa credit card programs. CardPartner is a unit of the privately
held Serverside Group, a technology provider to many of the world`s leading
banks. CardPartner affinity credit cards are issued by UMB Financial Corporation
(NASDAQ:UMBF), one of the largest independent banks in the United States and
Smart Money magazine`s pick as "&#8230;the highest scoring traditional bank among our
favorites."

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Some bullish news hit the Street today for blue chip pharmaceutical concern
Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE). Goldman Sachs removed PFE from its Americas Sell List.
The brokerage firm said, "Pressure is mounting on management to do something big
and soon." 

"Almost regardless of what precisely this action is, we believe the stock would
respond positively to a sign of positive, dramatic change at Pfizer," Goldman
analyst Jami Rubin said in a note to investors. The firm upgraded the stock from
"sell" to "neutral."

&lt;p&gt;Jan 12 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Harley
Davidson Inc (HOG.N) to "sell" and added the motorcycle maker
to its conviction sell list, sending its shares down as much as
13 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which also slashed its six-month price
target on the stock to $11 from $30, said it expects
considerable downside to the stock from headwinds in global
luxury-motorcycle demand and tighter credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aspirational products such as heavyweight motorcycles are
likely to be among the hardest hit, with the financial downturn
disproportionately affecting the higher income demography that
makes up a large portion of Harley Davidson's clients, analyst
Patrick Archambault said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These factors underpin our new forecast for a 30 percent
contraction in Harley retail bike sales in 2009. This would
exceed the largest declines in Harley Davidson registrations
since the early 1970s," he said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, RBC Capital Markets also cut its price target
on the company to $16 from $30, and advised caution, saying  it
sees a year of "significant change" for Harley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investors could have to take some pretty tough medicine,
including meaningful production cuts, possible restructuring
and maybe even a cut to the dividend," RBC analyst Edward Aaron
said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the Milwaukee-based company fell to $14.00,
before paring some of its losses to trade at down $1.82 at
$14.18 on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Jan 12 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Fire Department of the City of New York (FDNY) has selected IBM
(NYSE: IBM) to build a state-of-the-art system for collecting and sharing
data in real-time that potentially can prevent fires and protect
firefighters and other first responders when a fire occurs.

    FDNY's new Coordinated Building Inspection and Data Analysis System
(CBIDAS) will use business intelligence technologies, including predictive
modeling and advanced data analytics, to anticipate fire exposures,
analyze possible impacts, and improve processes that can minimize risks,
such as collecting and disseminating data on building inspection, permits
and violations.

    "This technology will allow us to shift to a risk-based inspection system
that will prevent fires and improve public safety," said Fire Commissioner
Nicholas Scoppetta. "Combining different existing databases, and linking
them with those of other city agencies such as the Department of
Buildings, will dramatically improve the information available to our
firefighters and result in a smarter, more productive inspection program."

    "The FDNY's strategic shift to a 'smarter' risk-based inspections and
using technology to improve data sharing directly supports its mission to
advance public safety through the timely delivery of fire prevention,
investigation and education services," said Charles L. Prow, Government
Managing Partner, IBM Global Business Services. "IBM is pleased to apply
our expertise to this lifesaving work."

    An important element of the project will be enabling better communication,
information sharing and coordination of fire inspection and site/building
structure information within FDNY bureaus, and between FDNY bureaus and
other city agencies such as Department of Buildings, Department of City
Planning, and Department of Environmental Protection, and contractors.

    The transformational FDNY initiative also will enhance fire prevention
capabilities through:


      A single, unified view of a property;
      Improved resource deployment and utilization for inspections;
      Expanded management analysis and preparedness planning;
      A risk-based inspection system for field inspections.

    
In August 2007, two firefighters lost their lives in a fire at the
former Deutsche Bank building in New York City, which had been scheduled
for demolition. Investigators attributed the loss of life to a lack of
timely information available to responding firefighters. Mayor Michael
Bloomberg launched an initiative to prevent similar events from happening
in the future.

    The goal of the CBIDAS is to ensure that firefighters and other first
responders have timely access to the information they need for effective
fire suppression and for maximum public and personnel safety when a fire
occurs.

    With the completion of the project, FDNY will also move from a strictly
cyclical, schedule-based inspection process to a risk-based assessment
methodology.

BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
Orthofix International N.V., (NASDAQ:OFIX) (the Company) announced today that it
will participate in the 27th Annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San

presentation he will reiterate the Company`s previously announced fourth quarter
2008 revenue guidance of $130-135 million. 

Mr. Milinazzo stated, "We are especially pleased to reiterate our fourth quarter
revenue guidance despite approximately $3-$4 million of negative foreign
currency impact. Additionally, though Blackstone`s fourth quarter 2008 revenue
was lower than the prior year, it increased sequentially from the third quarter.
For the full year 2009 we are forecasting a year-over-year increase in
Blackstone revenue of approximately 8%-12%. This increase reflects the estimated
impact of a number of planned new product introductions including our new
Firebird pedicle screw system and Trinity Evolution, a stem cell-based allograft
developed in collaboration with the Musculoskeletal Transplant Foundation."

&lt;p&gt;Jan 12 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities raised its price
targets on several U.S. aerospace and defense companies,
including Boeing and Northrop Grumman, and said it had given
more weight to defense companies this month as most of them
were likely to report strong results and maintain solid
outlooks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan lifted its price target on Boeing Co (BA.N) to
$44 from $42 on valuation, and said despite several issues such
as the delay in the plane makers' 787 Dreamliner program and
the machinists strike, it was bullish on the company's market
share and long-term prospects in commercial aircraft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the brokerage said the Boeing strike and other
issues should "make for a messy Q4" for commercial aerospace.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "More importantly, we expect '09 outlooks to be more
pessimistic than previous updates, since air traffic looks set
to decline more steeply, business jet flight operations have
fallen off a cliff and the aircraft financing environment has
not improved much," the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, the world's No. 2 plane maker cut jobs from its
commercial plane operations to counter the downturn in plane
orders after a three-year boom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the large-cap companies, the brokerage named Northrop
Grumman (NOC.N) and Raytheon Co (RTN.N) as its top picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not believe Northrop's valuation reflects the
company's potential to deliver sustained growth superior to
peers," the brokerage said and raised its price target to $57
from $51 on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It raised the price target on Raytheon shares by $2 to $60
and said the company boasts a superior organic growth profile
supported by strong bookings, both international and domestic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, JP Morgan said it was concerned about Precision
Castparts (PCP.N), which faced a number of operating
challenges, and Rockwell Collins (COL.N), which could have a
disappointing quarter due to plunging business jet flight
operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For alerts on JP Morgan's price target changes, click here

HAWTHORNE, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Acorda Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: ACOR) President and CEO Ron Cohen, M.D. will
provide an update on the Company`s U.S. and European commercialization and
regulatory filing strategy for its lead product, Fampridine-SR, today at the
JPMorgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco, CA. In addition, Dr. Cohen will
discuss timelines for advancing the Company`s preclinical pipeline candidates
into clinical trials and provide an update on the Zanaflex franchise. 

Fampridine-SR Updates

Acorda remains on track to file a New Drug Application (NDA) with the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) in the first quarter of 2009, as well as a
centralized Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) with the European
Medicines Agency (EMEA) later this year. Acorda also plans to submit a New Drug
Submission (NDS) to Health Canada in 2009. 

"In 2008 we made tremendous progress with the clinical development of
Fampridine-SR and evaluating the regulatory and commercial landscape for this
product in Europe. We expect to follow on that success in 2009 with the
submission of regulatory filings in the US, EU and Canada. We are also beginning
discussions with potential marketing partners to explore commercialization
options in Europe and the rest of world excluding the U.S.," said Dr. Cohen.
"Achieving these milestones will bring us closer to our goal of making
Fampridine-SR available to the many people with MS who may benefit from it." 

The Company has updated retention rates for the Fampridine-SR open-label
extension studies. Following the conclusion of the Phase 2 and two Phase 3
trials of Fampridine-SR in MS, all study participants were eligible to enroll in
extension studies and receive treatment with Fampridine-SR. In the
longest-running study, 52% (92 of 177) of those who enrolled in the study are
still participating after 4.2-4.8 years. In the other two studies, 69% (186 of
269) and 86% (185 of 214) remain enrolled after 2.3-3.1 years and 7-17 months,
respectively. 

Preclinical Pipeline Updates

Acorda plans to submit an Investigational New Drug (IND) application to the FDA
by the end of 2009 for GGF2, the lead molecule in the Company`s neuregulin
program. GGF2 has demonstrated potential in neurologic and cardiovascular
therapeutic areas, including multiple sclerosis, stroke and congestive heart
failure (CHF). The Company will initially pursue a cardiac indication with a
focus on CHF. Acorda may seek a partner with relevant category expertise to
collaborate on the development of the neuregulins for cardiovascular
indications, while retaining rights for their development in neurology
indications. 

An IND filing for the remyelinating antibody rHIgM22, previously projected for
late 2009, will be delayed due to a bankruptcy filing by its current external
manufacturing vendor. 

Zanaflex Capsules Updates

Acorda has confirmed that Zanaflex Capsules&#174; (tizanidine hydrochloride) and
Zanaflex&#174; (tizanidine hydrochloride) tablets commercial operations were cash
flow positive in 2008 on an operating basis. The Company projects that the
franchise will grow modestly and continue to be cash flow positive on an
operating basis in 2009. 

Corporate Earnings Schedule

Acorda announced its quarterly earnings reporting schedule for the coming year,
as follows:

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats story that originally ran on Friday)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LAS VEGAS Jan 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said
on Friday it has paused offering downloads of the public test
version of its new version of Windows due to "high demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "beta" launch of the highly anticipated update to
Microsoft's Windows franchise began early on Friday, but the
company had to halt downloads to add more servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are adding servers as fast as we can add them," a
Microsoft spokesman said at the Consumer Electronics Show in
Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to say when Windows 7 downloads would resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said at CES on Wednesday it would let consumers
test the next generation of its computer operating system
starting Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's biggest maker of software, has said
Windows 7 will incorporate touch screen technology and allow
users to more easily personalize the system. It promised more
user-friendly features, such as a new taskbar that previews all
open windows from a single application by hovering over the
program's icon.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Israel's animated war film "Waltz with Bashir," a Golden Globe winner, was named on Tuesday to a short list of nine movies up for Oscar nominations in the foreign-language contest, but an Italian entry that won a key prize at Cannes failed to make the cut.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That movie, "Gomorrah," from director Matteo Garrone, won the runner-up Grand Prix at the Cannes film festival in May. The hard-hitting film about the Neapolitan Mafia was Italy's contender for an Oscar and was nominated for a Golden Globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But another Cannes favorite, "The Class," a French movie set in a tough Parisian high school, made the short list of films vying for a nomination in the foreign-language Oscar race. "The Class" topped the competition at Cannes to win the Palme d'Or prize for best picture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Waltz with Bashir" was named best foreign-language film at Sunday's Golden Globes, often a harbinger of Oscar glory, and it was included on the Oscar short list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film about the 1982 Israeli-Lebanon war is from director Ari Folman, and this month the U.S.-based National Society of Film Critics chose it as the best film of 2008. It has been described as an animated documentary, combining audio interviews and animation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other foreign-language films short-listed for an Oscar nomination are: "Revanche" (Austria), "The Necessities of Life" (Canada), "The Baader Meinhof Complex (Germany), "Departures" (Japan), "Tear This Heart Out" (Mexico), "Everlasting Moments" (Sweden) and "3 Monkeys" (Turkey).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each country can submit only one film for consideration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The nine films, culled from among 65 entries, were chosen by hundreds of members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and by an executive committee of the organization. The list will be narrowed to five nominees by specially selected committees in New York and Los Angeles, the academy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The final five nominees in the foreign film category will be announced on January 22, the academy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year's foreign-language Oscar winner was "The Counterfeiters," a Holocaust-era drama from Austria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis: Editing by Steve Gorman and Eric Walsh)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) shares climbed nearly 7 percent on Tuesday after the company said late Monday it is bringing forward its results by six days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares climbed as much as 6.7 percent on Tuesday as some investors interpreted positively the bank's decision to announce fourth-quarter results on January 15, six days sooner than planned. The stock ended at $26.35, up 5.8 percent on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has consistently warned that the bank's results in the fourth quarter are under pressure from rising unemployment and consumer credit concerns, and some investors said the stock may have been oversold on these warnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think you are seeing some investor interest in JPMorgan as one of the survivors of the banking industry," said Bill Hackney, managing partner at Atlanta Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some analysts noted JPMorgan shares may just have been recovering after a pummeling on Monday that saw the shares slump 4 percent on fears the wider financial sector might be returning to its November lows, when Citigroup Inc (C.N) received $45 billion from the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across the financial sector, stocks rallied on Tuesday after Citigroup said it will restructure its business. The KBW Bank Index .BKX was up about 1 percent on the day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These stocks have been destroyed," said Marshall Front, chairman of Front Barnett Associates in Chicago. "Any ray of hope can kindle a substantial rebound," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts said the financial sector was also helped by Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke's declaration in a London speech that more steps were needed to stabilize banks, reviving the idea of authorities sopping up toxic assets from bank balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), whose $7.5 billion annual research budget has produced few major medicines in recent years, said on Tuesday it would cut 800 research positions this year as part of a restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest drugmaker, which recently narrowed its sights to 10 disease areas and dropped its long-standing focus on heart research, said the layoffs will be at laboratories in St. Louis, Groton, Conn., La Jolla, Calif. and Sandwich, England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's part of Pfizer's overall plan to refocus research in a more efficient way; we're taking a methodical approach to hit our goals," company spokesman Ray Kerins said of the job cuts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer did not disclose how much savings the layoffs might generate or whether additional research jobs could be targeted next year and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're in a strong financial position, with a strong balance sheet," Kerins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But company revenue fell in the third quarter amid declines for Lipitor and drugs for blood pressure, cancer and allergies now competing with generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company has already cut more than 25,000 jobs since 2004, or about a quarter of its overall global workforce, in an attempt to cut costs and generate earnings growth, despite generic competition for many of its major medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's biggest challenge comes in 2011, when its Lipitor cholesterol drug faces competition from cheaper generics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings growth has been anemic and shares of the company are trading at 10-year lows, despite belt tightening and the promotion in mid-2006 of Pfizer's general counsel Jeffrey Kindler as chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disappointing clinical trials have forced the company to scrap a number of once-promising experimental drugs, including a cholesterol medicine called torcetrapib that Pfizer hoped would become a $10 billion-a-year product that could help offset expected plunging Lipitor sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is counting on Martin Mackay, a longtime Pfizer executive who was promoted to research chief in late 2007, to deliver the kinds of big products that have eluded its laboratories over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mackay, speaking on Tuesday at a JP Morgan healthcare conference in San Francisco, highlighted experimental treatments for cancer, arthritis and Alzheimer's disease and said Pfizer was on track to file 15 to 20 marketing applications for drugs between 2010 and 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other hard-pressed large drugmakers have also cut thousands of jobs to deal with slow sales of medicines and generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers Squibb Co (BMY.N) said in December it would cut another 10 percent of its sales force by 2010. Two months earlier, London-based GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L) said it would cut up to 850 research and development jobs in Britain and the United States, equivalent to around 6 percent of the company's overall RD workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

Mutual now has a consistent enterprise view of information that enables
it to collect and report all data with a comprehensive view of individual
customers and demographic data.

    Physicians Mutual is already reaping the benefits of this technology. For
example, by offering customers more flexibility and options for electronic
premium payments, the company has shifted more than $14 million in premium
collections online. It increased the resolution of billing questions on
the first call by 15 percent, increased customer satisfaction, and
reduced time for return calls. In addition, the company is saving 3,000
customer service steps daily in streamlining the resolution of billing
disputes, resulting in thousands of hours in staff savings.

    "By putting information at the center of all our IT strategies, we have
brought business and IT closer together to better serve our customers,"
said Dan Simpson, senior vice president and CIO, Physicians Mutual. "Now
we can deliver information more quickly, offer customers more flexibility
in how they interact with us, and we're better positioned to stay on top
of changing market demands."

    Creating an Information Agenda to gain instant access to its business
information, the company can now make more informed decisions by accessing
and analyzing customer behavior patterns and preferences. This is allowing
Physicians Mutual to focus on providing customers with care and services
to promote higher customer satisfaction and retention.

    "Customers don't want to be limited to just a phone call or mail," said
Roger Moeller, assistant vice president and enterprise architect,
Physicians Mutual. "Some may want to be able to get in touch with us via
the Web. They may want to chat with a service representative, or choose
how or when they pay their bill. If they have multiple products from us,
they want to get a single invoice. These are the types of issues IBM has
helped us address by aligning all our information."

    Physicians Mutual's integrated and streamlined IT infrastructure has also
helped the company overcome the burden of legacy applications and
processes which in the past made it difficult to analyze and act on
business intelligence because of the way their policy administration
systems and data were structured.

    "With an information based enterprise -- an enterprise that has the
flexibility to rapidly deliver information as needed to improve processes
and business decisions -- Physicians Mutual has become a prime example of
how our clients are undertaking a shift in they way they access, manage
and use information," said Ambuj Goyal, general manager, Information
Management, IBM Software Group. "Their blueprint for a single, consistent
enterprise view of data ultimately gives them a competitive edge in a
dynamic market."

    A services oriented architecture (SOA) helps Physicians Mutual deliver
information as a service across its business. The IBM InfoSphere portfolio
of products transforms, reconciles and maintains information, delivering
it in real time to the people, processes and applications that need it.
The IBM Insurance Information Warehouse and Insurance Application
Architecture serve as the foundation for the Physicians Mutual customer
resource management system and IBM's Insurance industry models improve
efficiency with reusable industry-specific templates, including models to
help meet the requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act (HIPAA for the standardization of electronic records.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings assigns a rating of 'AA' to Custodial Receipt 41TP CR-1 (CR-1)

the series 2006-41TP floater certificates (Floaters) and the rating assigned to
the series 2006-41TP residual certificates (formerly based on the rating that
Fitch assigned to the bonds deposited in the Trust). 

The 'F1+' short-term component of the rating assigned to the Floaters based on
the short-term rating assigned to Wells remains unchanged.

&lt;p&gt;New Version of Free solution for Google Apps provides native Excel support;
Other Features Include Website/Blog Embedding; Customized Formulas
TORONTO--(Business Wire)--
Panorama Software, a global leader in Proactive Business Intelligence solutions,
today released a new version of Panorama Analytics for Google Apps, its free
analytics solution for Google Apps. By enabling native Excel and other files to
load directly into the application, Panorama`s new version gives Excel
spreadsheet users an even easier-to-use and more collaborative alternative to
the analytics tools in Excel. 

Panorama Analytics for Google Apps, powered by Panorama`s comprehensive set of
powerful and intuitive BI technologies, is ideal for business and consumer data
analysis, reporting, visualization and dashboarding. As part of the free Google
Docs or the enterprise edition Google Apps, anyone can use Panorama Analytics
for Google Apps to process spreadsheets from any source. Users can perform
analysis on their excel data to identify interesting and powerful insights off
of the data in new "Google like" ways. 

The new version of Panorama`s analytics solution adds a number of new features
and capabilities to an already impressive list. Updates include:

* Native Excel and .CSV Support. Panorama Analytics for Google Apps users can
now upload Excel files as well as CSV (Comma Separated Values, the file format
often used in line-of-business applications) files directly into Panorama
Analytics, without having to upload into Google Spreadsheets first. 
* User-Defined Formulas. Panorama Analytics for Google Apps now allows users to
create formulas-or select from a list of pre-defined formulas-and insert them
for faster processing of the data. 
* Gadget Embedding. Similar to the way YouTube videos can be embedded in
websites and blogs, this unique and innovative capability lets users upload data
and embed their interactive charts and tables into Web pages, blogs and other
forms of online communication. The embedded material can be made totally
interactive, enabling readers to do their own analysis on-the-fly giving a new
experience for sharing data on the web. 
* Interactive Help. Panorama Analytics for Google Apps introduces interactive
tips and explanations that explain the functions of the solution-a convenient
way to maximize the value of Google Docs and the free BI application.

"Although Microsoft Excel offers analytics, only a fraction of all Excel users
take advantage of them due to their complexity, the lack of collaboration and
the lack of web technology support. Panorama Analytics for Google Apps not only
makes spreadsheet analytics easy for the average person, but also makes them
available via any Web browser in a format that supports collaboration," said
Oudi Antebi, Vice President of Marketing and Strategy for Panorama Software.
"The new capabilities in our updated version of Panorama Analytics for Google
Apps adds to the convenience, flexibility and usability of this extremely
popular product." 

Advertising Model

Also debuting in the new version of Panorama Analytics for Google Apps are
context-sensitive ads that will help sustain and improve the free service in the
future. "The features in Panorama Analytics for Google Apps compare favorably to
commercial applications costing between $500 and $1,000 per user. By accepting
advertising and insisting it be made available in a desirable, non-intrusive
fashion, a new business model is in place that will actually help us find and
fund exciting features that will be of value to our users in the future," said
Antebi.

&lt;p&gt;Chair to Lead New Advances in Energy Efficiency; Endowment Furthers Chevron
Commitment to Conservation and Efficiency
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)today announced a $2.5 million endowment for a
permanent chair to head the Energy Efficiency Center (EEC) at the University of
California, Davis (UC Davis). 

The Chevron Chair in Energy Efficiency will direct the world`s first university
center of excellence in energy efficiency, created at UC Davis in 2006. The
center is focused on developing and commercializing advanced technologies to
enable energy efficiency in buildings, agriculture and transportation. 

"Advancing energy efficiency, which is the cheapest, cleanest and most abundant
form of new energy, is critical to the challenge of meeting the world`s growing
energy needs," said John McDonald, Chevron vice president and chief technology
officer. "California has been a pacesetter in energy efficiency, so it`s fitting
that one of the state`s leading universities and California`s largest company
should partner on the next generation of energy efficiency." 

The Chevron Chair will expand the impact of the center`s research programs
through interdisciplinary collaboration, education, outreach and
commercialization of technologies. The Chevron Chair will focus on developing
strong links with state and federal government, as well as with international
programs, to advance energy efficiency. 

"Chevron`s endowment will ensure long-term strategic leadership for the Energy
Efficiency Center," said Larry Vanderhoef, UC Davis chancellor. "By bridging
long-term research with real-world applications, the director will guide the
center in its goal of commercializing groundbreaking technologies, powering
economic progress and helping to conserve resources." 

Chevron develops energy efficiency and renewable power projects for public
institutions and businesses through its subsidiary, Chevron Energy Solutions.
The endowment for the Chevron Chair complements Chevron`s ongoing support for UC
Davis, which includes a $500,000 grant for the EEC announced in 2008 and a $25
million biofuels collaboration developing technology to convert non-food
agricultural waste into next-generation transportation fuels. 

"Chevron is a proven leader in energy efficiency," said Ralph Cavanagh, Natural
Resources Defense Council energy program co-director. "The Chevron Chair will be
a major catalyst in moving the work of the EEC forward and making significant
contributions to energy efficiency worldwide." 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business across the globe. The company's success
is driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 59,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes

&lt;p&gt;  LANSING, MI, Jan 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Governor Jennifer M. Granholm, on behalf of the state of Michigan, and
IBM (NYSE: IBM), in close partnership with Michigan State University
(MSU), today announced the creation of a global delivery center for
application services to be located on the MSU campus in East Lansing.

    The global delivery center will be the first of its kind in the U.S. for
IBM. The center will provide innovative application development and
support services to modernize older and less efficient IT systems for
state and local government agencies and universities. Additionally, IBM
will accommodate work from telecommunications, health care and other
U.S.-based clients in the center with a focus on modernizing IT
applications through process excellence, tooling automation, and asset
re-use.

    "We are working hard every day to grow our economy and create jobs," said
Governor Granholm. "This center is an outstanding example of a project
that brings together economic development, educational opportunity, and
jobs in a way that can help transform our economy in the 21st century."

    IBM will collaborate with MSU professors to educate students and recent
graduates on the application development techniques that will help to
create a workforce prepared to lead in the current economic environment.

    "Michigan State University shares the bold vision for the role technology
plays in building a diverse 21st century economy," said MSU President Lou
Anna K. Simon. "Our partnership with IBM will involve a multidisciplinary
approach that leverages the intellectual assets of several colleges,
including business, engineering, natural science, and social science."

    Michigan State University is known internationally as a major public
university with global reach and extraordinary impact.

    "Like IBM, MSU has a long tradition of and commitment to international
engagement," said Simon. "Our understanding of the global environment
makes us the ideal partner for this project."

    Students studying computer science, supply chain, and engineering will be
candidates for employment by programs in the IBM global delivery center.

    "Combining our own expertise in services and application development, this
agreement builds on a successful long-term relationship between IBM, MSU
and the state of Michigan," said Charles L. Prow, managing partner
government, IBM Global Business Services. "This project demonstrates
Michigan's pledge to use technology to improve agency services as well as
a commitment to create highly skilled job opportunities for its citizens."

    The project supports Granholm's vision to create a technology corridor
that uses highly skilled workers as a means to generate job growth and
improve the economic base in the state.

    Establishment of the center will help to centralize application support
and increase efficiencies. In its network of global delivery centers, IBM
has a set of integrated tools, processes and disciplines that will be
transplanted to the Michigan center to deliver superior applications for
clients.

    Support from the city of East Lansing, Lansing Economic Area Partnership
(Leap), MSU Federal Credit Union (MSUFCU) and the Michigan Economic
Development Corporation was a key factor in IBM's decision to locate this
project in Michigan.

    "This is a huge opportunity for our region," said Denyse Ferguson, Leap's
president and CEO. "We're thrilled to welcome IBM and everything they're
bringing in terms of jobs, opportunities for students, and support for our
IT sector."

    IBM expects to begin operations in the first quarter of this year in the
MSU Federal Credit Union building on campus, as the credit union has
relocated its headquarters to another location.

    The state estimates that the move by IBM to bring jobs and employees to
Michigan as part of the new center will create up to 1,500 new direct and
indirect jobs over the next five years, with 100 new direct jobs by June
2009.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Acceleron Pharma, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company developing novel
therapeutics that modulate the growth of cells and tissues including bone,
muscle and red blood cells, today announced that it has designated a new
development candidate, ACE-536, which selectively increases red blood cells and
hemoglobin, as a potential treatment for anemia. ACE-536, like the Company`s
lead development candidate ACE-011, utilizes a mechanism fundamentally different
from existing therapies to increase hemoglobin levels. 

"We are extremely excited about ACE-536 because it represents an entirely new
method of increasing hemoglobin and also demonstrates the tremendous potential
of the GDF family of proteins in which Acceleron is the recognized leader in
discovering and developing therapeutics based on this family of proteins," said
John Knopf, Ph.D., Chief Executive Officer of Acceleron. "With our bone, muscle,
fat, vasculature and now, red blood cell programs, we are only beginning to tap
into the potential of this family and we are proud of our unique strength in
this field." 

Acceleron now has two distinct development programs that increase red blood
cells and hemoglobin - ACE-011 and ACE-536. Results from the ACE-011 Phase 1b
clinical trial demonstrated an increase hemoglobin and bone mineral density.
ACE-011 is currently being studied in a Phase 2 trial in multiple myeloma
patients with osteolytic bone disease and is being jointly developed by
Acceleron and Celgene Corporation. The second and newest program, ACE-536, also
increases red blood cells and hemoglobin but with no effects on bone. Both of
these programs are based on Acceleron`s knowledge of the Growth and
Differentiation Factor (GDF) family of proteins. Acceleron`s GDF-based approach
is distinct from approved anemia therapies and those in development, which
generally target one of two pathways to increase red blood cells and hemoglobin:
the vast majority of anemia treatments take a variety of approaches to target
the erythropoietin pathway (EPO), while other development stage programs target
the hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1 alpha) pathway. 

By modulating GDF ligands and receptors, Acceleron`s product candidates address
multiple indications including anemia, cancer, bone loss, and muscle diseases
providing benefit to patients with unmet medical needs. 

About Acceleron

Acceleron is a privately held biopharmaceutical company committed to discover,
develop, manufacture and commercialize novel biotherapeutics that modulate the
growth of bone, muscle, red blood cells, fat and the vasculature to treat
musculoskeletal, metabolic and cancer-related diseases. Acceleron`s scientific
approach takes advantage of its unique insight into the regenerative powers of
the Growth and Differentiation Factor (GDF) family of proteins. ACE-011 is
currently being studied in a Phase 2 clinical trial in multiple myeloma patients
with osteolytic bone disease. ACE-031 is currently being studied in a Phase 1
clinical trial in healthy volunteers. In addition, the company is advancing new
product candidates that increase muscle mass, control angiogenesis, inhibit fat
accumulation and increase hemoglobin. Acceleron utilizes proven biotherapeutic
technologies and capitalizes on the company`s internal GMP manufacturing
capability to rapidly and efficiently advance its therapeutic programs. The
investors in Acceleron are Advanced Technology Ventures, Bessemer Ventures,
Flagship Ventures, MPM BioEquities, OrbiMed Advisors, Polaris Ventures, QVT
Financial, Sutter Hill Ventures and Venrock. For more information, visit

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co never had a chance to bid for Citigroup Inc's Smith Barney business, two people familiar with the matter said, but it may still build a retail brokerage business by acquiring smaller companies, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Citigroup and Morgan Stanley are combining their retail brokerages into a joint venture controlled by Morgan Stanley, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That deal, expected to be announced this week, may be a setback for JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, who has said frequently that he would like to acquire a retail brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup never spoke to JPMorgan about buying Smith Barney because it would not have been a good match, a person familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup was looking for a joint-venture partner that it could merge its business with. It was hoping its joint venture partner could buy Citigroup's stake over a period of years, so that it would not have to sell the entire business in a depressed market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, which has just a small brokerage from its May 2008 acquisition of Bear Stearns Cos, did not meet these requirements, the person said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and Citigroup declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is increasing interest among banks to boost assets under management in their brokerage businesses to diversify their sources of revenue. Many analysts believe JPMorgan does not need to increase brokerage business if it does not want to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Can JPMorgan succeed without a retail brokerage operation? Absolutely," said Brad Hintz, analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein  Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But even if the bank does not absolutely need a retail brokerage business, it may still choose to buy one, Hintz said. "Dimon would be very comfortable with that, it would be one of his favorite businesses to play in," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are not many large brokerages for JPMorgan to buy, after Bank of America Corp and Wells Fargo  Co snapped up Merrill Lynch  Co and Wachovia Corp respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank could buy smaller, regional brokerages, and JPMorgan's recent acquisitions could provide a good foundation, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Certainly, Bear Stearns and JPMorgan Securities gives JPMorgan the infrastructure to build a retail brokerage firm from smaller pieces," said Tim Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management in Bedford Hills, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two years ago in a speech to the CFA Society of Chicago, Dimon said he would love to have a retail brokerage, but that its absence is "not going to cripple" JPMorgan. "We can build a great bank without it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the end of the third quarter, JPMorgan had 323 brokers from Bear Stearns, and the Bear brokerage contributed $131 million to revenue, according to a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Dan Wilchins; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Jan 13 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded AMB
Property Corp AMB.N and six other real estate investment
trusts (REITs), and said it expects them to continue facing a
tough operating environment in 2009 with negative returns
expected this time around as well.

 "We think REITs will underperform the SP 500 index .SPX
given J.P. Morgan's strategy forecast of a possible 20 percent
market return," analyst Anthony Paolone said in a note to
clients.

  Paolone said Wall Street earnings estimates would decline
with fundamentals proving to be weaker than expected.

 "Weak fundamentals should lead to more earnings downside,"
Paolone said. "Job losses accelerated through 2008 and could
continue well into 2009."

 The analyst also said that given the lag in commercial real
estate trends, he expects the worst occupancy and rent trends
of the cycle to unfold in 2009.

 He expects another 6 percent downside to the consensus
estimates for annual funds from operations (FFO).

 Separately, Paolone also upgraded Nationwide Health
Properties NHP.N and six others, and said the easing of
liquidity concerns could be the upshot to the group this year.

 "We think loan extensions and adding equity to balance
sheets will be commonplace, and it is justifiable to put
balance sheet strength above earnings in this environment," he
added.

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 13 (Reuters)- Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) has reported
flaring at its 150,000-barrel-per-day refinery in Torrance, California,
where it recently shut key processing units including the fluid catalytic
cracker for planned work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In an environmental filing late Monday with the California Emergency
Management Agency, Exxon Mobil said "flaring ongoing - exceeded 1,000 lbs
NOX." A similar filing earlier that day with the agency noted that the
refinery hasexceeded certain emissions limits due to a flaring event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Los Angeles-area refinery shut the FCC, the hydrotreater, the
alkylation unit and a sulfur recovery unit  since Dec. 30 for a few weeks
of maintenance but the crude unit remains in operation, a spokeswoman said
on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Jan 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) announced today in Canada an important expansion of
its Zero Liability program, which will now include Visa Business cards
issued by Canadian financial institutions. The move can help better
protect Visa Business cardholders from losses due to fraudulent
transactions.

    In a consumer survey(i) of more than one thousand Canadian Visa
cardholders, 80 percent of respondents indicated they were extremely or
very interested in having Zero Liability protection on their Visa card,
with 30 percent ranking Zero Liability as the most appealing feature.

    "Visa Business cards offer many benefits to small business owners in
Canada and the addition of Zero Liability is another reason for them to
use a Visa card with confidence," said Kareem Chouli, Head of Commercial
Solutions in Canada, Visa Inc. "Security is a priority for Visa, and the
Zero Liability policy is an important layer of our fraud prevention
efforts."

    Visa's Zero Liability policy protects business cardholders against fraud
exactly the same way as it protects personal cardholders. Zero Liability
means that business cardholders who have been victims of credit card
fraud, including unauthorized transactions made via telephone or on the
internet, do not pay for fraudulent transactions. Zero Liability does not
apply to transactions with Visa Corporate or Visa Purchasing cards.

    Personal Visa cardholders, including those who have been issued a Visa
chip and PIN card, from Canadian-issued financial institutions will
continue to be protected by the Zero Liability policy. All Visa
cardholders must comply with the terms of their cardholder agreement
including protecting their PIN where applicable.

    With Visa Business cards, small businesses can conveniently manage their
finances by separating business and personal spending, and tracking and
analyzing expenses online. Online resources at visa.ca/smallbusiness
include free business tools and guides, articles, as well as information
about the Visa Savings for Business program - offering exclusive
discounts to Canadian Visa Business cardholders.

    About Visa

    Visa Inc. operates the world's largest retail electronic payments network
providing processing services and payment product platforms. This
includes consumer credit, debit, prepaid and commercial payments, which
are offered under the Visa, Visa Electron, Interlink and PLUS brands.

    A national survey was conducted online in September 2006 by Burak
Jacobsen Research Partners Inc. for Visa Canada. A total of 1,015 adults
aged 18 to 64 who have a Visa card and who have used it for personal
spending in the past three months were surveyed.

&lt;p&gt;A Live and Archived Copy of the Presentation Will Be Available on Incyte's
Websiteon January 13, 2009, Beginning at 3:30 pm PT/6:30 pm ET
WILMINGTON, Del.--(Business Wire)--
Incyte Corporation (Nasdaq:INCY) will announce today at the 27th Annual JPMorgan
Healthcare Conference its 2009 corporate objectives, including its decision to
focus on clinical programs with the greatest near-term value. 

These programs include:

* Janus kinase (JAK) inhibitor program for:

- myelofibrosis (MF),
- polycythemia vera (PV) &amp; essential thrombocythemia (ET),
- rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and
- psoriasis 
* 11beta-HSD1 (HSD1) inhibitor program for type 2 diabetes 
* Sheddase inhibitor program for breast cancer

Paul Friedman, M.D., Incyte's President and CEO, stated, "Our most important
clinical priority is to complete our planned pivotal trials for our lead product
candidate, INCB18424, in myelofibrosis. With our special protocol assessment for
myelofibrosis recently submitted to the FDA, we remain on track to initiate
registration trials, one in the U.S. and one in Europe, during the first half of
2009. 

Our decision to focus on clinical programs with the greatest likelihood of
creating near-term value supports our goal to spend less in 2009 than we spent
in 2008. Additionally, given the challenging economic environment, a second
financial objective in 2009 is to establish partnerships for a number of
programs including our lead metabolic program, HSD1. A third objective for this
year is to reduce and/or restructure our debt." 

Incyte intends to provide formal 2009 guidance during its year-end / 4th quarter
press release and conference call in February. 

Programs that will not receive funding in 2009 include:

* JAK inhibitor for multiple myeloma and hormone refractory prostate cancer 
* HM74a agonist for type 2 diabetes 
* CCR2 inhibitor for multiple sclerosis 
* CCR5 inhibitor for HIV

Partnership Objectives

In addition to partnering HSD1, Incyte is looking to establish alliances for
several other programs and/or indications that require extensive development and
commercial resources or are outside the core focus of the Company in oncology
and inflammation. 

New Oncology Programs

Two new oncology programs involving oral inhibitors of c-MET and indoleamine 2,
3-dioxygenase (IDO) have been cleared by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA) to begin clinical trials. Dr. Friedman will describe the c-MET program
during his presentation. The IDO inhibitor program will be discussed at a future
date. 

The initiation of Phase I trials for these compounds in 2009 depends upon
partnering one or more of Incyte`s other programs. 

Clinical Objectives

JAK Inhibitor Program

INCB18424 (MPDs)

* Secure agreement with the FDA regarding the special protocol assessment (SPA)
for approval in MF 
* Initiate registration trials in MF during the first half of 2009 
* Complete and present results from Phase II trial in PV/ET patients in the
second half of 2009

INCB18424 (psoriasis)

* Complete and present results from the ongoing three-month Phase IIb trial with
the topical formulation in mild to moderate psoriasis patients in the second
half of 2009

INCB18424 and INCB28050 (rheumatoid arthritis)

* Select lead compound to advance into Phase II program during the first quarter
of 2009

11beta-HSD1 Inhibitor Program

* Complete and present results from the three-month Phase IIb trial in type 2
diabetes in mid-2009 
* Secure partnership

Sheddase Inhibitor Program

* Complete and present results from the Phase II breast cancer trial in
combination with Herceptin(R) in the second half of the year

&lt;p&gt;Storage Efficiency Technologies Enable Customers to Significantly Lower IT
Infrastructure Costs
SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
As customers look to reduce costs amid the current economic climate, NetApp
(NASDAQ:NTAP) today announced that it is extending its 50% Virtualization
Guarantee* Program, previously available only for VMware, to Citrix and
Microsoft virtual environments. As part of the program, NetApp is offering a
guarantee that customers will use 50% less storage with NetApp compared to
traditional storage in Citrix XenServer and Microsoft Windows Server Hyper-V
virtual environments. According to industry estimates, most storage that IT
organizations purchase is inefficient and underutilized. The NetApp guarantee
minimizes investment costs and risks while enabling customers to achieve greater
storage utilization in their virtual server and desktop environments. 

"Recently introduced guarantee programs vary widely in what is covered and what
is guaranteed. Careful evaluation and judgment is needed, but when users qualify
and find that the solutions meet their requirements, they should consider these
guarantees a plus in the vendor's favor," said April Adams, research director,
Gartner, in the November 2008 report, Capacity Savings and Storage Utilization
Guarantees: What's Included, and Are They Worth Considering? Adams also said,
"During the research phase of your next storage purchasing cycle, ask each
vendor if it offers a capacity savings or utilization guarantee." 

NetApp`s unique program assures customers that they will use less storage,
achieve better data protection, and increase flexibility when they select NetApp
and leverage its unique storage-efficiency technologies such as thin
provisioning, deduplication, RAID-DP, and Snapshot, all of which come standard
on NetApp systems. No other large storage vendor is willing or able to match
this guarantee. As a result, customers can buy less storage and reduce their
overall power, space, and cooling costs in their data centers. 

NetApp customer Transplace provides comprehensive transportation and logistics
management services and technology to major shippers. Transplace trusted NetApp
to support its virtualization environment. Transplace achieved as much as 93%
space savings leveraging NetApp storage-efficiency technologies such as
deduplication. The use of deduplication in all of its virtual environments has
enabled Transplace to achieve massive space savings of more than 11TB. 

"We're responsible for the global logistics for many Fortune 1000 companies. The
more efficient we can make our processes and infrastructure, the more we can
directly impact our ability to execute and respond to the needs of our
customers," said Vincent Biddlecombe, CTO of Transplace. "We needed a solution
that gave us better business continuity and greater flexibility in our test and
development environment. We rearchitected our entire data center infrastructure,
making NetApp storage over Ethernet our new standard. This solution has since
allowed us to increase customer service levels while simultaneously meeting our
own tight budget constraints. The bottom line was that NetApp saved us a ton of
money and improved our ability to offer enhanced services to our customers." 

NetApp is committed to helping customers drive cost inefficiencies out of their
data centers. With the proven expertise and technology that may provide
customers to use 50% less storage compared to other competitive offerings,
NetApp is helping customers tap into the unrealized potential of their virtual
infrastructures. 

"Virtualization is at the heart of helping our customers reduce costs and adapt
to changing business needs," said Frank Artale, vice president of Business
Development, Citrix Systems. "NetApp extends the value of virtualization by
delivering greater efficiency in the storage infrastructure, a requirement for
any virtual environment. NetApp`s guarantee gives customers confidence that they
can realize greater efficiencies in their XenServer virtual environments and be
more flexible and responsive to business change." 

"Applying virtualization technologies broadly across the IT infrastructure, such
as those offered by Microsoft for addressing the needs of the desktop through
the data center, yields important benefits in reducing costs and attaining
greater efficiency, flexibility, continuity, and agility," said Zane Adam,
senior director, Virtualization at Microsoft. "With the combination of the
storage capabilities from NetApp and server virtualization offerings from
Microsoft, customers can quickly provision both their storage and servers.
Together, NetApp and Microsoft deliver greater IT efficiencies with improved
flexibility, helping drive down cost and complexity for customers` operations." 

Availability and Requirements

Customers anywhere in the world who purchase a new system for their virtual
desktop and server environment, including Citrix XenServer, VMware ESX, and
Microsoft Windows Server Hyper-V, can take advantage of this program. If
customers don't use 50% less storage with NetApp compared to competitive storage
systems after following established best practices implemented by NetApp
Professional Services and utilizing NetApp Data ONTAP storage-efficiency
technologies, NetApp will provide the additional capacity needed to meet
customers` shortfall, up to 50% of the original capacity purchased, at no
additional charge*. Qualifying service delivery is available from NetApp Global
Services or participating Authorized Professional Service Partners in networked
storage for virtualized platforms.

program details including FAQs, technical resources, best practices, and the new
NetApp Storage Efficiency Calculator to evaluate your current environment and

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Jan 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM Research (NYSE: IBM) scientists, in collaboration with the Center for
Probing the Nanoscale at Stanford University, have demonstrated magnetic
resonance imaging (MRI) with volume resolution 100 million times finer
than conventional MRI.

    See the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAA4FGKCBik

    This result, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of
Sciences (PNAS), signals a significant step forward in tools for
molecular biology and nanotechnology by offering the ability to study
complex 3D structures at the nanoscale.

    By extending MRI to such fine resolution, the scientists have created a
microscope that, with further development, may ultimately be powerful
enough to unravel the structure and interactions of proteins, paving the
way for new advances in personalized healthcare and targeted medicine.
This achievement stands to impact the study of materials -- from proteins
to integrated circuits -- for which a detailed understanding of atomic
structure is essential.

    "This technology stands to revolutionize the way we look at viruses,
bacteria, proteins, and other biological elements," said IBM Fellow Mark
Dean, vice president of strategy and operations for IBM Research.

    This advancement was enabled by a technique called magnetic resonance
force microscopy (MRFM), which relies on detecting ultrasmall magnetic
forces. In addition to its high resolution, the imaging technique has the
further advantages that it is chemically specific, can "see" below
surfaces and, unlike electron microscopy, is non-destructive to sensitive
biological materials.

    For more than a decade, IBM scientists have been making pioneering
advances in MRFM. Now, the IBM-led team has dramatically boosted the
sensitivity of MRFM and combined it with an advanced 3D image
reconstruction technique. This allowed them to demonstrate, for the first
time, MRI on nanometer-scale biological objects. The technique was
applied to a sample of tobacco mosaic virus and achieved resolution down
to four nanometers. (One nanometer is one billionth of a meter; a tobacco
mosaic virus is 18 nanometers across.)

    "MRI is well known as a powerful tool for medical imaging, but its
capability for microscopy has always been very limited," said  Dan Rugar,
manager of nanoscale studies, IBM Research. "Our hope is that nano MRI
will eventually allow us to directly image the internal structure of
individual protein molecules and molecular complexes, which is key to
understanding biological function."

    The new device does not work like a conventional MRI scanner, which uses
gradient and imaging coils. Instead, the researchers use MRFM to detect
tiny magnetic forces as the sample sits on a microscopic cantilever --
essentially a tiny sliver of silicon shaped like a diving board. Laser
interferometry tracks the motion of the cantilever, which vibrates
slightly as magnetic spins in the hydrogen atoms of the sample interact
with a nearby nanoscopic magnetic tip. The tip is scanned in three
dimensions and the cantilever vibrations are analyzed to create a 3D
image.

    IBM Research has a  distinguished history in developing microscopes for
nanoscale imaging and science. IBM researchers Gerd Binnig and Heinrich
Rohrer received the 1986 Nobel Prize in Physics for their invention of
the scanning tunneling microscope, which can image individual atoms on
electrically conducting surfaces.

    Additionally, IBM has a track record dating back to the 1950s of improving
healthcare through scientific achievements and collaboration with
healthcare companies. In the last decade, IBM has developed a national
digital mammography archive with the University of Pennsylvania; developed
a clinical trial participant system with the Mayo Clinic; collaborated
with Scripps to understand how influenza viruses mutate and proactively
develop treatments; collaborated with European universities to develop
better methods to decide on antiretroviral therapies for HIV; launched
the World Community Grid, which has done projects on cancer, aids, dengue
fever; and much more.

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Nordstrom Downgraded to Sell

Nordstrom Inc. (NYSE: JWN) pulled out all the stops during the holidays to
encourage consumers to shop in its stores. Unfortunately, its December sales
still declined 8% year-over-year, and management announced that it was going to
miss its fourth quarter EPS guidance of $0.35-$0.45. 

While 2008 was difficult environment for Nordstrom, we think that 2009 will be
even worse for the retailer. We are reducing our 2009 EPS estimate from $1.66 to
$1.00. This reduction reflects our view that sales will decline 6.5% and its
gross margin will contract 250 basis points. 

Smith Micro Retains a Buy

Smith Micro Software Inc. (NASDAQ: SMSI) is a developer of wireless
communications software and utility software for multiple OS [operating systems]
platforms. 

It has significant relationships with several large cellular providers and OEM
[original equipment manufacturer] cell phone makers. We remain encouraged by the
company`s recent results and strong brand recognition. 

Chevron Adjusting Downward

After the market close yesterday, Chevron (NYSE: CVX)provided a
weaker-than-expected preliminary update for the fourth quarter of 2008. The
update, which covers the first two months of the quarter, provides for
below-guidance production of crude oil and natural gas and price realizations
that are below benchmark levels. 

Realized margins in the downstream business were in line with benchmark levels,
while throughput levels were as per guidance. The company also indicated that
write-offs and other corporate items for the quarter will be higher than the
previous guidance. 

On the whole, the update will result in downward adjustment for quarterly
earnings for Chevron and set up the stage for what to expect from the other
major integrated oil companies like Exxon (NYSE: XOM) and ConocoPhillips (NYSE:
COP) in year-end results. Chevron reports fourth quarter results on January 30,
2009.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds data on private equity acquisitions, updates market

&lt;p&gt; By Wakako Sato and Emi Emoto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Jan 13 (Reuters) - USJ Co Ltd 2142.T, which
operates a Universal Studios theme park in Japan, may go

&lt;p&gt;PISA, TIMSS Join Forces With Cisco, Intel and Microsoft to Develop Next
Generation of Assessments
LONDON--(Business Wire)--
Three leading technology companies announced today a collaboration aimed at
transforming global educational assessment and improving learning outcomes. At
the Learning and Technology World Forum in London, Cisco, Intel and Microsoft
unveiled plans to underwrite a multi-sector research project to develop new
assessment approaches, methods and technologies for measuring the success of
21st-century teaching and learning in classrooms around the world. During the
session, the three companies called upon educational leaders, governments and
other corporations to join in the effort. 

The three companies also announced the appointment of Barry McGaw PhD, currently
the director of the Melbourne Education Research Institute at the University of
Melbourne, as executive director of the project. McGaw will oversee an executive
committee, project lead team, and up to 50 leading experts and innovators in
academia and government, to collaborate on the research and assist in
influencing the development of future international and national assessments. 

With an extensive background in academia and research, McGaw has served as the
director for Education at the Organization for Economic Co-Operation and
Development (OECD) where he was involved with international education
assessments in the Program for International Student Assessment (PISA). 

"Shrinking resources and market pressures mean that education can no longer be
the sole responsibility of governments," said McGaw. "Building the future
workforce will require a commitment from the private sector to partner with
public institutions. Reforming assessment is essential to enabling any systemic
change in education. And change on a global scale is required to equip students
of today with the skills they need to succeed in the workforce of tomorrow.
PISA`s international education assessments focus on key competencies in reading,
mathematics and science. In PISA 2003, we took a step by adding an assessment of
problem solving, but one limited to analogical reasoning. We hoped to add
information and communications technology (ICT) competence in PISA 2006 but did
not succeed. We all need now to work together to advance assessment practice." 

The assessment research and development project spearheaded by Cisco, Intel and
Microsoft has received the support of major international assessment
organizations. Specifically, OECD and the International Association of the
Evaluation of Educational Achievement (IEA) have expressed interest in using the
evidence-based and verifiable output of the 21st-century skills assessment to
inform the development of the next versions of PISA and Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS), their respective international
benchmarks. 

"In the global economy, it is the world`s best performing education systems, not
simply improvement by national standards, that have become the yardstick for
educational success," said Andreas Schleicher, Head of Education Indicators and
Analysis, OECD. "That is why more and more countries measure the relative
strengths and weaknesses of their education systems with OECD`s global PISA
assessments. To do so effectively, it is crucially important that these
assessments continue to evolve to reflect the skills that matter for individuals
and economies. Technology-based assessments will be critical to this and the
project brings together key partners that can help PISA make this happen." 

"IEA is committed to the greater integration of IT into all its assessments,
especially TIMSS and the Progress in International Reading Literacy Study," said
Seamus Hegarty, chair of the IEA. "This reflects the changes in learning
environments and the potential of technology to enhance the teaching and
learning process. We look forward to working with the collaboration to achieve
our common goals for young learners." 

Based on extensive research1, Cisco, Intel and Microsoft concluded that most
education systems have not kept pace with the dramatic changes in the economy
and the skill sets that are required for students to succeed. These skills
include the ability to think critically and creatively; to work cooperatively;
and to adapt to the evolving use of technology in business and society. 

The project will focus on several key areas that will offer the most promising
opportunities for transforming education and assessment. Teams of educators and
academics will focus on enabling education assessment methodologies and
technologies, effective learning environments, and replicable ICT-enabled
teaching and assessment methods that foster the development and assessment of
the skills students will need to succeed. To accelerate the project in time to
influence the next versions of PISA and TIMSS, the project will review
successful classroom practices for the teaching and testing of 21st-century
skills and draw implications for large-scale assessments. 

"Cisco believes a holistic transformation of the global educational system
requires a long-term, multi-stakeholder commitment from the public and private
sector," said Michael Stevenson, vice president of Global Education, Cisco. "We
believe the collaboration between Cisco, Intel and Microsoft can serve as an
impetus in creating and implementing an international assessment standard to
measure skills and abilities that are critical for student success in the
21st-century." 

"Cisco, Intel and Microsoft each have a long commitment to global education and
enabling and empowering educators," said Will Swope, Intel`s vice president and
general manager, Corporate Sustainability Group. "The collaboration will help us
to reach our common goal of transforming education around the world.
Specifically, we are aiming to resolve the gap that exists between what goes on
in schools and what goes on in the real world and better measure the skills that
are truly needed for the 21st-century." 

"As we continue to engage with government leaders, institutions and educators,
one of the most important points that is consistently raised is the need for
public and private sectors to unite in an effort to extend access to quality
education, increase graduation rates and create a consistent way to measure
success," said Anoop Gupta, corporate vice president for the Unlimited Potential
Group, the Education Product Group, and Technology Policy and Strategy at
Microsoft. "Through this collaboration, we hope to inspire others to join the
mission because we believe that, together, we can make greater impact towards
ensuring students of today are better prepared for the workforce of tomorrow."

to IBM customers, helping to maintain computers and software
systems primarily located in the United States, IBM said late
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp said it plans to
employ several hundred people in the facility by the end of
this year, following renovations to the top eight floors of the
building that it will occupy to make it more energy efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the end of next year, as many as 1,300 IBM employees
will work in the building built in the 1930s, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, IBM announced plans to work with Michigan State
University to build a software development center in East
Lansing, Michigan, that will create up to 1,500 jobs over the
next five years.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to additional subscribers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tony Munroe and George Chen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Jan 14 (Reuters) - Mount Kellett Capital
Management, a private equity firm run by former Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) partner Mark McGoldrick, has raised at least $1.5 billion
and is on the hunt for investments, several market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The global fund which McGoldrick - known as 'Goldfinger' -
launched last year had originally sought to raise about $5
billion but was slowed by the market meltdown, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Calls to McGoldrick's office in New York were not returned.
Brad Landes, Mount Kellett's managing director and deputy head of
Asia, said the firm does not speak to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGoldrick earned his nickname while at Goldman Sachs, where
as co-head of its lucrative global special situations group he
was reported by media to have been paid between $40 million and
$70 million in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He left Goldman Sachs in 2007 but the Wall Street bank had
helped Mount Kellett raise funding, market sources said. A
Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The multi-strategy fund, which is named after a mountain in
Hong Kong, has attracted several Goldman Sachs veterans to its
staff. It also has an office in Mumbai and one source said it
plans to open one in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "$1.5 billion is a good amount to launch with in this
market," one fund industry insider said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another person familiar with the matter said Mount Kellett
plans to raise additional funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fund manager in Asia with knowledge of Mount Kellett said
the firm was seeking investment opportunities across industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is looking for companies in good financial shape and of
substantial size, and is targeting deals in the $100 million
range, the fund manager said.     "They are aggressively looking
for deals," the fund manager said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Numerous bankers have left Wall Street to launch private
equity and hedge funds, although the harsh current climate makes
fund-raising a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch's former Asia investment banking chief, Sheldon
Trainor, recently left the bank to launch a private equity fund
but will continue to serve as an advisor to Merrill's new owner,
Bank of America (BAC.N), a source familiar with the matter said
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michael Flaherty in Hong Kong and

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N),
the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, this week told
investors it would not attend a key bond market conference in
Las Vegas due to the "current environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The annual conference, held by the American Securitization

&lt;p&gt;  SEOUL, KOREA, Jan 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced that Kookmin Bank (NYSE: KB), Korea's largest
banking institution, will adopt IBM System z10 as the platform for its
next-generation core banking application system. This bank-wide project
will consolidate all of the bank's different business units across the
world, providing a highly flexible and secure platform to transform
Kookmin Bank into a leading global bank of the future.

    Through the adoption of IBM System z10, Kookmin Bank will secure a
world-class, customer service-oriented IT infrastructure and gain a
footing to upgrade its financial operations based on cutting-edge
technology. In addition, this also supports the Bank's strategy of
innovating its data center operations and management by building a
smarter IT environment that drives cost effectiveness and energy
efficiency.

    Before the contract was signed in December 2008, Kookmin Bank evaluated
systems and technology from IBM and other vendors including
Hewlett-Packard, Oracle and TmaxSoft. The bank also carried out benchmark
tests (BMTs) for its core banking application and database management
systems on IBM System z9 and Unix server for Multi Channel Interface (MCI)
and Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) application over a six-month
period last year both in and outside of Korea. The BMTs were used to
assess and verify core technology components and involved handling a
large volume of online transactions to closely simulate the actual
environment.

    According to Kookmin Bank, it chose IBM technology to build its platform
as it provides the best stability, usability, and security for the
enhancement in customer service quality.

    Kookmin Bank started the NGBS project in 2007. As the bank's service
provider, IBM is currently developing the framework of the project and
building a customer-centric, user-friendly application system. With a
highly responsive and flexible IT infrastructure providing 24x7
availability, Kookmin Bank will be able to promptly respond to the
changing financial environment. Other benefits include business
continuity based on a seamless disaster recovery solution, minimum
deployment and stronger monitoring, as well as improved support for the
bank's global operations. In turn, the bank will be able to leverage new
technology, devices and media to provide world-class services to its
customers globally.

    SukYoung Kang, Director, Financial Services Sector, IBM Korea, said, "IBM
System z10 and DB2 is being regarded as the strategic platform for global
integration worldwide. Our Open Infrastructure Offering (OIO) contract
with Kookmin Bank reaffirms its trust in IBM's mainframe for
mission-critical work. IBM will provide all of its business and
technology values for the successful implementation of Kookmin Bank's
next-generation core banking application system."

    About Kookmin Bank

    Kookmin Bank is one of the top leading banks in Asia. As of the end of
June 2008, Kookmin Bank had KRW258 trillion in total assets, 26 million
active clients, and 1,218 branches. Kookmin Bank was also the first in
the world to introduce mobile banking. For more details, visit

    About IBM System z10

    The adoption of IBM mainframes, which power the top 50 banks worldwide and
22 of the top 25 US retailers, has enabled IBM's System z to nearly double
its share this decade, according to IDC's high-end server quarterly
tracker. Over the same timeframe, HP and Sun have lost its share.(1)
Examples of the clients in Financial Services Sector that have adopted IBM
mainframes include: Industrial Bank of Korea, Itau Bank (Brazil), Postbank
AG (Germany), Finanz Informatik (Germany), RHB Banking Group (Malaysia),
and Allied Irish Bank. For more information on the facts about IBM's
System z mainframe, visit IBM's Get the Facts website.

    About IBM's Project Big Green

    In May 2007, IBM launched Project Big Green to help clients around the
world improve the efficiency of IT and better optimize their data center
resources. IBM invested US$1 billion to increase the efficiency of IBM
products to help data centers reduce energy consumption, demonstrating its
energy efficiency by consolidating up to 3,900 computer servers onto about
30 System z servers running Linux operating system and virtualization
technology. In the past year, IBM has engaged with more than 2,000
clients, delivering a variety of hardware, software and services
technologies to help businesses reduce data center energy consumption and

&lt;p&gt; (Updates with further Exxon comment paragraph 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Jan 14 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N)
150,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in
Torrance, California, on Wednesday was contending with an upset
in an undisclosed unit while a major overhaul of its gasoline
production units was underway, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new upset began Monday night, triggering flaring at the
refinery, and did not involve one of the gasoline production
units being overhauled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has declined to say which unit was involved in the
Monday upset, but sources familiar with refinery operations
said it was the refinery's hydrogen plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon spokeswoman Aarti Ramachandran said no units have
been shut at the refinery due to the Monday upset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon began an overhaul of the refinery's 100,200 bpd
gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit on Dec. 30.
The refinery's hydrotreater, alkylation unit and a sulfur
recovery unit were included in the FCC overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramachandran said the Monday upset would have a minor
impact on refinery production.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The housing market may have much further to fall because of the huge supply of unsold homes, and the time may be right for large-scale government intervention, a top Goldman Sachs economists said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a paper released on Tuesday night, economist Jan Hatzius said total credit losses may exceed $2 trillion, up from his March 2008 forecast for losses of around $1.2 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than half of the total represents losses on residential mortgages, with the rest coming from commercial real estate, credit cards, auto loans and corporate debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hatzius said the Case-Shiller index, which tracks home prices in 20 major cities, may have another 20 to 25 percent to fall by the third quarter of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The good news is that housing valuations at the national level have largely normalized following the price declines of the past 2-1/2 years," Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bad news, unfortunately, is that our formal house price model suggests that it may not matter all that much how close house prices are to fundamental value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hatzius said that although various measures of affordability and price were now at or near historical norms, there were so many unsold homes on the market that it was pushing prices well below normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling house prices can drive up defaults and worsen both banks' balance sheets and the broader economy, so it was "appropriate" for the government to consider more aggressive intervention to limit the number of defaults, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The huge number of defaults over the next few years suggests a focus on bulk programs, which can be implemented across the board and do not require detailed knowledge of the situation of each individual borrower," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Writing down the principal amount of home loans was a more effective way of reducing defaults than lowering the interest rate. Policy-makers may want to "expend significant resources" on subsidizing such loan modifications to stop the housing rot from causing severe economic damage, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hatzius acknowledged that such a program would be difficult to design and implement fairly, and ran the risk of inadvertently rewarding people for making bad bets or giving public money to borrowers who didn't really need the help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If conditions deteriorate further, he said the government might consider becoming a "landlord of last resort" by buying up houses at low prices and renting them out to people who lost their homes to foreclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also backed steps by the U.S. Federal Reserve and Treasury Department to push down mortgage rates, and said financial firms may need even more capital to cope with the looming credit losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if policy-makers are successful in averting a worst-case outcome, the U.S. housing market will likely remain a drag on the financial system and the broader economy for an extended period," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Tom Hals)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Jan 14 (Reuters) - The U.S. housing market may
have much further to fall because of the huge supply of unsold
homes, and the time may be right for large-scale government
intervention, a top Goldman Sachs economists said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In a paper released on Tuesday night, economist Jan Hatzius
said total credit losses may exceed $2 trillion, up from his
March 2008 forecast for losses of around $1.2 trillion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More than half of the total represents losses on
residential mortgages, with the rest coming from commercial
real estate, credit cards, auto loans and corporate debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hatzius said the Case-Shiller index, which tracks home
prices in 20 major cities, may have another 20 to 25 percent to
fall by the third quarter of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The good news is that housing valuations at the national
level have largely normalized following the price declines of
the past 2-1/2 years," Hatzius said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The bad news, unfortunately, is that our formal house
price model suggests that it may not matter all that much how
close house prices are to fundamental value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hatzius said that although various measures of
affordability and price were now at or near historical norms,
there were so many unsold homes on the market that it was
pushing prices well below normal levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Falling house prices can drive up defaults and worsen both
banks' balance sheets and the broader economy, so it was
"appropriate" for the government to consider more aggressive
intervention to limit the number of defaults, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The huge number of defaults over the next few years
suggests a focus on bulk programs, which can be implemented
across the board and do not require detailed knowledge of the
situation of each individual borrower," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writing down the principal amount of home loans was a more
effective way of reducing defaults than lowering the interest
rate. Policy-makers may want to "expend significant resources"
on subsidizing such loan modifications to stop the housing rot
from causing severe economic damage, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hatzius acknowledged that such a program would be difficult
to design and implement fairly, and ran the risk of
inadvertently rewarding people for making bad bets or giving
public money to borrowers who didn't really need the help.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If conditions deteriorate further, he said the government
might consider becoming a "landlord of last resort" by buying
up houses at low prices and renting them out to people who lost
their homes to foreclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also backed steps by the U.S. Federal Reserve and
Treasury Department to push down mortgage rates, and said
financial firms may need even more capital to cope with the
looming credit losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even if policy-makers are successful in averting a
worst-case outcome, the U.S. housing market will likely remain
a drag on the financial system and the broader economy for an
extended period," he said.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Jan 14 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N)
150,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in
Torrance, California, was contending with an upset in an
undisclosed unit Wednesday while performing a major overhaul on
gasoline production units, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The new upset began Monday night, triggering flaring at the
refinery, and did not involve one of the units involved in the
overhaul of the gasoline production units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company was working to resolve the upset on Wednesday
morning, Exxon spokeswoman Aarti Ramachandran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon has declined to say which unit was involved in the
Monday upset, but sources familiar with refinery operations
said it was the refinery's hydrogen plant that went down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon began an overhaul of the refinery's 100,200 bpd
gasoline-producing fluidic catalytic cracking unit on Dec. 30.
The refinery's hydrotreater, alkylation unit and a sulfur
recovery unit were included in the FCC overhaul.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, Exxon said the Monday upset would have a minor
impact on refinery production. On Wednesday, Ramachandran said
it was unclear if the problem was still affecting output from
the refinery.

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola launches multi-million dollar marketing effort in support of recycling
expected to achieve nearly one billion impressions
SPARTANBURG, S.C.--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company and United Resource Recovery Corporation (URRC) joined
government leaders and environmental experts today to celebrate the grand
opening of the world`s largest plastic bottle-to-bottle recycling plant in
Spartanburg, S.C. As part of the celebration, Coca-Cola announced the launch of
a multi-million dollar marketing effort supporting recycling called "Give it
Back." 

"Today we turn our commitments into action as we mark a key milestone in our
goal to recycle and reuse 100 percent of our bottles and cans in the U.S. and
ensure the sustainability of our packaging," said Sandy Douglas, president of
Coca-Cola North America. "The opening of the Spartanburg plant, coupled with our
investment in recycling businesses, programs and a new marketing effort,
underscores our belief that our packaging has value and we want it back - both
for our own supply chain and to support the myriad of other uses for recycled
aluminum and plastic." 

When fully operational, the plant will produce approximately 100 million pounds
of food-grade recycled PET plastic each year - the equivalent of nearly two
billion 20-ounce Coca-Cola bottles. Recycling PET for reuse yields significant
environmental benefits. Over the next ten years the plant will prevent the
release of one million metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions - the equivalent
of removing 215,000 cars from the road. In addition to environmental benefits,
the 30-acre Spartanburg plant has created 100 new jobs in the local community. 

"We have been working with Coca-Cola for more than 10 years to help accelerate
the development and commercialization of new, sustainable recycling technology,"
said Carlos Gutierrez, president of United Resource Recovery Corporation (URRC).
"Today, we are not only proud to be part of the opening of the largest plant of
its kind in the world, but also hopeful that Spartanburg can serve as an example
of how investing in recycling infrastructure can have both environmental and
economic benefits." 

"Give it Back" Program

The "Give it Back" program is designed to remind consumers that Coca-Cola
bottles and cans are valuable recyclables. The new multi-million dollar
marketing effort supporting recycling will produce nearly one billion
impressions in 2009 through billboard, print and television advertising, online
messaging and promotional activities nationwide and at 600 college campuses
across the United States. 

"Coca-Cola has the unique ability to connect with millions of consumers every
day through refreshment," said Katie Bayne, chief marketing officer, Coca-Cola
North America. "Our brands are inspiring people to join us in the act of
recycling as we encourage consumers to `Give it Back` and help us achieve our
goal to recycle and reuse all of our bottles and cans." 

Coca-Cola debuted a new television ad promoting recycling yesterday during the
season premiere of American Idol on FOX, reaching millions of viewers. The
30-second ad, entitled "Portal," informs consumers that, "if you've had a Coke
in the last 40 years, you've played a part in one of the largest beverage
recycling efforts in the world." "Portal" will air during American Idol and
other prime time programming during the first and second quarters. To view the
ad and learn more about "Give it Back" please go to: www.livepositively.com. 

New Year`s Eve revelers at Times Square in New York City witnessed the "Give it
Back" themed creative on Coca-Cola`s iconic Times Square billboard. The animated
billboard ad reminded people to recycle through the mantra "Recycle, Reuse,
Repeat" and featured a series of "Give it Back" logos inside a Coca-Cola contour
bottle. 

"Give it Back" was first introduced on recycling bins and outdoor advertising
during the Democratic and Republican National Conventions, where Coca-Cola
Recycling, LLC, a joint venture between The Coca-Cola Company and its largest
bottler, Coca-Cola Enterprises, served as the official recycling provider for
both events. Similar outdoor advertising will run in Washington, D.C., New York
City, Charlotte, N.C., and other major markets throughout this year. College
students at more than 600 campuses also will participate in "Give it Back"
themed recycling programs.

&lt;p&gt;FULTON, Md.--(Business Wire)--
DocPoint Solutions, (www.docpointsolutions.com), a subsidiary of Quality
Associates, Inc., focused on providing Microsoft SharePoint to organizations
that are looking to expand employee collaboration and increase the exchange of
information, today announced that, for the first time, it is offering a
comprehensive SharePoint workforce collaboration services package that includes
KnowledgeLake Enterprise Content Management (ECM) solutions to all federal
agencies. 

DocPoint Solutions is a preferred government provider of SharePoint
implementation, training, and support services through its status on the
Government Services Administration (GSA) schedule. The GSA schedule is the
favored purchasing mechanism for most federal buyers. It is a list of providers
who have agreed to certain standards of quality, price, and fairness and have
met a rigorous application process. 

DocPoint`s SharePoint solutions package combines the convenience and usability
of Microsoft SharePoint, which is software that enables employee collaboration
via a secure intranet, with GSA-listed, digital content management software from
KnowledgeLake, a St. Louis company that makes software for converting paper
documents into electronic data using scanners, fax servers, or multi-function
devices. Once a document is converted into a digital format, it can then be
imported into SharePoint. In addition to its GSA status and partnership with
KnowledgeLake, DocPoint also holds certified status in Microsoft`s Partner
Program. 

Robert G. Bueltmann, Vice President of Business Development, KnowledgeLake, said
"We are pleased to be making our products available to the federal government
through our partnership with DocPoint Solutions, and we selected them for their
industry knowledge and expertise. DocPoint Solutions` service offerings,
combined with our enterprise content management software, add a great deal of
usability and functionality to Microsoft SharePoint that will be of great
benefit to federal agencies that need to increase staff collaboration and
improve information accessibility." 

"We are pleased to announce the start of a long and rewarding partnership with
the federal government to supply all of their SharePoint and ECM needs," said
Bob Dickerson, vice president, DocPoint Solutions. "Microsoft SharePoint is a
valuable tool for nearly any organization, especially considering it is a
solution that a significant number of agencies already own through the 2007
Microsoft Office system. Most firms just need the proper tools and introduction
to the software to operate the program effectively. SharePoint is the ideal
collaboration software for the federal government, in that it allows users,
regardless of location, to access needed information, share documents, and work
together as a team on projects." 

DocPoint Solutions provides a full range of consultative services, support, and
software for enterprise content management, with a specific focus on providing
Microsoft SharePoint to organizations that are looking to expand employee
collaboration efforts and increase information exchange across the enterprise.
The company primarily provides its services to government agencies, nonprofits,
and corporations.

&lt;p&gt;New Product Accelerates Delivery, Cuts Cost of Social Networking Applications
EL SEGUNDO, Calif. &amp; AUSTIN, Texas--(Business Wire)--
iRise&#174;, the world`s leading visualization solutions company, and Ascendant
Technology (Atech) today announced the immediate availability of iRise for IBM&#174;
Lotus Connections, a pre-configured set of visualization templates that gives
organizations a unique way to visualize new community and social networking
applications based on IBM Lotus portal and social stack solutions. By
visualizing before building, organizations can dramatically cut implementation
time and delivery cost of the resulting solution. Both iRise and Atech are
selling iRise for IBM Lotus Connections. 

iRise for IBM Lotus Connections will be demonstrated at the upcoming Lotusphere
Conference in Orlando, FL from January 18th through January 21st in the
Ascendant booth (#727). 

Jointly developed by iRise and Atech, iRise for IBM Lotus Connections offers a
visualization toolkit of generalized IBM Lotus solution-based page templates,
masters and styles used to accelerate the assembly of high-fidelity, working
simulations of proposed social networking applications. Starting with a library
of pre-configured content and by leveraging the power of iRise Studio, business
analysts can bring together a working preview of proposed solutions in a
fraction of the time it would take to generate paper specification documents or
build coded prototypes. Business stakeholders can `test drive` the
visualizations on their own or in collaborative meetings that directly involve
subject matter experts. Comments can be logged and acted upon quickly, speeding
consensus and eliminating confusion on business requirements. 

"Visualization is now a proven strategy to virtually eliminate project failure,"
stated Emmet B. Keeffe III, CEO and co-founder of iRise. "The next step in the
market`s development is the availability of pre-configured content that
accelerates the assembly of visualization solutions for specific environments.
Our partnership with Ascendant offers a powerful new capability for IBM Lotus
customers that will change the game for how applications are defined." 

Atech will also be leveraging iRise for IBM Lotus Connections to rapidly create
simulations of composite applications during proposal pursuits and on client
engagements. This will ensure that clients receive the ultimate in communication
and collaboration both during the selling process and the project definition
phase for these engagements. 

"iRise for IBM Lotus Connections provides the most cost-effective way for
organizations to understand the value and develop the requirements for creating
social computing applications before the expensive process of developing code,"
said Jim Deters, President of Ascendant Technology. 

Software Visualization - When Failure is No Longer an Option

iRise visualization software gives companies a powerful way to "test drive" and
fully experience business applications before they`re built. Whether you`re
building custom applications or extending packaged solutions, getting the
requirements right the first time is an imperative in today`s economy.
Visualization is now an essential strategy to cut software project cost,
accelerate application delivery and leverage outsourcing partnerships without
the usual confusion and risk. Just as computer-aided design (CAD) tools
transformed the automotive, aerospace and semiconductor industries, iRise is now
transforming the global business application market. 

With thousands of projects completed successfully, the value of visualization
has proven to be enormous for businesses in highly competitive markets:

* Get to market twice as fast; 
* Eliminate 30% of project cost; 
* Ensure success of global sourcing strategies; and, 
* Dramatically shorten application consolidation projects.

Pricing and Availability

Pricing for iRise for IBM Lotus Connections is available upon request. 

About iRise

iRise is the world`s leading provider of visualization software for business
applications. Visualization is quickly becoming a critical competitive advantage

Manpower, M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, and many others use iRise to "test drive"
their applications before building, which accelerates time to revenue, improves
customer experience, and drives costs down. At iRise, our vision is that by
2020, all business software will be visualized before being built, the same way
that every car, airplane, and building is visualized today. Headquartered in El
Segundo, Calif., iRise is backed by Morgan Stanley Venture Partners, and

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Jan 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Marshall Edwards, Inc. (NASDAQ: MSHL) will present at the 27th Annual
JPMorgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco on Thursday January 15,
2008 at 11:30am.

    About Marshall Edwards, Inc.

    Marshall Edwards, Inc. is a specialist oncology company focused on the
clinical development of novel anti-cancer therapeutics. These derive from
a flavonoid technology platform, which has generated a number of novel
compounds characterized by broad ranging activity against a range of
cancer cell types with few side effects. The combination of anti-tumor
cell activity and low toxicity is believed to be a result of the ability
of these compounds to target an enzyme present in the cell membrane of
cancer cells, thereby inhibiting the production of pro-survival proteins
within the cell. Marshall Edwards has licensed rights from Novogen
Limited (ASX: NRT) (NASDAQ: NVGN) to bring three oncology drugs --
phenoxodiol, triphendiol and NV-143 -- to market globally. Marshall
Edwards' lead investigational drug, phenoxodiol, is in a Phase III
multinational multi-centered clinical trial for patients with recurrent
ovarian cancer. More information on the trial can be found at
http://www.OVATUREtrial.com.

    Marshall Edwards is majority owned by Novogen (ASX: NRT) (NASDAQ: NVGN),
an Australian biotechnology company that is specializing in the
development of therapeutics based on a flavonoid technology platform.
Novogen is developing a range of therapeutics across the fields of
oncology, cardiovascular disease and inflammatory diseases. More
information on phenoxodiol and on the Novogen group of companies can be
found at www.marshalledwardsinc.com and www.novogen.com.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp said on Wednesday it became the first company ever to win more than 4,000 U.S. patents in a single year, citing a new report from research firm IFI Patent Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM said it earned 4,186 U.S. patents in 2008, more than triple the number of patents earned by rival Hewlett-Packard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp earned 2,030 patents, while Intel Corp had 1,776 and Hewlett-Packard 1,424, according to the report, which compiled data from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG Jan 14 (Reuters) - Mount Kellett Capital
Management, a private equity firm run by former Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) partner Mark McGoldrick, has raised at least $1.5 billion
and is on the hunt for investments, several market sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The global fund which McGoldrick - known as 'Goldfinger' -
launched last year had originally sought to raise about $5
billion but was slowed by the market meltdown, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Calls to McGoldrick's office in New York were not returned.
Brad Landes, Mount Kellett's managing director and deputy head
of Asia, said the firm does not speak to the press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; McGoldrick earned his nickname while at Goldman Sachs, where
as co-head of its lucrative global special situations group he
was reported by media to have been paid between $40 million and
$70 million in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He left Goldman Sachs in 2007 but the Wall Street bank had
helped Mount Kellett raise funding, market sources said. A
Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The multi-strategy fund, which is named after a mountain in
Hong Kong, has attracted several Goldman Sachs veterans to its
staff. It also has an office in Mumbai and one source said it
plans to open one in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "$1.5 billion is a good amount to launch with in this
market," one fund industry insider said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another person familiar with the matter said Mount Kellett
plans to raise additional funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A fund manager in Asia with knowledge of Mount Kellett said
the firm was seeking investment opportunities across industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is looking for companies in good financial shape and of
substantial size, and is targeting deals in the $100 million
range, the fund manager said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are aggressively looking for deals," the fund manager
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Numerous bankers have left Wall Street to launch private
equity and hedge funds, although the harsh current climate makes
fund-raising a challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch's former Asia investment banking chief,
Sheldon Trainor, recently left the bank to launch a private
equity fund but will continue to serve as an advisor to
Merrill's new owner, Bank of America (BAC.N), a source familiar
with the matter said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michael Flaherty in Hong Kong and

&lt;p&gt;  SEOUL, KOREA, Jan 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) in Korea announced that it has renewed a ten-year
outsourcing agreement with Korean Air, one of the leading airlines in
Asia Pacific. Under the agreement, signed in December 2008, IBM will
manage the data center for Korean Air for the next ten years.

    Since 1998, IBM has been providing IT management services to Korean Air
which covers System z, server and storage, as well as data center and
disaster recovery center operations. Due to the stable operations of the
IT infrastructure managed by IBM, Korean Air has been able to focus on the
core business areas in the airline industry and improve the efficiency of
its operations and customer service.

    IBM will provide Application Lifecycle Management infrastructure services
for a better application management and SOA runtime environment. This will
help integrate Korean Air's applications in a smarter way and start
implementing Maximo software in Korean Air for intelligent infrastructure
management services.

    Korean Air's outsourcing agreement with IBM has been widely acknowledged
by industry experts in Korea and around the world as a successful IT
outsourcing case. The company decided to renew its contract with IBM after
the review and evaluation of services from IBM and other vendors. IBM was
selected because of its high-quality service, industry expertise and cost
effectiveness of IBM Korea's services.

    Based on the understanding and experiences that it has accumulated over
the last ten years, IBM plans to extend its outsourcing services to focus
on generating business value for Korean Air by providing effective IT
services through an integrated management system. It will provide a
company-wide on-demand environment which covers application development,
highly secure and flexible IT infrastructure services and quality
management of business services through end-to-end service management.

    Sang-man Lee, Chief Information Officer, Korean Air, said, "Over the last
ten years, IBM Korea has been providing stable IT system operations and
management services. We have high expectations that IBM Korea will
continue to deliver IT services designed to improve the business value of
Korean Air, through reliable operations management."

    Won-jong Kim, IBM Korea General Manager, Global Technology Services, said,
"The new outsourcing services contract with Korean Air marks a turning
point in the history of IT outsourcing in Korea as we will extend beyond
the current services and focus on providing outsourcing services that can
enhance the business value of Korean Air, based on the innovative
competencies of IBM."

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jan 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today introduced a new initiative designed to help
business partners increase their revenue and grow customer relationships
in the mid-market space. The IBM Business Partner Software Mid-Market
Value Initiative offers incentives to business partners who plan to
invest in driving mid-market revenue through demand generation activity
and by progressing mid-market leads passed to them by IBM.

    IBM continues to expand its presence in the marketplace and drive growth
in the $253 billion mid-market, one of IBM's largest and fastest growing
market opportunities. Business partners can take advantage of incentives
and programs from IBM, leverage a rich collection of sales and marketing
resources and have access to deep technical expertise to drive new
business. IBM is committed to helping partners to grow profitably,
leverage cross-sell opportunities and participate in ample opportunities
so they can win in mid-market.

    "IBM's expertise and mid-market strategy aligns very well with ours and
this new initiative will help to balance our software and systems
solutions for customers in this market," said Dan Lifshutz, CEO of Arraya
Solutions. "Rounding out our solution offerings with software will drive
a higher return on our investment in this growing segment and build
momentum for us to capitalize on the tremendous market opportunity."

    To be eligible for the IBM Business Partner Software Mid-Market Value
Initiative, partners will meet criteria in areas including Membership,
Sales Capability, and Marketing Capability. Once selected, they will have
the opportunity to receive valuable benefits through the new initiative
that will help them to more effectively run their business.

    Among the criteria that must be met, business partners must be members of
IBM PartnerWorld and be enrolled in at least one of IBM's Express
Advantage social networking communities:

IBM  Express Advantage group on
Facebook IBM  Express Advantage group on LinkedIn IBM Express Advantage 
channel on Twitter IBM Express  Advantage YouTube channel IBM Express 
Advantage slideshare

    From a sales capability standpoint, business partners must participate in
Value Advantage Plus (VAP) with at least one approved VAP Solution. VAP
is an initiative that financially rewards business partners for
integrating IBM middleware with their software solutions. The benefit is
greater profit potential when partners sell IBM authorized software
products together with their value-adding solutions.

    Each business partner that participates will receive several benefits
including:

    Mid-market leads passed to them from IBM A list of prospective customers
per quarter for demand generation  campaigns Benchmarking studies that
describe levels of organizational  performance and covers metrics on
cost, staffing, cycle time, quality, and  best practice utilization
Access to ready-to-use software mid-market marketing assets through 
IBM's social networking sites

    "IBM sees the potential in the mid-market and continues to offer business
partners opportunities to increase their profitability in mid-market by
leveraging incentives and rebates that enable them to grow their profit
margins," said Bob Finnecy, vice president, IBM Business Partner Software
Sales. "This new initiative addresses the business needs of partners
serving this fast growing market and provides support to those that are
driving new and continued growth."

    The initial rollout of the IBM Business Partner Software Mid-Market Value
Initiative will be in 12 U.S. markets that represent a significant amount
of mid-market revenue potential. Those markets include Atlanta, Cleveland,
Indianapolis, Baltimore, Dallas, Pittsburgh, Charlotte, Denver, Portland,
Chicago, Hartford, and St. Louis.

&lt;p&gt;HydroPoint`s Sustainability 2.0 Educational Series Continues with Webcast
Showing Effective Strategies for Cutting Costs by Reducing Water Footprints
PETALUMA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
HydroPoint Data Systems Inc., provider of the WeatherTRAK Smart Water Management
solution, today announced the next webcast in its Sustainability 2.0 Educational
Series. The webcast will focus on proven strategies Jack in the Box and
Coca-Cola have used to reduce their corporate water footprints to cut costs,
save water and reduce carbon dioxide creation. 

The webcast will be hosted by HydroPoint and co-presented by Jack in the Box and
The Coca-Cola Company on Friday, January 16, 2009 at 2 pm ET/11 am PT. 

Reducing water footprints has become an important business strategy -- not only
to conserve one of our most important resources, but to also generate water
savings costs. Quick-service restaurants and fast casual restaurants can look at
Smart Water Management strategies to effectively help reduce water footprint and
cut water bills in a significant amount of time across all of their properties
and corporate headquarters. 

Jack in the Box reduced water use by 47 percent in four months at their
corporate facility in San Diego, CA by using Smart Water Management to reduce
its water footprint. The company saves one million gallons of water a year, and
also prevents the emission of 5,360 pounds of carbon dioxide. Additionally, by
reducing their water footprint, Jack in the Box substantially reduced their
operating costs. 

In this webinar, attendees will hear how Greg Sutton, operations manager for
corporate facilities at Jack in the Box, used Smart Water Management strategies
to deliver economic and financial value to their organizations in 21 days.
Specifically, attendees will hear how to identify and eliminate water waste,
evaluate sustainability programs and measure and verify program success. 

"With Smart Water Management strategies, quick service restaurants can lower
water and sewer bills, and avoid water-related property damage that ultimately
decrease operating costs and improve property value and appearance," said Sharon
Thompson, vice president of marketing for HydroPoint. "Businesses seeking to
establish water conservation practices will also enjoy a green "halo" effect
resulting in the improvement of an organization`s brand perception within the
community." 

HydroPoint`s WeatherTRAK Smart Water Management solution delivers a powerful
green multiplier effect - saving water, conserving energy, reducing carbon
emissions and protecting local ecosystems. The solution's bottom-line advantages
extend well beyond reduced water bills to lower operating costs and liability
avoidance. Proven to save four times more water and expenses than traditional
urban water conservation practices, the WeatherTRAK solution eliminates waste by
dynamically adjusting water output based on landscape needs and changes in local
weather conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Only Company in PSIM Market to Attain Highest Level for Microsoft Partners;
In Tests, Surveillint Delivers Impressive Results for Scalability and
Availability


SUNNYVALE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Proximex, the leading developer of award-winning products for the physical
security information (PSIM) market, today announced it has attained Gold
Certified Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program with a competency in
ISV/Software Solutions, recognizing Proximex`s expertise and impact in the
technology marketplace. As a Gold Certified Partner,Proximexhas demonstrated
expertise with Microsoft technologies and a proven ability to meet customers`
needs. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners receive a rich set of benefits,
including access, training and support, giving them a competitive advantage in
the channel. 

"Our team has delivered above and beyond expectations in order to produce the
most reliable PSIM solution available today," said Ken Prayoon Cheng, chief
technology officer for Proximex. "We know that customers need solutions that
they can count on during all sorts of unexpected situations, such as power
outages, system maintenance updates and even intentional attacks on security
systems. We've delivered a solution that can reliably handle disruptions and any
onslaught of alarms that would otherwise overpower a system, so companies can
focus on other important business at hand and not be concerned about the state
of their security systems." 

The results of testing for the Microsoft Gold Certified Partner status revealed
impressive results for Proximex Surveillint. With respect to scalability and
throughput tests, Surveillint was able to effectively handle several huge alarm
"bursts" coming in at one time. The Surveillint Business Logic Manager then
intelligently filtered, correlated and delivered only the information about
important alarms that required operator response. These tests reveal that
customers can rely on Surveillint to handle alarms from existing systems without
needing to adjust the systems themselves and, using the Business Logic Manager,
alarms can be intelligently reduced to a manageable amount. 

"Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap between
their business demands and technology capabilities," said Allison Watson,
corporate vice president of the Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. "They
need to trust in a company that can act as an expert adviser for their long-term
strategic technology plans. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners, which have
certified expertise and direct training and support from Microsoft, can build a
positive customer experience with our technologies. Today, Microsoft recognizes
Proximex as a new Gold Certified Partner for demonstrating its expertise in
providing customer satisfaction using Microsoft products and technology." 

Proximex will use its Microsoft Gold Certified Partner status to help high-risk
organizations meet and exceed their security goals by offering advanced
solutions that seamlessly integrate with a variety of established Microsoft
technologies. These technologies include Windows 2003/2008 Server, Windows
XP/Vista and MS SQL Server 2005/2008, .NET Framework and Windows Mobile. 

As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status,
Proximexhad to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft Competencies are
designed to help differentiate a partner`s capabilities with specific Microsoft
technologies to customers looking for a particular type of solution. Each
Competency has a unique set of requirements and benefits, formulated to
accurately represent the specific skills and services that partners bring to the
technology industry. Within select Competencies, there are Specializations that
focus on specific solution areas that recognize deeper expertise within that
Competency. Serving as a specialized path to earning those Competencies,
Specializations give direct access to the tools and resources that support that
specific area of focus. 

The ISV/Software Solutions Competency recognizes the skill and focus partners
bring to a particular solution set. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners that have
obtained this competency have a successful record of developing and marketing
packed software based on Microsoft technologies. 

"Solutions competencies are an important way for Microsoft to better enable ISVs
to meet customer needs," said Sanjay Parthasarathy, corporate vice president of
the Developer and Platform Evangelism Group at Microsoft Corp. "They allow ISVs
to keep and win customers through their deep knowledge of solutions-based
Microsoft platform technologies. Microsoft has a long history of working closely
with ISV partners to help them deliver compelling solutions and applications to
our mutual customers, and the Microsoft Competencies are an important step in
continuing to enhance vital relationships with ISVs worldwide." 

The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and represents
Microsoft`s ongoing commitment to the success of partners worldwide. The program
offers a single, integrated partnering framework that recognizes partner
expertise, rewards the total impact that partners have in the technology
marketplace, and delivers more value to help partners` businesses be successful.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 14 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp
(IBM.N) said on Wednesday it became the first company ever to
win more than 4,000 U.S. patents in a single year, citing a new
report from research firm IFI Patent Intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; IBM said it earned 4,186 U.S. patents in 2008, more than
triple the number of patents earned by rival Hewlett-Packard
(HPQ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) earned 2,030 patents, while Intel
Corp (INTC.O) had 1,776 and Hewlett-Packard 1,424, according to
the report, which compiled data from the U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office. Korean electronics giant Samsung Electronics
(005930.KS) had the second-highest number of patents at 3,515.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A wireless system that detects a child's presence in a baby
car seat and a method for blind people to find their way around
using radio frequency identification are among the patents IBM
Scientists won in 2008, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company also earned a patent for developing a cheaper
way to build nanotechnology used to make chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Armonk, New York-based company said it plans to increase
by 50 percent -- to more than 3,000 -- the number of technical
inventions it publishes annually instead of seeking patent
protection in an attempt to spur open and wide-scale innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM also said it would contribute the capabilities of IBM
Research to a collaborative project that is developing an
empirical measure of patent quality.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Web search leader Google Inc took another step on Wednesday toward direct competition with Microsoft Corp by recruiting IT resellers to market its Web-based applications to business clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the end of March, authorized resellers will be able to sell, customize and support premium versions of Google Apps, which includes word processing, spreadsheets, calendars and email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Apps is broadly similar to Microsoft's top-selling Office package except that Apps is completely Web-based and is part of Google's push into so called 'cloud computing' or software-as-a-service.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 14 (Reuters) - Web search leader Google Inc
(GOOG.O) took another step on Wednesday towards direct
competition with Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) by recruiting IT
resellers to market its Web-based applications to business
clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; From the end of March, authorized resellers will be able to
sell, customize and support premium versions of Google Apps,
which includes word processing, spreadsheets, calendars and
email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google Apps is broadly similar to Microsoft's top-selling
Office package except that Apps is completely Web-based and is
part of Google's push into so called 'cloud computing' or
software-as-a-service. Microsoft said in October it is also
looking at adding Web-based features for its Office
applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since it launched Google Apps in February 2007, Google has
only sold directly to business users over the Web. Analysts
said the move to work with third parties is necessary if Google
hopes to compete seriously with Microsoft or IBM (IBM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which is the world's largest software company,
sells more than 95 percent of its software through more than
440,000 third party resellers, according to Gartner Research,
and intends to spend around $3 billion on managing those sales
channels in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By comparison Google has so far only dipped its toe in the
water, but sees a great opportunity after running trials with
more than 50 resellers in 25 countries. It also has a 9-month
old relationship with Salesforce.com Inc (CRM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We feel that Google has had limited success in winning
customers with a singular sales channel," said Tiffani Bova, an
analyst at Gartner Research, who estimates Google has around
200,000 Premier customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IT resellers typically sell services such as Web hosting,
setting up servers and backing up data, as well as software to
hundreds of thousands of end user businesses of all sizes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a chance for those types of companies to get into
the cloud computing revolution," said Dave Girouard, president
of enterprise at Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To win over new resellers, Google said partners will buy
the Premier Edition at a 20 percent discount and keep the
recurring revenue for the lifetime of their customer
relationship.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The search leader already offers a basic package of Google
Apps for free to consumers, prompting some industry watchers to
see it as a major threat to Microsoft's profitable "Office"
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Rebecca Wettemann, an analyst at Nucleus Research, said
Google is a long way from hurting Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've seen in the applications space that Google is a
strong email competitor, but so far it is only a complement to
Office -- not yet a replacement," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google's move to offer applications is part of a wider
drive to diversify its revenue base, which has been completely
dominated by hugely profitable search advertising technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As the advertising market comes under pressure from a
slowing global economy, investors will likely be paying more
attention to Google's small but growing businesses.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY and HONG KONG, Jan 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) has announced its intent to acquire the strategic
messaging service assets of Outblaze, Ltd., a privately held provider of
online messaging and collaboration services, based in Hong Kong. Building
on IBM Lotus' market leadership in messaging software, the asset
acquisition will accelerate the delivery of affordable, Web-based e-mail
services in a software-as-a-service (SaaS) model.

    With more than 10 years of experience, Outblaze was one of the first
companies to offer a fully hosted multilingual e-mail service and now
supports over 40 million users. Outblaze's proven online Web-based
messaging service offers unique capabilities for branding and
administration. Today, Outblaze operates one of the largest online service
platforms for the provision of private label e-mail, collaboration and
social media services for other service providers, telecommunications
operators, corporations, academia, media and publishing companies.

    The Outblaze messaging service will be part of IBM Lotus' Project
"Bluehouse." "Bluehouse" is IBM's online social networking and
collaboration service designed for business and currently in open beta
(http://bluehouse.lotus.com). "Bluehouse" helps people work together more
quickly and easily beyond the boundaries of their organizations. Within
the service people can share files, chat, participate in online meetings
and network over the Web.

    "The acquisition of these Outblaze assets further demonstrates Lotus'
commitment to delivering secure, scalable online solutions and will help
accelerate delivery of collaborative services, with little to no IT
involvement," said Bob Picciano, General Manager, IBM Lotus Software and
WebSphere Portal. "Lotus has always led the way in helping people get more
connected, and we recognize that getting the right information and
expertise particularly outside of your own organization, can pose quite a
challenge. IBM will help companies overcome the barriers of time, distance
and affiliation to easily work together and deliver better business
outcomes," added Picciano.

    The combination of the Outblaze assets and "Bluehouse" will provide
customers with more choices in messaging solutions. Enterprise clients
will be able to use IBM as a single provider for all their messaging
needs, whether on-premise or online, serving a range of user needs from
occasional to full-time. Small business customers will get a
simple-to-acquire, integrated set of collaboration services that allow
them to easily work with their network of customers and partners.
Partners such as telecommunications operators and Internet service
providers will be able to package and sell collaborative services to
their clients under their own brands.

    Further detail on how these new assets will become part of IBM's online
portfolio will be disclosed at the Lotusphere conference in Orlando next
week.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's fourth-quarter profit plunged 76 percent as it wrote down bad loans, signaling that even the bank that has avoided the worst of the credit crunch is struggling with the recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank turned a profit only because of special items; and after Moody's Investors Service cut the bank's debt rating one notch to AA3, its shares dropped as much as 4.5 percent before recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's not much that's positive in JPMorgan's numbers," said John Stein, president of asset manager FSI Group in Cincinnati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan will come out the other side of this, but they have got an awful lot of losses ahead of them," Stein added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said last month that the bank had suffered in November and December, citing what he called the "normal culprits:" mortgages, junk bonds, and loans funding buyouts. Analysts in recent days have expressed more concern about the economic outlook, which may have spurred JPMorgan to report results six days earlier than originally planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said fourth-quarter net profit dropped to $702 million, or 7 cents per share, from $3 billion, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 0.9 percent to $17.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding one-time items, it had a loss of 28 cents per share -- much worse than analysts' average forecast of a profit of 1 cent, according to Reuters Estimates. The big miss was due mostly to a jump in loan loss reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon called the results "very disappointing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has managed to turn a profit so far during the year-long recession, but it still faces significant headwinds. Its losses from the September acquisition of failed thrift Washington Mutual may be up to 17 percent higher than originally expected, the bank said in a presentation accompanying its earnings release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit card losses are expected to rise to 7 percent of the portfolio on an annual basis at the end of the first quarter, and may be as high as 8 percent by year-end, it said. In better times, credit card losses can be closer to 4 percent or 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the economic environment deteriorates further, which is a distinct possibility, it is reasonable to expect additional negative impact on our market-related businesses, continued higher loan losses and increases to our credit reserves," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's difficulties reflect the broader trouble in the U.S. banking sector, which has received trillions of dollars of government support through capital injections, debt guarantees and other measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp is set to receive billions of dollars of additional support from the U.S. government to finance its purchase of Merrill Lynch  Co Inc, a person familiar with the matter said Wednesday. And Citigroup agreed earlier this week to shed a stake in one of its crown jewels, the Smith Barney retail brokerage business, to raise capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are not out of the woods at all," said Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital Management in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's shares were up 33 cents or 1.3 percent to $26.24 in late morning New York Stock Exchange dealings, after trading as high as $27.05 and as low as $24.75 earlier. In the credit derivatives market, the cost of protecting $10 million of JPMorgan debt against default for five years fell to $155,000 a year from $165,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;INVESTMENT BANKING HIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said special items in the fourth quarter included $1.1 billion of benefits from its purchase of WaMu, and a gain of $627 million from ending Chase Paymentech Solutions, a payments and merchant-acquiring joint venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worst hit in the period came from the investment banking division, which posted a loss of $2.36 billion, compared with a profit of $124 million a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank boosted the amount of money it set aside to cover credit losses by $4.1 billion before taxes, and recorded pretax writedowns of $2.9 billion for loans funding leveraged buyouts and mortgage-related positions at the investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said it ended the year with a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.8 percent. Regulators consider 6 percent "well capitalized."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Wednesday, JPMorgan shares had fallen 17.9 percent this year, compared with a 19.2 percent decline in the KBW Bank Index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008 the shares fell 27.8 percent, while the index plummeted 50 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ryan Vlastelica, Ellis Mnyandu and Dan Wilchins; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;  DUBUQUE, IA, Jan 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced it will open a new technology service
delivery center in Dubuque, Iowa, creating up to 1,300 jobs and providing
high-value information technology services to IBM customers.

    Working with Iowa Governor Chet Culver, the City of Dubuque, Dubuque
Initiatives and the Greater Dubuque Development Corporation, IBM has
signed a 10-year lease, with optional extension years, to occupy the
historic Roshek Building in downtown Dubuque. The City of Dubuque, Dubuque
Initiatives and IBM, plan to upgrade the facility to make it a "green"
building. The renovation of the building will utilize industry-leading
energy-efficient technology.

    "We selected the City of Dubuque for our new delivery center based on
several criteria, including the strong positive public-private partnership
within the city, its competitive business model and the talent and skills
that Iowa and the Midwest have to offer," said Mike Daniels, senior vice
president, IBM Global Technology Services. "We continue to invest in IBM's
future and recruit the skilled persons we need to grow our business. The
Dubuque Service Delivery Center is a model for creating new opportunities
and we look forward to working with the City and the State of Iowa to
accomplish great things together."

    "Today's announcement is about three things -- Jobs, Jobs, Jobs," said
Governor Culver. "I want to welcome IBM to Iowa, and thank them for
bringing these 1,300 high quality, good paying jobs to our state. Today's
announcement is one more sign that people around the country are
discovering what we have known all along -- that with our highly skilled
workforce, inviting business climate, and quality of life, Iowa is a great
place for business. As Governor, I will not rest when it comes to bringing
jobs like these to Iowa."

    Dubuque Mayor Roy Buol commented, "We are extremely proud that IBM chose
Dubuque for this project and particularly thrilled about the role that
Dubuque's sustainability initiative played in that decision. IBM's
decision to locate in the Roshek Building, through adaptive reuse of a
historic structure in the heart of our downtown, illustrates our shared
commitment to sustainable development, historic preservation, and
community revitalization."

    "This is truly an historic and transformational moment in the history of
Dubuque and the tri-state area," said Mike Blouin, President of the
Greater Dubuque Development Corporation. "We look forward to
participating in the creation of a stronger, sustainable 21st Century
community."

    The Dubuque Service Delivery Center will primarily support IBM's U.S.
strategic outsourcing clients, providing server systems operations,
security services and end-user services, including maintenance and
monitoring of computer hardware and software systems. The services utilize
collaborative problem solving and defect prevention processes based on
service management standards. Employees will manage IBM's world-class
servers and storage systems that are critical for assuring optimal IT
infrastructure performance.

    IBM intends to employ several hundred people in the new facility by the
end of this year and up to 1,300 by the end of 2010. IBM will work with
institutions of higher learning in the tri-state area of Iowa, Illinois
and Wisconsin for recruitment and training of potential employees. In
addition, IBM will look for opportunities to partner with these schools to
enhance their curricula to better prepare students for opportunities in
the IT industry, including the types of roles found at IBM.

    IBM's global delivery network incorporates more than 80 strategic centers
around the world and serves thousands of clients. IBM's global delivery
capabilities are a key differentiator -- the company delivers services
seamlessly by harnessing its infrastructure, processes, tools and skilled
resources. The global delivery centers are a key component of IBM's
strategy to be a globally integrated enterprise, allowing clients to
capitalize on a global talent pool to drive profitable growth.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 15 (Reuters) - Moody's Investors Service cut
the debt ratings of JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) by one notch on
Thursday, citing potential losses over the next 15 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Moody's cut the bank's ratings by one level to "Aa3," the
fourth-highest rating, and said the rating outlook is stable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The downgrades are in response to the poor prospect of JPM
generating capital in the current recession and protracted
period of market illiquidity leading to possible losses,"
Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consecutive quarterly losses in the next 12 to 15 months is
possible, the rating agency said, due to potential revenue
declines from a slowing economy. JPMorgan also faces higher
charges against its $302 billion residential-mortgage portfolio
than Moody's expected in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moreover, it faces the likelihood of increased credit costs
against its $185 billion credit-card portfolio, Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moody's placed a stable outlook on the bank's ratings as
JPMorgan maintains "prudent capital ratios, a sizable loan-loss
reserve, and enviable franchise positions in its major
businesses," Moody's said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan "is in a more manageable position than are its
major U.S. bank competitors to deal with the dual problems of
revenue reductions and increased credit costs," Moody's analyst
Sean Jones said in a statement. "To the extent these pressures
become more extreme, we expect JPM would defend its capital
ratios by reducing expenses and by cutting its common
dividend."

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is considering significant layoffs across its various divisions, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the company's plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But plans for the cutbacks have not yet been firmed up and Microsoft could end up finding alternative methods to control costs, the Journal reported on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on layoff rumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of potential job cuts is likely to be far less than the 15,000 positions that have been rumored in recent weeks, the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft might announce the job cuts when it reports quarterly earnings next week, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software giant employs about 91,000 employees globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anupreeta Das; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 15 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
said on Thursday strong commodities performance cushioned its
dive in fourth-quarter profit, although it sharply cut risk in
the sector as oil, metals and grains prices slumped.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's value-at-risk in commodities -- or the maximum
it could potentially lose in trading commodities in a day --
fell 28 percent to $30 million during the quarter ended Dec.
31, from $41 million in the previous quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan did not give a breakdown for its commodities
earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But its financial results showed commodities were the only
area where the bank had cut risks in the fourth quarter. VaR
for other businesses, such as fixed income, foreign exchange
and equities, were up from the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan posted a fourth-quarter net profit of $702
million, or 7 cents per share, down from $3 billion, or 86
cents per share, a year earlier. The bank said it was aided by
"strong performance" in commodities and emerging markets, aside
from record earnings in interest rates and currencies trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Jamie Dimon told a conference call after
the results that JPMorgan was hiring in Asia and expanding
pockets of its investment business, including commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan is the third major U.S. bank to announce a slash
in commodities risk during the fourth quarter as prices of oil,
metals and grains ended 2008 substantially lower from record
highs earlier in the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs (GS.N) cut its commodities VaR by 25 percent
in the fourth quarter, while Morgan Stanley (MS.N) pared its
risk in the business by 22 percent.

 (Recasts first paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ellis Mnyandu&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 15 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks were set to open
little changed on Thursday as reassuring quarterly results from
JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) were offset by worries stemming from
news of a push by Bank of America (BAC.N) for more government
aid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although JPMorgan's fourth-quarter profit slid 76 percent
from a year earlier as the bank wrote down bad loans and set
aside money to cover mounting credit losses, the results were
not as bad as expected for some investors. For more see
[ID:nN1491543].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's underlying performance suggested that the No.
2 U.S. bank was navigating the financial crisis with more
success than its rivals, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Most people consider them to be perhaps the strongest bank
out there. They really have battled to be profitable," said
Rick Meckler, president of investment firm LibertyView Capital
Management in New York, adding:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "So it doesn't speak well of those that are not in good

are starting to consider what the outlook is for those banks
that are not nearly as well positioned. We are not out of the
woods at all."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Bank of America dropped 3.4 percent to $9.85

$26.70.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 shed 3.10 points and were below fair

9 points while Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures slipped 7.50 points.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some encouraging economic reports were also set to cushion
the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a person familiar with the matter, Bank of

&lt;p&gt;  NASHVILLE, TN, Jan 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
OralDNA Labs, Inc. (www.OralDNA.com), a specialty diagnostics company
focused on bringing advanced laboratory testing to the dental community,
today announced it has entered into an agreement to be the JP Institute's
exclusive partner for diagnostic testing education.

    Under the terms of this agreement, OralDNA and the JP Institute will
conduct joint programs together throughout the United States in 2009,
beginning with a program in Nashville, Tennessee on February 6-7, 2009.

    "We are pleased to work with OralDNA Labs in communicating the importance
of diagnostic testing in dentistry," said Jan Lazarus, co-founder of the
JP Institute. "For the 30 past years, our JP Institute team has
recognized the clinical impact of under-diagnosis of periodontal
infections. Our team is extremely excited to finally have clinical lab
tests that will improve the accuracy of diagnosis for these serious
infectious diseases. This will allow Dentists, Hygienists and
Periodontists to diagnose and treat these infections with the importance
they deserve. We believe patient care can improve dramatically by using
laboratory tests to identify the specific cause of infection and to
predict the patients that often require more aggressive therapy."

    "OralDNA is pleased to join with a high quality partner like the JP
Institute," said Dr. Tom Nabors, chairman and Chief Dental Officer of
OralDNA Labs. "We are excited that they see the value in diagnostic
testing. Together we can continue to provide the right clinical training
and follow-up for proper implementation. Jan and her team of trainers can
help dental offices implement testing and integrate it into the overall
office protocol for patient care."

    About JP Institute (www.jpconsultants.com):

    The JP Institute was founded in 1979 and is committed to developing and
supporting clinical patient excellence and dental practice success.
Through initiatives such as in-office training and consulting, Mastership
Certification programs and hands-on training workshops, their curriculum
supports both periodontal and restorative case acceptance. The JP
Institute has been a leading force in helping dental practices achieve
excellence by utilizing evidence-based therapies and integrating new
products and technologies into comprehensive care.

    For more information about The JP Institute please call 800-946-4944.

    About OralDNA Labs, Inc. (www.OralDNA.com):

    OralDNA Labs, Inc. is a specialty diagnostics company created to advance
clinical testing in the dental community. Our goal is to help the dental
profession achieve better clinical outcomes by providing reliable,
definitive and cost effective clinical tests that drive the detection and
prognosis of disease at an earlier, more treatable stage, with an initial
focus on periodontal disease.

    Periodontal disease is a bacterial infection that causes an inflammatory
response. The disease is present in an estimated three quarters of the
adult population in the United States, with 30-35% of this population
having a genetic trait which predisposes these individuals to more serious
forms of the disease. If patients are not properly diagnosed and treated
at early stages, periodontal disease can lead to bone loss, tooth loss and
implant failure. Research now suggests an increased risk to a number of
systemic diseases when chronic periodontal infections are left untreated.

    OralDNA offers two DNA-PCR tests for periodontal disease diagnosis and
genetic susceptibility. MyPerioPath(SM) detects the presence and quantity
of specific bacteria associated with periodontal disease. MyPerioID(SM)
PST(R), licensed through a marketing, sales and distribution agreement
with Interleukin Genetics, provides a means of assessing an individual's
genetic risk for periodontal disease.

    The company is also developing an oral HPV test for use in assessing risks
associated with oral cancer. Thereafter, OralDNA intends to develop a
broader menu of clinical laboratory tests for use in oral medicine.

&lt;p&gt;HSM Support Critical for Securing Keys, Meeting Compliance Mandates
BALTIMORE--(Business Wire)--
SafeNet, Inc., a global leader in information security, today announced that its
Luna SA hardware security module (HSM) is the first HSM to work with Microsoft
SQL Server 2008 for greater application security and performance by offloading
select management functionality. 

Microsoft SQL Server 2008 is a relational database management system that
provides organizations with a highly secure data platform for storing and
managing sensitive data. Integration of SafeNet`s Luna SA HSM with SQL Server
2008 will enable customers to store the server`s master cryptographic keys-the
foundation of any robust security solution-within the hardware solution and not
the software. 

"Storing keys in software is risky to an organization`s data, and to its
compliance standing-especially under mandates like PCI DSS where best-practice
standard suggests organizations protect cryptographic keys separate and apart
from cardholder data," said Derek Tumulak, vice president, product management,
SafeNet. "Secure key management and encryption are the most challenging parts of
data protection and compliance." 

SafeNet`s Luna SA resolves this risk of exposure and challenge by keeping the
keys away from the data. The Luna SA is a network-attached HSM for applications
where security and performance are the priority. HSMs are physical devices that
keep business critical cryptographic keys at the highest security level. 

"SafeNet`s Luna SA provides organizations using SQL Server 2008 additional
security features to help meet today`s ever-evolving data threats and compliance
mandates," said Mark Jewett, director of SQL Server marketing at, Microsoft
Corp. "Organizations can add a layer of security technology that protects keys
to be separate from the data it protects while accelerating complex features
such as key rotation." 

The Luna SA can be leveraged by many servers, offering the ability to securely
partition and share the HSM resource and extend the data platform environment in
a cost-effective manner. The Luna SA, together with the Luna PCI, offers
customers of Microsoft SQL Server 2008 two flexible encryption options for their
deployment scenarios. 

In addition to the Luna SA, SafeNet is also enabling its Luna PCI HSM to work
with SQL Server 2008. The Luna PCI is a high-security cryptographic PCI
accelerator card that is embedded directly into the database server for added
security and provides accelerated cryptographic performance and CPU offload.
Both HSMs are widely used by major governments, financial institutions, and
large enterprises around the world for hardware-based key management and
increased cryptographic performance. 

SafeNet`s HSMs are key components of SafeNet`s comprehensive Enterprise Data
Protection (EDP) solution for reducing the cost and complexity of regulatory
compliance, data privacy, and information risk management. SafeNet EDP is the
only solution that secures data across the connected enterprise, from core to
edge, protecting data at rest, data in transit, and data in use. 

In September of 2008, SafeNet shipped its 75,000th HSM, more than any other
vendor. 

About SafeNet, Inc.

SafeNet is a global leader in information security. Founded more than 25 years
ago, the company provides complete security utilizing its encryption
technologies to protect communications, intellectual property and digital
identities, and offers a full spectrum of products including hardware, software,

&lt;p&gt;Joe Berlinger`s "Crude" Shows David v. Goliath Legal Battle to Hold Oil Giant
Accountable for Destroying Rainforest

Trudie Styler and Sting Join Indigenous Leaders at Opening Jan. 18
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
A new documentary by the acclaimed filmmaker Joe Berlinger (director of
BROTHER`S KEEPER, PARADISE LOST, and METALLICA: SOME KIND OF MONSTER), which
portrays the epic 15-year legal battle between indigenous tribes and oil giant
Chevron over massive oil contamination in Ecuador`s Amazon, will premiere at the
Sundance Film Festival on January 18th. 

The film, titled Crude, was produced and directed by Berlinger and shot by
Berlinger, producer/second unit director Michael Bonfiglio, and a film crew of
Ecuadorians during the time the case was on trial in Ecuador`s Amazon region at
the request of Chevron. It documents the travails of a team of young lawyers and
activists, including Pablo Fajardo (CNN Hero Award winner) and Luis Yanza
(Goldman Environmental Award), as they take on one of the world`s largest oil
companies over what experts believe is the worst oil-related contamination on
earth. 

A co-production of Entendre Films, Netflix, Radical Media, and Third Eye Motion
Picture Company, Crude has been invited to a number of international film
festivals and will be released theatrically later this year. Alyse Spiegel is
the editor, Juan Diego Perez is the director of photography, and Pocho Alvarez
is the cinematographer. Perez and Alvarez are from Ecuador. 

The trial documented by Berlinger is nearing an end, with Chevron facing a
potential $27 billion damages claim that would be enforceable in the United
States, according to lawyers for the plaintiffs. The amount of damages was
determined by an independent, court-appointed expert who relied primarily on
Chevron`s own scientific data to draw his conclusions. 

If the court accepts the damages assessment, Chevron could be hit with the
largest judgment ever in an environmental lawsuit. 

Trudie Styler and Sting, who are shown in the film helping to provide clean
water to the Amazon residents through the Rainforest Foundation and UNICEF, will
attend the premiere along with several Ecuadorians. Also attending will be
leaders from Amazon Watch, an American environmental organization that works
with the affected Amazon communities. 

Selected as one of the 16 finalists at Sundance out of 879 submissions in the
documentary category, Crude is described by the Sundance Committee as the
"inside story of the `Amazon Chernobyl` case in the rainforest of Ecuador". The
Committee says Crude "makes a concerted effort to show the case from all sides:
from the scientists and lawyers employed by Chevron, to Ecuadoran judges, to
celebrity activists and humanitarian organizers, to the role of the media, to
the dramatic intervention of Rafael Correa himself, the first Ecuadoran
president to sympathize with the indigenous perspective." 

The lawsuit, initially filed in the U.S. in 1993, charges that Texaco
deliberately dumped more than 18 billion gallons of waste water into Amazon
waterways and abandoned more than 900 unlined waste pits filled with oil sludge.
Five indigenous groups in the area - the Cofan, Secoya, Siona, Huaronai, and
Kichwa -- say the contamination left by Texaco has decimated their traditional
lifestyles and caused an outbreak of cancer and other health problems never
before seen in the rainforest. 

Chevron, which bought Texaco in 2001 and assumed defense of the case, now says
Petroecuador, Ecuador`s state-owned oil company that took over Texaco`s fields,
is responsible for the damage. Those claims have been rejected by the plaintiffs
and the court-appointed expert, and two Chevron lawyers are under indictment in
Ecuador for lying about a purported clean-up designed to secure a legal release
from Ecuador`s government. 

Chevron`s contamination also has captured the attention of the U.S. Congress and
President-elect Barack Obama. Congressman Jim McGovern (D-MA), the House
Co-Chairman of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, spent time touring the
area in November with his congressional staff. Senator Patrick Leahy (D-VT) and
then-Senator Obama asked the Bush Administration in 2005 to reject efforts by
Chevron to undermine the case via a lobbying campaign in Washington. 

Shortly after his recent trip to tour the disaster, Congressman McGovern wrote
President-Elect Obama, requesting that relevant federal agencies provide
technical assistance and other resources to bolster efforts by the government of
Ecuador to clean up the contamination.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co said on Thursday losses from its recent takeover of Washington Mutual Inc could total 17 percent more than it had originally forecast, and said credit card losses may also increase through 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The forecast reflects deterioration in the economy and credit conditions, which are also expected to hurt rivals such as Bank of America Corp and Citigroup Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a presentation accompanying its earnings release, JPMorgan projected $32 billion to $36 billion of remaining losses on the Washington Mutual portfolio, up from the $30.7 billion it forecast when it took over the business on Sept 25. The new forecast is based on updated home price expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual is the largest U.S. bank to fail. JPMorgan bought most of its assets for $1.9 billion in a government-arranged sale, adding more than 2,000 branches but taking on billions of dollars of risky mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also said losses in its credit card portfolio, excluding Washington Mutual, should approach 7 percent in the first quarter and could reach 8 percent near the end of 2009. The managed net charge-off rate in the card portfolio was 5.29 percent in the fourth quarter, excluding Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported fourth-quarter 2008 net income
of $702 million, compared with net income of $3.0 billion in the fourth quarter
of 2007. Earnings per share were $0.07, compared with $0.86 in the fourth
quarter of 2007. For the full year 2008, net income was $5.6 billion, or $1.37
per share, down 64% from $15.4 billion, or $4.38 per share, in 2007. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "Our
fourth-quarter financial results were very disappointing, driven by a loss in
Investment Banking largely attributable to continued markdowns on leveraged
loans and mortgage trading positions, as well as weak trading results. We also
faced higher credit costs associated with continued deterioration across our
loan portfolios, including a $4.1 billion addition to loan loss reserves.
However, we continued to see underlying growth in many business areas. The
integration of our recently-acquired Washington Mutual franchise has progressed
well, and we continued to grow in Treasury &amp; Securities Services and Commercial
Banking. We also opened millions of new checking and credit card accounts,
experienced net inflows in assets under management, and gained Investment
Banking market share in all major fee categories." 

As of December 31, 2008, the firm reported a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.8%
(estimated). During the year, the firm increased its total allowance for loan
losses to $23.2 billion, resulting in a firmwide coverage ratio of 3.16%4. Dimon
commented, "While the diversified nature of our franchise and strong capital
position have enabled us to weather the recessionary environment so far, we
added $13.9 billion to our allowance for loan losses in 2008 to keep this
important component of our fortress balance sheet firmly intact." 

Looking ahead to 2009, Dimon continued: "If the economic environment
deteriorates further, which is a distinct possibility, it is reasonable to
expect additional negative impact on our market-related businesses, continued
higher loan losses and increases to our credit reserves." 

"We are doing our part to help stabilize the financial markets and hasten
recovery. We assumed risk and expended resources to assimilate Bear Stearns and
Washington Mutual. We continued to lend in a safe and sound manner -- extending
more than $100 billion in new credit in the fourth quarter alone to consumers,
businesses, municipalities, and non-profit organizations. We also prevented more
than 300,0005 foreclosures, and we plan to help more than 300,000 more families
keep their homes through mortgage modifications over the next two years. In
addition, we currently have billions invested in renewable energy projects,
including wind farms and solar facilities, to provide green energy for the
current and future generations." 

Dimon added: "JPMorgan Chase`s management team is working diligently to manage
through this very difficult business climate, and to position the franchise to
benefit when the economy eventually recovers. No matter how difficult the
environment may get, we at JPMorgan Chase remain fully committed to delivering
for our clients, supporting our franchise, and doing all we can to help restore
broad-based economic growth and prosperity." 

In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a
firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with
GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the
firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded, and for
each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a
tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other
non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of
each line of business, see Notes 1 and 2 (page 13).

Commencing this quarter: (1) RFS has been resegmented into two reporting
segments; and (2) prime mortgage balances originated in RFS but previously
reported in Corporate/Private Equity are now being reported in RFS. In addition,
end-of-period third quarter balance sheet amounts related to assets acquired and
liabilities assumed from Washington Mutual Bank have been reclassified into the
appropriate business segment for the 2008 third quarter. For further
information, see the JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release Financial Supplement
filed by the Firm today.

The following discussion compares the fourth quarter of 2008 with the fourth
quarter of 2007 unless otherwise noted.

Discussion of Results:

Net loss was $2.4 billion, a decrease of $2.5 billion from the prior year. The
weaker results reflected a decrease in net revenue and a higher provision for
credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was negative $302 million, a decrease of $3.5 billion from the prior
year. Investment banking fees were $1.4 billion, down 17% from the prior year.
Advisory fees were $579 million, down 10% from the prior year, reflecting
decreased levels of activity, partially offset by improved market share. Debt
underwriting fees were $464 million, down 1% from the prior year. Equity
underwriting fees were $330 million, down 39% from the prior year. Fixed Income
Markets revenue was negative $1.7 billion, compared with $615 million in the
prior year. The decrease was driven by $1.8 billion of net markdowns on
leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments; $1.1 billion of net markdowns
on mortgage-related exposures; weak trading results in credit-related products;
and losses of $367 million from the tightening of the firm`s credit spread on
certain structured liabilities. These results were largely offset by record
performance in rates and currencies and strong performance in commodities and
emerging markets. Equity Markets revenue was negative $94 million, down by $672
million from the prior year, reflecting weak trading results and losses of $354
million from the tightening of the firm`s credit spread on certain structured
liabilities, partially offset by strong client revenue across products,
including prime services. Credit Portfolio revenue was $90 million, down $232
million from the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $765 million, compared with $200 million in
the prior year, predominantly reflecting a higher allowance driven by a
weakening credit environment. Net charge-offs were $87 million, compared with
net recoveries of $9 million in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses to
average loans retained was 4.71% for the current quarter, an increase from 1.93%
in the prior year. 

Average loans retained were $73.1 billion, an increase of $4.2 billion, or 6%,
from the prior year. Average fair-value and held-for-sale loans were $16.4
billion, down $8.6 billion, or 34%, from the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $2.7 billion, down 9% from the prior year, reflecting
lower performance-based compensation expense, largely offset by additional
expenses relating to the Bear Stearns merger.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $624 million, a decrease of $107 million, or 15%, from the prior
year, as a significant increase in the provision for credit losses was
predominately offset by positive MSR risk management results and the positive
impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. 

Net revenue was $8.7 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion, or 81%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $4.7 billion, up $2.0 billion, or 75%,
benefiting from the Washington Mutual transaction, wider deposit and loan
spreads, and higher loan and deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $4.0
billion, up $1.9 billion, or 88%, as positive MSR risk management results and
the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction were offset partially by a
decline in mortgage production revenue. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.6 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion
from the prior year, as housing price declines continued to result in
significant increases in estimated losses, particularly for high loan-to-value
home equity and mortgage loans. The provision includes $1.6 billion in addition
to the allowance for loan losses for the heritage Chase home equity and mortgage
portfolios. Home equity net charge-offs were $770 million (2.15% net charge-off
rate; 2.67% excluding purchased credit impaired loans), compared with $248
million (1.05% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net
charge-offs were $319 million (5.64% net charge-off rate; 8.08% excluding
purchased credit impaired loans), compared with $71 million (2.08% net
charge-off rate) in the prior year. Prime mortgage net charge-offs were $195
million (0.89% net charge-off rate; 1.20% excluding purchased credit impaired
loans), compared with $17 million (0.22% net charge-off rate) in the prior year.
The provision for credit losses was also affected by an increase in estimated
losses for the auto and business banking loan portfolios. 

Noninterest expense was $4.0 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 59%, from
the prior year, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
higher mortgage reinsurance losses, and increased servicing expense. 

Retail Banking, which includes the results of all consumer banking and business
banking activities,reported net income of $1.0 billion, up $479 million, or 85%,
from the prior year. Net revenue was $4.5 billion, up $2.0 billion, or 78%,
reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider deposit
spreads, higher deposit-related fees, and higher deposit balances. The provision
for credit losses was $268 million, compared with $50 million in the prior year,
reflecting an increase in the allowance for loan losses for Business Banking
loans due to higher estimated losses on the portfolio. Noninterest expense was
$2.5 billion, up $965 million, or 62%, from the prior year, due to the
Washington Mutual transaction.

* Overhead ratio (excluding amortization of core deposit intangibles) decreased

Consumer Lending, which includes the results of all consumer loan origination,
servicing, and portfolio management activities, reported a net loss of $416
million, compared with net income of $170 million in the prior year. Net revenue
was $4.2 billion, up $1.9 billion, or 85%, driven by higher mortgage fees and
related income, the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider loan
spreads and higher loan balances. 

The increase in mortgage fees and related income was driven by higher net
mortgage servicing revenue, partially offset by lower mortgage production
revenue. Mortgage production revenue of $62 million was down $103 million,
reflecting markdowns of the mortgage warehouse and an increase in reserves
related to the repurchase of previously-sold loans. Net mortgage servicing
revenue (which includes loan servicing revenue, MSR risk management results and
other changes in fair value) was $1.9 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or
163%, from the prior year. Loan servicing revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase
of $741 million on growth of 91% in third-party loans serviced. MSR risk
management results were positive $1.4 billion, compared with positive $491
million in the prior year. Other changes in fair value of the MSR asset were
negative $843 million, compared with negative $393 million in the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion, compared with $1.0 billion in
the prior year. The provision reflected weakness in the home equity and mortgage
portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for credit
losses above for further detail). 

Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion, up $540 million, or 55%, from the prior
year, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher
mortgage reinsurance losses and higher servicing expense due to increased
delinquencies and defaults.

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see Note 1 (page 13)for further explanation of
managed basis. 

Discussion of Results:

Net loss was $371 million, a decline of $980 million from the prior year. The
decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by
higher net revenue. 

End-of-period managed loans were $190.3 billion, an increase of $33.3 billion,
or 21%, from the prior year and up $3.8 billion, or 2%, from the prior quarter.
Average managed loans were $187.3 billion, an increase of $35.6 billion, or 23%,
from the prior year and up $29.7 billion, or 19%, from the prior quarter. The
increase from the prior year in both end-of-period and average managed loans was
predominantly due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. Excluding
Washington Mutual, end-of-period and average managed loans were $162.1 billion
and $159.6 billion, respectively. 

Managed net revenue was $4.9 billion, an increase of $937 million, or 24%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $4.3 billion, up $1.2 billion, or 38%,
from the prior year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
higher average managed loan balances, and wider loan spreads. These benefits
were offset partially by the effect of higher revenue reversals associated with
higher charge-offs. Noninterest revenue was $590 million, a decrease of $244
million, or 29%, from the prior year, driven by lower securitization income as
well as increased rewards expense and higher volume-driven payments to partners,
partially offset by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $4.0 billion, an increase of $2.2
billion, or 122%, from the prior year, due to an increase of $1.1 billion in the
allowance for loan losses and a higher level of charge-offs. The managed net
charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.56%, up from 3.89% in the prior year and
5.00% in the prior quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 4.97%, up
from 3.48% in the prior year and 3.91% in the prior quarter. Excluding
Washington Mutual, the managed net charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was
5.29% and the 30-day delinquency rate was 4.36%. 

Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion, an increase of $266 million, or 22%, from
the prior year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was a record $480 million, an increase of $192 million, or 67%, from
the prior year, driven by higher net revenue including the impact of the
Washington Mutual transaction, offset partially by higher provision for credit
losses. 

Net revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of $395 million, or 36%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, up $345 million, or 46% from
the prior year, driven by the Washington Mutual transaction, double-digit growth
in liability and loan balances, and a shift to higher spread liability products,
partially offset by spread compression in the liability and loan portfolios.
Noninterest revenue was $376 million, an increase of $50 million, or 15%, from
the prior year, reflecting higher deposit and lending-related fees, partially
offset by lower other income. 

Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $796 million, an increase of $101
million, or 15%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending, a
new client segment encompassing multi-family and commercial mortgage loans, was
$243 million. Revenue from Mid-Corporate Banking was $243 million, an increase
of $4 million, or 2%. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $131 million, an
increase of $29 million, or 28%, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction. 

The provision for credit losses was $190 million, an increase of $85 million, or
81%, compared with the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflects a
weakening credit environment. The allowance for loan losses to average loans
retained was 2.41% for the current quarter, down from 2.66% in the prior year
and up from 2.32% in the prior quarter, reflecting the changed mix of the loan
portfolio as a result of the Washington Mutual transaction. Nonperforming loans
were $1.0 billion, up $880 million from the prior year and up $182 million from
the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction
and the effect across all business segments of a weakening credit environment.
Net charge-offs were $118 million (0.40% net charge-off rate), compared with $33
million (0.21% net charge-off rate) in the prior year and $40 million (0.22% net
charge-off rate) in the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $499 million, a decrease of $5 million, or 1%, from the
prior year, due to lower performance-based compensation expense, largely offset
by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was a record $533 million, an increase of $111 million, or 26%, from
the prior year, driven by higher net revenue, partially offset by higher
noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was a record $2.2 billion, an increase of $319 million, or 17%, from
the prior year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was a record $1.3
billion, an increase of $150 million, or 14%, from the prior year. The growth
was driven by higher liability balances, reflecting increased client deposit
activity resulting from recent market conditions, and wider spreads in foreign
exchange. These benefits were offset partially by the effects of market
depreciation and lower securities lending balances. Treasury Services net
revenue was a record $1.0 billion, an increase of $169 million, or 21%,
reflecting higher liability balances and higher trade revenue. Liability balance
revenue growth reflects increased client deposit activity, resulting from recent
market conditions and organic growth, partially offset by spread compression.
Trade revenue benefited from higher volumes and wider loan spreads.TSS firmwide
net revenue, which includes Treasury Services net revenue recorded in other
lines of business, grew to $3.1 billion, an increase of $454 million, or 17%.
Treasury Services firmwide net revenue grew to $1.8 billion, an increase of $304
million, or 20%. 

The provision for credit losses was $45 million, an increase of $41 million from
prior year, reflecting a weakening credit environment. 

Noninterest expense was $1.3 billion, an increase of $117 million, or 10%, from
the prior year, reflecting higher expense related to business and volume growth
as well as continued investment in new product platforms.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $255 million, a decline of $272 million, or 52%, from the prior
year, due to lower net revenue offset partially by lower noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of $731 million, or 31%, from the prior
year. Noninterest revenue was $1.2 billion, a decline of $868 million, or 42%,
due to the effect of lower markets, including the impact of lower market
valuations of seed capital investments and lower performance fees; these effects
were offset partially by the benefit of the Bear Stearns merger. Net interest
income was $466 million, up $137 million, or 42%, from the prior year,
predominantly due to wider deposit spreads and higher deposit and loan balances.


Private Bank revenue declined 3% to $630 million, as the effects of lower
markets and lower performance fees were predominately offset by increased
deposit and loan balances. Private Wealth Management revenue declined 4% to $330
million due to lower assets under management. Institutional revenue declined 57%
to $327 million due to lower performance fees and lower market valuations of
principal investments, partially offset by net liquidity inflows. Retail revenue
decreased by 59% to $265 million due to the effect of lower markets, including
the impact of lower market valuations of seed capital investments and net equity
outflows. Bear Stearns Brokerage contributed $106 million to revenue. 

Assets under supervision were $1.5 trillion, a decrease of $76 billion, or 5%,
from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion, down $60
billion, or 5%, from the prior year. The decrease was due to the effect of lower
markets and non-liquidity outflows, predominantly offset by liquidity product
inflows across all segments and the addition of Bear Stearns assets under
management. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were $363
billion, down $16 billion due to the effect of lower markets on brokerage and
custody balances, offset by the addition of Bear Stearns Brokerage. 

The provision for credit losses was $32 million, compared with negative $1
million in the prior year, reflecting a weakening credit environment. 

Noninterest expense of $1.2 billion decreased $346 million, or 22%, from the
prior year due to lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by the
effect of the Bear Stearns merger.

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see Note 1 (page 13) for further explanation
of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was $17,226 million, $14,737
million, and $17,384 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, third quarter of
2008 and fourth quarter of 2007, respectively. 

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $702 million, a decrease of $2.3 billion, or 76%, from the prior
year. The decline in earnings was driven by a higher provision for credit losses
and increased noninterest expense. 

Managed net revenue was $19.1 billion, an increase of $833 million, or 5%, from
the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $3.2 billion, down $6.2 billion, or 66%,
due to lower principal transactions revenue, which reflected net markdowns on
leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments and mortgage-related
exposures, and Private Equity write-downs. Partially offsetting these declines
were the gain on the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech joint venture and
positive MSR rick management results. Net interest income was $15.9 billion, up
$7.1 billion, or 80%, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
higher trading-related net interest income, higher liability and loan balances,
and wider loan and deposit spreads. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $8.5 billion, up $5.4 billion, or
170%, from the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit
losses was $7.4 billion, compared with $2.9 billion in the prior year,
reflecting increases in the allowance for credit losses related to home equity,
mortgage and credit card loans, as well as higher net charge-offs.
Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $4.3 billion, compared with $2.0 billion
in the prior year, resulting in managed net charge-off rates of 3.61% and 2.22%,
respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion,
compared with $308 million in the prior year, due to an increase in the
allowance for credit losses reflecting the effect of a weakening credit
environment. Wholesale net charge-offs were $217 million, compared with net
charge-offs of $25 million, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.33% and
0.05%, respectively. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $12.7 billion at
December 31, 2008, up from the prior-year level of $3.9 billion. 

Noninterest expense was $11.3 billion, up $535 million, or 5%, from the prior
year. The increase was driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction
and additional operating costs relating to the Bear Stearns merger, partially
offset by lower compensation expense.

Notes:

1. In addition to analyzing the firm`s results on a reported basis, management
analyzes the firm`s results and the results of the lines of business on a
managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm`s definition of
managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the
following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis
excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the
provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The
presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit
card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still
remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are
classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the
balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the
credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed
credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made about
allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed
financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing
risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized
loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to
a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the
customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer`s
credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained
on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed-basis information is
useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks
associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm`s retained
interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and
net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a
tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and
investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a
basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows
management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and
tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items
is recorded within income tax expense. See page 8 of JPMorgan Chase`s Earnings
Release Financial Supplement (fourth quarter of 2008) for a reconciliation of
JPMorgan Chase`s income statement from a reported basis to a managed basis. 

2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total
net revenue, which is, in management`s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into
consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate
the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors.

 (a) Includes accounting conformity loan loss reserve provision related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual Bank's banking operations.                                                                                        
 (b) JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank for $1.9 billion. The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price which resulted in negative goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 141, nonfinancial assets that are not held-for-sale were written down against that negative goodwill. The negative goodwill that remained after writing down nonfinancial assets was recognized as an extraordinary gain. 
 (c) On September 30, 2008, the Firm issued $11.5 billion, or 284 million shares, of its common stock at $40.50 per share.                                                                                                        
 (d) Quarterly ratios are based upon annualized amounts.                                                                                                                                                                          
 (e) Net income applicable to common stock divided by total average common equity (net of goodwill).

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today reported fourth-quarter 2008 net income
of $702 million, compared with net income of $3.0 billion in the fourth quarter
of 2007. Earnings per share were $0.07, compared with $0.86 in the fourth
quarter of 2007. For the full year 2008, net income was $5.6 billion, or $1.37
per share, down 64% from $15.4 billion, or $4.38 per share, in 2007. 

Jamie Dimon, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, commented: "Our
fourth-quarter financial results were very disappointing, driven by a loss in
Investment Banking largely attributable to continued markdowns on leveraged
loans and mortgage trading positions, as well as weak trading results. We also
faced higher credit costs associated with continued deterioration across our
loan portfolios, including a $4.1 billion addition to loan loss reserves.
However, we continued to see underlying growth in many business areas. The
integration of our recently-acquired Washington Mutual franchise has progressed
well, and we continued to grow in Treasury &amp; Securities Services and Commercial
Banking. We also opened millions of new checking and credit card accounts,
experienced net inflows in assets under management, and gained Investment
Banking market share in all major fee categories." 

As of December 31, 2008, the firm reported a Tier 1 capital ratio of 10.8%
(estimated). During the year, the firm increased its total allowance for loan
losses to $23.2 billion, resulting in a firmwide coverage ratio of 3.16%4. Dimon
commented, "While the diversified nature of our franchise and strong capital
position have enabled us to weather the recessionary environment so far, we
added $13.9 billion to our allowance for loan losses in 2008 to keep this
important component of our fortress balance sheet firmly intact." 

Looking ahead to 2009, Dimon continued: "If the economic environment
deteriorates further, which is a distinct possibility, it is reasonable to
expect additional negative impact on our market-related businesses, continued
higher loan losses and increases to our credit reserves." 

"We are doing our part to help stabilize the financial markets and hasten
recovery. We assumed risk and expended resources to assimilate Bear Stearns and
Washington Mutual. We continued to lend in a safe and sound manner -- extending
more than $100 billion in new credit in the fourth quarter alone to consumers,
businesses, municipalities, and non-profit organizations. We also prevented more
than 300,0005 foreclosures, and we plan to help more than 300,000 more families
keep their homes through mortgage modifications over the next two years. In
addition, we currently have billions invested in renewable energy projects,
including wind farms and solar facilities, to provide green energy for the
current and future generations." 

Dimon added: "JPMorgan Chase`s management team is working diligently to manage
through this very difficult business climate, and to position the franchise to
benefit when the economy eventually recovers. No matter how difficult the
environment may get, we at JPMorgan Chase remain fully committed to delivering
for our clients, supporting our franchise, and doing all we can to help restore
broad-based economic growth and prosperity." 

In the discussion below of the business segments and of JPMorgan Chase as a
firm, information is presented on a managed basis. Managed basis starts with
GAAP results and includes the following adjustments: for Card Services and the
firm as a whole, the impact of credit card securitizations is excluded, and for
each line of business and the firm as a whole, net revenue is shown on a
tax-equivalent basis. For more information about managed basis, as well as other
non-GAAP financial measures used by management to evaluate the performance of
each line of business, see Notes 1 and 2 (page 13).

Commencing this quarter: (1) RFS has been resegmented into two reporting
segments; and (2) prime mortgage balances originated in RFS but previously
reported in Corporate/Private Equity are now being reported in RFS. In addition,
end-of-period third quarter balance sheet amounts related to assets acquired and
liabilities assumed from Washington Mutual Bank have been reclassified into the
appropriate business segment for the 2008 third quarter. For further
information, see the JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release Financial Supplement
filed by the Firm today.

The following discussion compares the fourth quarter of 2008 with the fourth
quarter of 2007 unless otherwise noted.

Discussion of Results:

Net loss was $2.4 billion, a decrease of $2.5 billion from the prior year. The
weaker results reflected a decrease in net revenue and a higher provision for
credit losses, partially offset by lower noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was negative $302 million, a decrease of $3.5 billion from the prior
year. Investment banking fees were $1.4 billion, down 17% from the prior year.
Advisory fees were $579 million, down 10% from the prior year, reflecting
decreased levels of activity, partially offset by improved market share. Debt
underwriting fees were $464 million, down 1% from the prior year. Equity
underwriting fees were $330 million, down 39% from the prior year. Fixed Income
Markets revenue was negative $1.7 billion, compared with $615 million in the
prior year. The decrease was driven by $1.8 billion of net markdowns on
leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments; $1.1 billion of net markdowns
on mortgage-related exposures; weak trading results in credit-related products;
and losses of $367 million from the tightening of the firm`s credit spread on
certain structured liabilities. These results were largely offset by record
performance in rates and currencies and strong performance in commodities and
emerging markets. Equity Markets revenue was negative $94 million, down by $672
million from the prior year, reflecting weak trading results and losses of $354
million from the tightening of the firm`s credit spread on certain structured
liabilities, partially offset by strong client revenue across products,
including prime services. Credit Portfolio revenue was $90 million, down $232
million from the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $765 million, compared with $200 million in
the prior year, predominantly reflecting a higher allowance driven by a
weakening credit environment. Net charge-offs were $87 million, compared with
net recoveries of $9 million in the prior year. The allowance for loan losses to
average loans retained was 4.71% for the current quarter, an increase from 1.93%
in the prior year. 

Average loans retained were $73.1 billion, an increase of $4.2 billion, or 6%,
from the prior year. Average fair-value and held-for-sale loans were $16.4
billion, down $8.6 billion, or 34%, from the prior year. 

Noninterest expense was $2.7 billion, down 9% from the prior year, reflecting
lower performance-based compensation expense, largely offset by additional
expenses relating to the Bear Stearns merger.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $624 million, a decrease of $107 million, or 15%, from the prior
year, as a significant increase in the provision for credit losses was
predominately offset by positive MSR risk management results and the positive
impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. 

Net revenue was $8.7 billion, an increase of $3.9 billion, or 81%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $4.7 billion, up $2.0 billion, or 75%,
benefiting from the Washington Mutual transaction, wider deposit and loan
spreads, and higher loan and deposit balances. Noninterest revenue was $4.0
billion, up $1.9 billion, or 88%, as positive MSR risk management results and
the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction were offset partially by a
decline in mortgage production revenue. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.6 billion, an increase of $2.5 billion
from the prior year, as housing price declines continued to result in
significant increases in estimated losses, particularly for high loan-to-value
home equity and mortgage loans. The provision includes $1.6 billion in addition
to the allowance for loan losses for the heritage Chase home equity and mortgage
portfolios. Home equity net charge-offs were $770 million (2.15% net charge-off
rate; 2.67% excluding purchased credit impaired loans), compared with $248
million (1.05% net charge-off rate) in the prior year. Subprime mortgage net
charge-offs were $319 million (5.64% net charge-off rate; 8.08% excluding
purchased credit impaired loans), compared with $71 million (2.08% net
charge-off rate) in the prior year. Prime mortgage net charge-offs were $195
million (0.89% net charge-off rate; 1.20% excluding purchased credit impaired
loans), compared with $17 million (0.22% net charge-off rate) in the prior year.
The provision for credit losses was also affected by an increase in estimated
losses for the auto and business banking loan portfolios. 

Noninterest expense was $4.0 billion, an increase of $1.5 billion, or 59%, from
the prior year, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
higher mortgage reinsurance losses, and increased servicing expense. 

Retail Banking, which includes the results of all consumer banking and business
banking activities,reported net income of $1.0 billion, up $479 million, or 85%,
from the prior year. Net revenue was $4.5 billion, up $2.0 billion, or 78%,
reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider deposit
spreads, higher deposit-related fees, and higher deposit balances. The provision
for credit losses was $268 million, compared with $50 million in the prior year,
reflecting an increase in the allowance for loan losses for Business Banking
loans due to higher estimated losses on the portfolio. Noninterest expense was
$2.5 billion, up $965 million, or 62%, from the prior year, due to the
Washington Mutual transaction.

* Checking accounts totaled 24.5 million, including 12.6 million attributable to
the Washington Mutual transaction, an increase of 13.7 million, or 126%.

* Branch sales of credit cards increased by 56%. 
* Branch sales of investment products decreased by 4%. 
* Overhead ratio (excluding amortization of core deposit intangibles) decreased
to 54% from 57%.

Consumer Lending, which includes the results of all consumer loan origination,
servicing, and portfolio management activities, reported a net loss of $416
million, compared with net income of $170 million in the prior year. Net revenue
was $4.2 billion, up $1.9 billion, or 85%, driven by higher mortgage fees and
related income, the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, wider loan
spreads and higher loan balances. 

The increase in mortgage fees and related income was driven by higher net
mortgage servicing revenue, partially offset by lower mortgage production
revenue. Mortgage production revenue of $62 million was down $103 million,
reflecting markdowns of the mortgage warehouse and an increase in reserves
related to the repurchase of previously-sold loans. Net mortgage servicing
revenue (which includes loan servicing revenue, MSR risk management results and
other changes in fair value) was $1.9 billion, an increase of $1.2 billion, or
163%, from the prior year. Loan servicing revenue was $1.4 billion, an increase
of $741 million on growth of 91% in third-party loans serviced. MSR risk
management results were positive $1.4 billion, compared with positive $491
million in the prior year. Other changes in fair value of the MSR asset were
negative $843 million, compared with negative $393 million in the prior year. 

The provision for credit losses was $3.3 billion, compared with $1.0 billion in
the prior year. The provision reflected weakness in the home equity and mortgage
portfolios (see Retail Financial Services discussion of the provision for credit
losses above for further detail). 

Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion, up $540 million, or 55%, from the prior
year, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction, higher
mortgage reinsurance losses and higher servicing expense due to increased
delinquencies and defaults.

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see Note 1 (page 13)for further explanation of
managed basis. 

Discussion of Results:

Net loss was $371 million, a decline of $980 million from the prior year. The
decrease was driven by a higher provision for credit losses, partially offset by
higher net revenue. 

End-of-period managed loans were $190.3 billion, an increase of $33.3 billion,
or 21%, from the prior year and up $3.8 billion, or 2%, from the prior quarter.
Average managed loans were $187.3 billion, an increase of $35.6 billion, or 23%,
from the prior year and up $29.7 billion, or 19%, from the prior quarter. The
increase from the prior year in both end-of-period and average managed loans was
predominantly due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. Excluding
Washington Mutual, end-of-period and average managed loans were $162.1 billion
and $159.6 billion, respectively. 

Managed net revenue was $4.9 billion, an increase of $937 million, or 24%, from
the prior year. Net interest income was $4.3 billion, up $1.2 billion, or 38%,
from the prior year, driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
higher average managed loan balances, and wider loan spreads. These benefits
were offset partially by the effect of higher revenue reversals associated with
higher charge-offs. Noninterest revenue was $590 million, a decrease of $244
million, or 29%, from the prior year, driven by lower securitization income as
well as increased rewards expense and higher volume-driven payments to partners,
partially offset by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $4.0 billion, an increase of $2.2
billion, or 122%, from the prior year, due to an increase of $1.1 billion in the
allowance for loan losses and a higher level of charge-offs. The managed net
charge-off rate for the quarter was 5.56%, up from 3.89% in the prior year and
5.00% in the prior quarter. The 30-day managed delinquency rate was 4.97%, up
from 3.48% in the prior year and 3.91% in the prior quarter. Excluding
Washington Mutual, the managed net charge-off rate for the fourth quarter was
5.29% and the 30-day delinquency rate was 4.36%. 

Noninterest expense was $1.5 billion, an increase of $266 million, or 22%, from
the prior year, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.

Discussion of Results:

Net income was a record $480 million, an increase of $192 million, or 67%, from
the prior year, driven by higher net revenue including the impact of the
Washington Mutual transaction, offset partially by higher provision for credit
losses. 

Net revenue was $1.5 billion, an increase of $395 million, or 36%, from the
prior year. Net interest income was $1.1 billion, up $345 million, or 46% from
the prior year, driven by the Washington Mutual transaction, double-digit growth
in liability and loan balances, and a shift to higher spread liability products,
partially offset by spread compression in the liability and loan portfolios.
Noninterest revenue was $376 million, an increase of $50 million, or 15%, from
the prior year, reflecting higher deposit and lending-related fees, partially
offset by lower other income. 

Revenue from Middle Market Banking was $796 million, an increase of $101
million, or 15%, from the prior year. Revenue from Commercial Term Lending, a
new client segment encompassing multi-family and commercial mortgage loans, was
$243 million. Revenue from Mid-Corporate Banking was $243 million, an increase
of $4 million, or 2%. Revenue from Real Estate Banking was $131 million, an
increase of $29 million, or 28%, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual
transaction. 

The provision for credit losses was $190 million, an increase of $85 million, or
81%, compared with the prior year. The current-quarter provision reflects a
weakening credit environment. The allowance for loan losses to average loans
retained was 2.41% for the current quarter, down from 2.66% in the prior year
and up from 2.32% in the prior quarter, reflecting the changed mix of the loan
portfolio as a result of the Washington Mutual transaction. Nonperforming loans
were $1.0 billion, up $880 million from the prior year and up $182 million from
the prior quarter, reflecting the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction
and the effect across all business segments of a weakening credit environment.
Net charge-offs were $118 million (0.40% net charge-off rate), compared with $33
million (0.21% net charge-off rate) in the prior year and $40 million (0.22% net
charge-off rate) in the prior quarter. 

Noninterest expense was $499 million, a decrease of $5 million, or 1%, from the
prior year, due to lower performance-based compensation expense, largely offset
by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction.

Net revenue was a record $2.2 billion, an increase of $319 million, or 17%, from
the prior year. Worldwide Securities Services net revenue was a record $1.3
billion, an increase of $150 million, or 14%, from the prior year. The growth
was driven by higher liability balances, reflecting increased client deposit
activity resulting from recent market conditions, and wider spreads in foreign
exchange. These benefits were offset partially by the effects of market
depreciation and lower securities lending balances. Treasury Services net
revenue was a record $1.0 billion, an increase of $169 million, or 21%,
reflecting higher liability balances and higher trade revenue. Liability balance
revenue growth reflects increased client deposit activity, resulting from recent
market conditions and organic growth, partially offset by spread compression.
Trade revenue benefited from higher volumes and wider loan spreads.TSS firmwide
net revenue, which includes Treasury Services net revenue recorded in other
lines of business, grew to $3.1 billion, an increase of $454 million, or 17%.
Treasury Services firmwide net revenue grew to $1.8 billion, an increase of $304

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $255 million, a decline of $272 million, or 52%, from the prior
year, due to lower net revenue offset partially by lower noninterest expense. 

Net revenue was $1.7 billion, a decrease of $731 million, or 31%, from the prior
year. Noninterest revenue was $1.2 billion, a decline of $868 million, or 42%,
due to the effect of lower markets, including the impact of lower market
valuations of seed capital investments and lower performance fees; these effects
were offset partially by the benefit of the Bear Stearns merger. Net interest
income was $466 million, up $137 million, or 42%, from the prior year,
predominantly due to wider deposit spreads and higher deposit and loan balances.


Private Bank revenue declined 3% to $630 million, as the effects of lower
markets and lower performance fees were predominately offset by increased
deposit and loan balances. Private Wealth Management revenue declined 4% to $330
million due to lower assets under management. Institutional revenue declined 57%
to $327 million due to lower performance fees and lower market valuations of
principal investments, partially offset by net liquidity inflows. Retail revenue
decreased by 59% to $265 million due to the effect of lower markets, including
the impact of lower market valuations of seed capital investments and net equity
outflows. Bear Stearns Brokerage contributed $106 million to revenue. 

Assets under supervision were $1.5 trillion, a decrease of $76 billion, or 5%,
from the prior year. Assets under management were $1.1 trillion, down $60
billion, or 5%, from the prior year. The decrease was due to the effect of lower
markets and non-liquidity outflows, predominantly offset by liquidity product
inflows across all segments and the addition of Bear Stearns assets under
management. Custody, brokerage, administration and deposit balances were $363
billion, down $16 billion due to the effect of lower markets on brokerage and
custody balances, offset by the addition of Bear Stearns Brokerage. 

The provision for credit losses was $32 million, compared with negative $1
million in the prior year, reflecting a weakening credit environment. 

Noninterest expense of $1.2 billion decreased $346 million, or 22%, from the
prior year due to lower performance-based compensation, partially offset by the
effect of the Bear Stearns merger.

(a) Presented on a managed basis; see Note 1 (page 13) for further explanation
of managed basis. Net revenue on a U.S. GAAP basis was $17,226 million, $14,737
million, and $17,384 million for the fourth quarter of 2008, third quarter of
2008 and fourth quarter of 2007, respectively. 

Discussion of Results:

Net income was $702 million, a decrease of $2.3 billion, or 76%, from the prior
year. The decline in earnings was driven by a higher provision for credit losses
and increased noninterest expense. 

Managed net revenue was $19.1 billion, an increase of $833 million, or 5%, from
the prior year. Noninterest revenue was $3.2 billion, down $6.2 billion, or 66%,
due to lower principal transactions revenue, which reflected net markdowns on
leveraged lending funded and unfunded commitments and mortgage-related
exposures, and Private Equity write-downs. Partially offsetting these declines
were the gain on the dissolution of the Chase Paymentech joint venture and
positive MSR rick management results. Net interest income was $15.9 billion, up
$7.1 billion, or 80%, due to the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction,
higher trading-related net interest income, higher liability and loan balances,
and wider loan and deposit spreads. 

The managed provision for credit losses was $8.5 billion, up $5.4 billion, or
170%, from the prior year. The total consumer-managed provision for credit
losses was $7.4 billion, compared with $2.9 billion in the prior year,
reflecting increases in the allowance for credit losses related to home equity,
mortgage and credit card loans, as well as higher net charge-offs.
Consumer-managed net charge-offs were $4.3 billion, compared with $2.0 billion
in the prior year, resulting in managed net charge-off rates of 3.61% and 2.22%,
respectively. The wholesale provision for credit losses was $1.1 billion,
compared with $308 million in the prior year, due to an increase in the
allowance for credit losses reflecting the effect of a weakening credit
environment. Wholesale net charge-offs were $217 million, compared with net
charge-offs of $25 million, resulting in net charge-off rates of 0.33% and
0.05%, respectively. The firm had total nonperforming assets of $12.7 billion at
December 31, 2008, up from the prior-year level of $3.9 billion. 

Noninterest expense was $11.3 billion, up $535 million, or 5%, from the prior
year. The increase was driven by the impact of the Washington Mutual transaction
and additional operating costs relating to the Bear Stearns merger, partially
offset by lower compensation expense.

Notes:

1. In addition to analyzing the firm`s results on a reported basis, management
analyzes the firm`s results and the results of the lines of business on a
managed basis, which is a non-GAAP financial measure. The firm`s definition of
managed basis starts with the reported U.S. GAAP results and includes the
following adjustments: First, for Card Services and the firm, managed basis
excludes the impact of credit card securitizations on total net revenue, the
provision for credit losses, net charge-offs and loan receivables. The
presentation of Card Services results on a managed basis assumes that credit
card loans that have been securitized and sold in accordance with SFAS 140 still
remain on the balance sheet and that the earnings on the securitized loans are
classified in the same manner as the earnings on retained loans recorded on the
balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase uses the concept of managed basis to evaluate the
credit performance and overall financial performance of the entire managed
credit card portfolio. Operations are funded and decisions are made about
allocating resources, such as employees and capital, based upon managed
financial information. In addition, the same underwriting standards and ongoing
risk monitoring are used for both loans on the balance sheet and securitized
loans. Although securitizations result in the sale of credit card receivables to
a trust, JPMorgan Chase retains the ongoing customer relationships, as the
customers may continue to use their credit cards; accordingly, the customer`s
credit performance will affect both the securitized loans and the loans retained
on the balance sheet. JPMorgan Chase believes managed-basis information is
useful to investors, enabling them to understand both the credit risks
associated with the loans reported on the balance sheet and the firm`s retained
interests in securitized loans. Second, managed revenue (noninterest revenue and
net interest income) for each of the segments and the firm is presented on a
tax-equivalent basis. Accordingly, revenue from tax-exempt securities and
investments that receive tax credits is presented in the managed results on a
basis comparable to taxable securities and investments. This methodology allows
management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and
tax-exempt sources. The corresponding income tax impact related to these items
is recorded within income tax expense. See page 8 of JPMorgan Chase`s Earnings
Release Financial Supplement (fourth quarter of 2008) for a reconciliation of
JPMorgan Chase`s income statement from a reported basis to a managed basis. 

2. Pretax margin represents income before income tax expense divided by total
net revenue, which is, in management`s view, a comprehensive measure of pretax
performance derived by measuring earnings after all costs are taken into
consideration. It is, therefore, another basis that management uses to evaluate
the performance of TSS and AM against the performance of competitors.

 (a) Includes accounting conformity loan loss reserve provision related to the acquisition of Washington Mutual Bank's banking operations.                                                                                        
 (b) JPMorgan Chase acquired the banking operations of Washington Mutual Bank for $1.9 billion. The fair value of the net assets acquired exceeded the purchase price which resulted in negative goodwill. In accordance with SFAS 141, nonfinancial assets that are not held-for-sale were written down against that negative goodwill. The negative goodwill that remained after writing down nonfinancial assets was recognized as an extraordinary gain. 
 (c) On September 30, 2008, the Firm issued $11.5 billion, or 284 million shares, of its common stock at $40.50 per share.                                                                                                        
 (d) Quarterly ratios are based upon annualized amounts.                                                                                                                                                                          
 (e) Net income applicable to common stock divided by total average common equity (net of goodwill). The Firm uses return on equity less goodwill, a non-GAAP financial measure, to evaluate the operating performance of the Firm. The Firm also utilizes this measure to facilitate comparisons to competitors. 
 (f) Increase in the third quarter of 2008 predominantly relates to the acquisition of Washington Mutual Bank's banking operations.                                                                                               
 (g) See Corporate/Private Equity Financial Highlights on page 29 of JPMorgan Chase's Earnings Release Financial Supplement for additional details.                                                                               
 (h) Common equivalent shares have been excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share for the fourth and third quarters of 2008, as the effect would be antidilutive.                                               
 (i) Estimated.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Select Comfort Lying Flat

Select Comfort Corp. (NASDAQ: SCSS) is a leading specialty mattress manufacturer
and retailer. Sales trends in the mattress industry are worsening, which puts
Select Comfort in a difficult position. There is little demand for the company's
high quality but high price-point bedding. 

While the company no longer provides specific sales and earnings guidance,
management indicated that it is going to focus on reducing costs, aggressively
closing stores, and preserving cash. 

Credit Markets Beginning to Thaw

Recent developments in many indicators of credit stress have been very positive.
The credit markets are beginning to thaw (unlike the upper Midwest). Perhaps the
most notable development is the decline in the Treasury-Eurodollar, or TED,
spread. This is a measure of banks' willingness to lend to each other, and thus
their confidence that the other bank will be there a few months from now. 

During the October credit crisis, the TED spread rose to an unprecedented 4.63%,
well above the 2.00% it reached in the Bear Stearns wave of financial distress.
It is now back down to under 1.0%. While this is still much higher than its
prevailing level up until about 18 months ago, it is in line with where it was
last summer. This is one of the more encouraging events I have seen in a long
time. 

I still think it is too early to go back into the equity of banks like Goldman
Sachs (NYSE: GS), Citigroup (NYSE: C) or Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), but on
dips the senior debt of these sorts of firms could be interesting. For example,
long-term debt of GS (due 10/37) is now yielding 8.22%, a very fat premium over
the 30-year T-bond yield of 3.02%. 

JA Solar Strongly Positioned

JA Solar Holdings Co., Ltd. (NASDAQ: JASO) is well positioned to successfully
become a global leader in the development and manufacturing of solar cells.
Going forward, improving production costs, coupled with ongoing capacity
expansions, and committed supply of key raw materials, will continue to boost
the growth story. 

However, rising silicon wafer costs, tepid module demand in Europe, after-shocks
of Lehman bankruptcy and the company's high R expenses may affect ASPs over
the near-term. Faced with adverse macro conditions the company reduced its
revenue guidance for fiscal 2008 and fiscal 2009. Accordingly, we maintain our
BUY recommendation on JASO with a six-month target price of $5.50. Price
appreciation to our near-term valuation target represents 18%% upside potential.

&lt;p&gt; * U.S. stock index futures pointed to a lower open on Wall
Street on Thursday ahead of JPMorgan Chase's (JPM.N) Q4 results
as woes about the state of the banking industry persisted.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * At 1005 GMT, futures for the SP 500 futures SPc1, Dow
Jones futures DJc1 and Nasdaq 100 NDc1 were down between 0.5
and 2.2 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) Q4 earnings kick off what is
expected to be a very grim reporting season for the banking
sector. The fourth quarter is the first full three-month period
since JPMorgan's $1.9 billion purchase of most of the assets of
Seattle's Washington Mutual, the largest U.S. banking failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares in Frankfurt (JPM.F) were 2.8 percent
higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Intel (INTC.O) is reporting Q4 results. Analysts expect
the company to earn 4 cents per share, down from 38 cents a year
earlier, according to Reuters Estimates. Intel shares in
Frankfurt (INTC.F) were down 1.1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Investors are also likely to focus on Marshall  Ilsley
MI.N Q4 results which may signal the depth and breadth of
deterioration in U.S. credit conditions. The market expects the
company to earn 8 cents per share, down from 15 cents a year
earlier, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Genentech DNA.N kicks off Q4 earnings reporting for the
healthcare sector amid concerns that sales for some of its key
products will come in below expectations based on early
prescription data. Analysts expect the company to earn 96 cents
per share, up from 69 cents a year earlier, according to Reuters
Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * After the bell, on Wednesday, Bank of America (BAC.N)
shares dropped more than 5 percent following a Wall Street
Journal report the bank is close to receiving billions of
dollars in additional government aid to help it digest its
purchase of Merrill Lynch. Bank of America shares in Frankfurt
(BAC.F) fell 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Investors will eye the New York Fed Empire State
Manufacturing Survey out at 1330 GMT for January with economists
in a Reuters survey expecting a reading of -25.00 compared with
-25.76 in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * The U.S. Labor Department will release the December
Producer Price Index (PPI) out at 1330 GMT with economists in a
Reuters survey forecasting a 2 percent fall compared with a 2.2
percent fall in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Weekly U.S. Jobless Claims are out at 1330 GMT with
economists in a Reuters survey forecasting a total of 500,000
new filings compared with 467,000 in the prior week.          &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * U.S. stocks fell to six-week lows on Wednesday on worries
about steeper losses at banks worldwide and as U.S. retail sales
data pointed to a deepening recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI ended down 2.9
percent, the SP 500 index .SPX ended down 3.4 percent and the
Nasdaq Composite index .IXIC closed down 3.7 percent.

&lt;p&gt; By Ingrid Melander and Edwin Chan&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/BRUSSELS Jan 16 (Reuters) - The European
Commission accused Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Friday of
stymieing competition by bundling its Internet Explorer Web
browser with Windows systems, firing the latest salvo in an
expensive, years-long battle with the software titan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The executive arm of the European Union reached the
preliminary view that the company, which controls roughly
three-quarters of the Web browser arena, had prevented rival
browsers from competing and had infringed EU rules by abusing
its dominant position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It added that Microsoft had eight weeks to reply to a
"statement of objections" sent to the company, in which it
threatened to impose a fine on the U.S. software giant if its
preliminary findings were confirmed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has had to shell out over $1 billion in fines to
the commission in the past.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission "sets out evidence and outlines its
preliminary conclusion that Microsoft's tying of Internet
Explorer to the Windows operating system harms competition
between Web browsers, undermines product innovation and
ultimately reduces consumer choice," the EU executive said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If the preliminary views expressed in the statement of
objection are confirmed, the Commission may impose a fine on
Microsoft, require Microsoft to cease the abuse and impose a
remedy that would restore genuine consumer choice and enable
competition on the merits."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and the EU have engaged in a running spat over
competition issues for years, and the U.S. company has been
fined several times for allegedly abusing its 95 percent
dominance of personal computer systems through its ubiquitous
Windows software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This case is about the future, about maintaining an open
and dynamic Internet," said Thomas Vinje, a Clifford Chance
lawyer representing ECIS, a non-profit organisation that
promotes market conditions in the tech sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft has achieved ubiquity for IE (Internet

Microsoft's monopolies in ways completely unrelated to the
merits of Microsoft's products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said in a separate statement on Friday that it
was studying the Commission's views and did not rule out
requesting a formal hearing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It cited the Commission as saying that remedies put in
place by U.S. courts in 2002 after antitrust proceedings also
did not make Windows-Explorer bundling lawful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are committed to conducting our business in full
compliance with European law," the company said in a short
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, the EU fined the U.S. software company a
record 899 million euros for discouraging software competition,
the biggest ever imposed on a corporation at the time.

Web-browsing market through Explorer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts say that the firm has diversified enormously and
is now no longer so reliant on its Windows system, with revenue
coming in from Xbox sales and server software.

Jobs also is Disney's largest individual shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney paid Iger $2 million in base salary, plus a $13.9 million bonus during its 2008 fiscal year ended September 26. The company expensed $7.76 million in stock awards and $5.9 million in option awards for Iger during the fiscal year, the proxy showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares fell 5.5 percent during the company's 2008 fiscal year but outperformed the Standard and Poor's index, which dropped by 18 percent during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The entertainment giant's share price has since dropped an additional 31 percent as the global economic downturn thrashed media sector shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In fiscal 2007, Iger received a 7 percent year-over-year rise in total compensation, to $27.7 million, according to last year's proxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects typographical error in headline to "osteoporosis")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. health regulators are
seeking additional information from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) on its
long-delayed, experimental osteoporosis drug, lasofoxifene,
before deciding whether to grant approval, the world's largest
drug maker said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer did not characterize the type of information that
the Food and Drug Administration was seeking or say whether the
agency was asking for an additional clinical study, which would
mean a lengthy delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer is reviewing the letter and will work with FDA to
determine the appropriate next steps regarding the company's
application," Pfizer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDA rejected the drug, which Pfizer hopes to sell under
the brand name Fablyn, in 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer submitted the current application for lasofoxifene
to be used by post-menopausal women who are at increased risk
of a fracture in December of 2007. An FDA scientific advisory
panel voted 9-3 in September to recommend approval, saying
there is a population of post-menopausal women with
osteoporosis for whom the drug's benefits likely outweigh the
risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency typically follows the advice of its expert
panels, but has rejected recommended medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European regulators are also reviewing the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have largely kept out Fablyn sales projections
from their Pfizer forecasts due to the uncertainty surrounding
the medicine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lasofoxifene belongs to the same class of drugs as Eli
Lilly and Co's (LLY.N) Evista, known as SERMS, or selective
estrogen receptor modulators. Evista had sales of $265.7
million in the third quarter of 2008.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES/BRUSSELS Jan 16 (Reuters) - The European

stymieing competition by bundling its Internet Explorer Web

is now no longer so reliant on its Windows system, with revenue
coming in from Xbox sales and server software.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc said today it has received a complete response letter from the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asking for additional information on the
company`s application for lasofoxifene. The investigational compound is
currently under review for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women
at increased risk of fracture. 

Pfizer is reviewing the letter and will work with FDA to determine the
appropriate next steps regarding the company`s application. 

Pfizer submitted the current application for lasofoxifene on December 18, 2007.
On September 8, 2008, an FDA scientific advisory panel voted 9-3 (with one
abstention) that there is a population of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis
in which the benefits of lasofoxifene likely outweigh the risks. FDA is not
required to follow the advice of the panel. 

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European
Medicines Agency issued a positive opinion on December 18, 2008, recommending
marketing authorization for lasofoxifene. The CHMP`s opinion will be reviewed by
the European Commission, which has authority to approve medicines for the
European Union. 

About Lasofoxifene

Lasofoxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, or SERM, in the same
chemical class as raloxifene. With its high affinity for estrogen receptors,
lasofoxifene acts as an agonist in bone and as an antagonist in the breast.
Thus, it modulates the estrogen receptor in a different manner than estrogen,
which accounts for the effects of lasofoxifene observed in multiple target
tissues.

This release contains forward-looking information that involves substantial

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The European Commission has sent a Statement of Objections (SO) to Microsoft on
January 15, 2009. The SO outlines the Commission`s preliminary view that
Microsoft`s tying of its web browser Internet Explorer to its dominant client PC
operating system Windows infringes the EC Treaty rules on abuse of a dominant
position (Article 82). 

In the SO, the Commission sets out evidence and outlines its preliminary
conclusion that Microsoft`s tying of Internet Explorer to the Windows operating
system harms competition between web browsers, undermines product innovation and
ultimately reduces consumer choice. 

The SO is based on the legal and economic principles established in the judgment
of the Court of First Instance of September 17, 2007 (case T-201/04) in which
the Court of First Instance upheld the Commission's decision of March 2004,
finding that Microsoft had abused its dominant position in the PC operating
system market by tying Windows Media Player to its Windows PC operating system. 

The evidence gathered during the investigation leads the Commission to believe
that the tying of Internet Explorer with Windows, which makes Internet Explorer
available on 90 percent of the world's PCs, distorts competition on the merits
between competing web browsers insofar as it provides Internet Explorer with an
artificial distribution advantage which other web browsers are unable to match.
The Commission is concerned that through the tying, Microsoft shields Internet
Explorer from head to head competition with other browsers which is detrimental
to the pace of product innovation and to the quality of products which consumers
ultimately obtain. In addition, the Commission is concerned that the ubiquity of
Internet Explorer creates artificial incentives for content providers and
software developers to design websites or software primarily for Internet
Explorer which ultimately risks undermining competition and innovation in the
provision of services to consumers. 

Microsoft has 8 weeks to reply the SO, and will then have the right to be heard
in an Oral Hearing should it wish to do so. If the preliminary views expressed
in the SO are confirmed, the Commission may impose a fine on Microsoft, require
Microsoft to cease the abuse and impose a remedy that would restore genuine
consumer choice and enable competition on the merits. 

Background

A Statement of Objections is a formal step in Commission antitrust
investigations in which the Commission informs the parties concerned in writing
of the objections raised against them. The addressee of a Statement of
Objections can reply in writing to the Statement of Objections, setting out all
facts known to it which are relevant to its defense against the objections
raised by the Commission. The party may also request an oral hearing to present
its comments on the case. 

The Commission may then take a decision on whether conduct addressed in the
Statement of Objections is compatible or not with the EC Treaty`s antitrust
rules. Sending a Statement of Objections does not prejudge the final outcome of
the procedure. In the March 2004 Decision, the Commission ordered Microsoft to
offer to PC manufacturers a version of its Windows client PC operating system
without Windows Media Player. Microsoft, however, retained the right to also
offer a version with Windows Media Player.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc, the world's largest drugmaker, plans to lay off as many as 2,400 sales staff this quarter in a continuing reorganization, the Wall Street Journal said in its Friday online edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The job cuts will involve sales representatives and middle managers and represent about one-third of the company's marketing work force, the report said, citing a person familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer declined to comment, but noted it is making a concerted effort to reshape itself into smaller, more focused business units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based drugmaker has already cut about 15,000 jobs in the past two years, including 800 research jobs earlier this week, to downsize before the company's $12 billion-a-year Lipitor cholesterol drug faces generic competition in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will continually look for ways to operate our business in a more effective an efficient way," company spokesman Ray Kerins said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon LeCroy, an analyst with Natixis Bleichroeder, said Wall Street is expecting Pfizer to announce its next big wave of job cuts this month, after having failed to do so by the end of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People had thought they'd cut a massive amount of jobs prior to the New Year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer could lay out its job-cut plans on January 28, when it reports fourth quarter earnings, other analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a necessary move; Pfizer has to right-size itself before they lose Lipitor," LeCroy said of expected sizable new layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to cuts in staff, LeCroy said the company will likely need to cut spending in other major areas, such as advertising and manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson, editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings downgrades JP Morgan Chase Commercial Securities Corp., Series
2001-A, as follows: 

--$7.8 million class G to 'CCC' from 'BB-' and assigned a distressed recovery
(DR) rating of 'DR2'. 

In addition, Fitch affirms and revises the Outlook of following class: 

--$5.1 million class F at 'AA'; Outlook to Negative. 

In addition, Fitch affirms and maintains Outlooks on the following classes: 

--$22.5 million class A-2 at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--Interest only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$6.8 million class B at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$7.7 million class C at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$10.8 million class D at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$3.4 million class E at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable. 

Fitch does not rate the $8.8 million class NR. Class A-1 has been paid in full. 

The downgrade is the result of expected losses on the specially serviced assets
and potential adverse selection with only 13 loans remaining. Rating Outlooks
reflect the likely direction of any rating changes over the next one to two
years. As of the January 2009 distribution date, the pool's collateral balance
has been reduced 35.8%, to $73 million from $113.8 million at issuance. Four
loans (14.7%) are defeased. 

Fitch is closely monitoring the largest remaining loan (29.9%), which recently
transferred to special servicing due to maturity default. The loan is secured by
a 795,517 square foot (sf) retail center in Maple Heights, Ohio and was
originally scheduled to mature in October 2007 and had been extended to January
2009. The servicer reported a September 2008 debt service coverage ratio (DSCR)
of 1.06 times (x) and occupancy as of December 2008 of 61%. The borrower was
unable to secure refinancing before the extended maturity date. 

In addition to the largest loan, Fitch has identified three other Loans of
Concern that include the other specially serviced asset. The specially serviced
asset (8.8%) is a two-building office complex located in Norcross, GA and has
suffered a decline occupancy. The buildings are currently being marketed for
sale by the special servicer. 

The largest Loan of Concern not in special servicing (15.2%) is secured by a
261,135 sf mall located in Woodland, CA. Servicer reported September 2008
occupancy was 93%; however, the largest tenant, Target, vacated in 2008 and
another tenant, Mervyn's, filed for bankruptcy and is liquidating. A discount
retailer is expected to take the space vacated by Target in 2009. Another
tenant, Gottschalks, a regional retail chain, filed for bankruptcy in January
2009. The loan is scheduled to mature in January 2010. 

The fourth Loan of Concern (5.7%) is secured by a 52,927 sf office facility
located in Pembroke, MA. Servicer reported September 2008 occupancy of 56%, a
decline from June 2008 occupancy of 77%. Servicer reported DSCR as of June 2008
was 1.12x. 

Fitch also remains concerned with the increasing concentrations in the
transaction. The deal is concentrated with 52.6% retail and 10.2% health care
properties. In addition, the top five loans, which include the specially
serviced asset, represent 69.2% of the overall transaction outstanding. All of
the remaining pool is scheduled to mature or has an anticipated repayment date
(ARD) before the end of 2010, with approximately 69.1% of the remaining pool
scheduled to mature in 2009, which includes the largest loan. 

The majority of the collateral in this transaction are loans that were
originated for securitization but were removed from their prospective conduit
pools.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Zacks Industry Rank. Stocks featured in this
week`s analysis includes BB Corporation (NYSE: BBT), Citigroup, Inc. (NYSE:
C), JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company (NYSE: JPM), Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) and Synovus
Financial Corporation (NYSE: SNV).

more than 200 industry groups, visit http://at.zacks.com/?id=3154. 

Zacks Industry Rank Analysis is written by Charles Rotblut, CFA, Senior Market
Analyst for Zacks.com. 

This week: Bank Forecasts: Don`t Believe Them

Recent announcements - including those discussed below - have only added to the
uncertainty regarding banks, and the broader financial sector. Therefore, the
story for investors remains unchanged - be weary of financials. 

J.P. Morgan To Announce Early

On Monday, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Company (NYSE: JPM) announced that it would announce
fourth-quarter earnings on Thursday, Jan 15. The company did not explain why it
was releasing quarterly results 6 days earlier than its previously announced
date. 

Brokerage analysts are bracing themselves for a negative surprise. Just within
the week, 2 analysts have lowered their fourth-quarter earnings estimates. These
negative revisions, combined with 4 other recent cuts, have resulted in a
consensus earnings estimate of 3 cents per share. 

JPM has topped reduced expectations for 3 consecutive quarters, so there is a
real possibility of earnings not being as bad as feared. Nonetheless, investors
should note that 1 month ago, the average forecast called for a 31-cent per
share profit. 

Citigroup Splitting Apart?

The news comes as Citigroup, Inc. (NYSE: C) and Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) struck
a deal for Smith Barney. The brokerage unit of Citigroup will be placed into a
joint venture called Morgan Stanley Smith Barney. C will receive $2.7 billion in
cash up front. 

An article in the Wall Street Journal discussed plans by the conglomerate to
sell other business units, such as some of its consumer finance units. This
means that the brokerage joint venture might be the first in what could be
several partial or full divestures. 

Prior to the credit crisis, Citigroup was criticized for being too big and too
bloated. Therefore, any moves to focus on a few core businesses might have
long-term benefits. However, given the current state of the industry, it could
be a long while before investors actually reap those benefits. 

Deutsche Bank Warns

Deutsche Bank (NYSE: DB) warned that fourth-quarter losses would total about EUR
4.8 billion. The company blamed "exceptional market conditions" and said much of
the losses occurred in its credit trading unit. 

The warning came a day after Zacks Equity Research analyst Ann Heffron lowered
her 2008 forecast to a loss of $3 per share. Ann correctly predicted that the
company would report a larger fourth-quarter quarter loss than was previously
expected, though today's warning was worse than even her lowered forecast. 

Effectiveness of TARP Remains Unknown

Then there is the Troubled Assets Relief Program (aka "TARP"). The Treasury
Department has given out $350 billion in taxpayer money, but can't account for
how it is being used. Home foreclosures continue to rise and loans remain hard
to get. As far as those troubled assets, well, they are still troubled. 

The incoming administration wants to spend the second-half of the TARP funds.
They claim the funds will be used to help beleaguered homeowners. Furthermore,
the Obama administration says it will exercise better oversight. 

Still Don't Trust 2009 Estimates

In the backdrop of all this, earnings estimates for the financial sector
continue to fall. Brokerage analysts had no idea where to peg 2009 earnings
throughout 2008 and the start of the New Year has not brought any additional
visibility. 

Rather, 8 full year 2009 earnings estimates are being cut for every forecast
that has been raised - a revisions ratio of 0.12. This compares to a revisions
ratio of 0.17 for the entire Zacks Rank universe (6 estimates cut for every 1
that has been raised). 

(Other banks that brokerage analysts have particularly targeted with negative
earnings estimate revisions include BB Corporation (NYSE: BBT) and Synovus
Financial Corporation (NYSE: SNV)). 

Rising unemployment will place an additional strain on struggling homeowners and
will cause a further rise in foreclosures. Credit card defaults will also be
higher. A reluctance to spend will generate fewer credit card fees. And if the
markets remain volatile, assets under management and associated investment
management revenues could be under pressure. It's not a good mix. 

The covering brokerage analysts may ultimately be late with reacting to a
turnaround in the financial sector. But given the current level of uncertainty,
being late to the party is not such a bad thing.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is considering significant layoffs across its various divisions, The Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday, citing people familiar with the company's plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But plans for the cutbacks have not yet been firmed up and Microsoft could end up finding alternative methods to control costs, the Journal reported on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesman declined to comment on layoff rumors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of potential job cuts is likely to be far less than the 15,000 positions that have been rumored in recent weeks, the Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft might announce the job cuts when it reports quarterly earnings next week, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software giant employs about 91,000 employees globally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anupreeta Das; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 16 (Reuters) - ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and
Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said on Friday their refineries
supplied by Venezuelan crude were operating normally after
Venezuela announced it had halted oil shipments to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conoco's 247,000 barrel per day refinery in Sweeny, Texas,
and Exxon's joint venture refinery with PDVSA in Chalmette,
Louisiana, with a capacity of about 200,000 barrel per day, are
both supplied with Venezuelan crude.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As a matter of practice Chalmette Refining LLC does not
discuss its day-to-day operations or supply arrangements.  It
expects to be able to meet its contractual commitments," said
Margaret Ross, a spokeswoman for Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ross said that questions about possible legal action
against Venezuela were speculative and, as a matter of
practice, the company does not speculate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conoco spokesman Bill Tanner said the company did not
expect to change its business plan as a result of Venezuela's
decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have the ability to draw on a number of internal and
external sources to supply our refinery," Tanner said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He added that due to the company's current arbitration
against Venezuela to seek compensation for the expropriation of
Conoco's Venezuelan oil assets, the company cannot comment on
specific questions about how it will respond to Venezuela's
latest announcement.

&lt;p&gt;  SEOUL, KOREA, Jan 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Korea Exchange Bank (KEB) and IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced the completion of
KEB's mainframe migration to IBM System z10 which will enable the bank's
credit card business (KEB Card) to create an advanced and smarter IT
environment to improve efficiency and customer service.

    Under the agreement signed in October 2008, IBM provided KEB Card with
three units of the System z10 Enterprise Class (EC), the most advanced IBM
System z mainframe with the equivalent capacity of nearly 1,500 x86
servers, with an 85% smaller footprint, up to 85% lower energy costs.

    IBM utilized the mainframe's Parallel Sysplex technology and successfully
implemented the system migration from System z990 without interrupting KEB
Card's business. With the IBM System z10, KEB Card now provides guaranteed
stability in its main computer operations and the capacity needed to
quickly respond to the rapidly changing financial environment. The new
system also supports KEB Card's business growth as System z10 offers
performance that is three times faster than the former z990 and ensures
two times more capacity.

    Through the integrated service of IBM, KEB Card has optimized its main
computer operations and cut down the total cost of ownership (TCO)
resulting from a reduction in operation and maintenance costs per million
instructions per second (MIPS). In addition, KEB Card has secured the
foundation to improve its main computer and data center performance and
substantially improved the online batch processing time, by employing the
latest 4.4GHz System z10 technology.

    "We have secured an essentially required computing capacity through the
successful System z10 migration through our partnership with IBM Korea,"
said Young Kim, Director of IT Operations, KEB. "We were also able to
minimize TCO by further improving system stability, efficiency, and
availability in a smarter way. It is anticipated that we will be able to
innovate various customer services based on the outstanding performance of
the IBM System z10."

    SukYoung Kang, Director, Financial Services Sector, IBM Korea, said, "The
System z10 automates the management and tracking of IT resources that is
required to quickly respond to the continuously changing business
environment while also ensuring top-level security.

    Kang added, "I am pleased that IBM was able to create greater value for
KEB from the IBM System z10 system, which has been regarded as the
strategic IT platform for the world's top companies and continues to gain
momentum for its long term economic value."

    About IBM System z10

    The adoption of IBM mainframes, which power the top 50 banks worldwide and
22 of the top 25 US retailers, has enabled IBM's System z to nearly double
its share this decade, according to IDC's high-end server quarterly
tracker. Over the same timeframe, HP and Sun have lost its share. (1)
Examples of the clients in Financial Services Sector that have adopted IBM
mainframes include: Industrial Bank of Korea, Itau Bank (Brazil), Postbank
AG (Germany), Finanz Informatik (Germany), RHB Banking Group (Malaysia),
and Allied Irish Bank. In growth markets such as Brazil, Singapore,
Thailand and the Philippines, IBM mainframe revenue grew 21% (1) in the
first half of 2008 when compared to the same period of time in 2007. For

&lt;p&gt;EPA Southeast Diesel Collaborative Recognizes CCE with Leadership Award
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Georgia Governor Sonny Perdue and EPA Deputy Regional Administrator Stan Meiburg
joined Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE) Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
John F. Brock to announce the deployment of the largest hybrid electric delivery
trucks in North America. As part of its overall commitment to energy
conservation and climate change, CCE plans to deploy an incremental 185 hybrid
electric trucks across the United States and Canada in 2009, bringing their
total number of hybrid electric delivery trucks to 327, the largest such fleet
in North America. 

"I want to commend Coca-Cola Enterprises for receiving this award, and I am
proud that this great company relies on Georgia as its home base," said Gov.
Perdue. "Their investment in hybrid electric vehicles distinguishes the company
amongst its peers and ensures that it remains at the forefront as a true leader
in corporate responsibility and sustainability." 

Meiburg, who presented CCE with a leadership award on behalf of the Southeast
Diesel Collaborative for the company`s commitment to hybrid vehicles to reduce
diesel emissions, added, "EPA is proud to recognize the efforts of Coca-Cola
Enterprises to improve air quality and protect public health. Emissions from
diesel engines are a serious public health threat and environmental challenge,
and reducing these emissions is a priority for EPA." 

"Coca-Cola Enterprises has long been responsive to the needs of our local
communities, and the continued expansion of our hybrid electric fleet here in
our hometown of Atlanta and across North America demonstrates our commitment to
energy efficiency and climate change," said Brock. "With the deployment of our
newer, larger hybrid delivery vehicles, CCE is continuing to explore ways to
help our customers and communities through our corporate responsibility and
sustainability efforts. These efforts help us capture operational efficiencies,
drive innovation and effectiveness, and eliminate waste while simultaneously
protecting the environment." 

CCE has established five corporate responsibility and sustainability strategic
focus areas, three of which - energy conservation/climate change, water
stewardship, and sustainable packaging/recycling - are related to the
environment. In addition to the hybrid electric delivery trucks on the road in
Atlanta and across North America, CCE facilities are focusing on becoming more
sustainable with the activation of its subsidiary, Coca-Cola Recycling, which is
focused on developing recycling solutions for its business and communities, and
the installation of water-saving technology and energy-efficient lighting in its
facilities. Just last week, CCE earned the Orion Energy Systems Environmental
Stewardship Award for its commitment to energy conservation and climate change
in California. 

The company has 142 hybrid electric delivery vehicles on the road, the majority
of which are 12-bay box trucks (33000 gross vehicle weight). This is the largest
heavy duty fleet in North America. Today, the company launched a new, larger
hybrid electric tractor (55000 gross combination vehicle), which is the standard
bulk delivery truck the company uses for large deliveries. The hybrid tractor
uses about 30 percent less fuel and produces about 30 percent fewer emissions
than standard tractors. A motor/generator, working with the transmission and a
series of lithium ion batteries, allows the truck to source electrical power
instead of gas when traveling at speeds below 30 MPH, reducing emissions and
fuel use. The tractor builds on the success CCE has had with their fleet of
hybrid electric 12-bay trucks and marries hybrid technology from Eaton
Corporation with state-of-the-art equipment from key suppliers, Kenworth
Corporation and Cummins Engines. 

Beginning in 2001, CCE began an intensive research and design program with their
suppliers to develop, test and produce hybrid electric trucks. By the end of
2008, CCE had deployed 142 hybrid electric trucks, in cities like Atlanta;
Baltimore; Dallas; Denver; Detroit; Houston; Los Angeles; Miami; Toronto;
Vancouver; and Washington, DC. In 2009, the company plans to deploy the larger
hybrid tractors to: Atlanta; Boston; Chicago; Dallas; Denver; Houston; Los
Angeles; Miami; New York; Portland; San Francisco; Seattle; Tampa; Toronto;
Vancouver; and Washington, DC. Additionally, the company plans to deploy
incremental hybrid 12-bay trucks to Albuquerque; Columbus; Jacksonville; Las
Vegas; and Montreal. 

At Coca-Cola Enterprises, corporate responsibility and sustainability is about
improving overall business performance while meeting the expectations of
employees, customers, investors, communities, and other stakeholders. Through
the company`s five strategic focus areas of water stewardship, sustainable
packaging/recycling, energy conservation/climate change, product
portfolio/well-being, and diverse and inclusive culture, corporate
responsibility and sustainability is where CCE`s business touches the world and
where the world touches CCE`s business.

efforts, please visit www.cokecce.com.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 16 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities introduced new
price targets for 2009 on the stocks of eight of the gold and
silver miners under its coverage, and cut its ratings on four
of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Our new price targeting methodology leans heavily on our
conviction that gold equity stock prices are driven primarily
by their connection to the expected gold price," analyst John
Bridges said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bridges also said he was looking at factors such as
diversification of assets, assets located in countries with
higher debt ratings, reserve growth and future production
estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst downgraded Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd (AEM.N)
(AEM.TO), Goldcorp Inc (GG.N)(G.TO) and Kinross Gold Corp
(K.TO)(KGC.N) to "neutral" from "overweight" and Pan American
Silver Corp (PAAS.O)(PAA.TO) to "underweight" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The following are the new price targets for 2009 set by
J.P. Morgan on gold and silver miners:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Company                             Price Target (in $)  
 Agnico-Eagle Mines Ltd (AEM.N)            51.00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barrick Gold Corp (ABX.N)                 37.00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buenaventura (BVN.N)                      19.00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldcorp Inc (GG.N)                       26.00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kinross Gold Corp (KGC.N)                 19.00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Newmont Mining Corp (NEM.N)               49.00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pan American Silver Corp (PAAS.O)         10.00&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Silver Wheaton (SLW.N)                     9.00

&lt;p&gt;  MANILA, THE PHILIPPINES, Jan 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Metrobank, one of the largest private banks in the Philippines, has
selected IBM (NYSE: IBM) to integrate and implement an advanced security
solution for its Metrobankdirect, an Internet banking facility.

    The agreement, signed in November 2008, will see IBM Internet Security
Systems deploy the Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) security solution by
which the user provides a second means of identification in order to
obtain access to Metrobank's online banking facility. IBM brings its
proven project management methodology and technical expertise, integrated
with VASCO's authentication token solution and Data Security Systems
Solutions' strong authentication and token management solutions for the
implementation of this project.

    New and changing risks in cyberspace such as identity theft, phishing,
pharming, and increasing incidents of fraud caused serious concern for
companies doing business over the Internet. Banks and financial
institutions, in particular, are common targets and face the challenge of
continuously looking for effective measures to safeguard customers'
information and electronic transactions.

    "Our objective is to have the strongest level of security for online
banking without having to complicate the sign-in and user authentication
procedures that might drive online users away," said Dennis Suico,
Executive Vice President, Metrobank. "As Metrobankdirect Internet banking
facility has been gaining popularity, we want to maintain this leadership
by ensuring a secure Internet online facility to increase the level of
protection for our clients."

    With 2FA, Metrobank will be able to strengthen its compliance with BSP
Circular 542 on Consumer Protection for Electronic Banking.

    Before the security upgrade, Metrobankdirect used single
factor-authentication whereby a user is required to enter a customer ID
and password to prove the user's real identity. The 2FA will enhance the
authentication process by requiring a second means of identification
through a security token thereby protecting clients against evolving
online banking threats. To date, it is the most suitable level of
security in online banking while maintaining a simplified user sign-on
procedure.

    "IBM has long been a leader in access and identity management and we're
expanding that lead with complementary services around the world,"
explained James Velasquez, Country General Manager, IBM Philippines.
"Account fraud and identity theft are frequently the result of
exploitation of single-factor authentication. With the 2FA security
process, we're securing the bank's assets, minimizing fraudulent
transactions and reducing the exposure to online fraud caused by offline
phishing attacks and other offline/online credential stealing threats."

    The common known threats or vulnerabilities in the banking and financial
services sector include Offline Credential Stealing, Online Credential
Stealing, Online Communication Channel Tampering, Online Transaction
Manipulation, and Online Authorization Redirection.

    About Metrobank

    Metrobank is the second largest private bank in the Philippines. With 552
domestic branches and 8 foreign branches, plus various representative
offices, subsidiary satellites and remittance tie-ups, the Bank's
international presence currently spans over 800 offices in 21 countries.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jan 16 (Reuters) - Thomson Reuters Plc TRIL.L (TRI.N) (TRI.TO) is expected to post strong results next month, analysts at J.P. Morgan Securities said, even as they downgraded the London-listed shares to "neutral" from "overweight" on valuation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The analysts raised their price targets on the London- and New York-listed shares of the group and kept their "neutral" stance on the U.S. stock. "We continue to like the fundamentals of the company but would look for a better entry price into both stocks," analysts, including Mark O'Donnell and Michael Meltz, wrote in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The analysts expect the news and information publisher to report strong results, with potential cost savings and/or some restructuring charges shifting from 2008 to 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But the key risk to the shares is news about financial industry job losses and the market's potential read-through to organic growth at the group's markets division, they said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Thomson Reuters' markets division includes the Reuters and Thomson news operations as well as financial data and tools for investment banks and other financial firms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last week, the group's Chief Financial Officer Robert Daleo said Thomson Reuters' quarterly and annual revenue growth rate would slow, reflecting the effects of the world financial crisis.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JP Morgan analysts, however, said any weakness in the group's markets division revenue will be offset by the relative strength in its professional unit, which represented about 60 percent of profits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cost savings may also largely cushion any markets revenue decline, the analysts added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The professional division sells databases and other deep information reservoirs to lawyers, accountants, scientists and the healthcare industry. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The analysts raised their price target on Thomson Reuters London shares to 1,750 pence from 1,500 pence, and on Thomson Reuters Corp (TRI.N) shares to $26.6 from $26.3. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Thomson Reuters Plc were up 1.4 percent at 1344 pence at 0955 GMT on the London Stock Exchange, while those of Thomson Reuters Corp closed at $23.90 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tenzin Pema in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((tenzin.pema@thomsonreuters.com; within U.S. +1 646 223 8780; outside U.S. +91 80 4135 5800; Reuters Messaging: tenzin.pema.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: THOMSONREUTERS/RESEARCH JPMORGAN  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT Jan 16 (Reuters) - U.S. private equity firm TPG
[TPG.UL] is considering taking a stake in HeidelbergCement
[HEIG.DE] jointly with Goldman Sachs (GS.N), a source familiar
with the matter said on Friday, confirming an earlier report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Another source said HeidelbergCement, the world's
fourth-largest cement maker, saw one or more investors taking a
stake in the firm as an option to strengthen its equity  base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier in the day, shares in HeidelbergCement rose sharply
after the Wall Street Journal reported that Goldman, possibly in
partnership with TPG, was considering making an investment in
HeidelbergCement. The paper cited people familiar with the
matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One person said that any investment would likely involve a
minority stake, but may lead to the sale of a majority holding
at a later stage, the paper added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HeidelbergCement, controlled by the Merckle family, which
has been forced to put up financial assets as collateral for
bank loans it is getting to help refinance, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company announced late on Tuesday that it planned to
bolster its capital base and restructure its large debt load.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Philipp Halstrick; Additional Reporting by

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Jan 16 (Reuters) - Indonesia has rejected a
proposal by Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) to develop the giant
Natuna D-Alpha gas field, since it believes the contract held
by the U.S. oil major expired in 2005, the energy minister said
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The move, revolving around the dispute between Exxon Mobil
and the government over the U.S. major's role in the project
and over how to split the gas output, would further delay the
project's start-up, but would not end Exxon's involvement,
analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil submitted a development plan to Indonesia's
energy watchdog, BPMIGAS, and to the director general of oil
and gas at the energy ministry, at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Natuna D-Alpha block in the South China Sea has around
222 trillion cubic feet (tcf) of gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 46 tcf of these are thought to be commercially
recoverable, accounting for roughly a quarter of Indonesia's
total commercially recoverable gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The submission of the plan to develop the field would be
accepted if BPMIGAS and the contractor had both previously
agreed that the field was commercially viable for development
based on a feasibility study," Energy Minister Yusgiantoro
Purnomo told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We sent a letter of rejection on Jan. 14," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BPMIGAS has responsiblity to monitor and control oil and
gas contractors working in Indonesia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon Mobil Indonesia official disputed that the
contract was not in force, but said it was seeking a
resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We respectfully disagree that our PSC (production sharing
contract) is not effective, but we remain interested in a
resolution which allows development of this resource to proceed
with the support of the Government," Maman Budiman, a senior
vice president at Exxon Mobil Indonesia, said via a telephone
text message.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have honoured our commitments under the PSC and will
continue to do so," Budiman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. firm has said it had submitted its development
plan ahead of the expiry and in line with the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AT ODDS OVER GAS SPLIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has said that Exxon Mobil's contract giving it a
76 percent share has already expired, whereas the energy major
has said that the contract was valid until January 9, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has said talks with Exxon Mobil, which has
controlled the block since the 1990s, had stopped on the
offshore gas project due to disagreements on how to split the
gas output.     Other unresolved issues with Exxon Mobil on the
block, which is about 1,100 kilometres (680 miles) north of
Jakarta and 200 km east of the West Natuna fields that feed gas
to Singapore, included the length of the U.S. firm's contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia's government has appointed state oil firm
Pertamina as the operator of Natuna, but the state company does
not have the capacity to develop the gas field alone, which is
estimated to need $40 billion in investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Budiman said Exxon Mobil was in a unique position to
develop the project in partnership with Pertamina and could
bring technological expertise, proven large scale project
execution capacity and experience with complex gas projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the latest move in the long-running dispute,
Kurtubi, an analyst at the Centre for Petroleum and Energy
Economics Studies in Jakarta, said that Exxon Mobil should be
used as a partner, particularly given its expertise..&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Pertamina take others companies to be a partner, there
will be a risk that Exxon could bring the case into arbitrage
court. If that happens the development of Natuna will be
delayed," said Kurtubi, who uses one name like many
Indonesians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Other companies have no data on Natuna and it will make
problems," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pertamina' upstream director Karen Agustiawan has said the
company will keep a 40 percent stake in the Natuna D-Alpha gas
project, while 60 percent will be shared among the partners.  
 Pertamina has named eight international oil and gas companies,
including Exxon Mobil, Chevron (CVX.N) and France's Total
(TOTF.PA), as its potential partners to develop the giant
Natuna D-Alpha gas field.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI Jan 17 (Reuters) - International Business
Machines Corp (IBM.N) has bought a strategic stake in Sichuan
Changhong Electric Co (600839.SS) for 108 million yuan ($15.8
million), the major Chinese television and consumer electronics
maker said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A Chinese unit of IBM bought the 1.56 percent stake through
the Shanghai Stock Exchange on Friday from the Changhong group,
Sichuan Changhong's biggest shareholder, which saw its
shareholding reduced to 29.08 percent from 30.64 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sichuan Changhong did not elaborate on any future expansion
of ties with IBM, which did not previously own a stake in the
Chinese company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In December 2007, China's securities regulator blocked a
deal under which Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) was to have bought a
nearly 1 percent stake in Sichuan Changhong for $12.9 million,
apparently because it felt the purchase price was too far below
the market price of the Chinese firm's shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sichuan Changhong's shares closed at 3.59 yuan on Friday,
near the price of 3.64 yuan per share at which IBM bought its
stake. They have plunged from a peak of 13.00 yuan in mid-2007
as the firm's earnings have been slashed by the global economic
slowdown and an earthquake which damaged its facilities last
May.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. computer firm T3
Technologies Inc said on Tuesday it had filed a competition
complaint with the European Commission accusing IBM (IBM.N) of
abusing its power in the mainframe computer industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; T3 accused International Business Machines of preventing
sales of competing mainframe hardware products by tying the
sale of its operating system to its mainframe hardware, and of
withholding patent licenses, the privately held, Florida-based
company said in a statement on its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From 1992 until 2002, T3 said it sold IBM mainframes, but
later produced two alternative mainframe product lines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Financial Times, which reported T3's move on Tuesday,
said it was likely to reinvigorate Brussels' questioning of
IBM's operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newspaper quoted IBM as saying it was unaware of T3's
complaint.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2007, U.S. software maker Platform Solutions Inc filed a
complaint with the European Commission, alleging that IBM
abused market dominance by refusing to supply interface
information on mainframe computers and refusing to license
third parties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That complaint was dropped when IBM acquired Platform
Solutions in July 2008.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - The price of U.S. crude oil is expected to rebound sharply later this year, but may sink below $30 a barrel in the near term, said a Goldman Sachs (GS.N) analyst on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman's average oil price forecast for the first quarter of 2009 remains at $30 a barrel but then recovers to $65 in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You still have potential for it to drop below $30," Jeff Currie, head of the bank's commodities research team, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank with the biggest share in commodities and energy markets had been among the most bullish forecasters of the oil price. It had last year predicted a crude oil spike to $200 a barrel. Currie said in a presentation to investors that Goldman Sachs was starting to argue that oil -- which has plunged more than $100 from a record near $150 last July -- may have reached a bottom.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. crude was $2.04 down at $34.47 a barrel by 10:31 a.m. EST.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He pointed to supply cuts from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and potential shut-ins of non-OPEC supply as factors that could ultimately spur a sharp rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currie expected OPEC to get 75 percent compliance with its supply cut of 4.2 million barrels per day (bpd), while falling demand and prices would put pressure on non-OPEC producers to shut down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STORAGE FULL&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If storage is full then there is an incentive to shut in (for non-OPEC) production," he said, adding that most of the world's primary storage was already full.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you see cuts in non-OPEC production you could have seen the bottom," Currie told investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the demand side, Goldman estimated the downturn in the global economy would mean a sharp pull-back in oil demand of an estimated 1.7 million bpd in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Demand fell last year in industrialized countries, this year emerging markets such as China and the Middle East would join them, Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman remains bullish on oil for the longer term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The long-term story is that the imbalances (in the market) haven't changed and the market will run into significant problems if there is a rebound in demand."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the supply side, there are no large scale next-generation projects to come onstream such as Mexico, the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and Alaska did in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low prices could force shut-downs of existing production and deter new investment that could create potential supply constraints in the future when demand recovers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers were hurt by high oil prices, but the industry will suffer now they are weak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The damage you do to the underlying industry at $37 a barrel is just as bad as what $147 did to the consumer," Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Long-term oil prices are at around $80 a barrel, signaling a recovery at some point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Currie said arbitraging this unprecedented differential was very difficult, partly because the credit crisis had made it harder to finance such trades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jane Merriman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Jan 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
LOTUSPHERE -- IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced LotusLive
(www.LotusLive.com), a cloud-based portfolio of social networking and
collaboration services designed for business.  LotusLive will extend
customers' current investments and link to everyday business services.
LotusLive.com is now the place to find all of Lotus' cloud solutions
including email, collaboration and Web conferencing services.

    "With LotusLive, we are brining 20 years of experience in collaboration

"We believe our open, integrated platform will dramatically simplify and
improve the way businesses interact with their partners and customers.
With this offering we're taking Lotus to more people, in more places,
than ever before."

and ease of use. LotusLive's online services give businesses of all sizes
access to Lotus' rich collaboration tools without requiring an up-front

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Jan 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
LOTUSPHERE -- At the annual Lotusphere Conference, IBM (NYSE: IBM)
unveiled plans to help businesses build a smarter workforce by providing
software services to help people work together across the enterprise, on
the move and via the cloud.

    IBM today announced IBM LotusLive (www.lotuslive.com), a cloud-based
portfolio of social networking and collaboration services designed for
business. LotusLive.com will serve as a single destination for all IBM
Lotus online collaboration tools, including social networking, e-mail,
file sharing and Web conferencing. LotusLive will help businesses of all
sizes simplify and improve the way they interact with their customers,
partners and suppliers.

    LinkedIn, an online network of more than 34 million business
professionals, today announced a partnership with IBM Lotus to integrate
LinkedIn's functionality and networking capabilities with IBM Lotus
Notes, IBM Lotus Connections and LotusLive.

    With the planned Lotus Notes integration, LinkedIn members will be able
to keep track of their professional network via a Network Updates feed.
Users will also have seamless access to LinkedIn profiles from within
their Lotus mail and applications.

    IBM intends to combine the best of business and professional social
networking sites allowing people to expose LinkedIn information from the
millions of LinkedIn public profiles directly into Lotus Connections.

    The planned LotusLive integration will connect the LinkedIn network with
LotusLive. LotusLive users will be able to search LinkedIn's public
professional network and then instantly collaborate with members using
the LotusLive services.

    Salesforce.com plans to integrate LotusLive services with its CRM
applications, helping simplify and improve customer interactions.
Businesses will be able to extend the customer and opportunity management
work done in the Salesforce CRM applications with the Web conferencing
and task management capabilities of LotusLive.

    In addition, Skype has announced plans to integrate its voice and video
service with LotusLive collaborative services to create a seamless
communications experience. This level of integration can allow LotusLive
customers to have the convenience of being able to call Skype contacts
from within their LotusLive contacts.

    Making New Connections with Micro-Blogs and Wikis

    The latest version of Lotus Connections takes popular features from
consumer social networking sites and puts them to work for business. A
new personal "posting wall" and micro-blogging capabilities will make it
easy for people to quickly share short, yet critical pieces of
information. Based on customer demand, IBM plans to add a new wiki
service to Lotus Connections. Wikis are Web pages that quickly and easily
allow people to create and modify content in real-time.

    Lotus Connections is being used by industry leaders worldwide. McKesson,
the world's largest healthcare services company, chose Lotus Connections
for enterprise social networking to improve workforce efficiency and
attract and retain top talent who expect advanced collaboration tools.
McKesson also sought to be among the first pioneers in the healthcare
industry to adopt social networking and benefit from the open
extensibility of Lotus Connections, allowing integration with Microsoft
SharePoint and Vignette Portal.

    "We're excited to broaden our collaboration tools to help encourage
information sharing and idea generation across our diverse workforce,"
said Anand Srinivasan, development manager at McKesson. "With hundreds of
facilities across the country, our use of Lotus Connections technology
will enable us to more effectively tap into our collective intelligence
to continue helping our customers improve health care."

    Mobilizing the Worker with Lotus on the BlackBerry(R)

    Another major pillar of a smart workforce is equipping individuals with
the power of the mobile Web to innovate and collaborate efficiently
anywhere, at anytime. IBM's Institute for Business Value predicts one
billion mobile Web users by 2011 and a significant shift in the way the
majority of people will interact with the Web over the next decade.
Addressing that market opportunity, IBM and Research In Motion (RIM) will
bring new advanced social software features to BlackBerry smartphone
business users worldwide. The new features will help BlackBerry
smartphone users find expertise, form teams, share information and stay
in touch in real-time, making them more effective and productive. They
will also bring mobile business users far beyond e-mail to live expertise
and collective intelligence.

    Lotusphere attendees will get a sneak preview and see demonstrations of
new capabilities for BlackBerry smartphones which will be available later
this year. They include access to open document format-based IBM Lotus
Symphony documents, presentations and spreadsheets; IBM Lotus Quickr Web
2.0-based team software to help individuals find, access, share and work
with business content such as documents, photos and videos; enhanced
Lotus Connections functionality for access to activities, blogs and
communities, augmenting the access already available to profiles and
tags; enhanced Lotus Sametime capabilities; and new tools for developers.

    SAP and Lotus Notes Make Core Data Easy to Use

    IBM and SAP announced the planned March release of their first joint
software product, called Alloy(TM).  IBM and SAP showcased successful
early results of this product with several customers, including
Colgate-Palmolive and Arla Foods.

    Alloy by IBM and SAP connects IBM Lotus Notes software with SAP Business
Suite. Providing workers with access to critical business information in
an intuitive, easy-to-use interface, it will enable timely, more informed
business decisions. Employees can benefit from increased business
analysis, information in context and the power to run their business
operations directly from their Lotus Notes desktops.

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Jan 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
LOTUSPHERE -- Today at the annual Lotusphere conference, IBM (NYSE: IBM)
and SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) announced the planned March release for their
first joint software product called Alloy(TM). At Lotusphere, IBM and SAP
showcased successful early results of this product with several
customers, including Colgate-Palmolive and Arla Foods.

    Alloy connects IBM Lotus Notes software with SAP Business Suite to get
people to the core of their business. Alloy is a new style of software
application that presents information and data from SAP applications in
the context of what millions of business users are familiar with -- the
Lotus Notes collaboration software desktop. This will make it easier for
professionals to do their jobs and enhance the investments they have made
in their SAP applications.

    "We expect the new Alloy software from IBM and SAP to help us drive down
IT management costs and boost productivity by allowing employees easy
access to SAP reports, procurement, data and product life cycle
management tools directly from their Lotus Notes e-mail," said Tom
Greene, CIO, Colgate-Palmolive.

    "Alloy will enable our senior management immediate access to critical
information residing in our SAP system directly from Lotus Notes," said
Claus Qvistgaard, senior director, Arla Foods amba, Global IT. "This will
enable them to improve the quality and timeliness of their decisions,
leading to superior business outcomes for Arla Foods."

    IBM Lotus and SAP have thousands of mutual customers who have been asking
for the functionality that Alloy will provide. The majority of IBM's top
100 customers also use SAP offerings.

    "In today's challenging business environment, companies need to identify
and respond to operational changes more quickly," said Bob Picciano,
general manager, IBM Lotus Software. "Tools that provide business people
with seamless access to expertise, processes and information streamline
work and improve productivity. Alloy by IBM and SAP is designed to help
individuals and companies work more efficiently to produce better
business outcomes."

    For more than 35 years, IBM and SAP have collaborated to bring joint
customers offerings to improve business efficiency at more than 13,000
client sites for millions of users.

    "In today's economy, more than ever, our customers want to maximize the
value derived from their existing investments," said Michael Reh, senior
vice president and general manager, SAP. "Joint Lotus Notes and SAP
customers can do that by leveraging Alloy. With Alloy, organizations can
bring people, processes and information together in one place for
business users thereby increasing adoption and providing opportunities to
further improve return on investment on the technology solutions that run
their businesses."

    Alloy supports SAP workflows, reporting and analytics, and the use of

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Jan 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
LOTUSPHERE -- Today at the annual Lotusphere conference, IBM (NYSE: IBM)
and SAP AG (NYSE: SAP) announced the planned March release for their
first joint software product called Alloy(TM). At Lotusphere, IBM and SAP
showcased successful early results of this product with several
customers, including Colgate-Palmolive and Arla Foods.

    Alloy connects IBM Lotus Notes software with SAP Business Suite to get
people to the core of their business. Alloy is a new style of software
application that presents information and data from SAP applications in
the context of what millions of business users are familiar with -- the
Lotus Notes collaboration software desktop. This will make it easier for
professionals to do their jobs and enhance the investments they have made
in their SAP applications.

    "We expect the new Alloy software from IBM and SAP to help us drive down
IT management costs and boost productivity by allowing employees easy
access to SAP reports, procurement, data and product life cycle
management tools directly from their Lotus Notes e-mail," said Tom
Greene, CIO, Colgate-Palmolive.

    "Alloy will enable our senior management immediate access to critical
information residing in our SAP system directly from Lotus Notes," said
Claus Qvistgaard, senior director, Arla Foods amba, Global IT. "This will
enable them to improve the quality and timeliness of their decisions,
leading to superior business outcomes for Arla Foods."

    IBM Lotus and SAP have thousands of mutual customers who have been asking
for the functionality that Alloy will provide. The majority of IBM's top
100 customers also use SAP offerings.

    "In today's challenging business environment, companies need to identify
and respond to operational changes more quickly," said Bob Picciano,
general manager, IBM Lotus Software. "Tools that provide business people
with seamless access to expertise, processes and information streamline
work and improve productivity. Alloy by IBM and SAP is designed to help
individuals and companies work more efficiently to produce better
business outcomes."

    For more than 35 years, IBM and SAP have collaborated to bring joint
customers offerings to improve business efficiency at more than 13,000
client sites for millions of users.

    "In today's economy, more than ever, our customers want to maximize the
value derived from their existing investments," said Michael Reh, senior
vice president and general manager, SAP. "Joint Lotus Notes and SAP
customers can do that by leveraging Alloy. With Alloy, organizations can
bring people, processes and information together in one place for
business users thereby increasing adoption and providing opportunities to
further improve return on investment on the technology solutions that run
their businesses."

    Alloy supports SAP workflows, reporting and analytics, and the use of
roles from within the Lotus Notes client. The product ships with a set of
standard workflows and reports. These standard elements may be customized
using standard Lotus Domino and SAP tools to reflect a company's unique
processes. IBM Global Business Services, SAP practitioners, Lotus Domino
Business Partners and other global and regional systems integrators will
be available to customize Alloy. Alloy implementations will take
advantage of the collaborative and off-line capabilities inherent in

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Jan 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
LOTUSPHERE -- At the annual Lotusphere Conference, IBM (NYSE: IBM)
unveiled plans to help businesses build a smarter workforce by providing
software services to help people work together across the enterprise, on
the move and via the cloud.

    IBM today announced IBM LotusLive (www.lotuslive.com), a cloud-based
portfolio of social networking and collaboration services designed for
business. LotusLive.com will serve as a single destination for all IBM
Lotus online collaboration tools, including social networking, e-mail,
file sharing and Web conferencing. LotusLive will help businesses of all
sizes simplify and improve the way they interact with their customers,
partners and suppliers.

    LinkedIn, an online network of more than 34 million business
professionals, today announced a partnership with IBM Lotus to integrate
LinkedIn's functionality and networking capabilities with IBM Lotus
Notes, IBM Lotus Connections and LotusLive.

    With the planned Lotus Notes integration, LinkedIn members will be able
to keep track of their professional network via a Network Updates feed.
Users will also have seamless access to LinkedIn profiles from within
their Lotus mail and applications.

    IBM intends to combine the best of business and professional social
networking sites allowing people to expose LinkedIn information from the
millions of LinkedIn public profiles directly into Lotus Connections.

    The planned LotusLive integration will connect the LinkedIn network with
LotusLive. LotusLive users will be able to search LinkedIn's public
professional network and then instantly collaborate with members using
the LotusLive services.

    Salesforce.com plans to integrate LotusLive services with its CRM
applications, helping simplify and improve customer interactions.
Businesses will be able to extend the customer and opportunity management
work done in the Salesforce CRM applications with the Web conferencing
and task management capabilities of LotusLive.

    In addition, Skype has announced plans to integrate its voice and video
service with LotusLive collaborative services to create a seamless
communications experience. This level of integration can allow LotusLive
customers to have the convenience of being able to call Skype contacts
from within their LotusLive contacts.

    Making New Connections with Micro-Blogs and Wikis

    The latest version of Lotus Connections takes popular features from
consumer social networking sites and puts them to work for business. A
new personal "posting wall" and micro-blogging capabilities will make it
easy for people to quickly share short, yet critical pieces of
information. Based on customer demand, IBM plans to add a new wiki
service to Lotus Connections. Wikis are Web pages that quickly and easily
allow people to create and modify content in real-time.

    Lotus Connections is being used by industry leaders worldwide. McKesson,
the world's largest healthcare services company, chose Lotus Connections
for enterprise social networking to improve workforce efficiency and
attract and retain top talent who expect advanced collaboration tools.
McKesson also sought to be among the first pioneers in the healthcare
industry to adopt social networking and benefit from the open
extensibility of Lotus Connections, allowing integration with Microsoft
SharePoint and Vignette Portal.

    "We're excited to broaden our collaboration tools to help encourage
information sharing and idea generation across our diverse workforce,"
said Anand Srinivasan, development manager at McKesson. "With hundreds of
facilities across the country, our use of Lotus Connections technology
will enable us to more effectively tap into our collective intelligence
to continue helping our customers improve health care."

    Mobilizing the Worker with Lotus on the BlackBerry(R)

    Another major pillar of a smart workforce is equipping individuals with
the power of the mobile Web to innovate and collaborate efficiently
anywhere, at anytime. IBM's Institute for Business Value predicts one
billion mobile Web users by 2011 and a significant shift in the way the
majority of people will interact with the Web over the next decade.
Addressing that market opportunity, IBM and Research In Motion (RIM) will
bring new advanced social software features to BlackBerry smartphone
business users worldwide. The new features will help BlackBerry
smartphone users find expertise, form teams, share information and stay
in touch in real-time, making them more effective and productive. They
will also bring mobile business users far beyond e-mail to live expertise
and collective intelligence.

    Lotusphere attendees will get a sneak preview and see demonstrations of
new capabilities for BlackBerry smartphones which will be available later
this year. They include access to open document format-based IBM Lotus

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Jan 19 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
LOTUSPHERE -- IBM Lotus users can communicate and collaborate more
efficiently by accessing a broad range of Avaya Unified Communications
capabilities from within their Lotus software, Avaya announced today. The
seamless integration between the unified communications applications of
both Avaya and IBM Lotus streamlines and enhances the user experience to
make workers more productive, and helps companies reduce costs and
management requirements.

    Leveraging the integration between Avaya products and IBM Lotus Sametime
software, users can easily access and manage Avaya Unified Communications
calling and conferencing capabilities directly from their Lotus desktop.
New, integrated telephony presence capabilities allow Lotus users to see
whether colleagues are available for a phone conversation and simply click
on the name to either call directly, elevate an IM to a live phone
conversation, or to add him or her into an ongoing conference. Real-time
collaboration is instantly easier when users know when immediate contact
is possible and can do so in a simple, single step.

    Specifically for Lotus Sametime web conferencing users, integration with
Avaya Meeting Exchange provides additional management capabilities through
a single unified interface for both audio and web conferencing. For
example, in addition to the ability to click-to-conference multiple
parties from Lotus Notes or Sametime, users can see who's joined the call
and who's speaking, mute noisy lines or disconnect participants. The
integrated solution provides fast return on investment by reducing
per-use or recurring fees from outsourced audio or Web conferencing
services.

    Lotus Notes users can also manage voice messages along with email,
calendar, tasks and more using Avaya Modular Messaging and their choice of
telephone for speech access, a multimedia PC or web interface from any
Internet connection. For example, a user can access emails over their
phone or mobile device via automated text to speech conversion and
subsequently reply to the email with an attached voice message. They can
also review and schedule meetings, request the system to read specific
emails and more using the power of their voice.

    Demonstrations of the seamless integration between Avaya Unified
Communications and IBM Lotus applications can be seen live this week in
Booth 309-311 at IBM Lotusphere, being held at the Walt Disney World
Dolphin Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla.

&lt;p&gt;X1 Technologies to Demonstrate New Support for IBM Lotus Notes and Domino
Archived Content in Symantec Enterprise Vault at Lotusphere 2009, Booth #606
ORLANDO, Fla.--(Business Wire)--
X1 Technologies, Inc., an innovator in enterprise search solutions and
information worker productivity tools for the desktop, today announced expanded
support for IBM Lotus Notes and Domino with the release of the X1 Content
Connector V1.3 for Symantec Enterprise Vault. X1 will demonstrate their search
solution for IBM Lotus Notes and Domino at Lotusphere 2009, in Orlando, Florida,
January 18-22, booth #606. 

The new Content Connector for Symantec Enterprise Vault allows users to search,
preview and act upon archived Lotus Notes and Domino email, contacts and email
attachments. X1 will also demonstrate their X1 Professional Client that allows
Lotus Notes and Domino users to easily search email and email attachments
residing in multiple databases from a single view. 

By adding Lotus Notes and Domino support to the Content Connector for Symantec
Enterprise Vault, customers have a 360 degree view of their email and can
perform unified searches across active and archived email and email attachments
from a single interface. The X1 Content Connector V1.3 for Symantec Enterprise
Vault is available immediately for purchase or 30 day trial evaluation. 

"We use the X1 Content Connector for Symantec Enterprise Vault to search all of
our email, both online and vaulted, in a quick and efficient manner," said Bryan
Kolak, Sr. Systems Administrator, Eagle Test Systems, Inc. "You cannot put a
dollar amount on how much time X1 has saved us in both increased efficiencies
and time; we are pleased to see additional improvements to the X1 Content
Connector for Symantec Enterprise Vault." 

Key features of the new Lotus Notes and Domino support in the Content Connector
for Symantec Enterprise Vault include the ability to perform keyword, phrase and
range searches along with Boolean searches on archived emails, contacts and
email attachments. Full fidelity preview allows users to preview the search
results without recalling the email or accessing the native application of the
attachment. Post search actions provide further productivity by allowing users
to perform common actions such as "Reply, Reply to All, Forward, Open, Send,
Print, Copy to Folder and Zip" from the same interface they performed the
search. X1 is both an IBM Business Partner and Symantec Technology Enabled
Partner. 

"IDC considers X1 a prime productivity tool for the information worker," said
Sue Feldman, IDC's VP for Search and Discovery Technologies. "X1's design
eliminates the wasted time of clicking through search results, opening and
closing one document after another. Pulling together documents, attachments, and
email in one easy to use interface cuts down on time spent looking so that
workers can start doing." 

"Given the success of our X1 Professional Client in Lotus Notes and Domino
environments, we were anxious to increase our breadth of Lotus Notes and Domino
support with the new Content Connector for Symantec Enterprise Vault," said John
Waller, President and COO X1 Technologies. "Some of our largest enterprise
customers, representing tens of thousands of Lotus Notes and Domino seats, are
utilizing X1 search to increase knowledge worker productivity and to provide
fast and cost effective enterprise search." 

"IBM Lotus Notes and Domino is an important focus for Symantec Enterprise Vault,
and X1`s search support of Lotus Notes and Domino content within the Enterprise
Vault archive provides customers an enterprise search solution that encompasses
both active and archived content," said Simon Jelley, Senior Director,
Enterprise Vault Product Management, Symantec.

&lt;p&gt;Upgrades Include Microsoft Project Interface and Ability to Author Complete
PowerPoint Slideshows
SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
SmartDraw.com, maker of SmartDraw, the software that helps you work smarter by
communicating visually, today announced SmartDraw 2009.5, a major new release of
its popular software. SmartDraw 2009.5 includes new features and sought-after
business enhancements that allow users to work smarter with the Microsoft
applications they use everyday. 

New SmartDraw 2009.5 features and enhancements include: 

Complete PowerPoint Slideshow Animation-SmartDraw 2009.5`s Crown Jewel

SmartDraw 2009.5 allows users to plan, design, and then build a PowerPoint
presentation in a faster, easier, and more intelligent way. With SmartDraw
2009.5, users create their entire presentation in SmartDraw`s storyboard mode,
using thousands of smart templates, images, and special effects. This allows
them to see their entire presentation at-a-glance before exporting it into
PowerPoint. When finished, SmartDraw 2009.5 users simply click on the PowerPoint
icon to produce their entire slideshow, where all images, animation and text are
exported to PowerPoint as native PowerPoint objects, allowing the user to make
further changes if they desire. The end result is a cohesive, compelling and
stunning presentation that is accomplished in far less time. 

Lightning Fast Microsoft Project Interoperability

Business users can now plan and manage any sized project with ease. SmartDraw
2009.5 enables any user to take the tasks, sub-tasks, and dependencies from a
smaller SmartDraw-created Gantt chart and export it directly into a larger MS
Project chart. In addition, rather than being saddled with cumbersome MS Project
charts that are difficult to manipulate, SmartDraw 2009.5 users can now import
MS Project charts quickly and easily into SmartDraw 2009.5, manipulate them,
export them, and share them with others using just a few clicks. 

Integrating Excel Spreadsheets Has Never Been Easier

SmartDraw 2009.5 allows users to directly import and manipulate MS Excel
spreadsheets inside of SmartDraw, which means charts and graphs can be created
and changed without exiting the SmartDraw file. Further MS Excel integration
features include the ability to show and hide tables, as well as group labels
(such as months) in chart elements-perfect for quarterly reports. 

SmartDraw 2009.5 is provided as a FREE upgrade to existing SmartDraw 2009 users.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc said today it has received a complete response letter from the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) asking for additional information on the
company`s application for lasofoxifene. The investigational compound is
currently under review for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women
at increased risk of fracture. 

Pfizer is reviewing the letter and will work with FDA to determine the
appropriate next steps regarding the company`s application. 

Pfizer submitted the current application for lasofoxifene on December 18, 2007.
On September 8, 2008, an FDA scientific advisory panel voted 9-3 (with one
abstention) that there is a population of postmenopausal women with osteoporosis
in which the benefits of lasofoxifene likely outweigh the risks. FDA is not
required to follow the advice of the panel. 

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European
Medicines Agency issued a positive opinion on December 18, 2008, recommending
marketing authorization for lasofoxifene. The CHMP`s opinion will be reviewed by
the European Commission, which has authority to approve medicines for the
European Union. 

About Lasofoxifene

Lasofoxifene is a selective estrogen receptor modulator, or SERM, in the same
chemical class as raloxifene. With its high affinity for estrogen receptors,
lasofoxifene acts as an agonist in bone and as an antagonist in the breast.
Thus, it modulates the estrogen receptor in a different manner than estrogen,
which accounts for the effects of lasofoxifene observed in multiple target
tissues. 

DISCLOSURE NOTICE: The information contained in this release is as of January
16, 2009. Pfizer assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements
contained in this release as the result of new information or future events or
developments.

This release contains forward-looking information that involves substantial
risks and uncertainties regarding a product candidate that is under review by
the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Commission
(EC) . Such risks and uncertainties include, among other things, whether and
when the FDA and the EC will approve the product candidate, their decisions
regarding labeling and other matters that could affect its availability or
commercial potential, as well as competitive developments.

A further list and description of risks and uncertainties can be found in
Pfizer`s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2007
and in its reports on Form 10-Q and Form 8-K.

 (Adds investor comment, details on results)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jim Finkle&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, Jan 20 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) issued a 2009 profit
outlook that blew past Wall Street expectations, underscoring
the ability of the world's top technology services firm to
weather the global downturn and boosting its shares 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fourth-quarter earnings of International Business
Machines Corp also trumped analysts' expectations on Tuesday,
presenting a rare bright spot for the tech industry, which has
been hit by profit warnings and sweeping job cuts as companies
and consumers reduce spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although IBM's fourth-quarter revenue came in a little shy
of expectations, falling 6.4 percent from a year ago, the
company also managed to cut costs by 3-4 percent. A lower tax
rate also helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IBM clearly is watching their expenses closely," said Andy
Miedler, an analyst at Edward Jones who expects revenue to drop
in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IBM can't control its revenue in this environment so
they're focusing on cost control, Miedler said"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano said IBM was "ahead of
pace" on a plan to boost earnings to $10 to $11 per share by
2010. That was more optimistic than its last assessment in
October, when the firm said only it was on track toward meeting
that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The upbeat projections contrasted with more somber comments
from other industry giants that have announced layoffs and
warned this year's business outlook was grim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; No. 1 corporate storage equipment maker EMC Corp (EMC.N) is
shedding 2,400 jobs, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc
(AMD.N) is cutting 1,100 workers and high-end server maker Sun
Microsystems Inc JAVA.O plans to cut up to 6,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While IBM is cutting jobs that add to overhead, it is
hiring more consultants, sales staff and other workers that
directly bring in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MARGIN EXPANSION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM -- which competes with the likes of Hewlett-Packard Co
(HPQ.N), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Oracle Corp ORCL.O  --
posted a gross profit margin of 47.9 percent, up 3 percentage
points from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said the firm will
keep improving margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will continue our focus on structural changes that
reduce our spending levels and improve productivity in 2009,"
Loughridge said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those efforts include standardizing services products so
they are less costly to deliver to IBM's customers, which are
predominantly among the world's biggest corporations. The
company will also shift staff from headquarters to local
offices where they can directly work with clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has moved to a more profitable revenue mix since 2000,
dumping commodity hardware units that made personal computers,
printers and PC hard drives. At the same time, it spent about
$20 billion on acquisitions of software makers and IT services
firms, which tend to do better in tough economic times because
they have highly predictable sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset
Management, said his firm was buying IBM shares after the
results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "IBM has enjoyed certain attributes that other tech stocks
don't enjoy," he said. "They have recurring revenue streams
that also translate into profitability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 2009 FORECAST BEATS ESTIMATES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM, the world's biggest maker of mainframe computers and
No. 2 software maker, predicted 2009 earnings of least $9.20 a
share, trouncing a consensus of $8.77, according to Reuters
Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Armonk, New York company said net income rose 12
percent to $4.43 billion, or $3.28 per share, in the fourth
quarter ended Dec. 31, from $3.95 billion, or $2.80 per share,
a year earlier. That easily beat the average analyst forecast
of $3.03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue fell 6.4 percent to $27.0 billion, but turnover in
its software segment climbed 3 percent to $6.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It signed services contracts totaling $17.2 billion, at
actual rates, a decrease of 5 percent. But its backlog of
services bookings rose to a currency-adjusted $117 billion at
the end of December, up $3 billion from the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares climbed to 85.32 in after-hours trade from a
regular close of $81.98 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock has dropped about 16 percent over the past year,
less than half the 36 percent drop in the Nasdaq Composite
Index .IXIC. Shares of Microsoft are down about 41 percent,
while Hewlett-Packard's stock has fallen 22 percent over the
same period.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - IBM, the biggest technology services company, posted a quarterly profit and full-year outlook that topped Wall Street expectations, sending its shares up 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;COMMENTARY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL JAMES, SENIOR TRADER AT REGIONAL INVESTMENT BANK WEDBUSH MORGAN IN LOS ANGELES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The bar was set pretty low going into the earnings given what has been going on in the market overall in the last two weeks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is certainly a welcome positive; we haven't had too much positive news over the course of the last week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd be surprised if the stock gives back that much -- if any -- of the gains we are seeing after hours."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM by itself should have a positive effect on the overall market, and technology specifically. But the developments among financials have been playing a much greater part in the market sentiment. So I wouldn't want to make too big a case about IBM's impact on the market tomorrow without knowing what else might happen world wide between now and tomorrow's market open."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANDY MIEDLER, ANALYST, EDWARD JONES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Overall I think these were good results given this tough environment. IBM clearly is watching their expenses closely which we believe is very important in the environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it comes down to IBM can't control its revenue in this environment so they're focusing on cost control which is what you'd hope for."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it all comes down to management teams that get it. IBM clearly has a management team that over the long term has proven they can manage this business in good and bad economic times."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHRIS WHITMORE, ANALYST, DEUTSCHE BANK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There has been pretty solid execution on the profitability and margin line. People are reacting positively to both the bookings number and the earnings guidance."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"$17 billion plus in bookings is well above anybody's expectations. Also the growth in their services backlog -- which was up $3 billion quarter on quarter to $117 billion. And you have earnings guidance that was better than most people on the Street were expecting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In a pretty tough environment this shows that IBM is executing quite well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This gives us visibility into this year, which is something the market is lacking right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ZACH ROSENSTOCK, ANALYST, WAYNE HUMMER WEALTH MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think everybody realized it's going to be a difficult revenue environment with currency and other things turning against them, but they showed solid cost control and gross margins were up 300 basis points year over year. These are certainly good things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On guidance:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's 45 cents ahead of what consensus had expected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My thinking would be is they're doing something right. They've created a company that everybody knows will be around. And you see the scandal with Satyam and other things coming up, with smaller companies, who knows where they'll be in a year in these uncertain economic times. They have proven they can perform as expected and provide a solid service for customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it should continue to be a core holding in someone's portfolios."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KIM CAUGHEY, SENIOR ANALYST, PITTSBURGH-BASED FORT PITT CAPITAL GROUP, WHICH HOLDS IBM SHARES IN ITS $800 MILLION PORTFOLIO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the results are pretty good. I always first go to the margins and they have improved."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a real testament to the CFO, who said at analyst day that they wanted to take out another $1 billion in costs. They've been trying to do this for several years, so analysts were very skeptical. But they did it. Good for them. Good for shareholders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KEITH WIRTZ, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, FIFTH THIRD ASSET MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market is exhaling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the market has been holding its breath to see if it would be close... We're feeling pretty good about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On earnings outlook for 2009:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That seems high. Our numbers are around the lower 8's. We've been pulling ours down because of the uncertain environment of economic conditions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM has enjoyed certain attributes that other tech stocks don't enjoy. They have recurring revenue streams that also translate into profitability... That's great for IBM and that's one of the reasons why, in today's uncertain environment, IBM's a very attractive name to hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're buying the stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER MISEK, ANALYST, CANACCORD ADAMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The guidance of $9.20 is awesome... looks like their outsourcing, packaging, cost containment strategy is working. They executed really well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As sales seem to be getting hit they're pulling cost containment and cost reduction levers all over the place. I still expect a major restructuring."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's really tough to read this more broadly into the tech sector...IBM has done a really good job of positioning itself as a cost containment strategy. It does provide a data point but I'd like to see what Microsoft, Intel and a bunch of the others do. My suspicion is that we'll see that the global consumer is in a severe recessionary state and that enterprises are only just entering that state."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gabriel Madway in San Francisco, Jim Finkle in Boston, and Ritsuko Ando and Rodrigo Campos in New York, compiled by Tiffany Wu)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is expected to post a quarterly profit that misses its own target and announce thousands of job cuts this week as the global economic slump hurts even the technology industry's biggest players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the leading software maker reports fiscal second quarter results on Thursday, investors are likely to press for comments on its outlook and on Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), whose search business has been the object of Microsoft's desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report comes against a backdrop of a wounded global economy that has stifled demand for everything from personal computers to business software and video games, all markets in which Microsoft is a significant player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All eyes are on the forecast," said Jefferies  Co analyst Katherine Egbert. "Expectations for the guidance are pretty low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average put Microsoft's profit at 49 cents a share for the quarter ended December 31, which includes a U.S. holiday shopping season that has been called the worst in at least four decades. The Redmond, Washington-based company had forecast a per-share profit of 51 cents to 53 cents for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is looking for quarterly revenue of $17.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates, also short of Microsoft's own target of $17.3 billion to $17.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egbert says she expects Microsoft to report sales of its Windows software for PCs and laptops to drop 3 percent from a year earlier, making it the toughest quarter in eight years. She blames the shortfall on weak consumer sales, noting that businesses have yet to cut back as much as retail shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's expectations for Microsoft's performance for its fiscal year ending in June 2009 have declined since it last reported results three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst forecasts for full-year net income have dropped 10 percent to $17.77 billion, while revenue projections are down 4.4 percent at $63.68 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POSSIBLE JOB CUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an eye on reducing costs, Microsoft is widely expected to announce that it will cut jobs, following similar moves by other tech firms, including ATT Inc (T.N), Dell Inc DELL.O, Motorola Inc MOT.N and Advance Micro Devices Inc (AMD.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Checks indicate that Microsoft is likely to engage in headcount reductions to the tune of 6,000 to 8,000 employees or 6 percent to 8 percent of its 95,000 workforce," said McAdams Wright Ragen analyst Sid Parakh. "Our checks also revealed some speculation over the potential for a second round of cuts in some groups sometime later in the year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other analysts suggest the cost reductions may occur in the next few weeks and could also include more targeted cutbacks and attrition, rather than the big number of layoffs that some have speculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has declined to comment on any likelihood of job cuts. Its shares have dropped 41 percent over the past year, while shares in another technology bellwether, IBM (IBM.N), have lost 16 percent. The SP 500 Index .SPX has dropped 38 percent during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts are also expected to pepper Chief Executive Steve Ballmer with questions about the status of the company's relationship with Yahoo, now that the Internet company has named Diane Bartz as its new CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz told employees earlier this week that she had a phone conversation with Ballmer, who has repeatedly said he remains interested in pursuing a search partnership with Yahoo but does not intend to renew an offer for the whole company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made a bid for Yahoo last year, but walked away after they disagreed on price. Investors have been skeptical about whether the software company can win online advertising revenue away from Google (GOOG.O) and Yahoo, which are both stronger than Microsoft in the Internet search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - U.S. computer firm T3 Technologies Inc said on Tuesday it had filed a competition complaint with the European Commission accusing IBM of abusing its power in the mainframe computer industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;T3 accused International Business Machines Corp of preventing sales of competing mainframe hardware products by tying the sale of its operating system to its mainframe hardware, and of withholding patent licenses, Steven Friedman, president of the privately held Florida-based company, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for IBM said the firm has not seen details of the complaint, but added that the company believed it is not violating any regulations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM is confident that it is no violation of competition laws for IBM to rightfully seek to prevent another company from violating IBM's intellectual property rights," said spokesman Tim Breuer. "IBM has spent great time and expense developing its technology and will defend its intellectual property rights vigorously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mainframes are computers used mainly by large organizations for critical applications -- typically bulk data processing such as census, industry and consumer statistics, and financial transaction processing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From 1992 until 2002, T3 said it sold IBM mainframes, but later produced two alternative mainframe product lines at lower cost, which competed with IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman said from October 2006, IBM refused to grant licenses to customers who bought T3 mainframes, rendering them useless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM simply refused to license any software to any other hardware except their own -- virtually putting us out of business," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you own a mainframe computer today, there's only one company you can go to, and that is IBM," said Friedman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Friedman said IBM is abusing its monopoly and now controls one hundred percent of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Imagine if Microsoft decided they were going to build hardware and they told the world ... you can only run Windows, we are not going to license Windows to Dell, HP or any other ... it is exactly what IBM has done to us," Friedman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said T3, which made about $20 million a year in turnover before 2006 and had over 600 clients in 28 different countries, 200 of them in 15 EU members states, had to layoff about 75 percent of its staff after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint asked the European Commission, the competition watchdog of the 27-nation European Union, to bring another investigation against IBM following a similar complaint by Platform Solutions Inc in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That complaint was dropped when IBM, the world's largest technology services company, acquired Platform Solutions in July 2008. However, the Commission said it was still pursuing that investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We did take the initiative and said we would look into the mainframe sector and that inquiry is still going on," an official at the Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission's provisions against abuse of dominance was central to its landmark court victory over Microsoft in September 2007 before a European Union court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The complaint comes a week after Brussels used the same principle to charge Microsoft with anti-competitive behavior, for bundling its browser in its operating software, and was also used for a major settlement against IBM in the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional by Jim Finkle in Boston, Adrian Croft in London; editing by Simon Jessop, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds comment from IBM)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Bate Felix and Sarah Luehrs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Jan 20 (Reuters) - U.S. computer firm T3

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE Jan 20 (Reuters) - Analysts expect the battered
stock of Walter Industries Inc (WLT.N) to regain lost ground,
as the company repositions itself as an energy firm and exits
its loss-ridden homebuilding business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company moved a step closer this month to phasing out
its homebuilding unit and plans to spin off its financing unit
-- JWH Holding Company LLC -- in early 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Walter's homebuilding and financing businesses have been
badly hit by the housing downturn and the mortgage crisis,
putting pressure on the company's stock, which has dropped more
than 80 percent since its year-high levels in June 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The spin off probably gives Walter the opportunity to get
a pure coal-type valuation, which I think would be a positive,"
analyst James Rollyson of Raymond James said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts, however, warned that the going might not be that
easy for the company as a deteriorating global steel market has
hurt demand for inputs such as iron ore and metallurgical coal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter primarily supplies coking, or metallurgical coal,
which is used to make steel. Since September 2008, U.S. steel
output has plunged about 50 percent to its lowest point since
the 1980s, largely because of a steep decline in construction
and auto production activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steel buyers have been withdrawing orders because of the
frozen credit markets and the slumping U.S., European and
Chinese economies. However, analyst Rollyson expects
metallurgical coal demand to improve in 2010 as credit markets
free up and stimulus plans across several countries start
kicking in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Luther Lu of Friedman, Billings Ramsey  Co said:
"Walter is as pure of a met coal player as you can get and
because of that its shareholders will be very sensitive to the
developments in the steel market." He has a "market perform"
rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHEAPER THAN PEERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Raymond James' Rollyson, who has a "strong buy" rating on
the stock, said Walter as a whole looks pretty cheap compared
to its peers. The company's shares trade at a multiple of 4.41
times forward earnings, compared with a multiple of 15.32 for
the coal and consumable fuels sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter competes with coal companies such as Alfa Natural
Resources (ANR.N), Patriot Coal PCX.N and Massey Energy
MEE.N. The Tampa, Florida-based company has been beating
market estimates for the last two quarters due mainly to
strength in its core natural resources unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With the divestiture of the loss-making units now certain,
the stock has pared some of its losses to gain 16 percent this
year. Walter shares are now trading at $19.30 on the New York
Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Brean Murray Carret  Co analyst Michael Gaugler said he
regards Walter shares as undervalued at current levels.
Gaugler, who has kept his "buy" rating on the stock, said the
company's low-cost structure leaves it well positioned relative
to its peers to ride out the current weakened pricing
environment. "We recommend the shares for patient investors
with a 12 month to 18 month investment time horizon," Gaugler
said.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
After the market closes on Thursday, Jan. 22, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is
scheduled to slip into the earnings confessional to release its fiscal
second-quarter performance. Currently, analysts are expecting the world's
leading software developer to report a profit of 49 cents per share, a penny shy
of last year's results. Historically, MSFT has bested Wall Street's views in 3
of the prior 4 reporting periods, with an average upside surprise of 3.88%. 

Heading into the report, options traders have piled into put positions, as the
stock's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio (SOIR) of 0.79 ranks above 89%
of all those taken during the past year. What's more, the International
Securities Exchange (ISE) and Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) 10-day
put/call ratio is higher than 80% of all those taken during the prior 52 weeks,
underscoring this preference for bearish bets.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds European Commission reaction)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Huw Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Jan 20 (Reuters) - Visa Europe expects to reach a
deal with European Union competition authorities on its
cross-border transaction fees this year, the payment card
company said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Retailers are angry at having to pay the so-called
interchange fee on each cross-border credit card transaction and
complained to the EU's executive European Commission, saying the
fee was a tax on consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes has already forced
rival MasterCard to reform its interchange fee, a move the
payment company is challenging in the bloc's top court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa Europe has been negotiating with Kroes over its
cross-border interchange fees on credit cards since the
MasterCard decision at the end of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We want to agree a model and level of interchange that can
be applied consistently across Europe," Visa Europe's CEO Peter
Ayliffe told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ayliffe said dialogue with Kroes was "very constructive" and
he expected a deal to be concluded "as soon as possible" this
year. Visa's interchange fee of 0.7 percent remains for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Commission said it had an on-going antitrust
case against Visa and could not prejudge the outcome of that
investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If an infringement of the antitrust rules were found, a
settlement decision would be one possible outcome, as would be
fines and/or a requirement to change business practices," a
Commission spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dispute has cast a shadow over a wider project to create
a single euro payment area (SEPA) that aims to allow consumers
to use their credit and debit cards to make payments in euros
anywhere in the 27-nation bloc from a single bank account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But banks have been holding back from launching new pan-EU
card schemes to rival Visa Europe and MasterCard, saying the
dispute over interchange fees makes it hard to determine the
right business model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Commission sought to ease concerns by saying an
interchange fee could be introduced for an interim period and
that schemes don't necessarily have to cover all EU states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Payments Council (EPC), made up of 4,000 or so
banks that are investing in SEPA infrastructure, said the
planned launch of cross-border direct debits may not go ahead in
November as the Commission wants unless there is clarity on
fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EPC said the Commission appeared to have accepted a
proposal for an 8.8 euro cent fee on cross-border direct debits
for two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, EPC Chairman Gerard Hartsink said clarity was
needed on whether the 8.8 euro cents fee is acceptable by all
national competition watchdogs and on what happens after two
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will at the latest on 31 March take a position if the
planned launch date of November 2009 can be maintained or if it
has to be postponed because of the lack of clarity of the public
sector at European and national level," Hartsink said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa Europe's Ayliffe was "absolutely staggered" the EU
appeared to be backtracking on the original broad vision of SEPA
but not insisting that all new SEPA cards can work anywhere in
the EU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They had it right first time. They should go back to how to
deliver the original vision," Ayliffe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa Europe said expenditure using its 361 million credit
and debit cards rose 10.3 percent in 2008 to 883 billion euros.
One euro in every nine spent in Europe is on a Visa card though
two-thirds of payments are still in cash.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded fashion company
Polo Ralph Lauren Corp (RL.N) to "sell" from "neutral," as it
saw risk to the company's earnings from a shift in customer
spending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Analyst Adrianne Shapira said several "aspirational" brands
and retailers, including Nordstrom Inc (JWN.N), Tiffany  Co
(TIF.N), Coach Inc (COH.N) and Estee Lauder Cos Inc (EL.N),
have seen challenging sales that has prompted negative earnings
preannouncements, leading to double-digit drop in their stock
prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A noticeable exception to this aspirational peer group has
been Ralph Lauren," she said, adding that the company had
bucked the trend with impressive inventory and expense
management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Shapira said she expects to see signs of weakened
fundamentals across the company's wholesale, retail and its

&lt;p&gt;Jan 20 (Reuters) - Fox-Pitt Kelton said JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) will continue to be a market-share beneficiary during
and after this financial crisis, but cut its profit estimates
for the bank as it expects higher credit costs and reserve
builds until the first half of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage lowered its earnings estimate for the company
for 2009 to $2.04 a share from $2.47 a share, and to $3.14 a
share from $3.61 a share for 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Despite these cuts, we still see JPMorgan as a relatively
better choice for investors that want some exposure in large
U.S. banks and/or capital markets," analyst David Trone said in
a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank by assets, is
"obviously not immune to the deteriorating credit environment",
but its higher reserve build and higher charge-offs in 2009 are
likely to be mitigated by higher core revenue and lower
expenses, Trone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase posted a 76 percent fall in its
fourth-quarter profit last week as it wrote down bad loans,
signaling that even the bank that has avoided the worst of the
credit crunch is struggling with the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's difficulties reflect the broader trouble in the
U.S. banking sector, which has received trillions of dollars of
government support through capital injections, debt guarantees
and other measures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the next 18 months will be far from easy on the
company, its balance sheet is strong enough to survive the
crisis, said the analyst, who maintained his "outperform"
rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company fell 6 percent to $21.40 in trading
before the bell. They closed at $22.82 Friday on the New York
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Motorola Inc
MOT.N to "conviction buy" from "neutral," saying significant
cost cuts should narrow losses in Motorola's mobile devices
division.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said the current stock price implies a
negative value of almost $5 billion to the company's mobile
services division, which it called "overstated".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Even if Motorola were to shut down its Mobile Devices
division in a worst-case scenario, we estimate that would cost
around $1.1 billion," analyst Simona Jankowski said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which expects handsets division to approach
breakeven in 2010, said it would not be surprised to see more
headcount reductions this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs expects Motorola to provide a "very weak"
first-quarter outlook in February, but said it expects the
forecast will remove the overhang on the stock that has
prevented the market from taking a longer-term view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman raised its price target on the stock to $7 from
$4.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Motorola shares closed at $4.54 Friday on New York Stock
Exchange.

documents. EditLive! addresses this need with a Word-like authoring
experience. It also offers powerful capabilities for image editing, track
changes, table editing and accessibility checking.

    "EditLive! is a great fit with Lotus Quickr because it makes it even

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

America`s New Stimulus Package

Overall, my biggest question is: "Is it enough?" This economy is falling into a
very deep hole, with both the consumer and business investment slowing very
sharply. 

World trade is in the process of collapsing, so it is unrealistic to expect an
export boom to fill the gap. Yes, imports are falling, but it appears to be more
a case of falling consumer demand rather than lots of import substitution. 

Government stimulus spending is really the only way to try and stabilize the
economy. The spending is over two years, so $412.5 billion per year. That works
out to be about 2.5% of GDP. 

The economy is most likely going to be running at least 8% below its potential.
As big as the numbers sound, this program is only likely to cushion the blow and
slow the decline, not result in a fully healthy economy. 

However, there do appear to be some clear potential winners here (or at least
relative to what they would be going through without this package). The energy
projects would be very good for electrical firms like Emerson Electric (NYSE:
EMR) and General Electric (NYSE: GE), and the Infrastructure projects will help
engineering and construction firms like Jacobs Engineering (NYSE: JEC) and
Chicago Bridge &amp; Iron (NYSE: CBI) along with heavy equipment firms like
Caterpillar (NYSE: CAT).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Stocks jumped on Wednesday, rebounding from a two-month low, after a surprisingly healthy earnings report from IBM fueled optimism that technology may fare better than other sectors during the recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Financial stocks outperformed as well on the strength of earnings surprises from Northern Trust (NTRS.O) and PNC Financial Services (PNC.N), helping the group reclaim some of Tuesday's massive losses that dropped the financial sector to a 14-year low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Technology shares may get a boost for a second straight session after Apple (AAPL.O) reported quarterly profit that beat Wall Street estimates after the bell and gave an outlook for its second quarter. Apple's stock rose 10 percent to $90.85 in extended trade, helping to lift stock futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel (INTC.O) shares rose 1 percent to $13.40 in extended trade after the chip maker said that it would close sites in Asia and scale back operations in the United States in a restructuring that could affect up to 6,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the regular session, the market shrugged off a brief sell-off after Treasury Secretary nominee Timothy Geithner faced tough questioning at his confirmation hearing before a Senate committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The day after earnings results from State Street alarmed investors about losses in one of the safest parts of banking, earnings from rival Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O) on Wednesday soothed investor concerns after its net income more than doubled. The financial services company's shares shot up nearly 31 percent to $57.51.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) also projected lower loan losses from its purchase of National City Corp, sending its shares soaring 37 percent to $30.16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are excited because financials are valued so low at this point. It's the mentality that they can't get any lower, but they've proven time and time again that they can," said Jocelynn Drake, market analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 279.01 points, or 3.51 percent, to 8,228.10. The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX rose 35.02 points, or 4.35 percent, to 840.24. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 66.21 points, or 4.60 percent, to 1,507.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The rise marked the Dow's largest point and percentage gain since December 16, 2008, but the index remains down 6.3 percent month-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM AND JPMORGAN BOOST THE DOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) provided the biggest lift to the Dow, jumping nearly 12 percent to $91.42 after the world's top technology services company posted a quarterly profit and a 2009 profit outlook that surpassed Wall Street's expectations. That burst of strength from IBM led&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;investors to believe the Dow component can weather the global economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple led the Nasdaq higher, ahead of its quarterly earnings report after the closing bell, and in spite of a report that U.S. regulators were examining the company's disclosures about CEO Steve Jobs' health. Apple's stock closed on Nasdaq at $82.83, up 5.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hearings on Geithner's appointment attracted the market's attention for much of the day as he is seen as President Barack Obama's point man in battling the economic crisis.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The chief executives of Bank of America Corp and JPMorgan Chase  Co bought some of their companies' stock in the last week, a sign of confidence as the banking sector struggles with soaring credit losses and a deep recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kenneth Lewis, Bank of America's chief executive, spent about $1.2 million on Tuesday to buy 200,000 common shares, four days after the largest U.S. bank posted its first quarterly loss in 17 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon spent about $11.5 million on Friday to buy 500,000 shares, a day after the second-largest U.S. bank said fourth-quarter profit fell 76 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The purchases were disclosed in separate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Lewis' purchase was disclosed more than an hour before U.S. stock markets closed, triggering a broad rally in bank shares. Major U.S. bank indexes had fallen to 14-year lows on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have executives trying to shore up shareholder confidence," said Jay Lorsch, a professor at Harvard Business School. "I would expect them to believe shareholders will interpret the purchases as a sign of long-term confidence, as investors worry about the state of the banking sector."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America spokesman Scott Silvestri and JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti declined to comment. Five Bank of America directors also bought new shares, including lead independent director O. Temple Sloan, SEC filings show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis paid between $5.98 and $6.06 per share, boosting his direct stake by 16 percent to 1,460,997 common shares, worth $9.76 million based on Wednesday's closing price. He also indirectly controls 542,235 bank shares through various trusts, and last November 4 bought 86,000 preferred shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon paid $22.93 for each of his shares, boosting his direct ownership stake by 16 percent to 3,545,503 common shares, worth $80.2 million as of Wednesday's close. He also indirectly controls 1,570,550 shares in various trusts, a retirement plan and through his wife.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is great news when officers and directors are buying stock because it indicates they believe it is worth putting money in the business," said Paul Lapides, director of the corporate governance center at Kennesaw State University in Kennesaw, Georgia. "In both cases, $1 million or more is significant. Executives don't like to lose money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lapides said he owns small amounts of both Bank of America and Citigroup shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lewis' investment also came after Bank of America took $20 billion from the government's Troubled Asset Relief Program to help it absorb Merrill Lynch  Co, which it bought on Jan 1. The government will share in losses on $118 billion of debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America is based in Charlotte, North Carolina, and JPMorgan in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America shares closed up $1.58, or 31 percent, at $6.68 on Wednesday, while JPMorgan shares rose $4.54, or 25.1 percent, to $22.63. Both banks' shares recouped much of their losses a day earlier. The Standard  Poor's Financials Index rose 14.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds context on Dow's gain, plus Apple, Intel and eBay news
after the bell)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on
Wednesday, rebounding from a two-month low, after a
surprisingly healthy earnings report from IBM fueled optimism
that technology may fare better than other sectors during the
recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial stocks outperformed as well on the strength of
earnings surprises from Northern Trust (NTRS.O) and PNC
Financial Services (PNC.N), helping the group reclaim some of
Tuesday's massive losses that dropped the financial sector to
a 14-year low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Technology shares may get a boost for a second straight
session after Apple (AAPL.O) reported quarterly profit that
beat Wall Street estimates after the bell and gave an outlook
for its second quarter. For details, see [ID:nN21498027].
Apple's stock rose 10 percent to $90.85 in extended trade,
helping to lift stock futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel (INTC.O) shares rose 1 percent to $13.40 in extended
trade after the chip maker said that it would close sites in
Asia and scale back operations in the United States in a
restructuring that could affect up to 6,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the regular session, the market shrugged off a
brief sell-off after Treasury Secretary nominee Timothy
Geithner faced tough questioning at his confirmation hearing
before a Senate committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The day after earnings results from State Street alarmed
investors about losses in one of the safest parts of banking,
earnings from rival Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O) on Wednesday
soothed investor concerns after its net income more than
doubled. The financial services company's shares shot up
nearly 31 percent to $57.51. [ID:nN21470235]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) also projected
lower loan losses from its purchase of National City Corp,
sending its shares soaring 37 percent to
$30.16.[ID:nN21483128]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are excited because financials are valued so low
at this point. It's the mentality that they can't get any
lower, but they've proven time and time again that they can,"
said Jocelynn Drake, market analyst at Schaeffer's Investment
Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 279.01
points, or 3.51 percent, to 8,228.10. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX rose 35.02 points, or 4.35 percent, to
840.24. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 66.21
points, or 4.60 percent, to 1,507.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rise marked the Dow's largest point and percentage
gain since Dec. 16, 2008, but the index remains down 6.3
percent month-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM AND JPMORGAN BOOST THE DOW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) provided the
biggest lift to the Dow, jumping nearly 12 percent to $91.42
after the world's top technology services company posted a
quarterly profit and a 2009 profit outlook that surpassed Wall
Street's expectations. That burst of strength from IBM led
 investors to believe the Dow component can weather the global
economic downturn.  [ID:nN20268352].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple led the Nasdaq higher, ahead of its quarterly
earnings report after the closing bell, and in spite of a
report that U.S. regulators were examining the company's
disclosures about CEO Steve Jobs' health. Apple's stock closed
on Nasdaq at $82.83, up 5.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hearings on Geithner's appointment attracted the market's
attention for much of the day as he is seen as President
Barack Obama's point man in battling the economic crisis. As
the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York since
2003, Geithner is expected to hit the ground running if
confirmed as Treasury secretary. The Senate Finance Committee
is scheduled to vote on Geithner's nomination on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A day after his historic inauguration, Obama met with his
economic advisers, who are working with the Democratic-led
Congress on an $825 billion fiscal stimulus package.
[ID:nN20421893].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financial sector drove gains in the SP 500 following
Tuesday's sharp sell-off, which was ignited by deepening fears
of insolvency among banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broad KBW index of bank stocks .BKX and the SP
financials index .GSPF both jumped 14.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America (BAC.N) shares climbed 31 percent to $6.68
after Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis purchased 200,000 common
shares, four days after the company posted its largest
quarterly loss in 17 years. [ID:nN21492581]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) ranked as the Dow's second-biggest
advancer, surging 25.1 percent to $22.63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SINGING THE eBAY BLUES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the downside, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) was the
heaviest weight on the Dow after being downgraded to a
"neutral" rating by Credit Suisse. Shares of Wal-Mart, the
world's largest retailer and leading discount chain, slid 2.8
percent to $49.14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the bell, shares of eBay (EBAY.O) slid nearly 7
percent in extended trade to $12.36 after the online
auctioneer posted a lower fourth-quarter profit and gave a
disappointing outlook for its current quarter as consumer
spending declines. [ID:nN21347951] In regular trading, before
the earnings release after hours, eBay's stock gained almost 6
percent to close at $13.28 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading volume was active on the New York Stock Exchange,
with about 1.74 billion shares changing hands, above last
year's estimated daily average of roughly 1.49 billion, while
on Nasdaq, about 2.14 billion shares traded, below last year's
daily average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by
a ratio of 4 to 1, while on the Nasdaq, about three stocks
rose for every one that fell.

&lt;p&gt;RIO DE JANEIRO Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. oil giant Exxon

Petrobras found billions of barrels of oil recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The so-called subsalt wells extend over a distance of 800

action online at http://www.csgrr.com/cases/jpmorgan/. Any member of the
putative class may move the Court to serve as lead plaintiff through counsel of
their choice, or may choose to do nothing and remain an absent class member. 

The complaint charges JP Morgan Acceptance, certain of its officers and
directors and the issuers and underwriters of the Certificates with violations
of the Securities Act of 1933. JP Morgan Acceptance was formed in 1988 for the
purpose of acquiring, owning and selling interests in those assets. JP Morgan
Acceptance is a subsidiary of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. ("JP Morgan") and is
engaged in mortgage lending and other real estate finance-related businesses,
including mortgage banking, mortgage warehouse lending, and insurance
underwriting. 

The complaint alleges that on July 29, 2005 and February 8, 2006, JP Morgan
Acceptance and the Defendant Issuers caused Registration Statements to be filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") in connection with the
issuance of billions of dollars of Certificates. The Certificates were issued
pursuant to Prospectus Supplements, each of which was incorporated into the
Registration Statements. The Certificates included several classes or tranches,
which had various priorities of payment, exposure to default, interest payment
provisions and/or levels of seniority. The Certificates were supported by large
pools of mortgage loans. The Registration Statements represented that the
mortgage pools would primarily consist of loan groups generally secured by first
liens on residential properties, including conventional, adjustable rate and
negative amortization mortgage loans. 

The complaint alleges that the Registration Statements omitted and/or
misrepresented the fact that the sellers of the underlying mortgages to JP
Morgan Acceptance were issuing many of the mortgage loans to borrowers who: (i)
did not meet the prudent or maximum debt-to-income ratio purportedly required by
the lender; (ii) did not provide adequate documentation to support the income
and assets required for the lenders to approve and fund the mortgage loans
pursuant to the lenders` own guidelines; (iii) were steered to stated
income/asset and low documentation mortgage loans by lenders, lenders`
correspondents or lenders` agents, such as mortgage brokers, because the
borrowers could not qualify for mortgage loans that required full documentation;
and (iv) did not have the income required by the lenders` own guidelines to
afford the required mortgage payments which resulted in a mismatch between the
amount loaned to the borrower and the capacity of the borrower. 

According to the complaint, by the summer of 2007, the amount of uncollectible
mortgage loans securing the Certificates began to be revealed to the public. To
avoid scrutiny for their own involvement in the sale of the Certificates, the
Rating Agencies began to put negative watch labels on many Certificate classes,
ultimately downgrading many. The delinquency and foreclosure rates of the
mortgage loans securing the Certificates has grown both faster and in greater
quantity than what would be expected for mortgage loans of the types described
in the Prospectus Supplements. As an additional result, the Certificates are no
longer marketable at prices anywhere near the price paid by plaintiffs and the
Class and the holders of the Certificates are exposed to much more risk with
respect to both the timing and absolute cash flow to be received than the
Registration Statements/Prospectus Supplements represented. 

Plaintiff seeks to recover damages on behalf of all purchasers of Certificates
pursuant and/or traceable to the Registration Statements (the "Class"). The
plaintiff is represented by Coughlin Stoia, which has expertise in prosecuting
investor class actions and extensive experience in actions involving financial
fraud.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co said on Wednesday it sent voluntary buyout offers to 600 executives at its domestic theme parks to cut costs amid an economic meltdown that has depressed attendance and prompted the company to deeply discount Walt Disney World stays.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney said if the buyout offer, which expires February 6, does not produce enough reductions, the company will consider layoffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A company spokeswoman declined to say what amount of savings or head count reductions Disney was trying to achieve, or what the cost of the terminations would be.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buyout offers come about six weeks after Disney said its hotel bookings had started to rebound as a result of the discounts. The move appears to be part of "significant" costs savings the company promised investors late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said at that time that hotel bookings were down about 6 percent in the company's first and second quarters, an improvement over the 10 percent drop the company previously forecast for that period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a letter dated January 22, Disney told employees it needed to streamline its executive work force "at all levels" to reduce its cost structure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The buyouts would become effective between mid-February and the end of March, the letter from Jayne Parker, senior vice president of human resources, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney shares closed up about 4.9 percent to $21.23 on Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds close of U.S. markets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Herbert Lash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street stocks rallied on
Wednesday, lifted by a solid outlook from bellwether IBM and a
strong rebound in financials a day after a steep slide, while
U.S. government bond prices slid on waning safe-haven bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stocks jumped more than 3 percent in a relief rally,
but was not enough to erase the year's biggest single-day
equity losses that were set a day earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite the U.S. rally, investors said concerns about banks
lingered and European shares fell on deepening fears that
several major financial institutions there would not survive
the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The British pound bounced from 23-year lows against the
dollar and trimmed losses against the euro after a Group of
Seven source said sterling weakness will be discussed at the
February meeting of the G7 industrialized economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil futures rose more than 6 percent to above $43 a barrel
as supply cuts by member countries of the Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries outweighed fresh evidence that a
deepening global slowdown is crushing demand for energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Signs of mounting job losses highlighted the depth of a
still worsening slowdown across the euro zone, sending two-year
government bond yields in the bloc to historic lows as
investors rushed to buy the safest and most liquid fixed-income
assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But U.S. government debt prices fell as the stocks rally
undercut a bid for safe-haven assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) contributed
the most to the Dow's gain, jumping 11.5 percent -- its biggest
single-day rise by percentage gain in six years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's top technology services company late Tuesday
posted a quarterly profit and gave a 2009 outlook that
surpassed expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial shares advanced as investors hunted for bargains
in the hard-hit sector. JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) soared 25

 (Updates to close)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Chuck Mikolajczak&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 21 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks jumped on
Wednesday, rebounding from a two-month low, after a
surprisingly healthy earnings report from IBM fueled optimism
that technology may fare better than other sectors during the
recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial stocks outperformed as well on the strength of
earnings surprises from Northern Trust (NTRS.O) and PNC
Financial Services (PNC.N), helping the group reclaim some of
Tuesday's massive losses that dropped the financial sector to
a 14-year low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market shrugged off a brief sell-off after Treasury
Secretary nominee Timothy Geithner faced tough questioning at
his confirmation hearing before a Senate committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The day after earnings results from State Street alarmed
investors about losses in one of the safest parts of banking,
earnings from rival Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O) on Wednesday
soothed investor concerns after its net income more than
doubled. The financial services company's shares shot up
nearly 31 percent to $57.51. For details see [ID:nN21470235]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PNC Financial Services Group Inc (PNC.N) also projected
lower loan losses from its purchase of National City Corp,
sending its shares soaring 37 percent to $30.16.[ID:nN21483128]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are excited because financials are valued so low
at this point. It's the mentality that they can't get any
lower, but they've proven time and time again that they can,"
said Jocelynn Drake, market analyst at Schaeffer's Investment
Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 279.01
points, or 3.51 percent, to 8,228.10. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX rose 35.02 points, or 4.35 percent, to
840.24. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC climbed 66.21
points, or 4.60 percent, to 1,507.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N) provided the
biggest lift to the Dow, jumping nearly 12 percent to $91.42
after the world's top technology services company posted a
quarterly profit and a 2009 profit outlook that surpassed Wall
Street's expectations. That burst of strength from IBM led
 investors to believe the Dow component can weather the global
economic downturn.  [ID:nN20268352].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hearings on Geithner's appointment attracted the market's
attention for much of the day as he is seen as President
Barack Obama's point man in battling the economic crisis. As
the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York since
2003, Geithner is expected to hit the ground running if
confirmed as Treasury secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A day after his historic inauguration, Obama met with his
economic advisers, who are working with the Democratic-led
Congress on an $825 billion fiscal stimulus package.
[ID:nN20421893].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The financial sector drove gains in the SP 500 following
Tuesday's sharp sell-off, which was ignited by deepening fears
of insolvency among banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broad KBW index of bank stocks .BKX and the SP
financials index .GSPF both jumped 14.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America (BAC.N) shares climbed 31 percent to $6.68
after Chief Executive Kenneth Lewis purchased 200,000 common
shares, four days after the company posted its largest
quarterly loss in 17 years. [ID:nN21492581]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) ranked as the Dow's second-biggest
advancer, surging 25.1 percent to $22.63.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the downside, Wal-Mart Stores Inc (WMT.N) was the
heaviest weight on the Dow after being downgraded to a
"neutral" rating by Credit Suisse. Shares of Wal-Mart, the
world's largest retailer and leading discount chain, slid 2.8
percent to $49.14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple (AAPL.O) led the Nasdaq higher ahead of its
quarterly earnings after the closing bell, despite a report
that U.S. regulators were examining the company's disclosures
about Chief Executive Officer Steve Jobs' health problems to
ensure investors were not misled. [ID:nN21478108]. Apple's
stock rose 5.9 percent to $82.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading volume was active on the New York Stock Exchange,
with about 1.74 billion shares changing hands, above last
year's estimated daily average of roughly 1.49 billion, while
on Nasdaq, about 2.12 billion shares traded, below last year's
daily average of 2.28 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Advancing stocks outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by
a ratio of 4 to 1, while on the Nasdaq, about three stocks
rose for every one that fell.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is expected to post a quarterly profit that misses its own target and announce thousands of job cuts this week as the global economic slump hurts even the technology industry's biggest players.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the leading software maker reports fiscal second quarter results on Thursday, investors are likely to press for comments on its outlook and on Yahoo Inc, whose search business has been the object of Microsoft's desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report comes against a backdrop of a wounded global economy that has stifled demand for everything from personal computers to business software and video games, all markets in which Microsoft is a significant player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All eyes are on the forecast," said Jefferies  Co analyst Katherine Egbert. "Expectations for the guidance are pretty low."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts on average put Microsoft's profit at 49 cents a share for the quarter ended December 31, which includes a U.S. holiday shopping season that has been called the worst in at least four decades. The Redmond, Washington-based company had forecast a per-share profit of 51 cents to 53 cents for the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street is looking for quarterly revenue of $17.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates, also short of Microsoft's own target of $17.3 billion to $17.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Egbert says she expects Microsoft to report sales of its Windows software for PCs and laptops to drop 3 percent from a year earlier, making it the toughest quarter in eight years. She blames the shortfall on weak consumer sales, noting that businesses have yet to cut back as much as retail shoppers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street's expectations for Microsoft's performance for its fiscal year ending in June 2009 have declined since it last reported results three months ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst forecasts for full-year net income have dropped 10 percent to $17.77 billion, while revenue projections are down 4.4 percent at $63.68 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POSSIBLE JOB CUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With an eye on reducing costs, Microsoft is widely expected to announce that it will cut jobs, following similar moves by other tech firms, including ATT Inc, Dell Inc, Motorola Inc and Advance Micro Devices Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Checks indicate that Microsoft is likely to engage in headcount reductions to the tune of 6,000 to 8,000 employees or 6 percent to 8 percent of its 95,000 workforce," said McAdams Wright Ragen analyst Sid Parakh. "Our checks also revealed some speculation over the potential for a second round of cuts in some groups sometime later in the year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other analysts suggest the cost reductions may occur in the next few weeks and could also include more targeted cutbacks and attrition, rather than the big number of layoffs that some have speculated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has declined to comment on any likelihood of job cuts. Its shares have dropped 41 percent over the past year, while shares in another technology bellwether, IBM, have lost 16 percent. The SP 500 Index has dropped 38 percent during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts are also expected to pepper Chief Executive Steve Ballmer with questions about the status of the company's relationship with Yahoo, now that the Internet company has named Carol Bartz as its new CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz told employees earlier this week that she had a phone conversation with Ballmer, who has repeatedly said he remains interested in pursuing a search partnership with Yahoo but does not intend to renew an offer for the whole company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made a bid for Yahoo last year, but walked away after they disagreed on price. Investors have been skeptical about whether the software company can win online advertising revenue away from Google and Yahoo, which are both stronger than Microsoft in the Internet search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Branch Design Showcases Local Photography of Visalia Landmarks


CHICO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--

Tri Counties Bank formerly operated a commercial lending office on W. Main

"It was time for us to expand so that we can deliver the Tri Counties Bank brand
of service in a bigger, more visible retail location that is convenient to
residents of the Visalia community," said Dan Bailey, executive vice president
of retail banking for Tri Counties Bank. "We are a community bank and we
specialize in `hometown, know-you-by-name service` combined with products that
are competitive with the big banks. As we expand our presence in the Central
Valley, we look forward to offering our banking services to more Visalia
residents." 

The new branch features a prominent photographic mural showcasing natural and
architectural Visalia landmarks, taken by local photographer, Sheree Altobelle.
The bank designed the branch to reflect the local community and discovered
amateur photographer Altobelle in the process. The murals include numerous
iconic Visalia landmarks such as: 

&#8226; Downtown Main Street Visalia 

&#8226; Mearle`s Drive-In 

&#8226; Fruit orchards of Exeter 

&#8226; Local downtown murals 

&#8226; Historic Fox Theater 

&#8226; Mooney Grove 

&#8226; Kaweah Oaks Preserve 

&#8226; Kings Canyon Park 

"Altobelle`s photos are an excellent representation of what we`ve been doing
since 1999 - primarily serving the commercial lending needs of the Visalia
business and agricultural communities," said Richard P. Smith, president and CEO
of Tri Counties Bank. "Tri Counties Bank has a strong retail operation
throughout the Central Valley and we are excited that we now have the capability
to also offer our consumer banking services to customers in Visalia." 

Tri Counties Bank will celebrate its grand opening with a ribbon cutting
ceremony conducted by the Visalia Chamber of Commerce on Thursday, Jan. 22, 2009
at 4 p.m. Refreshments will follow. Altobelle will also be attending the grand
opening as an honored guest of Tri Counties Bank.

Valley from the Oregon border to Bakersfield.

The SP 500 Index has dropped 38 percent during the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts are also expected to pepper Chief Executive Steve Ballmer with questions about the status of the company's relationship with Yahoo, now that the Internet company has named Carol Bartz as its new CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bartz told employees earlier this week that she had a phone conversation with Ballmer, who has repeatedly said he remains interested in pursuing a search partnership with Yahoo but does not intend to renew an offer for the whole company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft made a bid for Yahoo last year, but walked away after they disagreed on price. Investors have been skeptical about whether the software company can win online advertising revenue away from Google and Yahoo, which are both stronger than Microsoft in the Internet search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM) surprised the Street with some positive earnings results
late on Tuesday, when it posted a 12% increase in fourth-quarter profit and gave
an upbeat outlook for 2009. For the fourth quarter, IBM reported net income of
$4.42 billion, or $3.28 per share, compared with its year-ago profit of $3.95
billion, or $2.80 per share. Revenue fell 6.4% to $27 billion, from $28.87
billion a year before, partly due to the dollar's strength. IBM said that, at
constant currency rates, revenue would have declined 1%.

&lt;p&gt;Local Nonprofit Selected as the Recipient of the Chairman`s Gift for Work with
Homeless
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil
Corporation, today presented Vogel Alcove with a $50,000 grant in support of
their work with homeless infants, toddlers and preschool children. Vogel Alcove
is the third nonprofit organization to receive Tillerson`s annual Chairman`s
Gift. 

Tillerson established the Chairman`s Gift in 2006 in order to provide a local
nonprofit organization with a donation during the holiday season. Since the
gift`s inception, ExxonMobil has selected St. Philip`s School and Community
Center, Lena Pope Home and Vogel Alcove as recipients. 

While personally delivering the check to Alan Perkins, board chairman of Vogel
Alcove, Tillerson and ExxonMobil attendees enjoyed a short selection of songs
sung by preschool children at the facility. Following the singing, Tillerson
toured the grounds at Vogel Alcove along with ExxonMobil employees and members
of the Vogel Alcove board. 

"Vogel Alcove plays a vital role in serving our community, and we are pleased to
present them with the Chairman`s Gift this year," Tillerson said. "ExxonMobil is
committed to supporting organizations that work to encourage youth as they grow,
and we are excited to join Vogel Alcove in its mission of offering a haven for
homeless children to receive unique opportunities in education and development."


Since 1985, Vogel Alcove has served the homeless community by providing
childcare services to those in need. Today, the organization seeks to work with
children during their developmental years and to serve their families during
their homelessness. To achieve their mission, Vogel Alcove provides high
quality, free childcare, developmental services and comprehensive social
services. 

"We are proud to partner with a corporation that is so invested in the
community, and thanks to ExxonMobil, we are starting 2009 on the right note,"
said Barbara Landix, executive director of Vogel Alcove. "Our goal is to provide
children with an opportunity for a better, healthier life free from
homelessness, and ExxonMobil`s generous gift enables us to continue achieving
that goal with a growing number of children and families." 

ExxonMobil has a longstanding relationship with Vogel Alcove. In addition to the
selection as this year`s Chairman`s Gift recipient, ExxonMobil has provided the
nonprofit with a variety of grants totaling more than $450,000 in the past.

&lt;p&gt;Skye Deploys Manhattan Associates Supply Chain Solution to Enhance Existing
Microsoft Dynamics AX ERP Platform

CAPE TOWN, South Africa and ATLANTA, Jan. 21, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Global
supply chain optimisation provider Manhattan Associates (Nasdaq:MANH) today
announced that Skye Group, the distributor of clothing and well-known footwear
brands including Converse, Dickies and Mille, has achieved significant
productivity benefits following the implementation of Manhattan ILS(tm):
Integrated Logistics Solutions, built on Microsoft(r).NET, at its new
distribution centre (DC) at Crown Mines, Gauteng in South Africa. The
deployment, which has involved the integration of Manhattan's solution with
Skye's existing ERP platform, Microsoft Dynamics AX, has provided the footwear
and clothing specialist with an advanced supply chain solution capability that
both complements and enhances its ERP system.

Following the system's demonstrated success for the footwear side of Skye's
business, the distributor has already begun to roll out the technology across
its clothing business as well. Skye has already improved picking accuracy and
order processing speeds and has reduced the time taken to perform stock counts.

Manhattan's solution went live following an implementation led by South African
supply chain consulting specialist Supply Chain Junction. With Manhattan ILS
replacing a paper-based system, productivity improvements have been particularly
dramatic. Instead of having to physically enter a warehouse to ascertain precise
stock location and availability, this information is now instantly available
through Manhattan ILS. Skye's warehouse managers are able to pre-plan
order-picking requirements and to balance resources against sales orders,
resulting in a far smoother and more efficient use of time and labour.

The time required to manage stock-taking has reduced dramatically. Under the old
paper-based system, a count could take anything up to 12 days. Now Skye takes
only two days to conduct a complete count and expects further reductions.
Radio-frequency (RF) scanners from Psion-Teklogix complementing the Manhattan
solution, along with new racking and Material Handling Equipment (MHE), have
also contributed to improvements in the way Skye manages its stock.

The solution has also improved the order fulfilment process. Picking accuracy
and speed have both improved materially, and Skye has introduced the practice of
'cross-docking,' meaning some goods are shipped in and out of the distribution
centre in a very short period of time without being put away to storage.
Compared to an initial average order cycle time of three days, 80% of orders are
now despatched within 24 hours.

"We implemented the system during our busiest time of the year," explained Bibs
Dalpat, Skye's director of operations and logistics. "We had a challenge on our
hands as many people were entirely new to this type of technology and required
training, but we managed it with the help of Supply Chain Junction and Manhattan
Associates. We are now streamlining processes and beginning the work of
extending the solution's use to our clothing business. I can only see positive
things as a result of this implementation."

"We are extremely pleased to be helping another great South African company to
transform its supply chain," commented Jan-Paul Boos, senior director at
Manhattan Associates. "Our partnership with Supply Chain Junction in South
Africa goes from strength to strength and we look forward to continuing our work
together to help not just Skye but a growing number of manufacturers,
distributors and retailers in South Africa who are striving for supply chain
perfection."

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Jan 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
LOTUSPHERE - At the annual Lotusphere Conference, IBM (NYSE: IBM) today
unveiled its plans to make key business collaboration tools faster,
easier and available anytime, anywhere. Plans include a series of
partnerships with industry leaders Orange group, Samsung and Verizon
Wireless; a new version of IBM's leading unified communications and
collaboration solution, IBM Lotus Sametime; and intended support for
Microsoft Active Sync.

    The announcements with Orange, Samsung and Verizon Wireless are a key
part of IBM's work to expand its collaboration sales channel to global
device and telecommunications carriers. Verizon Wireless and Orange will
give their mobile network customers access to IBM Lotus Notes and Domino
software on their hand-held devices, expanding Lotus email access up to 85
million users across the US on the Verizon network and 113 million users
across Europe on the Orange network. Both wireless carriers are
certifying support for IBM Lotus Notes Traveler software, which enables
wireless replication of Lotus Notes email, calendaring, and personal
information management (PIM) data on select smartphones.

    Leading mobile device producer Samsung, will also support IBM Lotus Notes
Traveler software. This will enable millions of Samsung smartphone
customers to manage their Lotus Notes email, calendars and address books
anytime, anywhere.

    Lotus to Support Active Sync

    IBM today announced plans to support Microsoft Active Sync in a future
version of Lotus Notes Traveler. This support will extend automatic
synching capabilities for email and calendaring tools to a new range of
popular mobile devices. This support is part of IBM's pledge to provide
enterprises the choice and flexibility to select the mobile devices and
carriers that best suit their needs.

    Saving Businesses Time and Money, One Online Meeting at a Time

    In challenging economic times, the ability to collaborate with
colleagues, partners and customers from around the world without ever
leaving the office is a financial necessity. With the latest version of
Lotus Sametime, IBM is helping businesses save time and money by
participating in online meetings quickly and easily.

    Gone are the days of wasting the first 10 minutes of a meeting sharing
meeting details and downloading code just to participate. The latest
version of IBM Lotus Sametime features always-ready, reservation-less
meetings, a zero-download Web client and the ability to add meeting
participants by dragging and dropping names from the instant messaging
contact list.

    IBM Lotus Sametime's reservation-less online meetings mean that a
person's password protected meeting room is always ready and a Web
conference can be started instantly. Meeting minutes, slides and other
documents can be stored in this personalized meeting room for future use.
In addition, advanced audio and video features are included, allowing
people to select the collaboration style best suited for the task at
hand. Once recorded, these files are saved in open formats making them
easy to edit and playback.

    The new IBM Lotus Sametime comes with a new Web 2.0 look and feel and a
redesigned Web 2.0 tool kit that makes it easy for enterprises to build
key communications capabilities into their business processes. For
example, IBM Lotus Sametime makes it easy for a business to include
presence, instant messaging and click-to-call features on their Website.
Customers with inquiries could start a conversation with one click from
the company's Website. The business could reduce the costly charges of
maintaining a toll free customer support line, while delivering more
effective customer service.

    IBM Lotus Sametime 8.5 and the new version of IBM Lotus Traveler are
planned for the second half of 2009.

&lt;p&gt;  PARIS, Jan 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and BNP Paribas, the largest French company and the fifth
largest in the banking industry worldwide, today announced a 318 million
euro (exclusive of VAT), six-year agreement for their existing joint
venture, BP2I, to support and manage the overall information technology
(IT) infrastructure operations of BNP Paribas' subsidiary office, Banca
Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) in Italy.

    By extending BP2I to Italy, BP2I will be able to provide flexible
solutions across both its French and Italian operations. BP2I will provide
significant cost savings to the BNP Paribas Group by transforming BNL's IT
infrastructure and aligning it with BNP Paribas' current infrastructure
and standard processes. The agreement will also enable BNP Paribas Group
to strengthen BNL's capabilities to better manage the globalization
requirements of the retail banking business.

    In signing this agreement, BNP Paribas is expanding its existing
partnership with IBM, which began in 2004 when IBM proposed a new IT
infrastructure management for BNP Paribas Group's Retail and Insurance
branches across France, and in doing so, created BNP Paribas Partners for
Innovation (BP2I), the IT services company equally owned by BNP Paribas SA
and IBM.

    IBM is closely working with BNP Paribas Group, supporting its future
business initiatives and global ambitions, while consolidating some of
BNP's IT operations, securing resilience capabilities, improving
productivity and helping it to deliver high quality services to its
clients. Through this agreement, IBM will continue leveraging its global
leadership, technology innovation and banking solutions knowledge, for the
BNP Paribas Group.

    "We are pleased about the extension of our partnership with IBM and of the
scope of operations of our 50/50 joint venture, BP2I. As we progressively
build a multi-domestic retail bank across Europe, it will be essential to
create European competence centers in each country, along with aligned
processes to leverage the IT operations, all of which will be made
possible through BP2I," says Herve Gouezel, President du Conseil de
Strategie et de Surveillance de BP2I.

    "BNP Paribas is known for being at the forefront of the international
banking industry," says Eric Auvray, IBM General Manager for Global
Technology Services, Southwest Europe. "Along with being able to take
advantage of IBM's knowledge and experience in the banking and consumer
industry, this agreement will provide a flexible solution that will enable
BNP Paribas and its subsidiary office Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, to
adjust to the fast-changing demands of a competitive market. This new
agreement underscores the strong relationship between both companies and
our commitment to deliver the highest level of service excellence to BNP
Paribas."

    The agreement was signed in December 2008.

&lt;p&gt;  ORLANDO, FL, Jan 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
LOTUSPHERE -- To help customers get the most out of their information
technology (IT) in challenging business conditions, IBM (NYSE: IBM) is
offering a growing portfolio of low or no-cost software.

    Designed to help small-to-medium sized businesses (SMBs) reduce the time
and money associated with deploying and managing IT solutions, IBM Lotus
Foundations Start 1.1 and a new offering, Lotus Foundations Branch
Office, were unveiled today at Lotusphere. Lotus Foundations is IBM's
hardware and software solution that helps businesses from 5 - 500
employees collaborate with tools like email, office applications, file
sharing, back up and recovery.

    The latest version of Lotus Foundations Start, allows customers to take
advantage of existing IT investments by providing the ability to run
Microsoft Windows applications within a Lotus Foundations environment.
Previously announced as a pilot program with VMware, this new capability
will give customers the ability to run IBM Lotus Domino, Windows and
native Linux applications.

    Many large organizations running Lotus Domino such as banks, professional
services firms and insurance agencies have significant portions of their
businesses in branch offices without on-site IT. With Lotus Foundations
Branch Office, large enterprise Lotus Domino customers will be able to
extend existing skills and data to remote offices quickly and
efficiently. Lotus Foundations Branch Office will help large
organizations reduce costs and better manage operations by supporting the
sometimes complex technology needs of the branch and satellite offices
with a fully integrated appliance.

    Business Partners are taking note of Lotus Foundations. Lotus+911,
Research In Motion (RIM) and ShoreTel have evaluated Lotus Foundations'
functionality and ease-of-use, and believe it is a good platform to reach
the SMB market.

    IBM is working with Xerox to align Lotus Foundations and Xerox's
multi-function printing devices to empower Independent Software Vendors
(ISVs) and Value Added Resellers(VARs) to better support small business
customers.

    "Xerox's Extensible Interface Platform (EIP) enables solutions to be
built that manage documents and other digital content that flow to and
from our multi-function printing (MFP) devices," said Tom Durkin,
director for corporate strategy, Xerox. "With Lotus Foundations, IBM has
a simple and secure platform that supports document solutions that
involve encoded and image information and is ideal to simplify SMB
business processes. Combine Foundations and EIP and you will have a
complete collaboration infrastructure in which solutions can be
prototyped, developed and deployed quickly and easily to the SMB market."

    Lotus Symphony Goes Mainstream

    IBM Lotus Symphony, IBM's free software suite of word processing
documents, spreadsheets and presentation files, has recently passed three
million downloads worldwide. Available to anyone with one click at
http://symphony.lotus.com, Lotus Symphony has become one of the leading
alternatives to Microsoft Office, capable of saving individuals and
businesses hundreds or even thousands of dollars. Adopting Symphony can
put less stress on IT budgets, which can mean more money to drive
innovation and investments in human capital.

    With the challenging economy, businesses are more focused on
cost-effective technologies. Suame Magazine Industrial Development
Organization (SMIDO) provides critical technology training to the
artisans, mechanics and shop owners in the Suame Magazine section of
Ghana. Suame Magazine is an engineering cluster located in Kumasi, Ghana.
With more than 200,000 workers, it is the biggest industrial estate in
Africa and has business activities that result in daily cash financial
transactions of over $1 million US.

    "We need powerful productivity tools without a high price tag," said Yaw
Adu-Gyamfi, SMIDO instructor. "At an organization like SMIDO, incurring
additional costs year after year is problematic and detracts from our
ability to allocate funds to our long term vision and goal. Above all, the
open source nature of Symphony allows us the flexibility we need to
upgrade and manage the software without the hassle of licensing fees and
lengthy conditions."

    Organizations across business, government, education and philanthropy are
finding Lotus Symphony and Lotus Foundations the easy choices as
information technology and operating budgets tighten. For example, the
San Miguel School of Camden New Jersey, a specialized school for at-risk
adolescent boys, wanted to make the most of its non-profit budget without
sacrificing the quality of its education tools. "Paying hundreds of
dollars per user for office software isn't a possibility for us," said
Brother Joseph Juliano of the school. "Lotus gives us the applications
for our staff and student needs at much lower cost."

    Lotus Symphony is also a component in two low cost software-based
offerings from IBM Lotus, Lotus Foundations and the IBM Open Client
(OCCS), the active ingredient in a popular Linux desktop software bundle.

    Today IBM and Red Hat announced a joint initiative to help enterprise
clients migrate from Microsoft-based desktops to Linux-based desktops.
The initiative includes a migration package with tools such as Red Hat's
TCO calculator, diagnostic kit, best practices guide, no charge
cost-reduction strategy engagement, and no charge proof of concept/pilot
deployment. It also includes insight on optimal uses for various client
technology choices and how to harness Red Hat's heterogeneous
virtualization management capability for the desktop to drive
cost-efficiency and user productivity. The objective is to assist
businesses in moving from higher cost platforms to Lotus on Red Hat
Enterprise Linux solutions. This migration package will be delivered by
joint channel Business Partners supported by IBM and Red Hat technical
experts. Qualifying Business Partners in North America may apply to Red
Hat for reimbursement from Red Hat for these professional
services/implementation services provided to customers.

    Already businesses around the world are moving to these economical
solutions and driving significant savings of their planned expenditures
on desktop computing. Constructora San Jose, a leading, privately owned
construction company in Spain, chose the IBM Open Client on Red Hat for
an efficient and secure way to communicate and collaborate internally and
externally in real-time. This helps the company's mobile workers
controlling and directing construction projects in remote locations to
make fast decisions.

    Web 2.0 to the Rescue

    With the tightening economy, businesses are more focused than ever on
enhancing customer experience and loyalty. New Web 2.0 tools from IBM not
only help businesses to reduce costs and empower employees, but also to
make better use of their Web sites, mobile devices and process automation
for their customers.

    A new Mashup Accelerator will help organizations quickly build and deploy
applications that address daily business challenges. The Accelerator
allows even non-technical users to build applications on the fly,
reducing the development burden on IT and empowering people to pull
together the information they need to get their jobs done. Likewise, a
new Web 2.0 forms solution will help business users of any level
streamline work and eliminate the costs and errors associated with paper
production, processing and delivery. A new Mobile Accelerator enables
businesses to extend their corporate portal services to mobile devices.
This can help business save time and money by using the same servers to
provide access to information and applications through the company
intranet or extranet portal and to employees' or even customers' mobile
devices.

    IBM is also launching a new Web analytics initiative to help WebSphere
Portal customers better capture, measure and respond to Website visitor
information. Through relationships with leading Web analytics vendors,
IBM is helping businesses improve the customer experience for their
clients. For example, web analytics helps a major financial institution
optimize the results of their offers on their portal Website. They get
up-to-the-minute data on what users are doing on their site and can make
immediate changes to the design to increase the conversion rate of
shoppers to buyers.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) issued a 2009 profit outlook that blew past Wall Street expectations, underscoring the ability of the world's top technology services firm to weather the global downturn and boosting its shares 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fourth-quarter earnings of International Business Machines Corp also trumped analysts' expectations on Tuesday, presenting a rare bright spot for the tech industry, which has been hit by profit warnings and sweeping job cuts as companies and consumers reduce spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although IBM's fourth-quarter revenue came in a little shy of expectations, falling 6.4 percent from a year ago, the company also managed to cut costs by 3-4 percent. A lower tax rate also helped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM clearly is watching their expenses closely," said Andy Miedler, an analyst at Edward Jones who expects revenue to drop in the mid-single digits on a percentage basis in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM can't control its revenue in this environment so they're focusing on cost control, Miedler said"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Samuel Palmisano said IBM was "ahead of pace" on a plan to boost earnings to $10 to $11 per share by 2010. That was more optimistic than its last assessment in October, when the firm said only it was on track toward meeting that goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upbeat projections contrasted with more somber comments from other industry giants that have announced layoffs and warned this year's business outlook was grim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No. 1 corporate storage equipment maker EMC Corp (EMC.N) is shedding 2,400 jobs, chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices Inc (AMD.N) is cutting 1,100 workers and high-end server maker Sun Microsystems Inc JAVA.O plans to cut up to 6,000 employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While IBM is cutting jobs that add to overhead, it is hiring more consultants, sales staff and other workers that directly bring in revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARGIN EXPANSION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM -- which competes with the likes of Hewlett-Packard Co (HPQ.N), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and Oracle Corp ORCL.O -- posted a gross profit margin of 47.9 percent, up 3 percentage points from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Financial Officer Mark Loughridge said the firm will keep improving margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will continue our focus on structural changes that reduce our spending levels and improve productivity in 2009," Loughridge said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those efforts include standardizing services products so they are less costly to deliver to IBM's customers, which are predominantly among the world's biggest corporations. The company will also shift staff from headquarters to local offices where they can directly work with clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has moved to a more profitable revenue mix since 2000, dumping commodity hardware units that made personal computers, printers and PC hard drives. At the same time, it spent about $20 billion on acquisitions of software makers and IT services firms, which tend to do better in tough economic times because they have highly predictable sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keith Wirtz, chief investment officer of Fifth Third Asset Management, said his firm was buying IBM shares after the results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM has enjoyed certain attributes that other tech stocks don't enjoy," he said. "They have recurring revenue streams that also translate into profitability."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2009 FORECAST BEATS ESTIMATES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM, the world's biggest maker of mainframe computers and No. 2 software maker, predicted 2009 earnings of least $9.20 a share, trouncing a consensus of $8.77, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York company said net income rose 12 percent to $4.43 billion, or $3.28 per share, in the fourth quarter ended December 31, from $3.95 billion, or $2.80 per share, a year earlier. That easily beat the average analyst forecast of $3.03.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue fell 6.4 percent to $27.0 billion, but turnover in its software segment climbed 3 percent to $6.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It signed services contracts totaling $17.2 billion, at actual rates, a decrease of 5 percent. But its backlog of services bookings rose to a currency-adjusted $117 billion at the end of December, up $3 billion from the end of September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM shares climbed to 85.32 in after-hours trade from a regular close of $81.98 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock has dropped about 16 percent over the past year, less than half the 36 percent drop in the Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC. Shares of Microsoft are down about 41 percent, while Hewlett-Packard's stock has fallen 22 percent over the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Edwin Chan, editing by Richard Chang and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
IBM has been ranked at the top of the latest Vendor Matrix released by ABI
Research. 

SAP and Microsoft claimed the second and third spots in the company`s new
evaluation of worldwide RFID enterprise platform BPM (Business Process
Management) and SOA (Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) solutions vendors. 

"While several RFID software and solution providers promote RFID platforms, the
focus of this Vendor Matrix is on those vendors offering RFID enterprise
platforms backed by a BPM-SOA approach," says research director Michael Liard.
"IBM leads the category, backed by its extended global reach, installed customer
base and experience, and continued platform solution innovation; however, SAP
and Microsoft remain highly competitive." 

The Vendor Matrix is an analytical tool developed by ABI Research to provide a
clear understanding of vendors` positions in specific markets. Vendors are
assessed on the important parameters of "innovation" and "implementation" across
several criteria unique to each vendor matrix. 

For this particular matrix, under "innovation," ABI Research examined vendors`
overall RFID strategy, vision, and approach as well as the scope of RFID
enterprise platform solution offerings. Their industry leadership and knowledge
transfer are factored in, as are their application and vertical market
leadership, alignment, and innovation. Enterprise deployment-friendliness and
flexibility play a role in the evaluation, along with their business process
value enablement, their platform solution innovation on both BPM and SOA
considerations, and their standalone aptitude and level of customization. 

Under "implementation," ABI Research scrutinized the following criteria:
installed base of customers and customer size; international market presence and
penetration; RFID market experience; breadth of vertical and application markets
served; strength in vertical and application markets served; integration and
support capabilities; partner collaboration quotient, and overall market
leadership and strength.

Matrix, please visit RFID Enterprise Platform (BPM/SOA) Solution Providers

&lt;p&gt;Combination of IBM`s New Mainframe and Chordiant`s Customer Experience Software
Delivers a Highly Responsive, Scalable, Real-Time Customer Solution
CUPERTINO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chordiant Software, Inc. (Nasdaq:CHRD), the leading provider of Customer
Experience (Cx) software and services, today announced that Chordiant Decision
Management, Recommendation Advisor and Enterprise Foundation are now available
for the IBM Websphere Application Server on z/OS and z/Linux operating systems.
The combined solution will deliver Chordiant`s real-time customer interaction
management capabilities to companies that require the scalability, reliability,
performance, and flexibility of WebSphere Application Server on System z.
Together, Chordiant and IBM provide a responsive, high throughput, real-time
environment for delivering the best possible customer experience while
optimizing business efficiency. 

"We are delighted that Chordiant`s real-time decisioning solutions are now
available for IBM WebSphere Application Server for z/OS. The IBM hardware and
software combinations that it supports offers extraordinary energy efficiency
capabilities that in these difficult economic times our customers are demanding.
We look forward to working with Chordiant and our respective customers in their
move to Chordiant on z," said Mark Hanny, Vice President ISV Alliances and
Academic Initiatives, of IBM. 

Customers will see immediate benefit in speed and security with very complex
processing and predictive analytics, instantaneously delivering results to
customers or customer facing employees. Chordiant`s front office solution does
not replicate data which leads to a cleaner and simpler integration. Due to the
cost per user vs. cost per server metric, together we provide scalability based
on customers, which typically results in a reduction of operating costs.
According to one analyst, the IBM System z platform can be configured to require
1/12th the electricity as a distributed server farm with equivalent processor
capability. 

"Our move to IBM`s z platform was based on strong customer demand for the
platform," said Lisa Caswell, Vice President, Global Alliances of Chordiant.
"For our customers, the combination of Chordiant Cx and IBM`s flexible new
mainframe is a great solution. Our companies have a long history of building
customer-centric solutions for large enterprises, and this is an exciting step
in our history." 

Chordiant is capable of running on any operating system within the flexible IBM
System z environment, including z/Linux and z/OS. The Chordiant Platform is
deployed on top of (WebSphere and DB/2). Similarly, Chordiant customers who
adopt System z can benefit from having all of their disparate systems running
within a single box, while Chordiant seamlessly collects and leverages data from
each one. IBM System z customers who choose Chordiant solutions will benefit
from a host of unique customer experience management capabilities designed to
optimize customer relationships and interactions in high throughput
environments. 

This is timely as company`s face issues around M activity driving both
customer and system consolidation that require not only a single view of the
customer but more importantly a single view of the company back to the customer.
Together, Chordiant and IBM z series can enhance investments that have already
been made or when necessary they can replace numerous systems.

relationships and individual customer interactions in the hands of business
managers. 

Chordiant Decision Management comprises a suite of predictive and adaptive
decisioning applications that enables business users to efficiently and safely
develop highly expressive Next-Best-Action strategies. These strategies are
composed of models that predict and react to individual customer expectations,

decisioning or both, across any channel. With this powerful decision hub for
enterprise-wide decisioning in place, companies can automatically ensure that

current and previous interactions and recommend the next best action to be
taken. These actions can take the form of highly personalized product packages,
advice, insightful questions and relevant explanations. At no point during the
contact do recommendations or actions need to be scripted. Rather,
Recommendation Advisor continually guides the conversation, determining and
adapting actions in real-time based on customer responses and mood.

&lt;p&gt;Application, E-mail and Database Recovery Further Enhanced with Newest Versions
of NetVault: Real-Time Data Protector, NetVault: Backup APM for SQL Server and
NetVault: Backup APM for Exchange Server
SAN DIEGO--(Business Wire)--
BakBone Software&#174; (Pink Sheets:BKBO), the leading provider of heterogeneous
integrated data protection solutions, continues to strengthen its Microsoft
application data protection capabilities with the latest versions of its
NetVault&#174;: Real-Time Data Protector, NetVault: Backup Application Plugin Module
(APM) for SQL Server and NetVault: Backup APM for Exchange Server. The range of
Microsoft data protection solutions offered by BakBone gives users the ability
to tailor their BakBone solutions to their particular recovery needs and
budgets. 

"E-mail and databases are central components of daily business operations," said
Jeff Drescher, vice president of Marketing, BakBone. "BakBone gives Exchange
Server and SQL Server users very powerful, yet simple-to-use tools that improve
recoverability and are a must for any organization that cannot be without these
fundamental applications for any length of time, even minutes or seconds.
BakBone offers a comprehensive range of Microsoft application data protection
solutions. Customers with very aggressive RTO and RPO requirements can take full
advantage of 30-second application recovery with BakBone`s latest release of

potential impact on a company`s ability to service its customers and generate
revenue. Exchange, SQL Server and individual files can quickly be recovered to
any point in time, providing near-zero data loss. The solution provides granular
recovery of individual mailboxes or mailbox items without having to perform
additional brick-level backups that extend a backup window. These capabilities
reduce storage costs and vastly minimize the loss of business-critical
application data. Near-instantaneous application recovery happens in as fast as
30 seconds. 

NetVault: Real-Time Data Protector 2.0 adds

* Longer retention of continuous history and long-term snapshot history 
* Simplified management for greater ease of use

"Anyone who has witnessed the growing corporate reliance on e-mail should not be
surprised at the impact it now has in day-to-day operations. An individual`s
ability to send and receive e-mails, predominantly via Microsoft Exchange, now
tends to outweigh more traditional modes of business communication, and is a
critical foundation of tactical business operations," said Eric Burgener, senior
analyst, Taneja Group. "BakBone`s portfolio of data protection solutions for
Microsoft applications can help organizations meet protection and recovery
requirements for their applications, e-mails and databases in a simple and
cost-effective manner." 

NetVault: Backup APM for SQL Server

NetVault: Backup APM for SQL Server offers reliable and flexible data protection
through online Virtual Device Interface (VDI) or Volume Shadow Copy Service
(VSS) backup methods. A point-and-click GUI eliminates scripting and provides
recovery of complete and partial databases or individual datafiles. NetVault:
Backup APM for SQL Server also features full and differential database and file
backups and partial and differential-partial database backups. 

NetVault: Backup APM for SQL Server 5.5 includes the following features, all in
the context of full SQL Server 2008, Windows 2008 and Volume Shadow Copy Service
(VSS) support:

* Filestream support to help administrators backup SQL Server data stored
outside of SQL Server databases 
* Datafile rename to increase operational flexibility 
* Copy-only backups to help create test or standby environments

NetVault: Backup APM for Exchange Server

With NetVault: Backup APM for Exchange Server, users do not need to learn
Exchange internals; they simply select what needs to be backed up or restored
from a user interface. NetVault: Backup`s APM for Exchange Server automatically
performs the action. Support for online backups via Exchange Server`s Extensible
Storage Engine (ESE) and Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) provides users the
flexibility to select their preferred backup method and create flexible backup
policies that account for multiple recovery scenarios. The APM offers granular
control to restore complete information stores, individual storage groups, or
individual databases. 

NetVault: Backup APM for Exchange 4.0 offers the following features, all with
full VSS and Windows 2008 support:

* Protection for other high availability options such as Local Continuous
Replication (LCR), Cluster Continuous Replication (CCR) and Single Copy Cluster
(SCC) for enhanced availability 
* Standby continuous replication support to minimize downtime and ensure
operational continuity by enabling the separation of high availability and site
resilience 
* Parallel backup/restore streams to increase backup and recovery speed

bold and swift action to deal with the economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Obama will meet with his economic advisors, who are working

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects day to "Wednesday" in first paragraph from "Tuesday")&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * U.S. stock index futures pointed to a mixed open on Wall
Street on Wednesday, as IBM's (IBM.N) and Ericsson's (ERICb.ST)
forecast-beating outlook and results helped overshadow mounting
worries over the stricken banking sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * At 1005 GMT, futures for the SP 500 SPc1 were flat, Dow
Jones DJc1 futures were up 0.06 percent and Nasdaq 100 NDc1
futures were down 0.4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * After the bell on Tuesday, IBM (IBM.N) issued a 2009
profit outlook that blew past Wall Street expectations,
underscoring the ability of the world's top technology services
firm to weather the global downturn and boosting its shares 4
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Global telecom gear maker Ericsson (ERICb.ST) reported
forecast-beating quarterly profit and said it would cut 5,000
jobs, sending its shares rising 12 percent in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Investors were bracing for earnings from bellwethers such
as Apple Inc (AAPL.O), diversified manufacturer United Tech
(UTX.N), drugmaker Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N), airline carrier
UAL Corp UAUA.O and online auctioneer eBay Inc (EBAY.O), while
U.S. banks posting earnings include Northern Trust Corp (NTRS.O)
and U.S. Bancorp (USB.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Economic indicators on tap for Wednesday include the
National Association of Home Builders monthly survey of
builders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI dropped 332.13
points, or 4.01 percent, to 7,949.09 on Tuesday, amid fresh
signs the global bank crisis was far from over. The Standard 
Poor's 500 Index .SPX slid 44.90 points, or 5.28 percent, to
805.22. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC tumbled 88.47 points,
or 5.78 percent, to 1,440.86.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Bank of New York Mellon Corp (BK.N) said on Tuesday that
fourth-quarter profit tumbled 88 percent, hurt by securities
losses and pressure on fees as client assets declined. Results
reflected a charge of 65 cents per share from $1.24 billion in
writedowns largely for securities tied to "Alt-A" mortgages,
which often go to people who can't document income or assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Saudi billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is reviewing
his investment portfolio, Saudi newspapers quoted him as saying
on Wednesday, after his Kingdom Holding Co 4280.SE, which has
a substantial stake in Citigroup (C.N), posted a record loss in
the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * General Motors Corp (GM.N) Chief Operating Officer Fritz
Henderson said the automaker expected to receive a delayed U.S.
government loan payment in the next several days that it needs
to avoid running out of cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) sold its 7.26 percent stake in
Comcast Corp (CMCSA.O), the software giant disclosed in a filing
with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Microsoft's
stake of around 150.9 million shares would have been worth some
$3.4 billion on the day of the filing.

IBM's tax rate in the fourth-quarter 2008 was 23.8 percent compared with 28.0

percent, and IBM expects its full- year 2009 tax rate to be sustained at

billion, a decrease of $1.2 billion since year-end 2007. This decrease coupled
with a non-cash adjustment related to year-end pension remeasurements, which is
reflected as a reduction in stockholders' equity, resulted in a
debt-to-capitalization ratio of 49.0 percent as compared to 30.0 percent at
year-end 2007.

&lt;p&gt;  A filing dated Jan. 16 showed Microsoft no longer held any

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Mexico's top broadcaster, Televisa, and U.S. partner Univision settled a three-year-old lawsuit over royalties on Thursday, setting a fresh start for the two to expand in the Hispanic media market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Televisa, the world's leading producer of Spanish-language content, will receive $65 million per year worth of advertising from privately held Univision from 2009 to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies also signed an amended Program License Agreement (PLA) giving Televisa royalty payments for a wider swath of programing and simplified royalty calculations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new agreement, which runs through 2017, covers "virtually all programs on Univision, including all those at issue in the litigation" but not including the World Cup, Televisa's attorney Marshall Grossman said outside court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In return, "Univision is receiving oxygen in the form of a continuation of the PLA without the risk of having it canceled," Grossman, of Bingham McCutchen LLP, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement ends a bitter legal battle that had curbed Televisa's expansion in the United States. The two companies are to start a three- or four-day trial on March 3 to work out U.S. Internet rights in the same Los Angeles federal court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These two folks ought to get back to business. This is a good first step," said John Keker, Univision's outside counsel. "It would be great if they could settle their differences."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement on the PLA will give Televisa nine more years of national coverage in the coveted U.S. Hispanic market using Univision's three networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Univision, it means it will lock in virtually all of Televisa's shows through 2017, which will help maintain its leadership in the United States against rival Telemundo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additionally, Televisa will receive $25 million in cash, though Univision has already paid $21.5 million of this under protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a separate deal announced on Thursday, Televisa agreed to license to Univision the home games for the three Televisa-owned soccer teams: America, Necaxa and San Luis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa's shares rose after the announcements, reversing earlier losses. Its stock closed up 7.35 pct to 42.20 pesos on the local bourse, while its New York-traded shares closed up 5.2 percent to $15.11.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OLD DISPUTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The two companies had been sparring since 2005, when Televisa filed a lawsuit demanding royalty payments it said Univision had withheld as part of a long-term programing deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa had alleged that Univision wrongly excluded some programs for which it was supposed to share advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal battle started after former Univision CEO Jerrold Perenchio made one of his lieutenants his successor, crushing Televisa's hopes of putting one of its own at the helm of the U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fight escalated the following year after Televisa lost a bid for Univision against a group of investors led by media tycoon Haim Saban, which offered $12.3 billion for the U.S. Spanish-language broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Televisa later sold its 11 percent stake in Univision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked whether the Mexican company would consider taking a stake in Univision again, Televisa's Grossman, said: "There are no discussions of that now. It was under discussion months ago, but the market conditions are such that it is not on the table."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Veronica Sparrowe, Jason Lange, Robert Campbell in Mexico City, editing by Matthew Lewis and Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/LOS ANGELES Jan 22 (Reuters) - For affluent
Seattle, Microsoft is just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's  (MSFT.O) announcement it will lay off 5,000 in
its biggest-ever job-cut rippled through the Seattle area on
Thursday, further unnerving residents of an already-bruised
city of just over 3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The city plays host to a spate of well-known corporations,
some of which have recently announced layoffs [ID:nN22545073],
including Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) , and Boeing Co (BA.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Starbucks said on Thursday that it will freeze salaries for
its top executives. [ID:nN22417628]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Employees at Microsoft's sprawling, tree-lined campus in
Redmond -- just 13 miles from Seattle -- filed in to work in
somber moods, though many had been bracing for weeks for just
such an announcement. Executives say managers called hurried
meetings to talk through the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For some, the news came almost as a relief after weeks of
tense speculation and in the midst of the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression. For others, Microsoft's
warning that cuts will be spread over a year and a half means a
lengthy period of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's definitely a lot of black humor now" in the
hallways, a Microsoft executive said. "People are joking around
like: 'we better get back and see if we still have jobs'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The one thing that might have raised eyebrows is: 'why're
they putting this cloud over our heads for the next 18
months?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seattle, the city in Washington state well-known for
drizzle, cafes and the TV series "Frasier" is feeling its fair
share of corporate pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington state's jobless rate rose in December to 7.1
percent -- just a tad shy of the nation's 7.2 percent, from 6.4
percent in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual Inc [WAMUQ.PL] -- once the largest U.S.
savings and loan but since collapsed and taken over by JPMorgan
(JPM.N)  -- will shed 9,200 jobs. [ID:nLG148108]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 3,400 of those jobs will come out of Seattle, the
Seattle Times reported last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boeing Co  (BA.N) unveiled plans this month to cut 4,500
workers -- most of them in Washington. [ID:nN09303414]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Starbucks -- the brand virtually synonymous with
Seattle's boom -- is in the midst of layoffs of potentially
thousands, though executives would not specify a final number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is the worst economy I've seen in my life. The way
Seattle is shedding jobs reflects what's happening elsewhere,"
said retiree Conrad Shock, 58, as he sipped at a coffee in
Starbucks's first store, opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle's
historic Pike Place market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think we've seen the worst of it," he said, adding
that his retirement accounts had been cut in half in just the
past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His wife Kim said: "Unfortunately it's everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's layoffs -- of about 5 percent of its total
workforce -- came after weeks of Web and media speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is disheartening that one of Washington's premier
businesses is reducing its work force. Unfortunately, it is
another indication that the national economic recession is
deepening," Washington Governor Chris Gregoire said in a
statement. "Our highest priority is to help those workers find
other good jobs as quickly as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back at the Microsoft campus, employees veered between
relief and trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We were waiting for the shoe to drop. It's not even a
large percentage of the workforce. But I haven't had time to
digest it yet", said a middle manager from Microsoft in his
30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I've been through layoffs before at Hewlett Packard. It's
led to good things. I love my job here but whatever happens,
happens," said another Microsoft employee in his 40s.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp unveiled a consulting tool on Thursday that allows companies to reduce both costs and carbon dioxide emissions in their supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The offering -- which IBM calls the Supply Chain Network Optimization Workbench, or SNOW -- comes as companies are under pressure to both slash expenses amid a slumping global economy and reduce impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Built with IBM-branded software, SNOW helps clients review the number of distribution centers they need and decide whether to do manufacturing themselves or through a third party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a test, Chinese shipper and logistics company COSCO Ltd used the system to reduce the number of distribution centers it uses to 40 from 100, lowering costs by 23 percent and cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you improve the overall efficiency of a system you can almost automatically lower cost, waste, and environmental impact," Eric Riddleberger, head of IBM's business strategy consulting practice, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Nichola Groom; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ad coverage sheds light on future performance of top search engines
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
On the heels of earnings announcements from Google (Goog) and Microsoft (MSFT),
AdGooroo (www.adgooroo.com), a leading provider of online marketing competitive
intelligence and keyword tools, reaffirmed the importance of ad coverage as a
critical success metric for leading search engines and serious search engine
marketers alike. 

"With such a wide range of predictions about the Q4 performance of leading
search engines, many were taken by surprise to see a record Q4 for Google," said
AdGooroo`s Founder and Chief Gooroo Rich Stokes. 

Click stream data, often cited in analyst reports, relies on panel data
collected from small groups of individuals and later extrapolated to the general
population. Ad coverage and other pre-click or impression-based search engine
data, on the other hand, is collected on a much larger scale with technology and
automation, essentially pulling the data directly from the marketplace by mining
actual search engine results pages from a wide range of geographic locations. 

"Thousands of marketers and 35 of the nation`s top 50 search agencies use
AdGooroo`s impression-based data," said Gary Allen, CEO of AdGooroo. "And while
ad coverage is a valuable metric that these marketers turn to for guidance on
managing their search campaigns, our track record has demonstrated for four
consecutive quarters that it`s also an accurate indicator of leading engines`
revenue performance as well." 

AdGooroo`s report, "Search Engine Advertising Update - Q408," was the fourth of
its kind released to date and rounded out a year-long series of these reports,
which provided accurate ad coverage data that assisted in the analysis of search
engine performance for a wide range of leading business and industry media and

"Click stream data has inherent limitations that simply do not affect
impression-based metrics like ad coverage," explains Stokes. "We`re changing the

 By Chuck Mikolajczak

 NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Thursday,
after Microsoft's (MSFT.O) proposed job cuts and disappointing
earnings shook investors, while economic data showed further
deterioration in the labor and housing markets.

 Microsoft Corp's stock fell nearly 12 percent at one point
in the session to its lowest level since 1998 and was among
the top drags on both the Dow and Nasdaq, after the world's
largest software maker said it would cut up to 5 percent of
its estimated work force over the next 18 months. The company
cautioned that it could no longer offer profit forecasts for
the rest of the fiscal year after posting a quarterly profit
that fell short of expectations. For more details, see
[ID:nN22530524]. The tech bellwether shook up Wall Street by
releasing its earnings before the opening bell, instead of
after the close as expected.

 "There's just no good news out there. Microsoft pulled the
rug out from under us," said Joe Saluzzi, co-manager of
trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey.

 "Wall Street hates surprises -- don't surprise us like
that."

 Wall Street briefly pared losses late in the session after
comments from the White House that it is committed to moving
as quickly as possible on a stimulus package and that
President Barack Obama's administration will do everything
possible to restore growth and normalize the markets.
[ID:nWAT010827]

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 105.30
points, or 1.28 percent, to 8,122.80. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX dropped 12.74 points, or 1.52 percent, to
827.50. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC slumped 41.58
points, or 2.76 percent, to 1,465.49.

 The Dow is down 7.5 percent for the month and down 34.4
percent from 52 weeks ago.

 Microsoft traded as low as $17.07, the lowest price since
January 1998, and its largest percentage drop since November
2000. Microsoft ended Nasdaq trading down 11.7 percent at
$17.11.

 GOOGLE'S STRENGTH, AMD'S LOSS

 In a positive sign for tech stocks, Google Inc (GOOG.O)
posted strong fourth-quarter earnings after the close on
Thursday, beating Wall Street's forecasts. [IDnN2247795]

 Google's stock climbed 2.8 percent to $315.18 in extended
trade from a Nasdaq close at $306.50.

 However, the strong earnings from Google were countered by
results from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.N), which reported a
fourth-quarter loss after the closing bell and forecast
decreased revenue in its first quarter.

 AMD also said that Intel (INTC.O) had requested a meeting
related to a patent cross-licensing agreement.

 Shares of AMD fell 5.9 percent to $1.90 in extended
trade.

 JOBS AND HOUSING PICTURE DARKENS

 The U.S. economy showed further signs of deterioration on
Thursday as initial weekly claims for jobless benefits rose to
a seasonally adjusted 589,000, and housing starts sank 15.5
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 550,000 units
-- the lowest on record.

 Adding to concerns in the financial sector, former Merrill
Lynch  Co Chief Executive John Thain is leaving Bank of
America Corp (BAC.N), which recently acquired Merrill, a Bank
of America spokesman said. [ID:nWEN3056] His departure, which
is effective immediately, came less than a week after Bank of
America took $20 billion of government capital to help absorb
Merrill's losses.

Bank of America's stock stumbled 14.5 percent to $5.71.

Investors were not appeased by the Senate Finance
Committee's backing of Timothy Geithner, President Barack
Obama's nominee for U.S. Treasury secretary. The panel's
approval cleared the way for a full Senate confirmation vote.

 However, the process could be delayed until next week if
Republicans object.

 "We are basically leaderless in Treasury," said Tim
Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management
in Bedford Hills, New York. "It's an overhang right now and we
need some leadership."

 Geithner is widely expected to be confirmed by the Senate
as one of Obama's leading players on the team that will tackle
the U.S. recession.

 Shares of long-term disability insurer Aflac Inc (AFL.N)
lost more than a third of their value after a Morgan Stanley
analyst expressed concern about the company's holdings of
hybrid securities issued by European financial institutions.

 Aflac plunged nearly 37 percent to $22.90 on the NYSE.

 In contrast to Microsoft, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares rose
6.7 percent to $88.36 on Nasdaq a day after the iPhone maker
reported stronger-than-expected earnings and gave a solid
outlook for the current quarter, despite the weak economy.

 Trading volume was moderate on the New York Stock
Exchange, with about 1.56 billion shares changing hands,
slightly above last year's estimated daily average of roughly
1.49 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.33 billion shares
traded, roughly equal to last year's daily average of 2.28
billion.

 Declining stocks outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by a
ratio of 7 to 2, while on the Nasdaq, about three stocks fell
for every one that rose.

Johnson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street swooned on
Thursday after a surprisingly grim earnings report from
Microsoft, following European shares lower, while anxious
investors kept the yen near a 13-1/2-year peak against the U.S.
dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. President Barack Obama's nominee to head the Treasury
Department, Timothy Geithner, won approval from a Senate panel,
but it remained unclear how soon the full Senate would act on
his confirmation, adding another element of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The vote could come later on Thursday, but also could be
pushed into next week if one or more Republicans object to a
swift vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are basically leaderless in Treasury," said Tim
Ghriskey, chief investment officer of Solaris Asset Management
in Bedford Hills, New York. "It's an overhang right now and we
need some leadership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even without his status confirmed, Geithner was a
significant factor in financial markets. He lifted the dollar
when he said a strong dollar is in the U.S. national interest,
and sent U.S. government longer-dated bond prices lower after
saying Obama believes China was manipulating its currency.
China is the biggest holder of U.S. Treasuries, with some $682
billion as of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stocks fell after Microsoft (MSFT.O) said it would cut
up to 5,000 jobs over 18 months and would not offer new profit
forecasts for the rest of the fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For full story see [ID:nN22530524].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's top software maker company, blamed
weak personal computer sales, which undercut sales of its
Windows operating system. Its shares fell 11.7 percent, its
biggest one-day percentage loss in more than eight years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a negative surprise for the market, certainly from a
bellwether technology company," said Richard Sparks, senior
equities analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in
Cincinnati, Ohio. "For Microsoft to miss its guidance, it
brings home the pervasive fallout from the credit crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed down 105.3
points, or 1.3 percent, at 8,122.80. The Standard  Poor's 500
Index .SPX dropped 12.74 points, or 1.52 percent, to 827.50.
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC ended lower by 41.58 points,
or 2.76 percent, at 1,465.49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another batch of dismal U.S. economic data, this time on
housing and jobs, also weighed on shares. [ID:nN22528164]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European shares also fell for a fourth straight day. The
FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European stocks fell 0.8
percent, led lower by a 9 percent slump in Nokia shares
(NOK1V.HE) after the company reported disappointing earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude oil CLc1 prices settled 12 cents higher at
$43.67 per barrel, as optimism for an aggressive stimulus
package from the Obama administration helped it claw back from
steep losses earlier in the day that had been sparked by large
stockpile increases in the latest week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOVERNMENT DEBT CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar lost 0.6 percent to 88.77 yen JPY= after
falling to 87.10 yen on Wednesday, the lowest since 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar rose against most other major currencies, with
the euro dipping 0.3 percent to $1.30 EUR= after Geithner
reiterated support for a strong dollar. Sterling was down 0.76
percent at $1.3873 GBP= after fears about the UK banking
sector on Wednesday drove it to its lowest level since 1985.
The British currency has fallen around 6 percent this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geithner's remarks on China, however, weighed on Treasury
debt prices, pushing the benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR
down 14/32 in price, with the yield at 2.60 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expectations of a slew of U.S. debt issuance flooding the
market have been weighing on Treasuries, and some investors
worried the possibility of a tougher U.S. line on Chinese
currency policy could prompt Beijing to purchase less debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Geithner comments on China coupled with the massive
supply is weighing heavily on the long end of Treasuries," said
Andrew Brenner, analyst at MF Global Inc in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sovereign debt worldwide has been under some pressure on
concerns that governments will have to borrow huge amounts to
help fund packages designed to support their economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worries about fiscal balance have driven the cost of
insuring sovereign debt of many major economies to record highs
in recent sessions, according to credit default swaps data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors are also demanding more compensation to hold less
liquid euro zone debt than benchmark German government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spreads of French 10-year bonds over German Bunds are
around 60 basis points, the widest since the euro's inception.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES Jan 22 (Reuters) - International Business
Machines Corp (IBM.N) unveiled a consulting tool on Thursday
that allows companies to reduce both costs and carbon dioxide
emissions in their supply chains.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The offering -- which IBM calls the Supply Chain Network
Optimization Workbench, or SNOW -- comes as companies are under
pressure to both slash expenses amid a slumping global economy
and reduce impact on the environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Built with IBM-branded software, SNOW helps clients review
the number of distribution centers they need and decide whether
to do manufacturing themselves or through a third party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a test, Chinese shipper and logistics company COSCO Ltd
(1199.HK) used the system to reduce the number of distribution
centers it uses to 40 from 100, lowering costs by 23 percent
and cutting carbon dioxide emissions by 15 percent, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you improve the overall efficiency of a system you
can almost automatically lower cost, waste, and environmental
impact," Eric Riddleberger, head of IBM's business strategy
consulting practice, said in a statement.

broadcaster Televisa and U.S. partner Univision settled a
three-year-old lawsuit over royalties on Thursday, setting a
fresh start for the two to expand in the Hispanic media market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa, the world's leading producer of Spanish-language
content, will receive $65 million per year worth of advertising
from privately held Univision from 2009 to 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agreement ends a bitter legal battle that had curbed
Televisa's expansion in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These two folks ought to get back to business. This is a
good first step," said John Keker, Univision's outside counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The settlement will give Televisa nine more years of
national coverage in the coveted U.S. Hispanic market using
Univision's three networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For Univision, it means it will lock in virtually all of
Televisa's shows through 2017, which will help maintain its
leadership in the United States against rival Telemundo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additionally, Televisa will receive $25 million in cash,
though Univision has already paid $21.5 million of this under
protest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under a separate deal announced on Thursday, Televisa
agreed to license to Univision the home games for the three
Televisa-owned soccer teams: America, Necaxa and San Luis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's shares rose on the announcements, reversing
earlier losses. Its stock (TLVACPO.MX) jumped 6.08 percent to
41.70 pesos on the local bourse, while its New York-traded
shares (TV.N) rose 5.2 percent to $15.10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OLD DISPUTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies had been sparring since 2005, when
Televisa filed a lawsuit demanding royalty payments it said
Univision had withheld as part of a long-term programming deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa had alleged that Univision wrongly excluded some
programs for which it was supposed to share advertising
revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The legal battle started after former Univision CEO Jerrold
Perenchio made one of his lieutenants his successor, crushing
Televisa's hopes of putting one of its own at the helm of the
U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fight escalated the following year after Televisa lost
a bid for Univision against a group of investors led by media
tycoon Haim Saban, which offered $12.3 billion for the U.S.
Spanish-language broadcaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa later sold its 11 percent stake in Univision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asked whether the Mexican company would consider taking a
stake in Univision again, Televisa's outside counsel, Marshall
Grossman, said: "There are no discussions of that now. It was
under discussion months ago, but the market conditions are such
that it is not on the table."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp stunned Wall Street with disappointing results that included plans to slash up to 5,000 jobs and a warning that profit and revenue will almost certainly drop over the next two quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news from the world's largest software maker, which had not been expected to report results until after the close of trading on Thursday, sent shock waves across financial markets, pulling down the Nasdaq, and sending U.S. Treasury debt prices higher as investors sought safer assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares dropped as much as 11 percent to their lowest level since January 1998, adding to a 40 percent decline in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company blamed the miss on the weak PC market and the popularity of low-cost netbook computers, which have combined to badly undercut sales of its Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our financial position is solid ... but it is also clear that we are not immune to the effects of the economy," Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told employees in a letter. "Consumers and businesses have reined in spending, which is affecting PC shipments and IT expenditures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market has become so volatile, Microsoft cautioned, that it will not issue earnings or revenue forecasts for the rest of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 -- other than to predict both will very likely be lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is pretty bad when things are deteriorating so fast that even the largest companies in the world don't know how rapidly it is happening," said Jefferies analyst Katherine Egbert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted a profit of $4.17 billion, or 47 cents per share, in its fiscal second quarter ended December 31, versus a profit of $4.71 billion, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts were looking for earnings of 49 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 2 percent to $16.63 billion, missing the average analyst forecast of $17.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales in the Windows segment fell 8 percent, while its Business division, responsible for the Office software package, marked a 1 percent increase. Revenue at the unit that makes the popular 360 Xbox gaming system rose 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the Windows business is expected to perform in line with the weak traditional PC market, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIGGEST JOB CUTS EVER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's staggered elimination of 5,000 jobs -- 1,400 immediately and the rest over 18 months -- amounts to about 5 percent of its estimated 96,000 work force, the biggest reduction ever by the software maker. Other cost cuts include travel and marketing budgets, and the roster of independent contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly business conditions are worse than people were expecting," said Richard Williams, analyst at Cross Research. "This is a substantial amount of jobs cuts. Microsoft has never had a layoff like this in my knowledge and it's sending a signal that the times are definitely changing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job cuts follow similar moves by other technology firms, including ATT Inc, Dell Inc, Motorola Inc and Advanced Micro Devices Inc, all of which are suffering from the global economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft faces a shift by PC buyers to netbooks, which are smaller, stripped-down laptops. Microsoft only gets $60 or less for each sale of Windows for a netbook, compared to $90 for traditional laptops, according to Enderle Group analyst Rob Enderle. Some netbooks also use the rival open-source Linux software instead of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call, Ballmer said Microsoft also lost market share to Apple Inc, which on Wednesday posted surprisingly strong results. Ballmer, whose public histrionics often overshadow a sharp intellect and gift for numbers, was serious in tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are certainly in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime set of economic conditions," Ballmer said, adding that the company is "dealing with unprecedented ground."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the economy, Ballmer said he did not expect a quick rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Ballmer noted that Microsoft will be adding "thousands of jobs" in strategic areas like Internet search, where it has been lagging behind Google Inc, and that he still desires a search partnership with Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said the result of the job cuts and additions would be an overall staff reduction of 2,000 to 3,000 positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said he does not expect significant acquisitions this year, despite hopes from some Yahoo shareholders for a buyout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft were down $2.13 at $17.25, after touching an intraday low of $17.17, the weakest level since January 1998. It was the biggest single-day drop in the stock since an 11.38 percent fall on April 28, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston, and Robert MacMillan and Sinead Carew in New York; Writing by Tiffany Wu and Paul Thomasch; Editing by Derek Caney, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Before the opening bell tomorrow morning, blue-chip conglomerate General
Electric (NYSE: GE) is slated to step into the limelight and release its
quarterly earnings report. Wall Street analysts are currently expecting a profit
of 37 cents per share, down sharply from last year's earnings of 68 cents per
share. Historically, GE has matched these expectations in 3 of the past 4
reporting periods, missing by 13.73% in the quarter ending in March 2008,
according to Zacks. 

However, the brokerage bunch is still downwardly adjusting its expectations, as
my colleague Colleen King reported yesterday. Specifically, King noted that
"Goldman Sachs and Oppenheimer lowered their earning estimates for GE's fourth
quarter to at or near the low end of GE's guidance range of 36 cents to 45 cents
a share." Furthermore, UBS placed the shares on a short-term "sell" status,
citing a risk to the company's dividend and top-tier credit rating.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters.com) -- Microsoft Corp stunned Wall Street with disappointing results that included plans to slash up to 5,000 jobs and a warning that profit and revenue will almost certainly drop over the next two quarters. Here is a copy of an email, obtained by Reuters, from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to Microsoft employees discussing the results and steps taken:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the realities of a deteriorating economy, we're taking important steps to realign Microsoft's business. I want to tell you about what we're doing and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we announced second quarter revenue of $16.6 billion. This number is an increase of just 2 percent compared with the second quarter of last year and it is approximately $900 million below our earlier expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that we are growing at all during the worst recession in two generations reflects our strong business fundamentals and is a testament to your hard work. Our products provide great value to our customers. Our financial position is solid. We have made long-term investments that continue to pay off. But it is also clear that we are not immune to the effects of the economy. Consumers and businesses have reined in spending, which is affecting PC shipments and IT expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our response to this environment must combine a commitment to long-term investments in innovation with prompt action to reduce our costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the second quarter we started down the right path. As the economy deteriorated, we acted quickly. As a result, we reduced operating expenses during the quarter by $600 million. I appreciate the agility you have shown in enabling us to achieve this result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we need to do more. We must make adjustments to ensure that our investments are tightly aligned with current and future revenue opportunities. The current environment requires that we continue to increase our efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the process of adjustments, we will eliminate up to 5,000 positions in RD, marketing, sales, finance, LCA, HR, and IT over the next 18 months, of which 1,400 will occur today. We'll also open new positions to support key investment areas during this same period of time. Our net headcount in these functions will decline by 2,000 to 3,000 over the next 18 months. In addition, our workforce in support, consulting, operations, billing, manufacturing, and data center operations will continue to change in direct response to customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our leaders all have specific goals to manage costs prudently and thoughtfully. They have the flexibility to adjust the size of their teams so they are appropriately matched to revenue potential, to add headcount where they need to increase investments in order to ensure future success, and to drive efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To increase efficiency, we're taking a series of aggressive steps. We'll cut travel expenditures 20 percent and make significant reductions in spending on vendors and contingent staff. We've scaled back Puget Sound campus expansion and reduced marketing budgets. We'll also reduce costs by eliminating merit increases for FY10 that would have taken effect in September of this calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these steps will be difficult. Our priority remains doing right by our customers and our employees. For employees who are directly affected, I know this will be a difficult time for you and I want to assure you that we will provide help and support during this transition. We have established an outplacement center in the Puget Sound region and we'll provide outplacement services in many other locations to help you find new jobs. Some of you may find jobs internally. For those who don't, we will also offer severance pay and other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to eliminate jobs is a very difficult one. Our people are the foundation of everything we have achieved and we place the highest value on the commitment and hard work that you have dedicated to building this company. But we believe these job eliminations are crucial to our ability to adjust the company's cost structure so that we have the resources to drive future profitable growth. I encourage you to attend tomorrow's Town Hall at 9am PST in Caf 34 or watch the webcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is the most challenging economic climate we have ever faced, I want to reiterate my confidence in the strength of our competitive position and soundness of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these changes in place, I feel confident that we will have the resources we need to continue to invest in long-term computing trends that offer the greatest opportunity to deliver value to our customers and shareholders, benefit to society, and growth for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With our approach to investing for the long term and managing our expenses, I know Microsoft will emerge an even stronger industry leader than it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your continued commitment and hard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp shocked Wall Street on Thursday with its poor second-quarter results, and said it would cut as many as 5,000 jobs as it struggles to balance growth and costs amid the worsening economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;

 NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks slid on Thursday,
after Microsoft's (MSFT.O) proposed job cuts and grim earnings
rattled investors, while economic data showed further
deterioration in the labor and housing markets.

 Microsoft Corp's stock fell as much as 11 percent to the
lowest since 1998 and was among the biggest drags on the Dow
and the Nasdaq, after the world's largest software maker said
it would cut up to 5 percent of its estimated work force over
the next 18 months. Microsoft warned that it could no longer
offer profit forecasts for the rest of the fiscal year after
reporting a quarterly profit that fell short of expectations.
For more details, see [ID:nN22530524]. The tech bellwether
further shook up Wall Street by releasing its earnings before
the opening bell, instead of after the close as expected.

 "Coming into some OK earnings numbers from IBM and Apple,
it was thought that Microsoft at least would follow suit,"
said Paul Nolte, director of investments at Hinsdale
Associates in Hinsdale, Illinois.

 "It was always seen that the tech area was one of pretty
good growth and was somewhat immune to the business cycle."

 Microsoft traded as low as $17.19, the lowest price since
January 1998.

 Energy stocks also dove in sync with falling crude oil
prices, with Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) down 2.8 percent at $77.07
and Chevron (CVX.N) down 3.3 percent at $68.86. Both dragged
on the Dow.

 Stock prices and crude oil futures had been pressured
earlier in the session as data showed the U.S. recession has
yet to hit a trough. [ID:nN22528164]

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 207.33
points, or 2.52 percent, to 8.020.77. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX slid 20.71 points, or 2.46 percent, to
819.53. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC tumbled 47.06
points, or 3.12 percent, to 1,460.01.

 Adding to concerns in the financial sector, former Merrill
Lynch  Co Chief Executive John Thain is leaving Bank of
America Corp (BAC.N), which recently acquired Merrill,
effective immediately, a Bank of America spokesman said.
[ID:nWEN3056] His departure came less than a week after Bank
of America took $20 billion of government capital to help
absorb Merrill's losses.

Bank of America's stock slid 14 percent to $5.76.

Shares of long-term disability insurer Aflac Inc (AFL.N)
lost almost a third of their value after a Morgan Stanley
analyst expressed concern about the company's holdings of
hybrid securities issued by European financial institutions.
Aflac plunged nearly 32 percent to $24.71 on the NYSE.

 Investors were not calmed by the Senate Finance
Committee's backing of Timothy Geithner, President Barack
Obama's nominee for U.S. Treasury secretary. The panel's
approval cleared the way for a full Senate confirmation vote
that could be brought to the floor later on Thursday.

 Geithner is widely expected to be confirmed by the Senate
as one of Obama's leading players on the team that will tackle
the U.S. recession.

 The U.S. economy showed further signs of deterioration on
Thursday as initial weekly claims for jobless benefits rose to
a seasonally adjusted 589,000, and housing starts sank 15.5
percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 550,000 units
-- the lowest on record.

 NYMEX crude futures CLc1 fell more than 6 percent, or
$2.70 per barrel, following the U.S. government's oil
inventory report that showed crude oil and gasoline supplies
rose more than expected last week and an unexpected build in
distillate supply.

 On the bright side, Apple Inc (AAPL.O) shares rose 8.1
percent to $89.52 on Nasdaq a day after the iPhone maker
reported stronger-than-expected earnings and gave a solid
outlook for the current quarter, despite the weak economy.

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Grupo Televisa S.A.B. (NYSE:TV) (BMV:TELEVISA CPO) and Univision Communications
Inc. today announced that they have amended the current Program License
Agreement ("PLA"). In connection with the amended PLA, litigation between the
parties underway in Los Angeles federal court has been settled and will be
dismissed. 

In connection with the settlement, the amended PLA, which runs through 2017,
includes a simplified royalty calculation, which will result in increased
payments to Televisa in exchange for incremental rights for Univision.
Specificterms were not disclosed. 

The companies issued the following statement: "We are pleased that today`s
settlement concludes this time-consuming litigation. This settlement serves the
best business interests of both Televisa and Univision. It assures the public
that Univision will continue to have access to consistently top quality Hispanic
programming. It enables Televisa to continue utilizing Univision`s extensive
television networks as an important distribution channel for its content into
the U.S. marketplace. For Univision, it assures that there will be no disruption
in some of its most popular and valuable programming, as well as affording
Univision an ongoing pipeline of future content developed by Televisa." 

Under a separate agreement, Televisa will license to Univision the home games
for the three Televisa-owned teams -- America, Necaxa and San Luis -- for 2009. 

As previously planned, the United States Internet rights to Televisa programming
will be adjudicated in a federal district court in Los Angeles in March 2009.

Johnson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 22 (Reuters) - Wall Street swooned on
Thursday after a surprisingly grim earnings report from
Microsoft, following European shares lower, while anxious
investors kept the yen near a 13-1/2-year peak against the U.S.
dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. President Barack Obama's nominee to head the Treasury
Department won approval from a Senate panel, clearing the way
for a full Senate confirmation vote, and lifted the greenback
when he said a strong dollar is in the U.S. national interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But U.S. government bond prices turned lower after Treasury
Secretary designate Timothy Geithner said Obama believes China
was manipulating its currency. China is the biggest holder of
U.S. Treasuries, with some $682 billion as of November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stocks fell after Microsoft (MSFT.O) said it would cut
up to 5,000 jobs over 18 months and would not offer new profit
forecasts for the rest of the fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For full story see [ID:nN22530524].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's top software maker company, blamed
its profit miss on weak personal computer sales, which undercut
sales of its Windows operating system. Its shares fell more
than 9 percent, bringing losses for the year to 40 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a negative surprise for the market, certainly from a
bellwether technology company," said Richard Sparks, senior
equities analyst at Schaeffer's Investment Research in
Cincinnati, Ohio. "For Microsoft to miss its guidance, it
brings home the pervasive fallout from the credit crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was down 219.43
points, or 2.67 percent, at 8,008.67. The Standard  Poor's 500
Index .SPX was down 22.08 points, or 2.63 percent, at 818.16.
The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was down 52.18 points, or
3.46 percent, at 1,454.89.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another batch of dismal U.S. economic data, this time on
housing and unemployment, also weighed on share prices.
[ID:nN22528164]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European shares also fell for a fourth straight day. The
FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of top European stocks fell 0.8
percent, led lower by a 9 percent slump in Nokia shares
(NOK1V.HE) after the company reported disappointing earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude oil CLc1 prices fell $2.33, or 5.3 percent, to
$41.24 per barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOVERNMENT DEBT CONCERNS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar lost 0.6 percent to 88.87 yen JPY= after
falling as low as 87.10 yen on Wednesday, the lowest since
1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar rose against most other major currencies, with
the euro dipping 0.4 percent to $1.2990 EUR= after Geithner
reiterated support for a strong dollar. Sterling was down 0.7
percent at $1.3880 GBP= after fears about the UK banking
sector on Wednesday drove it to its lowest level since 1985.
The British currency has fallen around 6 percent this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geithner's remarks on China, however, weighed on Treasury
debt prices, pushing the benchmark 10-year note US10YT=RR
down 20/32 in price, with the yield at 2.62 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Expectations of a slew of U.S. debt issuance have been
weighing on Treasury prices, and some investors worried that a
the possibility of a tougher U.S. line on Chinese currency
policy under Obama could prompt Beijing to purchase less debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Geithner comments on China coupled with the massive
supply is weighing heavily on the long end of Treasuries," said
Andrew Brenner, analyst at MF Global Inc in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sovereign debt worldwide has been under some pressure on
concerns that governments will have to borrow huge amounts to
help fund their packages designed to support the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worries about fiscal balance have driven the cost of
insuring sovereign debt of many major economies to record highs
in recent sessions, according to credit default swaps data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors are also demanding more compensation to hold less
liquid euro zone debt than benchmark German government bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spreads of French 10-year bonds over German Bunds are
around 60 basis points, the widest since the euro's inception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 10-year Portuguese/Bund spread hit a new wide of 153
basis points on Wednesday after Portugal became the third euro
zone economy this year to have its credit rating downgraded by
Standard  Poor's.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp posted quarterly results on Thursday that missed Wall Street expectations, announced it would cut up to 5,000 jobs and said it could no longer offer forecasts for the rest of the fiscal year, sending shares down 8.5 percent in early trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted a profit of $4.17 billion, or 47 cents per share, in its fiscal second quarter ended December 31, versus a profit of $4.71 billion, or 50 cents, a year earlier. Analysts were looking for earnings per share of 49 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMMENTS:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRENDAN BARNICLE, ANALYST, PACIFIC CREST SECURITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The interesting thing is that they chose not to preannounce these numbers. Most companies that are going to miss this badly would have preannounced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think what's most damaging is their credibility. It's as if this is something that they discovered today. (To announce) at market-open, the whole follow-up, it's odd."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STEPHEN TAYLOR, ANALYST, DOLMEN SECURITIES, DUBLIN, IRELAND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market had expected job cuts of up to 10 to 15 percent of their workforce so maybe the cost cuts won't be as good as the market expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact they're not giving a view for the rest of the year is a little disappointing for the market but given the strength of its balance sheet and its new Windows 7 product coming up this should be seen as a good long term buying opportunity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YUN KIM, ANALYST, PACIFIC GROWTH EQUITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ON TIMING OF RELEASE)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it has a lot to do with the fact that they're going to let people go today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ON THE RESULTS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously, the Windows business is down quite a bit... People were expecting that to be pretty bad, but this definitely came in a lot worse than what most people were thinking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most surprising is that they will not issue guidance going forward. For Microsoft, a company of this size, to not issue guidance, is not reassuring for a lot of investors out there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now it's all about visibility... It's not what they did in Q4 and the December quarter, but what they're going to guide. That's what's going to drive the stock forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They do a lot of things, but it is still heavily driven by their Windows business. That is where at least 52 percent of their profit comes from."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(ON LAYOFFS)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's probably the right thing to do at this point. They have not had a major layoff in or a significant one in quite a while.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a lot of room for the company to be able to focus more on the operating expense side of the business without affecting the core business because a lot of it was investment spending."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICHARD WILLIAMS, ANALYST, CROSS RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They definitely were substantially below our expectations for the quarter. Clearly, business conditions are worse than people were expecting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a substantial amount of jobs cuts. Microsoft has never had a layoff like this in my knowledge and it's sending a signal that the times are definitely changing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Somebody must have slipped -- that's the only thing I can guess would make them come out and preannounce their own earnings report."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;THOMAS DI GALOMA, HEAD OF U.S. TREASURY TRADING, JEFFERIES  CO, NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The (economic) data was very bullish for the bond market. Then the market started to pick up some of this Microsoft news, where all of a sudden Microsoft is turning and laying off (up to) 5,000 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That happens to be a very big development. Microsoft is a company people feel is in pretty good shape and they're laying 5,000 off. Who's next? You've got a deteriorating economy that is really helping bond prices. That's why bond yields are falling."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOM SOWANICK, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER OF CLEARBROOK FINANCIAL LLC IN PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Microsoft news tells us that the company is now a mature company and is now sensitive to the ebbs and flows of economic activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The job cuts announcement is, like most company layoffs, a lagging economic indicator. Apple on the other hand announced record sales, which highlights the difference between a mature company versus a company that is still creative."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FRANK LESH, FUTURES ANALYST AND BROKER AT FUTUREPATH TRADING LLC IN CHICAGO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're cutting jobs just like everybody else -- another negative on the economy. More job cuts we don't need. Loss of revenue, we don't like seeing that either. Some of this was to be expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think (the futures) have sold off that much on it, we sold off more on the economic data, that's what casting a pall over the market. But this is not good news for Microsoft, there's nothing here to inspire buying, not even buying on weakness at this point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone is waiting. We've got more to deal with right now, so there's no rush into anything right now. We'll get through the earnings season and see what issues have survived and what looks good, but there's no rush into anything right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRIP CHOWDHRY GLOBAL EQUITIES RESEARCH&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a reflection of the extreme pain that's occurring in consumer tech spending as well as enterprise tech spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until the macro conditions are fixed there is no way a tech company can recover."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RICHARD SPARKS, SENIOR EQUITIES ANALYST, SCHAEFFER'S INVESTMENT RESEARCH, CINCINNATI, OHIO&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a negative surprise for the market, certainly from a bellwether technology company. For Microsoft to miss its guidance, it brings home the pervasive fallout from the credit crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On Wednesday, we had been able to bounce from the 8,000 level on the Dow. This (Microsoft news) makes it inevitable to retest the November lows for the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paul Thomasch, Sinead Carew, Jennifer Ablan, Robert MacMillan, Ryan Vlastelica, Richard Leong and Burton Frierson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 22 (Reuters) - Following is the text of Microsoft
(MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer's email to employees on
Thursday:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; From: Steve Ballmer&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To: All Microsoft FTE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subject: Realigning Resources and Reducing Costs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In response to the realities of a deteriorating economy,
we're taking important steps to realign Microsoft's business. I
want to tell you about what we're doing and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Today we announced second quarter revenue of $16.6 billion.
This number is an increase of just 2 percent compared with the
second quarter of last year and it is approximately $900
million below our earlier expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact that we are growing at all during the worst
recession in two generations reflects our strong business
fundamentals and is a testament to your hard work. Our products
provide great value to our customers. Our financial position is
solid. We have made long-term investments that continue to pay
off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But it is also clear that we are not immune to the effects
of the economy. Consumers and businesses have reined in
spending, which is affecting PC shipments and IT expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our response to this environment must combine a commitment
to long-term investments in innovation with prompt action to
reduce our costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During the second quarter we started down the right path.
As the economy deteriorated, we acted quickly. As a result, we
reduced operating expenses during the quarter by $600 million.
I appreciate the agility you have shown in enabling us to
achieve this result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Now we need to do more. We must make adjustments to ensure
that our investments are tightly aligned with current and
future revenue opportunities. The current environment requires
that we continue to increase our efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the process of adjustments, we will eliminate up
to 5,000 positions in RD, marketing, sales, finance, LCA, HR,
and IT over the next 18 months, of which 1,400 will occur
today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; We'll also open new positions to support key investment
areas during this same period of time. Our net headcount in
these functions will decline by 2,000 to 3,000 over the next 18
months. In addition, our workforce in support, consulting,
operations, billing, manufacturing, and data center operations
will continue to change in direct response to customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Our leaders all have specific goals to manage costs
prudently and thoughtfully. They have the flexibility to adjust
the size of their teams so they are appropriately matched to
revenue potential, to add headcount where they need to increase
investments in order to ensure future success, and to drive
efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To increase efficiency, we're taking a series of aggressive
steps. We'll cut travel expenditures 20 percent and make
significant reductions in spending on vendors and contingent
staff. We've scaled back Puget Sound campus expansion and
reduced marketing budgets. We'll also reduce costs by
eliminating merit increases for FY10 that would have taken
effect in September of this calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each of these steps will be difficult. Our priority remains
doing right by our customers and our employees. For employees
who are directly affected, I know this will be a difficult time
for you and I want to assure you that we will provide help and
support during this transition. We have established an
outplacement center in the Puget Sound region and we'll provide
outplacement services in many other locations to help you find
new jobs. Some of you may find jobs internally. For those who
don't, we will also offer severance pay and other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decision to eliminate jobs is a very difficult one. Our
people are the foundation of everything we have achieved and we
place the highest value on the commitment and hard work that
you have dedicated to building this company. But we believe
these job eliminations are crucial to our ability to adjust the
company's cost structure so that we have the resources to drive
future profitable growth. I encourage you to attend tomorrow's
Town Hall at 9am PST in Cafe 34 or watch the webcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While this is the most challenging economic climate we have
ever faced, I want to reiterate my confidence in the strength
of our competitive position and soundness of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With these changes in place, I feel confident that we will
have the resources we need to continue to invest in long-term
computing trends that offer the greatest opportunity to deliver
value to our customers and shareholders, benefit to society,
and growth for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With our approach to investing for the long term and
managing our expenses, I know Microsoft will emerge an even
stronger industry leader than it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thank you for your continued commitment and hard work.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp stunned Wall Street with disappointing results that included plans to slash up to 5,000 jobs and a warning that profit and revenue will almost certainly drop over the next two quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news from the world's largest software maker, which had not been expected to report results until after the close of trading on Thursday, sent shockwaves across financial markets, pulling down the Nasdaq and the U.S. dollar, and sending U.S. Treasury debt prices higher as investors sought safer assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares dropped 9 percent, adding to a 40 percent decline in the past year. It blamed the miss on the weakness of the PC market and the popularity of low-cost netbook computers, which have combined to badly undercut sales of its dominant Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market has become so volatile, Microsoft cautioned, that it has decided against issuing earnings or revenue forecasts for the rest of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 -- other than to predict both will very likely be lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that they are withdrawing guidance is really bad. It adds to uncertainty. It is pretty bad when things are deteriorating so fast that even the largest companies in the world don't know how rapidly it is happening," said Jefferies analyst Katherine Egbert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted a profit of $4.17 billion, or 47 cents per share, in its fiscal second quarter ended December 31, versus a profit of $4.71 billion, or 50 cents, a year earlier. Analysts were looking for earnings per share of 49 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 2 percent to $16.63 billion, missing the average analyst forecast of $17.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will eliminate up to 5,000 jobs in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources and information technology over the next 18 months, including 1,400 jobs on Thursday. That amounts to about 5 percent of its estimated 96,000 work force, the biggest ever cuts by the software maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly business conditions are worse than people were expecting," said Richard Williams, analyst at Cross Research. "This is a substantial amount of jobs cuts. Microsoft has never had a layoff like this in my knowledge and it's sending a signal that the times are definitely changing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job cuts follow similar moves by other tech firms, including ATT Inc, Dell Inc, Motorola Inc and Advance Micro Devices Inc, all of which are suffering from the global economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CUT TRAVEL, SPENDING ON VENDORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will also cut travel spending by 20 percent, eliminate merit salary increases in September, and make significant reductions in spending on vendors and contingent staff. The Redmond, Washington, company will scale back budgets for marketing and the expansion of its Puget Sound campus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Economic activity and IT spend slowed beyond our expectations in the quarter," Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are planning for economic uncertainty to continue through the remainder of the fiscal year, almost certainly leading to lower revenue and earnings for the second half relative to the previous year," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft faces a shift by PC buyers to less expensive netbooks, which are small, stripped-down laptops. Netbooks can run Windows, but Microsoft makes more on each sale of Windows for a PC than it does for a netbook. Some netbooks also use the rival open-source Linux software, which further undercuts Windows sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"PC shipments have really suffered," said Sandeep Aggarwal, an analyst with Collins Stewart LLC. "In the case of Microsoft, this came as a double impact -- on one hand, PC shipments are going down, on the other hand, as the PC shipments slow down, there is still a strong shipment for netbooks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will hold a conference call later this morning, when Chief Executive Steve Ballmer will almost certainly be peppered with questions about slowing Windows sales and its relationship with Yahoo Inc, whose search business has been the object of Microsoft's desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The interesting thing is that they chose not to pre-announce these numbers. Most companies that are going to miss this badly would have pre-announced," said Brendan Barnicle, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think what's most damaging is their credibility. It's as if this is something that they discovered today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell to $17.77 in early trading on the Nasdaq, from their previous close of $19.38. "There's nothing here to inspire buying, not even buying on weakness at this point," said Frank Lesh, a futures analyst and broker at FuturePath Trading LLC in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results come a day after Microsoft rival Apple Inc posted better than expected results and gave an outlook that cheered investors, showing how it was relatively immune to the tech downturn. Other tech companies that warned this week include Nokia, Sony and LG Electronics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Robert MacMillan and Sinead Carew in New York and Jim Finkle in Boston; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Jan 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Mitel(R) has further enhanced the integration of its unified
communications solutions with the suite of Microsoft(R) business
applications including Microsoft(R) Office Communications Server 2007.
These new enhancements include tight integration across Mitel's
comprehensive suite of communications applications from messaging, to
contact center, to collaboration and more.

    The Mitel 3300 IP Communications Platform (ICP) is Microsoft certified
for direct SIP integration with Office Communications Server 2007 without
the need of third-party gateway devices. Only three vendors - Mitel,
Nortel, and Seltatel - are certified for this type of integration(i).

    "Since March 2005 Mitel has been committed to providing customers with
the ability to leverage their Microsoft infrastructure for enhanced
office collaboration," said Paul Butcher, Mitel's president and chief
operating officer. "We will continue to add value for organizations using
Microsoft's business applications by providing a comprehensive unified
communications integration for knowledge workers and specialized roles
such as in vertical markets."

    Customers across the globe are deploying combined Mitel/Microsoft
solutions for a complete unified communications experience that is simple
to use, implement, and manage.

    "As the largest community college in the state of Mississippi,
streamlining communications between faculty, staff, and students across
our five campuses is critical to keeping us at the forefront of providing
quality education programs for over 10,000 students annually," said
Russell Wood, IT director, Hinds Community College. "With the seamless
integration of Mitel's presence-enabled voice solutions with Office
Communications Server 2007, we are able to provide a comprehensive
unified communications solution to staff and students while working in a
collaborative environment independent of location. The combined solution
allows us to solve common business challenges when working across
dispersed campuses."

    The Mitel 3300 ICP supports dual forking and remote call control for
Office Communications Server 2007, enabling simultaneous delivery of
calls to the user's extension and their Microsoft(R) Office Communicator
client, regardless of the user's location. Calls are accepted on either a
desk phone or softphone, according to the user's preference. The 3300 ICP
can also be directly connected to Microsoft(R) Exchange Server 2003 and
2007 without the need for any third-party gateway, further simplifying
deployment.

    Mitel's suite of applications with enhanced integration into Office
Communications Server 2007 includes:

    - Mitel NuPoint Unified Messaging(TM) (UM) - direct integration allows
users to increase efficiency by permitting incoming callers to instantly
hear their Office Communications Server 2007 presence status.

    - Mitel 5550 IP Console - integration allows the operator to see user's
real-time presence information and to communicate via instant message
with users, enabling calls to be managed more efficiently.

    - Mitel Customer Interaction Solutions - integrates presence and
availability directly into the contact center. Agents are able to quickly
determine the presence and availability of colleagues to increase
efficiency, facilitate first-call resolution, and improve the customer
experience. Mitel also integrates into Microsoft Dynamics(TM) CRM to
provide agents with access to customer records. 

    - Mitel 5300 Intelligent Directory - integrates with Microsoft Active
Directory and Office Communications Server 2007 displaying real-time
directory and presence information on a Mitel IP phone, enabling users to
'see' colleagues and their availability for more effective communication.

    - Mitel Unified Communicator(R) (UC) Mobile - meets the needs of mobile
employees, in the office or on the road, for single number accessibility
and presence regardless of device and location.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft reported disappointing earnings on Thursday and plans to cut up to 5,000 jobs as U.S. jobless claims rose more than expected and Asia's two largest economies buckled under the strain of the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China reported economic growth slowed to 6.8 percent in the fourth quarter, dragging down the 2008 rate to a seven-year low of 9.0 percent, and Japan's central bank predicted two years of deflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the trading day reached Europe, top cellphone maker Nokia reported a greater-than-expected dive in fourth-quarter earnings and warned that market volumes would shrink 10 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street futures were already down on the jobless data and a report that housing starts and permits fell to a record low in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then Microsoft shocked the market by reporting results before the opening bell -- hours ahead of time -- and missing already lowered expectations as it said it would stop offering profit forecasts for the rest of the fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's results contrasted with those of IBM and Apple , which both beat forecasts earlier this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results rocked stocks, bonds and currencies as Microsoft stock fell 9 percent, dragging down the Nasdaq which was off 3.3 percent. The dollar briefly extended losses against the yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The (economic) data was very bullish for the bond market. Then ... all of a sudden Microsoft is turning and laying off (up to) 5,000 people," said Thomas di Galoma, head of U.S. Treasury trading for Jefferies  Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is a company people feel is in pretty good shape and they're laying 5,000 off. Who's next?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Capitol Hill in the second day of his confirmation hearings, U.S. Treasury Secretary-designate Timothy Geithner said a strong dollar is in the United States' interest and he said President Barack Obama believes China is manipulating its currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ASIA UNDER STRAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indicating a return of the deflation which ravaged the Japanese economy in the 1990s, the Bank of Japan cut its growth forecasts, predicting the world's No. 2 economy would contract for two full years until March 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier data showed Japanese exports plunged a record 35 percent in December from a year before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The figures showed a collapse in demand across the board with record falls in shipments to the United States, Europe and Asia. The Bank of Japan said it was holding interest rates just above zero and said it would buy corporate bonds to ease a severe funding squeeze which threatens to deepen the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China's statistics bureau said the financial crisis was spreading and China would aim to stimulate domestic demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHINA'S CHALLENGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deceleration of growth (in China) is beyond the market's consensus, which presents a huge challenge to this year's growth target of 8 percent," said Jin Yanshi, chief economist at Sinolink Securities in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea said its economy suffered its second-largest contraction on record in the fourth quarter, pushing Asia's fourth-largest economy closer to its first recession since the regional financial crisis a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In France, consumer spending, the driving force behind the country's growth last year, fell by a larger-than-expected 0.9 percent on the month in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, the Bank of France said it expected negative inflation in the euro zone and the United States for one or several months this year, but this would not amount to deflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once the shock of the fall in energy and food prices -- which could lead to negative inflation rates during certain moments in mid-2009 -- has been absorbed, the evolution of prices should go back into positive territory from next autumn," the Bank said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Reuters bureaus around the world; Editing by Brian Moss)&lt;/p&gt;

with the major indexes down more than 2 percent after a
surprisingly grim earnings report from Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
and economic data that showed further deterioration in the
labor and housing markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, raising worries over how it would fare in the
economic slowdown, said it would cut up to 5,000 jobs over the
next 18 months and that it could no longer offer profit
forecasts for the rest of the fiscal year. For more details,
see [ID:nN22530524]. The stock was among the Dow's biggest
drags, falling 8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a negative surprise for the market, certainly from a
bellwether technology company. For Microsoft to miss its
guidance, it brings home the pervasive fallout from the credit
crisis," said Richard Sparks, senior equities analyst at
Schaeffer's Investment Research in Cincinnati, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On Wednesday, we had been able to bounce from the 8,000
level on the Dow. This (Microsoft news) makes it inevitable to
retest the November lows for the market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results, which had been expected to be released later
in the day, added to the already negative tone after data
showing the number of workers filing new claims for jobless
benefits rose by more than expected last week, while housing
starts and permits fell to a record low in December, data
showed. [ID:nN22525475] [ID:nN21489514].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 195.30 points,

Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC gave up 48.55 points, or 3.22
percent, to 1,458.52.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors were watching for a vote by the U.S. Senate
Finance Committee on the nomination of Timothy Geithner to be
Treasury secretary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geithner faced tough questioning at his confirmation
hearing before the committee on Wednesday. Wall Street had
originally cheered Geithner's nomination but the choice has
since come under controversy over Geithner's failure to pay
some taxes.

companies forced to shed jobs as they deal with slowing
consumer demand and the global economic downturn. Microsoft's
news came on the heels of Intel (INTC.O) saying it would cut as
many as 6,000 jobs, while U.S. chemical maker Huntsman Corp
(HUN.N) said it plans to cut about 1,175 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Intel, the world's largest maker of microprocessors, was
down 3.9 percent at $12.74, while Microsoft shed 8 percent to
$17.83.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; eBay (EBAY.O) lost 11.5 percent to $11.76 after it gave a
disappointing outlook for its current quarter as consumer
spending declined, highlighting concerns that consumers will
continue tightening their belts in the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple (AAPL.O) was a standout to the upside and was among
the biggest lifts on the Nasdaq after it posted quarterly
profit that surpassed Wall Street's expectations on Wednesday
after the closing bell. Shares of the iPod maker were up more
than 7 percent at $89.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors will be watching for a vote by the U.S. Senate

&lt;p&gt;Official Motor Oil and Official Lubricants Designations Renewed Through 2012
CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
As a reflection of the value of the relationship with the nation's number one
motorsport, ExxonMobil today announced the renewal of a long-standing official
partnership with NASCAR for its Mobil 1 motor oil and Mobil brand of lubricant
products. 

The 2009 NASCAR season will mark the seventh consecutive season in which Mobil 1
is the "Official Motor Oil of NASCAR" and the Mobil brand of lubricant products
are the "Official Lubricants of NASCAR." The new agreement extends that official
partnership through the 2012 season. 

"We are excited to extend this relationship with such well known and respected
global brands like Mobil 1 motor oil and Mobil lubricants," said Mike Helton,
president, NASCAR. "Race fans know that when using Mobil 1 and Mobil lubricants,
they`re getting similar performance benefits as those experienced by the world's
top racing teams." 

An industry leader in the development of innovative, problem-solving lubricants,
including synthetics, the Mobil family of automotive lubricants includes motor
oil, transmission fluid, gear lubricants and greases. Used by more than 50
percent of the teams in NASCAR`s top three circuits, race-proven Mobil 1 is the
world's leading synthetic motor oil and meets the industry`s toughest standards,
outperforming all conventional oils. 

"Partnering with NASCAR gives us an excellent platform to fully demonstrate our
products," said Alan Kelly, president, ExxonMobil Lubricants &amp; Petroleum
Specialties Company. "This agreement with NASCAR showcases the engine protection
and performance that Mobil 1 delivers for both NASCAR drivers on the track and
race fans traveling to the track. Everyone at ExxonMobil is looking forward to
another exciting NASCAR season in which Mobil 1 plays such a prominent role." 

A long-time supporter of NASCAR racing, 2009 marks Mobil 1's 18th season as a
major sponsor of Penske Racing`s NASCAR team. Mobil 1 is the primary sponsor of
Sam Hornish Jr. in the #77 Mobil 1 Dodge, an associate sponsor of veteran driver
Kurt Busch in the #2 Miller Lite Dodge and an associate sponsor of driver David
Stremme in the #12 Alltel Dodge.

&lt;p&gt;  BEIJING, Jan 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and eFuture Information Technology Inc. (NASDAQ: EFUT)
announced the launch of a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) Solution for the
retail distribution industry in China. The two companies have
successfully completed the deployment of the solution at select Beijing
Wangfujing Department Store Group ("Wangfujing Group") stores in Beijing,
one of the largest retail groups in China.

    This initiative has brought 2000 of Wangfujing Group's suppliers onto the
platform, allowing them to exchange business information, arrange payments
online and access purchase orders, returns, payment status, inventory
levels and analysis of sales data. When the system is fully operational
throughout the Group's stores in 17 cities across China by the end of
2009, the Group will be able to share the supply chain information real
time with 20,000 suppliers.

    "The ability to manage an efficient supply chain is a prerequisite for
success in the retail industry," said Mr. Changxin Liu, Director of IT
Department/President Assistance, Wangfujing Group. "Wangfujing Group now
serves 10 million customers per day, and we believe the new supply chain
system can enhance our Group's leadership in the China retail market."

    China's retail market has been experiencing exponential growth in the last
20 years, and is forecasted to reach US$1.4 trillion by 2010 to become the
world's second largest market. However, practices inherited from years ago
-- such as manual procurement, manual verification, paper-based statements
and months-long settlement cycles -- can no longer meet the needs of the
new era and the rapid market changes.

    In the new economy, retailers are challenged with the demands of managing
inventories more closely, increasing supply chain efficiencies, increasing
labor productivity and controlling costs. The new SaaS Solution addresses
all of these needs, and provides an effective and scalable solution for
retailers to manage change in a dynamic environment.

    The IBM and eFuture SaaS Solution is delivered through the Web to the
authorized suppliers of the retail businesses. With just an
Internet-connected terminal, an authorized supplier can log onto the
system with designated username and password to handle all their business
transactions from order processing to settlement, and monitor the
transactions. Meanwhile, retailers can also monitor the entire process
including orders, delivery, inventory and payment real time and in a
completely transparent and automated manner.

    IBM and eFuture, a leader in China's supply chain management for the
distribution sector, have started their collaboration since 2005 to
develop software for China's retail industry. IBM integrated its SaaS
infrastructure platform, designed and developed by IBM China Research Lab,
with eFuture's industry solutions. The end-to-end SaaS Solution, running
on WebSphere Application Server and DB2 database, is based on IBM's
advanced SOA technology. The solution covers supply chain execution, task
tracking and performance measurement. IBM is also responsible for the
post-launch operation and maintenance service.

    "SaaS is one of the fastest growing segments of the IT industry because it
provides companies of all sizes with access to the latest, innovative
supply chain solutions delivered remotely via a subscription model," said
Mr. Adam Yan, eFuture's chairman and chief executive officer. "Our retail
software and industry expertise has been taken to the next level following
our partnership with IBM's cutting-edge technologies."

    The SaaS solution helps retailers and their suppliers better synchronize
and share information and analyze business data. This will greatly improve
the productivity, shorten the credit cycle, reduce risks and facilitate
the growth of both demand and supply sides of the businesses. All they
need to do is to pay service fees on a monthly basis, which is as
convenient as paying their water and electricity bills. It can help
retailers reduce its investment in IT systems which in turn will help
China's distribution sector combat the current financial crisis. In
addition, the automated and IT-based settlement system expedites cash
collection to provide suppliers with more working capital and investment
opportunities.

    "This particular solution represents China's first Software-as-a-Service
application," said Mr. David Cheng, vice president, General Business, IBM
Greater China Group. "We selected eFuture to collaborate on our retail
SaaS solution because we believe eFuture has the expertise and best
practices in supply chain management software that, with IBM's integrated
infrastructure and platforms, will bring the greatest flexibility,
competitive competence and return on investment for our customers."

&lt;p&gt;
BERKELEY, Calif., Jan. 22, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- XOMA Ltd. (Nasdaq:XOMA)
today announced that it has received a milestone payment of $500,000 for the
initiation of a Phase 3 clinical trial from Pfizer Inc. (Pfizer), the world's
largest research-based biomedical and pharmaceutical company, pursuant to the
parties' previously-announced license agreement. The agreement grants Pfizer
non-exclusive, worldwide rights to XOMA's patented bacterial cell expression
(BCE) technology for phage display and other research, development and
manufacture of antibody products. The milestone payment arises from the
initiation by Pfizer of Phase 3 clinical trials for an antibody drug candidate,
tanezumab, for the treatment of chronic pain due to osteoarthritis.

"This payment provides further validation of XOMA's antibody research
capabilities and affirms XOMA's ability to capitalize on the value of its
patented technologies," said Steven Engle, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
of XOMA. "We are pleased with Pfizer's progress in their global drug development
efforts, and we look forward to the development of additional products using
XOMA's BCE technology."

"BCE is an enabling technology for antibody phage display discovery and for the
manufacture of bacterially expressed therapeutic antibody products. It is a
proven technology for commercially significant therapeutic antibodies as
demonstrated by the approval of LUCENTIS(r) for wet age-related macular
degeneration and CIMZIA(r) for Crohn's Disease. With over 50 license agreements
in place, BCE continues to be an important enabling technology in antibody
discovery and production," said Mr. Engle.

Under the terms of the agreement signed in 2007, XOMA received an upfront,
non-dilutive cash payment of $30 million. It is eligible for milestone, royalty
and other fees on future sales of all products subject to this license,
including products currently in late-stage clinical development.

XOMA has licensed its BCE technology to many major pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies, including Merck &amp; Co., Inc., Centocor, Inc. and Alexion
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. for use in the development and manufacture of marketed and
investigational therapeutic antibody products. Under a license agreement with
Genentech, Inc., XOMA currently receives royalties for their marketed
therapeutic antibody product, LUCENTIS(r), which was approved by the Food and
Drug Association (FDA) in June of 2006 and in the European Union, where it is
distributed by Novartis AG, in January of 2007. LUCENTIS(r) (ranibzumab) is an
antibody fragment to Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF).

BCE technology is also employed for the production of CIMZIA(r) (certolizumab),
UCB S.A.'s anti-TNF (Tumor Necrosis Factor) alpha antibody fragment, which was
approved by the FDA in April of 2008 for the treatment of moderate to severe
Crohn's disease in adult patients who have not responded to conventional therapy
and is currently under review for approval in rheumatoid arthritis by the FDA in
the U.S. and by the European Medicines Agency in Europe.

Bacterial Cell Expression Technology

Bacterial cell expression technology (BCE) is an enabling technology used to
discover and screen, as well as develop and manufacture, recombinant antibodies
for commercial purposes. BCE is also a key technology used in multiple systems
for high-throughput screening of antibody domains. Expression of antibodies by
phage display technology, for example, depends on the expression and secretion
of antibody domains from bacteria as properly folded, functional proteins.

XOMA scientists were the first to demonstrate the secretion of antibody domains
directly from the bacterial cells as fully functional, properly folded
molecules. XOMA has received ten U.S. patents to date relating to aspects of its
BCE system, including six patents that broadly cover the secretion of
immunoglobulins from bacteria, including antibody fragments such as Fab and
single-chain antibodies. Corresponding foreign patents have also been granted.
XOMA's intellectual property estate is applicable to the practice of antibody
phage display and other antibody screening applications.

About XOMA

XOMA discovers, develops and manufactures therapeutic antibody and other agents
designed to treat inflammatory, autoimmune, infectious and cancerous diseases.
The company's proprietary product pipeline includes XOMA 052, an anti-IL-1 beta
antibody, and XOMA 3AB, a biodefense anti-botulism antibody candidate.

XOMA's proprietary development pipeline is primarily funded by multiple revenue
streams resulting from the licensing of its antibody technologies, product
royalties, development collaborations and biodefense contracts. XOMA's
technologies and experienced team have contributed to the success of marketed
antibody products, including RAPTIVA(r) (efalizumab) for chronic moderate to
severe plaque psoriasis, LUCENTIS(r) (ranibizumab injection) for wet age-related
macular degeneration and CIMZIA(r) (certolizumab pegol) for Crohn's disease.

The company has a premier antibody discovery and development platform that
incorporates leading antibody phage display libraries and XOMA's proprietary
Human Engineering(TM) and bacterial cell expression and manufacturing
technologies. Bacterial cell expression (BCE) is a key breakthrough
biotechnology for the discovery and manufacturing of antibodies and other
proteins. As a result, more than 50 pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies
have signed BCE licenses.

In addition to developing its own products, XOMA develops products with premier
pharmaceutical companies including Novartis AG, Schering-Plough Research
Institute and Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. XOMA has a fully integrated
product development infrastructure, extending from pre-clinical science to
approval, and a team of 200 employees at its Berkeley location. For more

&lt;p&gt;Jan 22 (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp
(IBM) employees have informed Alliance@IBM, an affiliate of the
Communication Workers of America, that workers at a number of
locations have been told their jobs are being eliminated, the
Wall Street Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The paper quoted Lee Conrad, national coordinator for
Alliance, as saying he received a number of reports of people
being informed that they are subject to what IBM calls a
"resource action."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conrad said that the reports are coming from people who work
for the software group in applications development and
marketing, among other functions, the paper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM could not be immediately reached for comment, when
contacted by Reuters. The Wall Street Journal said an IBM
spokesman declined to comment on the reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company on Tuesday had issued a 2009 profit outlook that
beat Wall Street expectations, underscoring the ability of the
world's top technology services firm to weather the global
downturn and boosting its shares 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its fourth-quarter earnings had also trumped analysts'
expectations.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research picks IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM) as Bull of the Day and
Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) as Bear of the Day. In addition, the analysts at
Zacks Equity Research discuss the latest on Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE: RAD),
Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT) and Amdocs Ltd. (NYSE: DOX). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at: http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678

Bull of the Day

On January 20, 2008, IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM) announced its fiscal 2008 4th quarter
results that were mixed, with revenue coming in below expectations but pro forma
EPS beating our expectation. Net income from continuing operations were $4.4
billion versus $4.0 billion in the same quarter last year. With aggressive
cost-cutting, diluted earnings from continuing operations for the quarter
reached $3.28, up 17.1% from $2.80 in the prior-year quarter. 

Total revenue of $27.0 billion was down 6.4% (down 1.0% when adjusted for
currency) from $28.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. Earnings were boosted by a
reduction in the tax rate in the 4th quarter. 

We were ahead of the Street in our expectations for the 4th quarter and for
full-year 2009. 

Given strong performance in the 4th quarter, IBM provided its EPS outlook for
fiscal 2009. It expects full-year EPS of at least $9.20, which is a growth rate
of 3.0% over 2008 reported EPS. IBM also expects its full-year 2009 tax rate to
be sustained at approximately 26.5%. 

Bear of the Day

We are downgrading Halliburton Company (NYSE: HAL) shares to Sell from Buy to
reflect our growing concerns about the weakening outlook for the domestic
natural gas market, where the company enjoys a strong leverage through its
premier position in the pressure pumping business. 

Demand for pressure pumping closely tracks the overall rig count, which in turn
reflects spending plans by E players. Pressure pumping is an umbrella term
used to describe a number of vital services performed on new and existing
(producing) wells. 

While the current U.S. rig count is already down roughly 24% from its all-time
peak in August 2008, we see significant room for further declines in the coming
months before the market stabilizes. This expected drop in activity levels will
weigh on the outlook for pressure pumping even after the resumption of normal
activity levels towards the end of 2009, in our view. 

Recent Analysis from the Analyst Blog

Rite Aid Feels Wal-Mart Pressure

Management at Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE: RAD) was executing a turnaround
strategy centered on increasing the profitability of the existing store base.
However, management acquired Brooks Eckerd prior to a convincing turnaround in
profitability and increased the debt burden of the company. 

Moreover, Wal-Mart's (NYSE: WMT) entrance into the retail generic drug market
began pressuring the company's pharmacy margin. 

Given the weakness of front-end sales, especially in the latest reported
quarter, and management's continual lowering of EPS guidance (for larger net
losses), the stock's rating is a Sell. 

Amdocs Buy Rec Reiterated

Amdocs Ltd. (NYSE: DOX), a leading provider of CRM and billing software for
communications service providers, continues to perform in line with our
expectations, supported by its industry-leading technology integration products
for large-scale transformational projects and managed services. 

Long-term fundamentals remain firm as a result of global telecom carriers'
transition to converged and consolidated solutions. In addition, the company
maintains a strong financial position with a healthy order backlog. Management
indicated caution with respect to near-term business performance based on global
economic uncertainties which may generate some fluctuations in its near-term
results. We confirm our Buy recommendation on the shares.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A. de C.V. (NYSE: KOF), Regions Financial Corp. (NYSE: RF),

Renewable Energy Holdings (NYSE: AVR).

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Coca-Cola FEMSA Stays a Buy

We are keeping our Buy recommendation on Coca-Cola FEMSA S.A. de C.V. (NYSE:
KOF). The company posted slightly lower-than-expected results for the third
quarter of 2008 due to losses in derivatives and currency exchange losses, but
the results in the Mercosur division were particularly impressive. 

We believe that going forward, new lines of business combined with the recent
acquisitions will enhance its topline growth despite the difficult economic
environment throughout the world, including Mexico. 

Regions Financial Misses Ests

Prior to market open, Regions Financial Corp. (NYSE: RF) reported its earnings
for 4Q08. Core results were a negative $0.35 per share, versus $0.24 per share
in 4Q-07. 

The difference from our expectations reflected a higher-than-expected provision
for losses (from the accelerated disposition of problem assets), impairment of
MSRs [mortgage servicing rights], the effects of preferred stock issuance (via
the Treasury`s Capital Purchase Program), and lower-than expected service charge
on deposits and Trust income, which were somewhat offset by the tax settlement
benefit covered for tax years 1999-2006. 

Logitech Intl's Grim Numbers

Logitech International (NASDAQ: LOGI) announced financial results for the third
quarter of fiscal year 2009. Sales for Q3-09 were $627 million (as compared to
our estimate of $637 million and the average Street estimate of $699 million), a
decrease of 16 percent versus $744 million in the same quarter last year. 

Operating income was $43 million, a decrease of 63 percent compared to $116
million in the same quarter a year ago. Net income was $40 million - = $0.22 per
share - (as compared to our estimate of $0.39 per share and the average Street
estimate of $0.43) versus Q3-08 net income of $134 million - = $0.71 per share -
which included a net realized gain on sales of short-term investments of $27.8
million and an impairment loss of $5.5 million on the value of short-term
investments. Gross margin for the Q3-09 was 29.9 percent compared to 36.9
percent in Q3-08. 

PetMed Express: Good Entry Point

Before the bell today, PetMed Express (NASDAQ: PETS) reported solid results for
the third quarter of fiscal 2009. The company had sales of $43.4 million, up 16%
over the third quarter of fiscal 2008, and earnings per share of $0.21, up 15%
over the year-ago quarter. Sales were slightly above the Zacks consensus
estimate of $43 million, and its EPS beat the Zacks consensus by $0.01. 

That said, even PetMed couldn`t completely escape the clutches of consumer
tightening their belts. The company`s third quarter gross margin decreased by 70
basis points year-over-year (and was 30 basis points lower than our forecast),
but the company was able to reduce its general and administrative expense by 40
basis points to help offset its lower gross margin. 

Aventine Fueled by Ethanol

Aventine Renewable Energy Holdings (NYSE: AVR) is a producer and marketer of
corn-based ethanol. On October 2nd, 2008, the company completed the buy-out of
its minority partner Nebraska Energy Cooperative's stake (21.58%) in Nebraska
Energy, LLC. 

Aside from direct ethanol production, the company also sells co-products and
bio-products, and markets ethanol for other producers. Co-products such as
distillers' grain are produced in tandem with ethanol and help offset corn
feedstock costs.

whose search business has been the object of the leading
software maker's desires.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Google reports quarterly results amid questions over
whether it can sustain its growth momentum in a slow economy
with companies closely scrutinising their Internet advertising
dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Capital One Financial (COF.N), one of the largest issuers
of MasterCard and Visa credit cards, is expected to report a 33

quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.N) report results

a revenue warning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Lockheed Martin (LMT.N), the world's biggest military
contractor, is expected to report modestly higher quarterly
earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * UnitedHealth (UNH.N) kicks off the fourth-quarter

the company will give them reasons to buy shares of the beaten

expectations on strong iPod and Mac computer sales, and the
company gave an outlook that cheered investors in extended
trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Also in extended trading, Intel (INTC.O) gained after the
chip maker said that it would close sites in Asia and scale back
operations in the United States in a restructuring that could
affect up to 6,000 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares of eBay (EBAY.O) fell in extended trade after the
online auctioneer posted a lower fourth-quarter profit and gave
a disappointing outlook for its current quarter as consumer
spending declines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * In macroeconomic news, weekly jobless claims are due from
the Labor Department at 1330 GMT. The jobless figure is expected
to have risen to 540,000, up from 524,000 the previous week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * The U.S. Housing Starts/Building Permits for December is

&lt;p&gt;  (Refiles to fix attribution in 5th paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Jan 22 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is
reviewing its business plans in Indonesia, but remains
committed to developing natural gas fields offshore from East
Kalimantan, Borneo island, the U.S. major said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Gehem and Gendalo natural gas projects in the Makassar
Strait would be the deepest offshore gas fields in Indonesia,
at water depths ranging from 2,500-6,000 feet (760-1,800
metres), an official at oil watchdog BPMIGAS told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, Indonesia's biggest oil producer, previously said
it planned to invest about $6 billion to develop gas fields off
Borneo, including the Gehem and Gendalo projects, which would
help Indonesia to crank up its flagging gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are currently reviewing our business plans as part of
our normal business planning process and in light of changes in
the business environment," Chevron spokesman Gareth Johnstone
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That said, we are committed to developing the deepwater
projects in the Kutei Basin. We look forward to working in
partnership with the Government of Indonesia and BPMIGAS in
developing these fields," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil companies throughout the world have been reevaulating
energy developments given a collapse in oil prices, which has
made some projects uneconomic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deepwater projects are particularly expensive to develop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An official for energy watchdog BPMIGAS said there was no
proposal to review the Makassar Strait project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combined natural gas reserves in the area covered by
the plan are estimated at more than 3 trillion cubic feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, which has far more gas than oil, has pushed
companies to move faster in developing areas as the country
badly needs the gas for domestic industries and exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron currently produces gas from several other fields in
East Kalimantan, but the output is in decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Muklis Ali; Writing by Jennifer Henderson/Ed

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. senator has asked Microsoft Corp about its plans to slash up to 5,000 jobs, urging the world's biggest software company to preserve the jobs of Americans ahead of foreigners working on visas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc, the world's largest drugmaker, is in talks to buy Wyeth, sources familiar with the situation said on Friday, and one source put the possible value of the deal at about $67 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer may pay about $50 per share for Wyeth, but the price may change as negotiations continue throughout the weekend, the source said. At $50 per share, Wyeth would fetch roughly $66.6 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such an acquisition, which sources said could come within days, would help Pfizer cope with a major gap in revenue in 2011 when its blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol treatment will begin to face U.S. generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Pfizer and Wyeth declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would diversify Pfizer into vaccines and injectable biologic medicines by adding Wyeth's big-selling Prevnar vaccine for childhood infections and Enbrel rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Pfizer would realize major cost savings by streamlining areas that overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the deal also raises questions about whether another huge acquisition is the right medicine for Pfizer, which has struggled after digesting two huge deals in the past decade. And it threatens to spark another round of layoffs in the drug industry at a time the U.S. economy is already on its knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's eminently doable," said Barbara Ryan, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. "The question is whether others enter the fray. It's going to come down to price. The deal is attractive at this price, it's not attractive at any price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan said Pfizer could pursue Bristol-Myers Squibb or biotech giant Amgen Inc if a Wyeth deal falls through. Biogen Idec has also been mentioned as a possible Pfizer target, Credit Suisse analyst Catherine Arnold said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has secured roughly $25 billion in funding for the Wyeth deal, one source close to the talks said. Getting financing for the deal helps Pfizer surpass one of the biggest hurdles amid tight credit markets. Pfizer would pay more cash than stock in the deal, but final details have yet to be nailed down, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer would pay two-thirds of the cost in cash and a third in stock for Madison, New Jersey-based Wyeth, The Wall Street Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks were accelerating on Friday and a deal could be announced in the near term, one source said, while cautioning that negotiations could still fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer had $26 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on its balance sheet, as of its latest quarterly filing. It had $16.3 billion in short-term borrowings and long-term debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One complication to the financing is that some of the cash on Pfizer's balance sheet is overseas and it would have to repatriate those funds to purchase Wyeth, one source explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer may be able to purchase Wyeth's international assets separately and thus avoid the tax and foreign-exchange complications of repatriating funds, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth shares closed up $4.91, or 12.6 percent, at $43.74 on the New York Stock Exchange. Pfizer rose 24 cents, or 1.4 percent, to close at $17.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth has been in talks to buy Dutch vaccine firm Crucell, whose shares fell 9.6 percent on Friday on fears that deal might now be in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sources told Reuters the Pfizer-Wyeth talks will not necessarily scuttle Wyeth's Crucell deal.  Wyeth has been holding talks with both Pfizer and Crucell in recent weeks, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANOTHER DEAL FOR PFIZER?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer became the world's largest drugmaker with its purchase in 2000 of Warner-Lambert and the $60 billion acquisition three years later of Pharmacia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question for investors, many of whom continue to hold the stock largely because of its industry-topping dividend, is whether another acquisition of that scale will revive Pfizer over the long term, or only temporarily boost results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a huge acquisition could make it harder for the merged company to grow from its larger revenue base and to prevent bureaucracy from stifling innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer exemplifies the overriding problem for many large drugmakers, which have struggled to produce new blockbusters to replace those on which they lose exclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have, for many quarters now, said that Pfizer essentially has no realistic way of replacing the many drugs that are scheduled to go generic apart from doing a mega-merger," Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global economic downturn has created a buyer's market for cash-rich drugmakers, prompting several deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth's market capitalization as of Thursday was about $52 billion, so at $60 billion, the deal would represent a 15 percent premium. Pfizer was valued at about $118 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COST SAVINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from Enbrel, for which Wyeth shares rights with Amgen, and Prevnar, Wyeth also is developing experimental Alzheimer's disease drugs, which could be a major opportunity although some believe such drugs are a longshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer would also gain Wyeth's large consumer health division that includes Advil painkillers more than two years after it sold off its own consumer health business to Johnson  Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's fortunes rose initially after its Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia deals thanks to huge merger-related cost savings, and outright ownership of Lipitor from Warner-Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently its performance flagged and shares dropped to more than 10-year lows in late 2008, after savings dried up and its $7 billion-a-year research budget failed to bear much fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which reports fourth-quarter earnings next week, has said it expects 2008 revenue to be roughly similar to its 2007 revenue of $48 billion. It expects decent profit growth thanks to deep cost cuts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - News that Pfizer Inc is in talks to acquire Wyeth for more than $60 billion may flush out other bidders for the U.S. drugmaker and trigger a long-predicted consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its lucrative vaccine business and biotechnology drugs not facing imminent patent expirations, Wyeth has become a target for companies bracing for generic competition for their most important drugs while struggling with development pipelines that have recently yielded few major new medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the pharma companies are desperate, so it's possible someone else comes in here," said Jon LeCroy, an analyst with Natixis Bleichroeder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's probably more likely that we see some of the other companies get bidders, and Bristol is the name that's being thrown around," LeCroy said of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, which several analysts suggested as a potential takeover target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schering-Plough Corp , which has limited exposure to generics between 2011 and 2013 when many drugmakers lose patent protection on their biggest medicines, is also often mentioned as an attractive acquisition candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse analyst Catherine Arnold, in a research note said: "A Pfizer/Wyeth deal may mark the beginning of a year of sector consolidation and could trigger other pharma-pharma or pharma-biotech deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Other companies that we think may have an interest in Wyeth include Novartis, Merck and Sanofi-Aventis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey-based Wyeth faces its own patent crisis in 2010, when its Effexor XR anti-depressant loses protection. Moreover, its ulcer drug Protonix unexpectedly was hit by generic competition a year ago, and the company suffered delays or rejections for a number of its experimental medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Wyeth has much to offer and may not simply be Pfizer's for the taking despite the New York-based company's position as the world's largest drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer can't come in like a white knight and pick them off on the cheap," Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. "I think they'd (Wyeth) do it at the right price, but I don't think they'd sell at a cheap premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From Wyeth's perspective, they have a strong pipeline of experimental drugs, and more importantly, a robust lineup of marketed biologics, with Enbrel and Prevnar," Conover said, referring to the company's rheumatoid arthritis drug and childhood vaccine that are both blockbusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth shareholders are likely to embrace a deal, whether from Pfizer or another bidder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our sense is that some Wyeth shareholders have been waiting for the day when Wyeth would get acquired," Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that even without Wyeth's consent Pfizer ... could likely find a receptive shareholder base."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natixis' LeCroy agreed that the deal would be a boon to Wyeth shareholders. Wyeth shares, which closed on Thursday at $38.83 before news of talks broke, have traded in the past year as low as $28.07. They rose 12.64 percent to close at $43.74 on Friday after the news broke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Pfizer does end up bidding for them, (Wyeth shares) will be significantly higher than where the stock has traded recently," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The losers from such a deal and industry consolidation, however, are sure to be many of Wyeth's 47,500 employees and quite possibly the struggling U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They'll slash Wyeth to the bone," LeCroy said of Pfizer's likely cost-cutting strategy post acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's bad for the industry and the economy as a whole because we're going to see massive amounts of job losses in the pharmaceutical industry," LeCroy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've already seen a lot and it's only going to increase as these mergers start happening, so in a way that ends up being bad for everyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The $60 billion price tag on Pfizer Inc's potential purchase of Wyeth may seem like a staggering number amid tight credit markets, but the cash-rich balance sheets and marquee names of the companies could help Pfizer secure funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's talks to buy Wyeth accelerated after news of the possible deal emerged in the media, sources familiar with the situation said. A deal could be reached in the near term, although the talks could fall apart at any time, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal, which could be financed with a mix of cash and stock, hinges on whether Pfizer can get enough funding. CNBC said Pfizer was seeking $25 billion in financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The credit markets are tight, but if you're going to lend to anyone, you're going to lend to a triple-A rated company with $17 billion in cash flow plus cash on its books," said Andy Baker, a special situations strategist with Jefferies  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volume of mergers worldwide dropped 30 percent last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters, as tight credit markets, the U.S. recession and swooning global financial markets made it difficult and costly to borrow money to do deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The economic outlook is extremely challenging; credit markets continue to be extraordinarily challenging," Philip Yea, chief executive of British private equity firm 3i Group Plc, told a conference organized by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the next couple of years, capital is the most precious thing around," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has said it expects $17 billion to $18 billion in cash flow from operations in 2008. According to its latest quarterly filing, the company had $26 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on its balance sheet. It had $16.3 billion in short-term borrowings and long-term debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if you assume the deal is half stock and half cash, that's still $30 billion in cash to raise. They can't just write a check easily, since a lot of their cash sits on their books overseas," Baker said. "But a company with this name, this balance sheet and this credit rating could possibly raise the money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Krensavage, principal of Krensavage Asset Management, said Wyeth has $4 billion in annual free cash flow and that Pfizer could borrow as much as $57 billion at 10 percent interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth's cash flow would be on top of any cost-cutting and revenue benefits Pfizer could squeeze from products in Wyeth's drug pipeline that prove successful, Krensavage said. As a result, the economics would make sense for a deal valued at roughly $60 billion, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our view all along is these companies are among the select few companies in the world that can get financing to do these kinds of transactions," said Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. "The cash flow of the new company would be $20-plus billion every single year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is not the only drug company looking for mega-funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roche Holding AG is expected to raise its bid for the 44 percent of Genentech Inc it does not already own, but it still must work out funding details, sources previously told Reuters Loan Pricing Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Swiss drugmaker Roche offered $43.7 billion, or $89 per share, to acquire the 44 percent stake. Bankers said Roche is now waiting for the right moment to tap the difficult, expensive and illiquid credit markets before raising its bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every deal out there trying to get done is competing with every other deal for funding. But it's not impossible that marquee names like Roche and Pfizer both get their deals done," said one investment banker who declined to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, even if Pfizer succeeds in securing financing, a deal may not be the best idea for Wyeth, some analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The negative impact on Pfizer's credit profile of the staggering amount of additional debt would offset much of the benefit to Wyeth of being bought by a near triple-A credit (company)," Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson said in a research report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Paritosh Bansal, Megan Davies and Ransdell Pierson; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For more MA news and our DealZone blog, go to here)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Jeff Kindler has called mega-mergers disruptive and distracting, but desperation over the impending patent loss on the world's best-selling drug may be just the shotgun steering Pfizer to the altar with U.S. rival Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is in talks to acquire Wyeth for more than $60 billion, sources say, in what would be its third giant acquisition after purchases of Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia made it the biggest name in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last March, Pfizer laid out a strategy for dealing with the 2011 loss of patent protection on its $12 billion a year cash cow, the cholesterol drug Lipitor, that did not involve huge acquisitions. But the failure of its research pipeline to yield many major new medicines appear to have renewed Pfizer's appetite for big deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it shows their desperation," said Natixis Bleichroeder analyst Jon LeCroy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without a pipeline it doesn't much matter what a company does. Kindler's been there a couple of years now, and the view is not much has been done," LeCroy said. "So this was sort of inevitable if he wanted to keep his job."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said buying Wyeth, with its lucrative vaccines, biotechnology medicines and consumer products, may be Pfizer's only choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer's RD (research and development) track record has not been a good one and the sheer volume of product it stands to lose to generics means it would have to have unprecedented RD success to overcome these future losses," Anderson wrote in a research note. "Buying another company like Wyeth may therefore be the only realistic solution for Pfizer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was clearly not the way Kindler saw things last year, when he told journalists that large acquisitions "can be very disruptive; it can slow things down and distract people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company declined to comment on reports that it was in negotiations with Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it represents a departure from recent policy, because at least all public statements prior to about three months ago were that Pfizer would do bolt-on acquisitions, or product acquisitions, but not a mega-merger," said Sam Isaly, portfolio manager of OrbiMed Advisors, who believes almost all mega-mergers in the past 15 years, including those by Pfizer, have failed to reward investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Pfizer's shares are trading just above 10-year lows hit late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jeff Kindler is the most recent in a long string of losers at Pfizer," said Isaly, who is not one to mince words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He really inherited a junk pile. Even so, his board is going to insist that he do something. He doesn't have much more time left, nor should he have much time left," Isaly said of the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Isaly, LeCroy expressed skepticism about whether the deal makes sense for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it's going to pay off for them," LeCroy said. "Pfizer's problem was they were already too big, and so just making the company bigger doesn't solve the issue. The real issue is the RD productivity is not there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mike Krensavage, principal at Krensavage Asset Management, said: "The pros of a Pfizer/Wyeth deal probably outweigh the cons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Wyeth next year loses patent protection on its own top drug, the antidepressant Effexor XR, Krensavage said it has no other major patent expirations in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hopefully, biologics from Wyeth would give Pfizer a more sustainable revenue base because these products tend to provide evergreen sales," he said, noting the lack in the United States of a pathway for generic versions of biotech medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krensavage estimated Wyeth shares are worth $51 each, given the value of the drugmaker's marketed products and assets, whereas a $60 billion deal would value them at only $45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wyeth is cheap enough so that the downside for Pfizer is not too steep," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; * Deal could be roughly $67 billion - source&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Big takeover could help Pfizer make up for Lipitor loss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Wyeth would expand Pfizer into vaccines, biologics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Shares of Wyeth close up 12.6 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson and Jessica Hall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK/PHILADELPHIA, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc
(PFE.N), the world's largest drugmaker, is in talks to buy
Wyeth WYE.N, sources familiar with the situation said on
Friday, and one source put the possible value of the deal at
about $67 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer may pay about $50 per share for Wyeth, but the price
may change as negotiations continue throughout the weekend, the
source said. At $50 per share, Wyeth would fetch roughly $66.6
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such an acquisition, which sources said could come within
days, would help Pfizer cope with a major gap in revenue in
2011 when its blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol treatment will
begin to face U.S. generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spokesmen for Pfizer and Wyeth declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It would diversify Pfizer into vaccines and injectable
biologic medicines by adding Wyeth's big-selling Prevnar
vaccine for childhood infections and Enbrel rheumatoid
arthritis treatment. Pfizer would realize major cost savings by
streamlining areas that overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the deal also raises questions about whether another
huge acquisition is the right medicine for Pfizer, which has
struggled after digesting two huge deals in the past decade.
And it threatens to spark another round of layoffs in the drug
industry at a time the U.S. economy is already on its knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think it's eminently doable," said Barbara Ryan, an
analyst with Deutsche Bank. "The question is whether others
enter the fray. It's going to come down to price. The deal is
attractive at this price, it's not attractive at any price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ryan said Pfizer could pursue Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N)
or biotech giant Amgen Inc (AMGN.O) if a Wyeth deal falls
through. Biogen Idec (BIIB.O) has also been mentioned as a
possible Pfizer target, Credit Suisse analyst Catherine Arnold
said.[ID:nN23324733]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has secured roughly $25 billion in funding for the
Wyeth deal, one source close to the talks said. Getting
financing for the deal helps Pfizer surpass one of the biggest
hurdles amid tight credit markets. Pfizer would pay more cash
than stock in the deal, but final details have yet to be nailed
down, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer would pay two-thirds of the cost in cash and a third
in stock for Madison, New Jersey-based Wyeth, The Wall Street
Journal reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks were accelerating on Friday and a deal could be
announced in the near term, one source said, while cautioning
that negotiations could still fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-based Pfizer had $26 billion in cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments on its balance sheet, as
of its latest quarterly filing. It had $16.3 billion in
short-term borrowings and long-term debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One complication to the financing is that some of the cash
on Pfizer's balance sheet is overseas and it would have to
repatriate those funds to purchase Wyeth, one source
explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer may be able to purchase Wyeth's international assets
separately and thus avoid the tax and foreign-exchange
complications of repatriating funds, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth shares closed up $4.91, or 12.6 percent, at $43.74 on
the New York Stock Exchange. Pfizer rose 24 cents, or 1.4
percent, to close at $17.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth has been in talks to buy Dutch vaccine firm Crucell
CRCL.AS, whose shares fell 9.6 percent on Friday on fears
that deal might now be in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But sources told Reuters the Pfizer-Wyeth talks will not
necessarily scuttle Wyeth's Crucell deal. [ID:nLN750308] Wyeth
has been holding talks with both Pfizer and Crucell in recent
weeks, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ANOTHER DEAL FOR PFIZER?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer became the world's largest drugmaker with its
purchase in 2000 of Warner-Lambert and the $60 billion
acquisition three years later of Pharmacia. [ID:nLN45335]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The question for investors, many of whom continue to hold
the stock largely because of its industry-topping dividend, is
whether another acquisition of that scale will revive Pfizer
over the long term, or only temporarily boost results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ultimately, a huge acquisition could make it harder for the
merged company to grow from its larger revenue base and to
prevent bureaucracy from stifling innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer exemplifies the overriding problem for many large
drugmakers, which have struggled to produce new blockbusters to
replace those on which they lose exclusivity. [ID:nN23318400]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have, for many quarters now, said that Pfizer
essentially has no realistic way of replacing the many drugs
that are scheduled to go generic apart from doing a
mega-merger," Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in
a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The global economic downturn has created a buyer's market
for cash-rich drugmakers, prompting several deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth's market capitalization as of Thursday was about $52
billion, so at $60 billion, the deal would represent a 15
percent premium. Pfizer was valued at about $118 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COST SAVINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aside from Enbrel, for which Wyeth shares rights with
Amgen, and Prevnar, Wyeth also is developing experimental
Alzheimer's disease drugs, which could be a major opportunity
although some believe such drugs are a longshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer would also gain Wyeth's large consumer health
division that includes Advil painkillers more than two years

Johnson (JNJ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's fortunes rose initially after its Warner-Lambert
and Pharmacia deals thanks to huge merger-related cost savings,
and outright ownership of Lipitor from Warner-Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Recently its performance flagged and shares dropped to more
than 10-year lows in late 2008, after savings dried up and its
$7 billion-a-year research budget failed to bear much fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which reports fourth-quarter earnings next week,
has said it expects 2008 revenue to be roughly similar to its
2007 revenue of $48 billion. It expects decent profit growth
thanks to deep cost cuts.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - John Thain, Bank of America's just ousted head of investment banking, securities and wealth management, is only the latest alumnus from Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs to fall abruptly from grace as the legendary bank loses its aura of invincibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thain -- the former chief operating officer at Merrill Lynch -- masterminded that bank's sale to Bank of America Corp (BAC.N). But he was forced to leave BofA under the shadow of a $15.31 billion fourth-quarter loss at Merrill, as well as allegations he was a lavish spender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thain was among the many former executives from what once was Wall Street's most profitable investment bank who went on to other top companies, as well as the upper echelons of government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they were the brightest stars in the investment universe, but Goldman alumni -- including Thain, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and former Citigroup Chairman Robert Rubin -- look much less brilliant now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Goldman feet of clay is the way I look at it," said Nancy Bush, an analyst at NAB Research, referring to the one-time "masters of the universe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thain has made the biggest headlines lately. Along with a report that he spent $1.2 million redecorating his office shortly after joining Merrill Lynch in December 2007, his reputation was tarnished even more by a request for a bonus -- after Merrill racked up more than $20 billion in writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he joined BofA, Thain brought on at least one other highly paid Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) executive -- Thomas Montag, who was paid a bonus of $39.4 million plus a $600,000 salary -- and other staff, such as former chief risk officer Noel Donohoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet they did little to reverse the crisis at the firm, although their defenders say turning around Merrill, loaded up on risk as it was under its former management, might have been too much for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Merrill, former Goldman Chief Executive Henry Paulson's reign as U.S. Treasury Secretary came to an end this month, overshadowed by increasing criticism of his expensive efforts to revive the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And earlier this month, former Goldman executive and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin left his post as senior counselor at Citigroup Inc (C.N) after coming under fire for his performance at the giant bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of Goldman executives whose names have lost their luster extends to Robert Steel, former Goldman vice chairman, who was parachuted into Wachovia Bank to save it and wound up selling it to Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N), and Neel Kashkari, the Goldman wunderkind, who at 35 was named by Paulson to manage the government's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program -- an increasingly unpopular bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The firm's reputation has taken some hits," said NAB Research's Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN REPRICED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein may have hoped he could rely on the bank's reputation as the financial crisis spun into a global recession. But that status looks increasingly tenuous now and Goldman Sachs' share price fell 61 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lloyd Blankfein must be smacking his forehead about this," said Bush after Thain's exit from Bank of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that things have been easy for those who stayed behind. Last month, the firm posted its first quarterly loss since going public and was forced to raise more than $20 billion in capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Goldman became a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve in September after Merrill Lynch's sale to Bank of America and Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy left the markets reeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether during the fourth quarter, the bank was forced to seek $21 billion in capital from the U.S. Treasury, public investors and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Goldman and its former stars are not the only victims of a crisis that has overwhelmed many top bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sense, the inability of executives such as Steel and Thain to keep struggling banks independent, or the difficulties of Paulson and Kashkari in managing the sprawling TARP bailout simply triggered a repricing of Goldman's talent -- much as many other once prized assets across Wall Street have had to be repriced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Stein, president and co-founder of investment firm FSI Group in Cincinnati perhaps says it best: "They are not cut from a different cloth than anyone else on Wall Street."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc, the world's largest drugmaker, is in talks to buy Wyeth in a deal possibly valued at more than $60 billion, sources familiar with the situation said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such an acquisition, which a source said could come soon, would help Pfizer cope with a major gap in revenue in 2011 when its blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol treatment will begin to face U.S. generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It would diversify Pfizer into vaccines and injectable biologic medicines by adding Wyeth's big-selling Prevnar vaccine for childhood infections and Enbrel rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Pfizer would realize major cost savings by streamlining areas that overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the deal also raises questions about whether another huge acquisition is the right medicine for Pfizer, which has struggled after digesting two huge deals in the past decade. And it threatens to spark another round of layoffs in the drug industry at a time the U.S. economy is already on its knees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's eminently doable," said Barbara Ryan, an analyst with Deutsche Bank. "The question is whether others enter the fray. It's going to come down to price. The deal is attractive at this price, it's not attractive at any price."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan said Pfizer could pursue Bristol-Myers Squibb or biotech giant Amgen Inc if a Wyeth deal falls through. Biogen Idec has also been mentioned as a possible Pfizer target, Credit Suisse analyst Catherine Arnold said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Wyeth have been in talks for months, but Pfizer may have difficulty getting funding for a deal because of tight credit markets, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks were accelerating on Friday and a deal could be announced in the near term, one source said, while cautioning that negotiations could still fall apart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer would likely use a combination of cash and stock to acquire Madison, New Jersey-based Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based Pfizer had $26 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on its balance sheet, as of its latest quarterly filing. It had $16.3 billion in short-term borrowings and long-term debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spokesmen for Pfizer and Wyeth declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth shares closed up $4.91 or 12.6 percent at $43.74 on the New York Stock Exchange. Pfizer rose 24 cents or 1.4 percent to close at $17.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth has been in talks to buy Dutch vaccine firm Crucell, whose shares fell 9.6 percent on Friday on fears that deal might now be in doubt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But sources told Reuters the Pfizer-Wyeth talks will not necessarily scuttle Wyeth's Crucell deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANOTHER DEAL FOR PFIZER?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer became the world's largest drugmaker with its purchase in 2000 of Warner-Lambert and the $60 billion acquisition three years later of Pharmacia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The question for investors, many of whom continue to hold the stock largely because of its industry-topping dividend, is whether another acquisition of that scale will revive Pfizer over the long term, or only temporarily boost results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, a huge acquisition could make it harder for the merged company to grow from its larger revenue base and to prevent bureaucracy from stifling innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer exemplifies the overriding problem for many large drugmakers, which have struggled to produce new blockbusters to replace those on which they lose exclusivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have, for many quarters now, said that Pfizer essentially has no realistic way of replacing the many drugs that are scheduled to go generic apart from doing a mega-merger," Sanford C. Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The global economic downturn has created a buyer's market for cash-rich drugmakers, prompting several deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth's market capitalization as of Thursday was about $52 billion, so at $60 billion, the deal would represent a 15 percent premium. Pfizer was valued at about $118 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COST SAVINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from Enbrel, for which Wyeth shares rights with Amgen, and Prevnar, Wyeth also is developing experimental Alzheimer's disease drugs which could be a major opportunity, although some believe such drugs are a longshot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer would also gain Wyeth's large consumer health division that includes Advil painkillers more than two years after it sold off its own consumer health business to Johnson  Johnson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's fortunes rose initially after its Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia deals thanks to huge merger-related cost savings, and outright ownership of Lipitor from Warner-Lambert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Recently its performance flagged and shares dropped to more than 10-year lows in late 2008, after savings dried up and its $7 billion-a-year research budget failed to bear much fruit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which reports fourth-quarter earnings next week, has said it expects 2008 revenue to be roughly similar to its 2007 revenue of $48 billion.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON Jan 23 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) shares
plummeted to an 11-year low this week after the world's largest
software maker announced its biggest ever job cuts and warned
profit declines would almost certainly continue over the next
two quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The stock rose 9 cents, or 0.5 percent, to $17.20 on
Friday, after a 12 percent dive on Thursday when the company
released the bad news [ID:nN22530524].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft trades at about 9 times the average analyst
per-share profit forecast for the fiscal year ending in June,
below the 11 times average for the Standard  Poor's 500 Index
.SPX for this calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Does that relatively low valuation mean that Microsoft
shares are poised to outperform other large corporations and
technology companies in the current bear market? Or is the
maker of Windows too closely tied to the weak personal computer
industry and could it disappoint again?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TIME TO BUY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the bulls, the story is all about valuation. They say
shares in tech giants are relatively secure investments in
uncertain times and even if Microsoft's outlook deteriorates
further, they expect Chief Executive Steve Ballmer can make
deeper cost cuts to compensate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As early as a year ago Microsoft was trading at a 22
multiple. At these prices now, I would say that the valuation
has come down to what I would call an attractive value," said
Charles Carnevale, chief investment officer at investment firm
Great Companies who has a $200 million portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morningstar analyst Toan Tran said he likes the company's
long-term fundamentals and has a 3-to-5 year target of at least
$30 for the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have two wonderful businesses with Windows and
Office, a fortress-like balance sheet and it's trading at a
single-digit multiple," Tran said. "It's a very cheap stock."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FBR Capital Markets analyst David Hilal also likes
Microsoft's dominant position as the top software maker.
"During a downturn like this investors want to own names that
have fairly protected earnings, great cash flow and great
balance sheets. Microsoft fits that profile," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PC EXPOSURE A LIABILITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bears point out that Microsoft earns more than half its
revenues and profits from Windows and Office software for PCs,
at a time when the personal computer industry is poised to post
one of its weakest years since the 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For that reason, they say investors should avoid the stock,
but not necessarily dump shares they already hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wayne Hummer Wealth Management holds some Microsoft shares,
but is underweight on the stock compared to other technology
holdings in its $900 million portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If PC sales are down, I don't see how they are going to
have any growth," said Zach Rosenstock, an analyst with the
firm, adding that he does not think the low valuation is a
compelling reason to buy more Microsoft stock. "If the earnings
get cut further, then their PE (ratio) isn't going to look so
attractive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rosenstock said shares of International Business Machines
Corp (IBM.N), Oracle Corp ORCL.O, Adobe Systems Inc (ADBE.O)
and Symantec Corp (SYMC.O) are better bets in the tech sector.
IBM and Oracle have large recurring revenue streams, while
Adobe is poised to benefit from a major product launch last
year. He said Symantec makes security software that companies
cannot do without.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Benchmark Co analyst Brent Williams said he is also not
convinced that Microsoft's low valuation is a reason to buy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The stock has not been this low in forever, but the flip
side of the equation is -- what is going to move this stock
higher?" Williams said. "My concern is that the catalysts won't
fire for quite some time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global Equities Research analyst Trip Chowdhry said odds
are high that there will be more bad news from Microsoft, given
a business climate in which companies are going out of business
and even healthier ones are laying off workers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is no urgency to jump into the stock now," he said,
though he is bullish on the stock hitting $24 in 2 to 3 years.
"Fresh money should not go into Microsoft. Stay in cash. Let
the stock price go down even further."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - News that Pfizer Inc is in talks to acquire Wyeth for more than $60 billion may flush out other bidders for the U.S. drugmaker and trigger a long-predicted consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With its lucrative vaccine business and biotechnology drugs not facing imminent patent expirations, Wyeth has become a target for companies bracing for generic competition for their most important drugs while struggling with development pipelines that have recently yielded few major new medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All the pharma companies are desperate, so it's possible someone else comes in here," said Jon LeCroy, an analyst with Natixis Bleichroeder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's probably more likely that we see some of the other companies get bidders, and Bristol is the name that's being thrown around," LeCroy said of Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, which several analysts suggested as a potential takeover target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Schering-Plough Corp , which has limited exposure to generics between 2011 and 2013 when many drugmakers lose patent protection on their biggest medicines, is also often mentioned as an attractive acquisition candidate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse analyst Catherine Arnold, in a research note said: "A Pfizer/Wyeth deal may mark the beginning of a year of sector consolidation and could trigger other pharma-pharma or pharma-biotech deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Other companies that we think may have an interest in Wyeth include Novartis, Merck and Sanofi-Aventis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New Jersey-based Wyeth faces its own patent crisis in 2010, when its Effexor XR anti-depressant loses protection. Moreover, its ulcer drug Protonix unexpectedly was hit by generic competition a year ago, and the company suffered delays or rejections for a number of its experimental medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Wyeth has much to offer and may not simply be Pfizer's for the taking despite the New York-based company's position as the world's largest drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer can't come in like a white knight and pick them off on the cheap," Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. "I think they'd (Wyeth) do it at the right price, but I don't think they'd sell at a cheap premium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"From Wyeth's perspective, they have a strong pipeline of experimental drugs, and more importantly, a robust lineup of marketed biologics, with Enbrel and Prevnar," Conover said, referring to the company's rheumatoid arthritis drug and childhood vaccine that are both blockbusters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth shareholders are likely to embrace a deal, whether from Pfizer or another bidder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our sense is that some Wyeth shareholders have been waiting for the day when Wyeth would get acquired," Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This suggests that even without Wyeth's consent Pfizer ... could likely find a receptive shareholder base."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Natixis' LeCroy agreed that the deal would be a boon to Wyeth shareholders. Wyeth shares, which closed on Thursday at $38.83 before news of talks broke, have traded in the past year as low as $28.07. They rose 12.64 percent to close at $43.74 on Friday after the news broke.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Pfizer does end up bidding for them, (Wyeth shares) will be significantly higher than where the stock has traded recently," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The losers from such a deal and industry consolidation, however, are sure to be many of Wyeth's 47,500 employees and quite possibly the struggling U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They'll slash Wyeth to the bone," LeCroy said of Pfizer's likely cost-cutting strategy post acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's bad for the industry and the economy as a whole because we're going to see massive amounts of job losses in the pharmaceutical industry," LeCroy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've already seen a lot and it's only going to increase as these mergers start happening, so in a way that ends up being bad for everyone."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - News that Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is in talks to acquire Wyeth WYE.N for more than $60 billion may flush out other bidders for the U.S. drugmaker and trigger a long-predicted consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS) announced late Thursday that it would combine 2
of its divisions, ABC Entertainment and ABC Studios. No job cuts were announced
with the combined unit, which will be called ABC Entertainment Group, but a
spokesman said that "everything is on the table" with regard to future
cost-cutting measures. 

This news follows the company's announcement Jan. 21 that it is offering buyout
packages to roughly 600 of its executives at the domestic Parks and Resorts
division in an effort to reduce costs during the ongoing recession. The
entertainment giant stated that it is giving the affected employees until Feb. 6
to decide whether to take the buyouts, and layoffs afterwards are possible.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Jan 23 (Reuters) - A U.S. senator has asked 
Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) about its plans to slash up to 5,000
jobs, urging the world's biggest software company to preserve
the jobs of Americans ahead of foreigners working on visas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "I am concerned that Microsoft will be retaining foreign
guest workers rather than similarly qualified American
employees when it implements its layoff plan,"  Sen. Charles
Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said in a Jan. 22 letter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shocked investors on Thursday when it released
quarterly results that missed Wall Street expectations,
announced up to 5,000 layoff and said it would no longer give
forecasts for the rest of the fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has been a champion of expanding the H-1B visa
program, a temporary visa program that lets American companies
and universities hire foreign workers in a category considered
by the government to be a "specialty occupation."  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft employs thousands of workers through the program,
according to Grassley, the top Republican on the Senate Finance
Committee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Microsoft was not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Grassley's letter asked Microsoft Chief Executive Steve
Ballmer to provide a breakdown of the jobs to be eliminated,
and how many of those are individuals with H-1B visas and how
many are Americans. He also wants to know what the breakdown
will be when the layoffs are complete.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft has a moral obligation to protect these American
workers by putting them first during these difficult economic
times," Grassley said in the letter, copies of which were
provided by his office on Friday.

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA/NEW YORK (Reuters) - The $60 billion price tag on Pfizer Inc's potential purchase of Wyeth may seem like a staggering number amid tight credit markets, but the cash-rich balance sheets and marquee names of the companies could help Pfizer secure funding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's talks to buy Wyeth accelerated after news of the possible deal emerged in the media, sources familiar with the situation said. A deal could be reached in the near term, although the talks could fall apart at any time, one source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A deal, which could be financed with a mix of cash and stock, hinges on whether Pfizer can get enough funding. CNBC said Pfizer was seeking $25 billion in financing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The credit markets are tight, but if you're going to lend to anyone, you're going to lend to a triple-A rated company with $17 billion in cash flow plus cash on its books," said Andy Baker, a special situations strategist with Jefferies  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The volume of mergers worldwide dropped 30 percent last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters, as tight credit markets, the U.S. recession and swooning global financial markets made it difficult and costly to borrow money to do deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The economic outlook is extremely challenging; credit markets continue to be extraordinarily challenging," Philip Yea, chief executive of British private equity firm 3i Group Plc, told a conference organized by the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the next couple of years, capital is the most precious thing around," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has said it expects $17 billion to $18 billion in cash flow from operations in 2008. According to its latest quarterly filing, the company had $26 billion in cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments on its balance sheet. It had $16.3 billion in short-term borrowings and long-term debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if you assume the deal is half stock and half cash, that's still $30 billion in cash to raise. They can't just write a check easily, since a lot of their cash sits on their books overseas," Baker said. "But a company with this name, this balance sheet and this credit rating could possibly raise the money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Krensavage, principal of Krensavage Asset Management, said Wyeth has $4 billion in annual free cash flow and that Pfizer could borrow as much as $57 billion at 10 percent interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth's cash flow would be on top of any cost-cutting and revenue benefits Pfizer could squeeze from products in Wyeth's drug pipeline that prove successful, Krensavage said. As a result, the economics would make sense for a deal valued at roughly $60 billion, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our view all along is these companies are among the select few companies in the world that can get financing to do these kinds of transactions," said Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank. "The cash flow of the new company would be $20-plus billion every single year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is not the only drug company looking for mega-funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roche Holding AG is expected to raise its bid for the 44 percent of Genentech Inc it does not already own, but it still must work out funding details, sources previously told Reuters Loan Pricing Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year Swiss drugmaker Roche offered $43.7 billion, or $89 per share, to acquire the 44 percent stake. Bankers said Roche is now waiting for the right moment to tap the difficult, expensive and illiquid credit markets before raising its bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every deal out there trying to get done is competing with every other deal for funding. But it's not impossible that marquee names like Roche and Pfizer both get their deals done," said one investment banker who declined to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, even if Pfizer succeeds in securing financing, a deal may not be the best idea for Wyeth, some analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The negative impact on Pfizer's credit profile of the staggering amount of additional debt would offset much of the benefit to Wyeth of being bought by a near triple-A credit (company)," Gimme Credit analyst Carol Levenson said in a research report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Paritosh Bansal, Megan Davies and Ransdell Pierson; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For more MA news and our DealZone blog, go to here)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc Chief Executive Jeff Kindler has called mega-mergers disruptive and distracting, but desperation over the impending patent loss on the world's best-selling drug may be just the shotgun steering Pfizer to the altar with U.S. rival Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer is in talks to acquire Wyeth for more than $60 billion, sources say, in what would be its third giant acquisition after purchases of Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia made it the biggest name in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last March, Pfizer laid out a strategy for dealing with the 2011 loss of patent protection on its $12 billion a year cash cow, the cholesterol drug Lipitor, that did not involve huge acquisitions. But the failure of its research pipeline to yield many major new medicines appear to have renewed Pfizer's appetite for big deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it shows their desperation," said Natixis Bleichroeder analyst Jon LeCroy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Without a pipeline it doesn't much matter what a company does. Kindler's been there a couple of years now, and the view is not much has been done," LeCroy said. "So this was sort of inevitable if he wanted to keep his job."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said buying Wyeth, with its lucrative vaccines, biotechnology medicines and consumer products, may be Pfizer's only choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer's RD (research and development) track record has not been a good one and the sheer volume of product it stands to lose to generics means it would have to have unprecedented RD success to overcome these future losses," Anderson wrote in a research note. "Buying another company like Wyeth may therefore be the only realistic solution for Pfizer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That was clearly not the way Kindler saw things last year, when he told journalists that large acquisitions "can be very disruptive; it can slow things down and distract people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company declined to comment on reports that it was in negotiations with Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it represents a departure from recent policy, because at least all public statements prior to about three months ago were that Pfizer would do bolt-on acquisitions, or product acquisitions, but not a mega-merger," said Sam Isaly, portfolio manager of OrbiMed Advisors, who believes almost all mega-mergers in the past 15 years, including those by Pfizer, have failed to reward investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Pfizer's shares are trading just above 10-year lows hit late last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jeff Kindler is the most recent in a long string of losers at Pfizer," said Isaly, who is not one to mince words.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He really inherited a junk pile. Even so, his board is going to insist that he do something. He doesn't have much more time left, nor should he have much time left," Isaly said of the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Isaly, LeCroy expressed skepticism about whether the deal makes sense for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think it's going to pay off for them," LeCroy said. "Pfizer's problem was they were already too big, and so just making the company bigger doesn't solve the issue. The real issue is the RD productivity is not there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Mike Krensavage, principal at Krensavage Asset Management, said: "The pros of a Pfizer/Wyeth deal probably outweigh the cons."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Wyeth next year loses patent protection on its own top drug, the antidepressant Effexor XR, Krensavage said it has no other major patent expirations in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Hopefully, biologics from Wyeth would give Pfizer a more sustainable revenue base because these products tend to provide evergreen sales," he said, noting the lack in the United States of a pathway for generic versions of biotech medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krensavage estimated Wyeth shares are worth $51 each, given the value of the drugmaker's marketed products and assets, whereas a $60 billion deal would value them at only $45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Wyeth is cheap enough so that the downside for Pfizer is not too steep," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;Company President Jim Bitonti to Present on Tuesday, February 3
DENVER--(Business Wire)--
C-Lock Technology, Inc., a subsidiary of Evergreen Energy Inc. (NYSE Arca: EEE),
in concert with IBM and Enterprise Information Management Inc. (EIM), will
exhibit its patented GreenCert greenhouse gas (GHG) measurement and carbon
information management software in booth #707 at the 12th annual Energy and
Environment Conference (EUEC) at the Phoenix Convention Center February 1-4. 

C-Lock President Jim Bitonti will deliver a presentation entitled "Closing the
Loop - From Power Plants to Agriculture to Sequestration" as part of the carbon
sequestration track on Tuesday, February 3 at 2:40 p.m. Bitonti will describe
how GreenCert stands as an innovative tool for mitigating greenhouse gas
emissions from the power sector using the natural carbon sink capabilities found
in agriculture. 

Held annually in Phoenix since 1995, EUEC has grown to an expected 2000
attendees this year. It is the nation`s largest energy and environment
conference and is organized under the auspices of the U.S. Department of Energy,
the Edison Electric Institute, the Electric Power Research Institute and C
TRADE, a global renewable energy project development company. 

The four-day conference will offer hundreds of sessions across dozens of topic
area tracks that include U.S. climate policy, Kyoto and carbon markets, verified
emissions reduction credits, carbon capture and storage, GHG inventories, carbon
risks and costs, GHG standards, and GHG corporate strategies, among many others.


"The GreenCert software solution is the world`s most accurate tool for the
measurement and management of GHG gases," said Jim Bitonti, president of C-Lock.
"Our software modules for the energy and agriculture sectors are now in general
availability status and with our recent Eastern European deployment announcement
and acquisition of Carbon Credit Corp. of Canada, EUEC presents the perfect
platform for C-Lock to exhibit the advantages of its science-based approach to
carbon information management." 

The C-Lock GreenCert products provide advanced accuracy and precision in GHG
measurements and comprehensive information management capabilities. The IBM
framework platform is integrated with the patented C-Lock methodologies to
include real-time communications, data collection, extensive correlation
processes and the integration of large-scale models with a scalability dimension
for both worldwide applications and large enterprise applications. The
proprietary C-Lock software was integrated with IBM software products and tools
by Enterprise Information Management Inc., a premier IBM business partner for
integration services. 

C-Lock recently announced the general availability status of its GreenCert
software products for the accurate and precise measurement of GHG emissions in
the energy and agriculture sectors. In mid-December, C-Lock announced an
agreement for the deployment of its technology in Eastern Europe, starting in
Poland. 

According to The World Bank, global trade in carbon credits was valued at US$64
billion in 2007 compared to US$31 billion in 2006. According to Point Carbon, a
leading provider of carbon markets information, the global 2008 carbon market
grew faster in terms of volume and value than estimated, with 4.9 billion tons
of carbon dioxide equivalent changing hands, an 83 percent increase over 2007.
The recently-released Point Carbon study estimated the total 2008 carbon market
value at $125 billion, double the 2007 level.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Exxon comment, paragraph 4)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Austin Ekeinde&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria Jan 23 (Reuters) - Gunmen ambushed
an oil supply vessel and tugboat in two separate incidents on
Friday, a military spokesman said, the latest in a series of
attacks off the coast of Nigeria's Niger Delta region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Africa's top oil producer has one of the world's highest
incidence of piracy, second only to Somalia, with 10 attacks
reported so far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ten armed men in two speedboats early on Friday attacked the
oil supply vessel MV Ngoni as it was travelling through the busy
waters near Bonny in Rivers state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The ship was working for a contractor of Mobil Producing
Nigeria, a joint venture between Exxon Mobil and state-run NNPC,
a company spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were no fatalities or kidnappings, but some items were
stolen from the vessel, said a security source working in the
oil industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lieutenant Colonel Sagir Musa, spokesman for the military
task force in Rivers state, said he did not believe the attack
was near any oil facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Insecurity in the region has cut Nigeria's oil output by
around a fifth and has led foreign companies in sectors from
construction to telecoms, as well as the oil industry, to
reconsider investments and reduce expatriate staffing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DEDICATED GUNBOATS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a separate incident, 20 gunmen in three speedboats
hijacked a tugboat near the same area as the attack on the Exxon
vessel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Musa said no one was hurt in the incident and the tugboat
was later recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The attacks of yesterday and today show that the oil
services companies must liaise with the (military) as we have
dedicated gunboats to escort them on their movements," Musa

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Exxon comment, paragraph 4) By Austin Ekeinde PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria, Jan 23 (Reuters) - Gunmen ambushed an oil supply vessel and tugboat in two separate incidents on Friday, a military spokesman said, the latest in a series of attacks off the coast of Nigeria's Niger Delta region. Africa's top oil producer has one of the world's highest incidence of piracy, second only to Somalia, with 10 attacks reported so far this year. Ten armed men in two speedboats early on Friday attacked the oil supply vessel MV Ngoni as it was travelling through the busy waters near Bonny in Rivers state. The ship was working for a contractor of Mobil Producing Nigeria, a joint venture between Exxon Mobil and state-run NNPC, a company spokeswoman said. There were no fatalities or kidnappings, but some items were stolen from the vessel, said a security source working in the oil industry. Lieutenant Colonel Sagir Musa, spokesman for the military task force in Rivers state, said he did not believe the attack was near any oil facility. Insecurity in the region has cut Nigeria's oil output by around a fifth and has led foreign companies in sectors from construction to telecoms, as well as the oil industry, to reconsider investments and reduce expatriate staffing.  DEDICATED GUNBOATS In a separate incident, 20 gunmen in three speedboats hijacked a tugboat near the same area as the attack on the Exxon vessel. Musa said no one was hurt in the incident and the tugboat was later recovered. The attacks of yesterday and today show that the oil services companies must liaise with the (military) as we have dedicated gunboats to escort them on their movements, Musa said. We are begging them to come to us. The Niger Delta has long been plagued by violence but the number of attacks on vessels this year and abductions in areas previously considered relatively safe has alarmed the security forces. Last year, there were 40 reported incidents of piracy in Nigeria, including 27 vessels boarded, five hijackings and 39 crew members kidnapped, according to the International Maritime Bureau.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
The American Center for Law and Justice (ACLJ), focusing on constitutional law,
said today it is pleased that the New Jersey Supreme Court has decided to take a
case involving an ordinance by the Township of Galloway, N.J. which is designed
to keep convicted sex offenders away from children. The ACLJ represents the
Township of Galloway and asked the state`s high court to take this case to
uphold the ordinance, which was struck down by lower state courts. 

"The fact is that the ordinance in question is a legal and proper method of
protecting children from convicted sex offenders," said Jay Sekulow, Chief
Counsel of the ACLJ. "Galloway`s ordinance is in agreement with New Jersey law
and the lower court decisions are flawed on many levels. The town has the right
and duty to act on behalf of its children if it believes that the state action
is insufficient as long as the municipality`s ordinance does not conflict with
state law. We`re hopeful that the state`s highest court will uphold the Galloway
ordinance and take the necessary action to protect the children of New Jersey." 

In 2005, the Township of Galloway enacted the ordinance which created a buffer
zone of 2,500 feet between the residences of convicted sex offenders and places
where children normally congregate, specifically, schools, playgrounds, parks
and day care centers. The ordinance was intended to compliment "Megan`s Law"
which requires anyone convicted of committing a sex crime against a minor to
register in the community in which he or she resides. "Megan`s Law" was upheld
by the New Jersey Supreme Court in 1995. The trial court overturned Galloway`s
buffer zones, holding that they constitute additional punishment to the sexual
predator who already has paid his or her debt to society. 

The case was appealed to the New Jersey Appellate Division and that court upheld
the findings of the lower court. The convicted sex offender in the case -
referred to as "G.H." - is represented by the ACLU of New Jersey which argued
that "Megan`s Law" comprehensively regulated the post-prison behavior of sex
offenders so that Galloway has no authority to legislate in this area. 

In arguments before the appeals court last March, the ACLJ argued that
Galloway`s buffer zones complimented "Megan`s Law." The ACLJ noted that while
sexual predators would be limited in where they could live within the town, they
were prohibited from living only in those areas which are frequented by children
such as near schools, playgrounds, day care centers and parks. The ACLJ contends
that unlike those who commit other crimes, there is substantial evidence that
sex offenders repeat their crimes. 

The case before the New Jersey Supreme Court is G.H. v. Township of Galloway.

More than 100 municipalities across New Jersey have enacted similar laws like
the one in Galloway and are awaiting the outcome of this case. 

Led by Chief Counsel Jay Sekulow, the American Center for Law and Justice
focuses on constitutional law and is based in Washington, D.C. The ACLJ is
online at www.aclj.org.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Merger talks between Pfizer and Wyeth need not derail plans by Wyeth to buy Dutch vaccine maker Crucell, sources familiar with the situation said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in Crucell fell 9 percent by 1600 GMT on fears that Pfizer's discussions with Wyeth to buy its smaller rival for $60 billion or more could scupper ongoing Wyeth-Crucell negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources told Reuters, however, that Wyeth had been pursuing both avenues in parallel and buying the much smaller Dutch group should not present an obstacle to any eventual mega-merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They (Wyeth) don't view the deals as mutually exclusive," said one person. "At the same time, Pfizer has also been trying to build up its vaccines profile."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A second source said Wyeth had been talking to both Pfizer and Crucell in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucell -- one of the world's few remaining independent vaccine makers -- announced on January 7 it was in friendly merger discussions with Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth itself is one of the world's most prominent vaccine makers, whose products include the blockbuster Prevnar vaccine to protect infants and young children from infections with pneumococcal bacteria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Combining the two companies is seen making good strategic sense and Crucell's market capitalization of around 1.1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) makes it a manageable buy for Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;RBS analyst Mutlu Gundogan agreed news of talks between Pfizer and Wyeth should not be a deal breaker and advised investors to buy Crucell shares on weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Crucell would complement both Wyeth on a standalone basis and Wyeth in a combination with Pfizer," he said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that Pfizer would not only be interested in potential cost synergies of the two big pharma names, but also in Wyeth's successful biotech/vaccines franchise. Given Crucell's biotech/vaccine profile we believe it would complement Wyeth in both scenarios."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crucell in November posted its first-ever quarterly profit, boosted by sales of its vaccines and cost savings, and raised its 2008 sales outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dutch company's sales have been fueled by strong growth in its pediatric vaccines, especially Quinvaxem, a vaccine cocktail for the childhood diseases diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough and hepatitis B.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Harro ten Wolde in Amsterdam; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Deepens Partnership with RecycleBank as Official Non-Alcoholic
Beverage Sponsor


ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola and RecycleBank today announced a non-alcoholic beverage sponsorship
agreement that will significantly enhance the variety of rewards offered to
RecycleBank`s members for recycling through RecycleBank. Beginning in February,
consumers participating in the RecycleBank program may redeem their earned
RecycleBank points to select from a variety of fun rewards from the Coca-Cola
family of brands and partners. Coca-Cola rewards will deliver up to $600,000 in
retail value to the RecycleBank beverage category. RecycleBank households also
will have the opportunity to redeem RecycleBank Points for Coca-Cola sponsored
My Coke Rewards Points, the successful online loyalty program for consumers of
Coca-Cola products. 

"We are committed to promoting recycling of all our packages," said Katie Bayne,

loop by recycling and `Giving it Back.`" 

RecycleBank dramatically increases curbside recycling rates by offering
participating households rewards for their recycling efforts. RecycleBank`s
proprietary technology measures the amount of material recycled and then
converts that amount into RecycleBank Points that can be redeemed for rewards at
hundreds of local and national partners. More than 900 local and national
businesses partner with RecycleBank in order to encourage RecycleBank members
towards greener behaviors and increased recycling habits. 

"Coca-Cola believed in RecycleBank when it was just an entrepreneur`s vision and
has continued to support us as we grow nationally," said Ron Gonen, CEO of
RecycleBank. "We are proud that our relationship with Coca-Cola continues to
deepen as we work together on a number of activities to promote a more
sustainable business community and to scale RecycleBank nationally."

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - For affluent Seattle, Microsoft is just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's announcement it will lay off 5,000 in its biggest-ever job-cut rippled through the Seattle area on Thursday, further unnerving residents of an already-bruised city of just over 3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city plays host to a spate of well-known corporations, some of which have recently announced layoffs, including Starbucks Corp , and Boeing Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Starbucks said on Thursday that it will freeze salaries for its top executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Employees at Microsoft's sprawling, tree-lined campus in Redmond -- just 13 miles from Seattle -- filed in to work in somber moods, though many had been bracing for weeks for just such an announcement. Executives say managers called hurried meetings to talk through the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For some, the news came almost as a relief after weeks of tense speculation and in the midst of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. For others, Microsoft's warning that cuts will be spread over a year and a half means a lengthy period of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's definitely a lot of black humor now" in the hallways, a Microsoft executive said. "People are joking around like: 'we better get back and see if we still have jobs'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The one thing that might have raised eyebrows is: 'why're they putting this cloud over our heads for the next 18 months?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seattle, the city in Washington state well-known for drizzle, cafes and the TV series "Frasier" is feeling its fair share of corporate pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington state's jobless rate rose in December to 7.1 percent -- just a tad shy of the nation's 7.2 percent, from 6.4 percent in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Washington Mutual Inc -- once the largest U.S. savings and loan but since collapsed and taken over by JPMorgan -- will shed 9,200 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 3,400 of those jobs will come out of Seattle, the Seattle Times reported last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boeing Co unveiled plans this month to cut 4,500 workers -- most of them in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Starbucks -- the brand virtually synonymous with Seattle's boom -- is in the midst of layoffs of potentially thousands, though executives would not specify a final number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the worst economy I've seen in my life. The way Seattle is shedding jobs reflects what's happening elsewhere," said retiree Conrad Shock, 58, as he sipped at a coffee in Starbucks's first store, opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle's historic Pike Place market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think we've seen the worst of it," he said, adding that his retirement accounts had been cut in half in just the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His wife Kim said: "Unfortunately it's everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's layoffs -- of about 5 percent of its total workforce -- came after weeks of Web and media speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is disheartening that one of Washington's premier businesses is reducing its work force. Unfortunately, it is another indication that the national economic recession is deepening," Washington Governor Chris Gregoire said in a statement. "Our highest priority is to help those workers find other good jobs as quickly as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back at the Microsoft campus, employees veered between relief and trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We were waiting for the shoe to drop. It's not even a large percentage of the workforce. But I haven't had time to digest it yet", said a middle manager from Microsoft in his 30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I've been through layoffs before at Hewlett Packard. It's led to good things. I love my job here but whatever happens, happens," said another Microsoft employee in his 40s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Chrissy Zotalis and Jim Christie; Writing by Edwin Chan; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp stunned Wall Street with disappointing results that included plans to slash up to 5,000 jobs and a warning that profit and revenue will almost certainly drop over the next two quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The news from the world's largest software maker, which had not been expected to report results until after the close of trading on Thursday, sent shock waves across financial markets, pulling down the Nasdaq, and sending U.S. Treasury debt prices higher as investors sought safer assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's shares dropped as much as 11 percent to their lowest level since January 1998, adding to a 40 percent decline in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company blamed the miss on the weak PC market and the popularity of low-cost netbook computers, which have combined to badly undercut sales of its Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our financial position is solid ... but it is also clear that we are not immune to the effects of the economy," Chief Executive Steve Ballmer told employees in a letter. "Consumers and businesses have reined in spending, which is affecting PC shipments and IT expenditures."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market has become so volatile, Microsoft cautioned, that it will not issue earnings or revenue forecasts for the rest of its fiscal year ending June 30, 2009 -- other than to predict both will very likely be lower.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is pretty bad when things are deteriorating so fast that even the largest companies in the world don't know how rapidly it is happening," said Jefferies analyst Katherine Egbert.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted a profit of $4.17 billion, or 47 cents per share, in its fiscal second quarter ended December 31, versus a profit of $4.71 billion, or 50 cents per share, a year earlier. Analysts were looking for earnings of 49 cents per share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue rose 2 percent to $16.63 billion, missing the average analyst forecast of $17.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales in the Windows segment fell 8 percent, while its Business division, responsible for the Office software package, marked a 1 percent increase. Revenue at the unit that makes the popular 360 Xbox gaming system rose 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Looking ahead, the Windows business is expected to perform in line with the weak traditional PC market, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIGGEST JOB CUTS EVER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's staggered elimination of 5,000 jobs -- 1,400 immediately and the rest over 18 months -- amounts to about 5 percent of its estimated 96,000 work force, the biggest reduction ever by the software maker. Other cost cuts include travel and marketing budgets, and the roster of independent contractors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clearly business conditions are worse than people were expecting," said Richard Williams, analyst at Cross Research. "This is a substantial amount of jobs cuts. Microsoft has never had a layoff like this in my knowledge and it's sending a signal that the times are definitely changing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job cuts follow similar moves by other technology firms, including ATT Inc, Dell Inc, Motorola Inc and Advanced Micro Devices Inc, all of which are suffering from the global economic slowdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft faces a shift by PC buyers to netbooks, which are smaller, stripped-down laptops. Microsoft only gets $60 or less for each sale of Windows for a netbook, compared to $90 for traditional laptops, according to Enderle Group analyst Rob Enderle. Some netbooks also use the rival open-source Linux software instead of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a conference call, Ballmer said Microsoft also lost market share to Apple Inc, which on Wednesday posted surprisingly strong results. Ballmer, whose public histrionics often overshadow a sharp intellect and gift for numbers, was serious in tone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are certainly in the midst of a once-in-a-lifetime set of economic conditions," Ballmer said, adding that the company is "dealing with unprecedented ground."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the economy, Ballmer said he did not expect a quick rebound.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Ballmer noted that Microsoft will be adding "thousands of jobs" in strategic areas like Internet search, where it has been lagging behind Google Inc, and that he still desires a search partnership with Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer said the result of the job cuts and additions would be an overall staff reduction of 2,000 to 3,000 positions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said he does not expect significant acquisitions this year, despite hopes from some Yahoo shareholders for a buyout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft were down $2.13 at $17.25, after touching an intraday low of $17.17, the weakest level since January 1998. It was the biggest single-day drop in the stock since an 11.38 percent fall on April 28, 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jim Finkle in Boston, and Robert MacMillan and Sinead Carew in New York; Writing by Tiffany Wu and Paul Thomasch; Editing by Derek Caney, Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters.com) -- Microsoft Corp stunned Wall Street with disappointing results that included plans to slash up to 5,000 jobs and a warning that profit and revenue will almost certainly drop over the next two quarters. Here is a copy of an email, obtained by Reuters, from Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer to Microsoft employees discussing the results and steps taken:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In response to the realities of a deteriorating economy, we're taking important steps to realign Microsoft's business. I want to tell you about what we're doing and why.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today we announced second quarter revenue of $16.6 billion. This number is an increase of just 2 percent compared with the second quarter of last year and it is approximately $900 million below our earlier expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that we are growing at all during the worst recession in two generations reflects our strong business fundamentals and is a testament to your hard work. Our products provide great value to our customers. Our financial position is solid. We have made long-term investments that continue to pay off. But it is also clear that we are not immune to the effects of the economy. Consumers and businesses have reined in spending, which is affecting PC shipments and IT expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our response to this environment must combine a commitment to long-term investments in innovation with prompt action to reduce our costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the second quarter we started down the right path. As the economy deteriorated, we acted quickly. As a result, we reduced operating expenses during the quarter by $600 million. I appreciate the agility you have shown in enabling us to achieve this result.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now we need to do more. We must make adjustments to ensure that our investments are tightly aligned with current and future revenue opportunities. The current environment requires that we continue to increase our efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the process of adjustments, we will eliminate up to 5,000 positions in RD, marketing, sales, finance, LCA, HR, and IT over the next 18 months, of which 1,400 will occur today. We'll also open new positions to support key investment areas during this same period of time. Our net headcount in these functions will decline by 2,000 to 3,000 over the next 18 months. In addition, our workforce in support, consulting, operations, billing, manufacturing, and data center operations will continue to change in direct response to customer needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our leaders all have specific goals to manage costs prudently and thoughtfully. They have the flexibility to adjust the size of their teams so they are appropriately matched to revenue potential, to add headcount where they need to increase investments in order to ensure future success, and to drive efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To increase efficiency, we're taking a series of aggressive steps. We'll cut travel expenditures 20 percent and make significant reductions in spending on vendors and contingent staff. We've scaled back Puget Sound campus expansion and reduced marketing budgets. We'll also reduce costs by eliminating merit increases for FY10 that would have taken effect in September of this calendar year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of these steps will be difficult. Our priority remains doing right by our customers and our employees. For employees who are directly affected, I know this will be a difficult time for you and I want to assure you that we will provide help and support during this transition. We have established an outplacement center in the Puget Sound region and we'll provide outplacement services in many other locations to help you find new jobs. Some of you may find jobs internally. For those who don't, we will also offer severance pay and other benefits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The decision to eliminate jobs is a very difficult one. Our people are the foundation of everything we have achieved and we place the highest value on the commitment and hard work that you have dedicated to building this company. But we believe these job eliminations are crucial to our ability to adjust the company's cost structure so that we have the resources to drive future profitable growth. I encourage you to attend tomorrow's Town Hall at 9am PST in Caf 34 or watch the webcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While this is the most challenging economic climate we have ever faced, I want to reiterate my confidence in the strength of our competitive position and soundness of our approach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With these changes in place, I feel confident that we will have the resources we need to continue to invest in long-term computing trends that offer the greatest opportunity to deliver value to our customers and shareholders, benefit to society, and growth for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With our approach to investing for the long term and managing our expenses, I know Microsoft will emerge an even stronger industry leader than it is today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your continued commitment and hard work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Slash fiscal 2009 capital expenditures by $700 billion;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Eliminate up to 5,000 jobs in research and development, marketing, sales, finance, legal, human resources and information technology over the next 18 months;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Of that total, 1,400 jobs will be cut from Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Allow a net decline of 2,000-3,000 jobs in certain new positions over 18 months;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Eliminate merit pay increases for fiscal 2010, set to start in September;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Cut travel by 20 percent and reduce spending on vendors and contingent staff;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Scale back Puget Sound campus expansion plans;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Reduce marketing budgets;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Make significant reductions in spending on vendors and contingent staff;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- "Continue to change" its workforce in support, consulting, operations, billing, manufacturing and data center operations, in direct response to customer needs;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Add "thousands" of jobs in strategic areas such as search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Lawsky; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp shocked Wall Street on Thursday with its poor second-quarter results, and said it would cut as many as 5,000 jobs as it struggles to balance growth and costs amid the worsening economic downturn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jan 23 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities resumed coverage
of CME Group Inc (CME.O) with an "underweight" rating and a
$145 price target, saying CME's volumes could be under material
pressure in 2009 due to very low interest rates and
deleveraging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "With dealers, hedge funds, and mutual funds all under
significant pressure from asset declines, and algorithmic
traders likely under pressure from falling volumes, we see
potential for volume declines to be worse in this cycle than
experienced in previous cycles," the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan, which previously rated the derivatives exchange
"overweight," said the outlook for 2010 was also uncertain as,
according to historical data, multi-year volume slowdowns were
not unique.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Given weak volumes in the fourth quarter and a poor start
to trading volumes in 2009, JP Morgan said it expected the
analyst community to reduce estimates materially, putting CME's
stock under additional pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, Sanford C. Bernstein downgraded and cut its
price target on CME shares, saying it sees a sharp decline in
growth rates in futures trading volumes. [ID:nN22256808]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CME shares were down by $8.37 at $160 on very low volumes
before the bell. They closed at $168.37 Thursday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE/LOS ANGELES Jan 22 (Reuters) - For affluent
Seattle, Microsoft is just the tip of the iceberg.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's  (MSFT.O) announcement it will lay off 5,000 in
its biggest-ever job-cut rippled through the Seattle area on
Thursday, further unnerving residents of an already-bruised
city of just over 3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The city plays host to a spate of well-known corporations,
some of which have recently announced layoffs [ID:nN22545073],
including Starbucks Corp (SBUX.O) , and Boeing Co (BA.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Starbucks said on Thursday that it will freeze salaries for
its top executives. [ID:nN22417628]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Employees at Microsoft's sprawling, tree-lined campus in
Redmond -- just 13 miles from Seattle -- filed in to work in
somber moods, though many had been bracing for weeks for just
such an announcement. Executives say managers called hurried
meetings to talk through the changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For some, the news came almost as a relief after weeks of
tense speculation and in the midst of the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression. For others, Microsoft's
warning that cuts will be spread over a year and a half means a
lengthy period of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's definitely a lot of black humor now" in the
hallways, a Microsoft executive said. "People are joking around
like: 'we better get back and see if we still have jobs'.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The one thing that might have raised eyebrows is: 'why're
they putting this cloud over our heads for the next 18
months?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Seattle, the city in Washington state well-known for
drizzle, cafes and the TV series "Frasier" is feeling its fair
share of corporate pain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington state's jobless rate rose in December to 7.1
percent -- just a tad shy of the nation's 7.2 percent, from 6.4
percent in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Washington Mutual Inc [WAMUQ.PL] -- once the largest U.S.
savings and loan but since collapsed and taken over by JPMorgan
(JPM.N)  -- will shed 9,200 jobs. [ID:nLG148108]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 3,400 of those jobs will come out of Seattle, the
Seattle Times reported last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Boeing Co  (BA.N) unveiled plans this month to cut 4,500
workers -- most of them in Washington. [ID:nN09303414]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And Starbucks -- the brand virtually synonymous with
Seattle's boom -- is in the midst of layoffs of potentially
thousands, though executives would not specify a final number.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is the worst economy I've seen in my life. The way
Seattle is shedding jobs reflects what's happening elsewhere,"
said retiree Conrad Shock, 58, as he sipped at a coffee in
Starbucks's first store, opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle's
historic Pike Place market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think we've seen the worst of it," he said, adding
that his retirement accounts had been cut in half in just the
past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His wife Kim said: "Unfortunately it's everywhere."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's layoffs -- of about 5 percent of its total
workforce -- came after weeks of Web and media speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is disheartening that one of Washington's premier
businesses is reducing its work force. Unfortunately, it is
another indication that the national economic recession is
deepening," Washington Governor Chris Gregoire said in a
statement. "Our highest priority is to help those workers find
other good jobs as quickly as possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Back at the Microsoft campus, employees veered between
relief and trepidation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We were waiting for the shoe to drop. It's not even a
large percentage of the workforce. But I haven't had time to
digest it yet", said a middle manager from Microsoft in his
30s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I've been through layoffs before at Hewlett Packard. It's
led to good things. I love my job here but whatever happens,
happens," said another Microsoft employee in his 40s.

Here are highlights from Thursday`s Analyst Blog:

C.R. Bard Quoted as a Buy

C.R. Bard (NYSE: BCR) operates in vascular, urology, oncology and surgical
specialty markets. These end-markets should remain insulated from the current
economic turmoil. Many of the company's products are used in interventional
medicine - life-saving surgical procedures. 

We look for the company to finish in the upper end of their guidance. Future
quarters will be met with a headwind from foreign exchange. However, with less
than a third of sales outside of the United States, the impact will be less than
for BCR's competitors. 

Amdocs Buy Rec Reiterated

Amdocs Ltd. (NYSE: DOX), a leading provider of CRM and billing software for
communications service providers, continues to perform in line with our
expectations, supported by its industry-leading technology integration products
for large-scale transformational projects and managed services. 

Long-term fundamentals remain firm as a result of global telecom carriers'
transition to converged and consolidated solutions. In addition, the company
maintains a strong financial position with a healthy order backlog. Management
indicated caution with respect to near-term business performance based on global
economic uncertainties which may generate some fluctuations in its near-term
results. We confirm our Buy recommendation on the shares. 

IBM Buy Rating Maintained

On January 20, 2008, IBM Corp. (NYSE: IBM) announced its fiscal 2008 4th quarter
results that were mixed, with revenue coming in below expectations but pro forma
EPS beating our expectation. Net income from continuing operations were $4.4
billion versus $4.0 billion in the same quarter last year. With aggressive
cost-cutting, diluted earnings from continuing operations for the quarter
reached $3.28, up 17.1% from $2.80 in the prior-year quarter. 

Total revenue of $27.0 billion was down 6.4% (down 1.0% when adjusted for
currency) from $28.9 billion in the year-ago quarter. Earnings were boosted by a
reduction in the tax rate in the 4th quarter. 

Rite-Aid Feels Wal-Mart Pressure

Management at Rite Aid Corporation (NYSE: RAD) was executing a turnaround
strategy centered on increasing the profitability of the existing store base.
However, management acquired Brooks Eckerd prior to a convincing turnaround in
profitability and increased the debt burden of the company. 

Moreover, Wal-Mart's (NYSE: WMT) entrance into the retail generic drug market
began pressuring the company's pharmacy margin.

&lt;p&gt;PORT HARCOURT, Nigeria Jan 23 (Reuters) - Gunmen in speedboats attacked an oil supply vessel contracted to U.S. oil major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) in the restive Niger Delta, military and security sources said on Friday. Ten armed men in two speedboats attacked the MV Ngoni off the coast of the Niger Delta, the heart of Nigeria's oil and gas sector, early Friday morning. There were no fatalities or kidnappings, but some items were stolen from the vessel, a private security source said. I can confirm there was an attack, said Lieutenant-Colonel Sagir Musa, spokesman for the military task force in the southern state of Rivers. Musa said he didn't believe the offshore attack was near an oil facility. Insecurity in the region has cut Nigeria's oil output by around a fifth and has led foreign companies in sectors from construction to telecoms, as well as the oil industry, to reconsider investments and reduce expatriate staffing. The Niger Delta has long been plagued by violence but the number of attacks on vessels this year and abductions in areas previously considered relatively safe has alarmed the security forces. Friday's attack was the ninth such attack on shipping in waters off the delta this year.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING Jan 23 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan on Friday cut its
2009 earnings forecast and price targets for China's top Internet
search firms Baidu.com Inc (BIDU.O), SINA Corp (SINA.O) and
Sohu.com Inc (SOHU.O), citing slowing economic growth and
advertising revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan had earlier lowered its forecast for China's
economic growth this year to 7.2 percent and said the country's
advertising market growth would be flat in 2009, after an earlier
projection of 5 percent growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lowered outlook comes a day after China said its economy
grew 9.0 percent last year, the slowest pace in seven years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. bank revised down its December 2009 share price
target for Baidu to $190, from $300. Baidu shares closed at
$112.53 on Thursday on the Nasdaq exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baidu's 2008 fourth quarter diluted earnings per share (EPS)
forecast was cut 6.3 percent to $1.19, and the diluted EPS
forecast for the first quarter of this year by 19.1 percent to
$0.93, said the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The target price for Internet media firm SINA was cut to $29,
from an earlier $53 target, while the target for Sohu was dropped
to $62, from $100.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The shares of the two companies closed Thursday at $20.59 and
$39.47, respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SINA's first quarter EPS was cut 5.7 percent to $0.33, while
the firm's 2009 EPS was raised to 6.5 percent to $1.96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sohu's first quarter EPS target was cut 6.4 percent to $1.02,
while the full 2009 forecast was lowered 6.9 percent to $4.45.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the bank warned that near-term economic data would be
weak, it also said there could be buying opportunities for
investors in the three companies after the first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan expects Baidu.com's revenue to fall 11.7 percent
in the first quarter of 2009 from the previous quarter to $116.5
million due to the slowing economy, but it maintained a positive
view of the company down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Baidu continues to improve its technology and expand its
potential to raise revenues, and the firm leads the country's
fast growing search market, the bank said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank was optimistic about Sina's prospects due to
long-term online ad growth potential and its media role, but the
firm's recent acquisition of Focus Media Ltd's FMCN.O core
assets increased risk and uncertainty for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan maintained an overweight rating on Sohu due to
online advertising, but it said a slowing economy and delays in
launching online games posed risks.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 23 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is in talks to buy
rival drug maker Wyeth WYE.N in a deal that could be valued
at more than $60 billion, the Wall Street Journal said, citing
people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The two sides have been in discussions for months and a
deal is not imminent, the people told the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The talks are fragile given recent market volatility and
weak global economic conditions, and could collapse, the people
told the paper.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A tidal wave of layoffs washed across the world on Monday, sending tens of thousands of workers into joblessness as the pain of the global recession worsened.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amid reports of tumbling corporate profits, dire outlooks and a lowered global growth forecast from the International Monetary Fund, companies in Europe and the United States announced they would cut employees in a dramatic effort to reduce costs and keep their businesses afloat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the corporate gloom, markets rallied on some of Monday's other news: No. 1 drugmaker Pfizer Inc said it would buy rival Wyeth for $68 billion, Barclays said it had no need to raise capital and sales of existing U.S. homes unexpectedly rose 6.5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the midst of a global recession, here is Pfizer, hopefully spending their dollars wisely," said Andre Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial Group in New Brunswick, New Jersey. "It adds a little confidence that all is not lost."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the darkening view was reinforced by a dismal revised outlook from the IMF, which slashed its forecast for 2009 global growth to 0.5 percent from 2.2 percent in its last economic outlook in November, a source told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IMF saw the U.S. economy contracting 1.6 percent in 2009, with the euro zone shrinking 2 percent and Japan contracting 2.6 percent, according to the source. The IMF pegged 2010 world growth at 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tsunami of layoff announcements, affecting more than 70,000 workers, started in Europe, with electronics maker Philips reporting 6,000 job cuts as it posted a bigger-than-expected 1.5 billion euro ($1.9 billion) loss, its first quarterly loss since 2003.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ING cut 7,000 of its 130,000 jobs, replaced its CEO and got guarantees from the Dutch government as other European banks sought to reassure investors they are coming to grips with the turmoil in financial markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Corus, Europe's second-largest steelmaker, said 3,500 jobs would go worldwide, including 2,500 in Britain, as the company, owned by India's Tata Steel, sought to boost operating profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CATERPILLAR, SPRINT, HOME DEPOT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, Caterpillar, the world's largest maker of heavy equipment, said it would eliminate nearly 20,000 jobs, reported a 32 percent drop in profit and forecast the weakest year for business since the end of World War Two.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sprint Nextel Corp the No. 3 U.S. mobile service provider, said it will cut up to 8,000 jobs, or about 14 percent of its workforce. [ID:nN26368948] Retailer Home Depot Inc said it will cut 7,000 jobs, or about 2 percent of its workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chip maker Texas Instruments said it was cutting 12 percent of its workforce, including 1,800 layoffs and 1,600 voluntary departures [ID:nN2638388], and car maker General Motors Corp said it would lay off 2,000 more workers at two assembly plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the flip side of Pfizer's deal for Wyeth, Pfizer said it will cut 15 percent of the companies' combined 130,000 workers -- about 19,500 jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Major U.S. indexes rose. The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 0.5 percent and the broader SP 500 was up 0.6 percent. Bond prices fell as the increase in existing-home sales raised questions whether the housing market was as weak as thought. European stocks rose, with Europe's FTSE 300 index closing 3.2 percent higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gold climbed above $900 an ounce, the highest in more than three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Governments around the world focused on stimulus packages to grapple with the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. President Barack Obama's spokesman, Robert Gibbs, told reporters the president "would do everything in his power to ensure the financial system does not collapse," after a weekend in which Republicans voiced objections to Obama's stimulus proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Obama's choice to help lead the government effort, Treasury Secretary-designate Timothy Geithner, won Senate approval after a delay due to qualms over his underpayment, since rectified, of some personal taxes earlier this decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geithner is expected to be sworn in quickly and within weeks will likely unveil reforms to the $700 billion financial bailout program to provide more support for housing and credit markets and possibly to absorb troubled assets from banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Canada will spend C$7 billion ($5.7 billion) on infrastructure over the next two years, a government minister said, and officials said Canada will run budget deficits totaling C$64 billion over the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We not only create jobs and economic activity now, we also improve our economic competitiveness for decades to come," said Minister of Transport John Baird.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Norwegian government presented a $2.87 billion fiscal stimulus package to prevent a surge in unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Iceland, however, the government of Prime Minister Geir Haarde collapsed under the pressures of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks have borne the brunt of the credit crisis, which was sparked by mass defaults on U.S. home loans. The sector has seen a wave of consolidation as leading banks around the world have collapsed or been taken over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But shares in Britain's Barclays leaped 73 percent after it said its projected 2008 pretax profit of more than 5.3 billion pounds ($7.3 billion) would include significant writedowns of 8 billion pounds and that the bank had made a good start to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer will halve its dividend and raise $22 billion in debt to buy rival Wyeth for $68 billion in an acquisition aimed at softening the blow of losing its biggest product to generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Pfizer shares slumped 10 percent and the cost of insuring its debt rose to an all-time high on concern about the additional debt and likely credit-rating downgrades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has long touted a hefty dividend to keep investors happy while it develops new drugs. But to do the deal, Pfizer slashed its dividend to 16 cents per share, effective with its second-quarter payout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The dividend had led the industry, although the company maintains it still remains competitive with other drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People who owned it for the dividend got slapped in the head with a two-by-four today," said Mike Krensavage, principal with Krensavage Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blockbuster purchase planned by the world's largest drugmaker would reshape the pharmaceutical industry, while thawing a merger climate frozen by the global credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which also forecast disappointing 2009 profit, said it would cut 15 percent of the combined company's workforce of about 130,000 employees and close some manufacturing sites -- adding to the job cuts sweeping through corporate America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company agreed to pay $50.19 -- $33 in cash and 0.985 share of its stock -- for each Wyeth share. That represents a 29 percent premium over Wyeth's closing share price last Thursday, before news of the talks began to leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth shares dipped 0.8 percent to close at $43.39 on Monday -- well below the offer price. The shares of Pfizer, which secured $22.5 billion in funding from a consortium of banks to help pay for the deal, fell 10.3 percent to $15.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given that there is a sizable amount of debt financing that has to occur, you would expect more risk to be built in," said David Moskowitz, an analyst with Caris  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, the megadeal comes amid a merger drought, as tight credit markets make borrowing costly and difficult. Analysts said the fact that Pfizer had secured a large amount of financing was a positive signal. ID:nN26539838&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Deals of this quality and this magnitude will rekindle enthusiasm and hope about equity markets," said Andre Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial Group. "In the midst of a global recession, here is Pfizer, hopefully spending their dollars wisely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COPING WITH LIPITOR LOSS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition -- the third-largest in the drug industry since 1998 -- would help Pfizer cope with a major gap in revenue in 2011, when its blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol treatment will begin to face U.S. generic competition. The company now says its earnings for 2012 should perhaps be about 20 percent above what Wall Street expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors have been rightfully concerned about when Lipitor goes off patent," said Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler. "Today's announcement definitively addresses that." ID:nN26388736&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal would help Pfizer diversify into vaccines and injectable biologic medicines by adding Wyeth's big-selling Prevnar vaccine for childhood infections and Enbrel rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Both areas are seen as more immune than traditional pills to generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also adds Wyeth's consumer health business that includes Advil painkillers more than two years after selling its own consumer health unit to Johnson  Johnson. ID:nBNG226161&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer typifies many large drugmakers, which have struggled to produce new blockbusters to replace those on which they lose exclusivity. ID:nN23318400 Wyeth itself loses patent protection next year on its own top drug, the antidepressant Effexor XR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to boost Pfizer's earnings in the second full year after closing and result in cost savings of $4 billion by the third year. Pfizer is reducing its manufacturing sites to 41 from 46 facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An acquisition of this nature can be valuable if management recognizes how rich their spending is and really cuts to maximize the profitability of the new organization," said Michael Castor, portfolio manager with Sio Capital Management. "$4 billion in cuts is a good first step."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CONSOLIDATION WAVE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal could trigger a wave of consolidation in the cash- rich pharmaceutical sector as drugmakers look to diversify revenue sources in the face of competition from generic-drug rivals, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In sealing the Pfizer deal, Wyeth withdrew from talks to buy Dutch vaccine firm Crucell. Crucell shares fell 12.6 percent. ID:nLQ120204&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Based on Wyeth's 1.33 billion shares outstanding as of October 31, the deal with Pfizer would be worth $66.8 billion; including Wyeth's stock options, it would be worth $68 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is subject to Pfizer's financing sources not backing out should the company's financial health suffer a material adverse change or should it fail to maintain a certain credit rating. Standard  Poor's said on Monday it might cut Pfizer's top "AAA" rating. ID:nN26379279&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth would have to pay Pfizer a $1.8 billion break-up fee if it walks away from the deal, while Pfizer would have to pay Wyeth $4.5 billion if it does so, according to a source familiar with the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Wyeth expect the deal to close at the end of the 2009 third quarter or during the fourth quarter. Analysts said there did not appear to be much risk of antitrust issues holding up the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Barclays and Citigroup Inc. Wyeth's financial advisers were Morgan Stanley and Evercore Partners Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also reported that fourth-quarter results suffered because of a higher tax rate, charges from cost-cutting and settlement costs from a probe by U.S. authorities. The company earned $266 million, or 4 cents per share, on revenue of $12.35 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer forecast adjusted earnings would fall at least 19 percent in 2009 as it takes a big tax hit for repatriating funds for the deal, whereas Wall Street was expecting slight growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Monday, Wyeth posted fourth-quarter results that fell short of expectations.

(PFE.N) will halve its dividend and raise $22 billion in debt
to buy rival Wyeth WYE.N for $68 billion in an acquisition
aimed at softening the blow of losing its biggest product to
generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Pfizer shares slumped 10 percent and the cost of
insuring its debt rose to an all-time high on concern about the
additional debt and likely credit-rating downgrades.
[ID:nN26577832]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has long touted a hefty dividend to keep investors
happy while it develops new drugs. But to do the deal, Pfizer
slashed its dividend to 16 cents per share, effective with its
second-quarter payout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dividend had led the industry, although the company
maintains it still remains competitive with other drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People who owned it for the dividend got slapped in the
head with a two-by-four today," said Mike Krensavage, principal
with Krensavage Asset Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The blockbuster purchase planned by the world's largest
drugmaker would reshape the pharmaceutical industry, while
thawing a merger climate frozen by the global credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, which also forecast disappointing 2009 profit, said
it would cut 15 percent of the combined company's workforce of
about 130,000 employees and close some manufacturing sites --
adding to the job cuts sweeping through corporate America.
[ID:N26387260]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based company agreed to pay $50.19 -- $33 in
cash and 0.985 share of its stock -- for each Wyeth share. That
represents a 29 percent premium over Wyeth's closing share
price last Thursday, before news of the talks began to leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth shares dipped 0.8 percent to close at $43.39 on
Monday -- well below the offer price. The shares of Pfizer,
which secured $22.5 billion in funding from a consortium of
banks to help pay for the deal, fell 10.3 percent to $15.65.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Given that there is a sizable amount of debt financing
that has to occur, you would expect more risk to be built in,"
said David Moskowitz, an analyst with Caris  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, the megadeal comes amid a merger drought, as tight
credit markets make borrowing costly and difficult. Analysts
said the fact that Pfizer had secured a large amount of
financing was a positive signal. [ID:nN26539838]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Deals of this quality and this magnitude will rekindle
enthusiasm and hope about equity markets," said Andre Bakhos,
president of Princeton Financial Group. "In the midst of a
global recession, here is Pfizer, hopefully spending their
dollars wisely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COPING WITH LIPITOR LOSS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition -- the third-largest in the drug industry
since 1998 -- would help Pfizer cope with a major gap in
revenue in 2011, when its blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol
treatment will begin to face U.S. generic competition. The
company now says its earnings for 2012 should perhaps be about
20 percent above what Wall Street expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investors have been rightfully concerned about when
Lipitor goes off patent," said Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler.
"Today's announcement definitively addresses that."
[ID:nN26388736]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal would help Pfizer diversify into vaccines and
injectable biologic medicines by adding Wyeth's big-selling
Prevnar vaccine for childhood infections and Enbrel rheumatoid
arthritis treatment. Both areas are seen as more immune than
traditional pills to generic competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer also adds Wyeth's consumer health business that
includes Advil painkillers more than two years after selling
its own consumer health unit to Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N).
[ID:nBNG226161]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer typifies many large drugmakers, which have struggled
to produce new blockbusters to replace those on which they lose
exclusivity. [ID:nN23318400] Wyeth itself loses patent
protection next year on its own top drug, the antidepressant
Effexor XR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is expected to boost Pfizer's earnings in the
second full year after closing and result in cost savings of $4
billion by the third year. Pfizer is reducing its manufacturing
sites to 41 from 46 facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "An acquisition of this nature can be valuable if
management recognizes how rich their spending is and really
cuts to maximize the profitability of the new organization,"
said Michael Castor, portfolio manager with Sio Capital
Management. "$4 billion in cuts is a good first step."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONSOLIDATION WAVE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal could trigger a wave of consolidation in the cash-
rich pharmaceutical sector as drugmakers look to diversify
revenue sources in the face of competition from generic-drug
rivals, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In sealing the Pfizer deal, Wyeth withdrew from talks to
buy Dutch vaccine firm Crucell CRCL.AS. Crucell shares fell
12.6 percent. [ID:nLQ120204]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on Wyeth's 1.33 billion shares outstanding as of Oct.
31, the deal with Pfizer would be worth $66.8 billion;
including Wyeth's stock options, it would be worth $68
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is subject to Pfizer's financing sources not
backing out should the company's financial health suffer a
material adverse change or should it fail to maintain a certain
credit rating. Standard  Poor's said on Monday it might cut
Pfizer's top "AAA" rating. [ID:nN26379279]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth would have to pay Pfizer a $1.8 billion break-up fee
if it walks away from the deal, while Pfizer would have to pay
Wyeth $4.5 billion if it does so, according to a source
familiar with the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer and Wyeth expect the deal to close at the end of the
2009 third quarter or during the fourth quarter. Analysts said
there did not appear to be much risk of antitrust issues
holding up the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch
(BAC.N), Goldman Sachs (GS.N), JPMorgan (JPM.N), Barclays
(BARC.L) and Citigroup Inc (C.N). Wyeth's financial advisers
were Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Evercore Partners Inc (EVR.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer also reported that fourth-quarter results suffered
because of a higher tax rate, charges from cost-cutting and
settlement costs from a probe by U.S. authorities. The company
earned $266 million, or 4 cents per share, on revenue of $12.35
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer forecast adjusted earnings would fall at least 19
percent in 2009 as it takes a big tax hit for repatriating
funds for the deal, whereas Wall Street was expecting slight
growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on Monday, Wyeth posted fourth-quarter results that
fell short of expectations. The company earned 71 cents a share
on revenue of $5.35 billion, compared with the average Wall
Street forecast of 79 cents a share on revenue of $5.79
billion, according to Reuters Estimates.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded Pfizer Inc.'s (Pfizer) Issuer Default Rating (IDR),
senior unsecured debt and bank loan ratings to 'AA' from 'AA+'. Fitch has also
placed the company's ratings (including the short-term IDR) on Rating Watch
Negative. The ratings actions follow Pfizer's announcement of its intention to
acquire Wyeth. The ratings apply to approximately $16.3 billion of debt. 

Today Pfizer, Inc. (Pfizer) announced its intention to purchase Wyeth for $50.19
per share or approximately $68 billion, including Wyeth stock options. The
purchase price represents a 29% premium over Wyeth share price at the end of
closing on Jan. 22, 2009, just prior to the start of rumored merger talks. The
acquisition is planned to be financed by one-third Pfizer equity and the balance
in cash. Although the combined entity had pro forma cash and short-term
securities of over $40 billion at the end of the third quarter of 2008, Pfizer
secured $22.5 billion of debt financing for the transaction. The deal is
expected to close in the third or fourth quarter of 2009. 

The incremental debt will immediately pressure Pfizer's credit profile upon the
consummation of the transaction; however, uncertainty exists to the tenure of
the new debt and the company's plans to address the higher leverage in the
intermediate-term. Preliminary calculations using pro forma financials,
excluding synergies, puts total debt leverage around 1.75 times (x) and net debt
leverage at 0.80x at closing. Fitch will ascertain the capital structure of the
proposed combined entity and finalize the rating level at that time, which may
decrease by another notch. 

Pfizer stated that annual synergies totaling around $4 billion would be targeted
for three years after the completion of the transaction. Additionally, the
company will halve its dividend to $0.16 per share, saving over $4 billion of
cash annually. Wyeth's product portfolio, strongly centered on biologics and
vaccines, does not significantly overlap Pfizer's offerings, increasing the
probability of anti-trust clearance of the acqusition. Areas of potential
anti-trust concern are the animal health businesses and developmental projects
focused on central nervous disorders, specifically Alzheimer's disease. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance

process other than through the medium of its public disclosure.

&lt;p&gt; * Gold shoots above $900 an ounce on safe-haven buying&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Glimmer of housing market hope batters government debt&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Oil prices fall in anticipation of rising U.S. inventory
 (Adds close of U.S. markets)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Herbert Lash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday on
investors' optimism over a $68 billion pharmaceutical takeover
and a surprise rebound in U.S. home sales in December, but gold
climbed above $900 an ounce in safe-haven buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An unexpected uptick in U.S. home sales provided a rare
bright spot in the slumping housing market while companies on
both sides of the Atlantic continued to slash jobs as a
year-long recession inflicted more pain on local economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Longer-dated U.S. and euro zone government debt prices
fell, bogged down by persistent concerns about the amount of
new issuance to flood markets this year to fund financial
sector bailouts and government stimulus packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices slipped 1.6 percent on expectations a government
report on Wednesday will show another rise in swelling U.S.
crude inventories as a deepening downturn pummels consumption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The relentless wave of layoffs continued, with European and
U.S. corporations disclosing plans to cut more than 70,000 jobs
to cope with the downturn. The depth of the job losses
suggested the optimism in equity markets could easily change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Sentiment is still quite shaky, and at the first sign of
bad news, people are prepared to run for the hills again," said
David Watt, senior currency strategist at RBC Capital Markets
in Toronto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) fell 8.4 percent after
the heavy equipment maker forecast earnings in 2009 would drop
significantly from last year. The company also said it would
shed about 20,000 workers as it grapples with the turndown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Pfizer (PFE.N), the world's largest drugmaker,
fell 10.3 percent after said it agreed to acquire Wyeth WYE.N
for $68 billion. Wyeth shares fell 0.8 percent. The share price
of acquirers in takeovers often fall on cost concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI closed up 38.47
points, or 0.48 percent, at 8,116.03. The Standard  Poor's 500
Index .SPX rose 4.62 points, or 0.56 percent, at 836.57. The
Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC gained 12.17 points, or 0.82
percent, at 1,489.46.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. stocks briefly turned negative in the afternoon on the
grim jobs outlook. A Group of 20 official told Reuters the
International Monetary Fund will slash its 2009 world growth
forecast to 0.5 percent from 2.2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But investors liked the possibility of more deals ahead as
companies seek to position themselves defensively in the midst
of faltering global economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Any kind of MA is a positive and is seen as marking the
beginning of the light at the end of the tunnel," said Alan
Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz  Associates Inc, an
investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain's Barclays (BARC.L) added to the positive tone
after it said it did not need to raise fresh capital, sending
its beaten-down shares soaring 73 percent. Barclays helped a
recovery in other battered European financial stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FTSEurofirst 300 .FTEU3 index of leading European
shares rose 3.2 percent at 784.66 points. The index had fallen
in 12 of the previous 13 sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among European banks, Lloyds (LLOY.L) jumped 32 percent,
ING (ING.AS) gained 28 percent and Royal Bank of Scotland
(RBS.L) added 19.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worries about a deepening global slowdown and ongoing
turmoil in the financial sector have proven enormous hurdles
for investors to overcome in January, a month that often sets
the tone for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of previously owned U.S. homes rebounded unexpectedly
in December, rising 6.5 percent, closing out a bleak year in
which prices dropped a record 15.3 percent, the National
Association of Realtors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gold climbed to its highest level in more than three months
as interest in bullion as a haven from risk and a weaker dollar
against the euro spurred buying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. gold futures for February delivery GCG9 settled up
$13 at $908.80 an ounce in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Gold is rising on the fallout from the renewed banking
crisis," said VM Group analyst Matthew Turner. "The banking
crisis is bad for share prices, and creates fear and panic.
Some investors are thinking gold is the safest option."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Robert Lutts, president and chief investment officer of
Cabot Money Management, said he expected gold could rise to
$2,000 an ounce over time as investors sought to protect their
assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The central banks are printing trillions of dollars worth
of currencies, and there is no real asset behind it. So, every
dollar in my pocket is going to be worth less and less every
day," said Lutts, who oversees $400 million of client assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The decline in crude oil was tempered by evidence the
Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries was complying
with the bulk of its output cut agreements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. crude CLc1 fell 74 cents to settle at $45.73 a
barrel, after rising to a session high of $48.59. London Brent
LCOc1 dipped $1.41, to $46.96 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar fell against a basket of major currencies, with
the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY down 1.17 percent at 84.584.
Against the yen, the dollar JPY= rose 0.23 percent at 89.01.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The euro EUR= rose 1.34 percent at $1.3163.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. government bond prices were knocked lower on the home
sales data, as housing remains a key factor in the credit
crisis and the worst U.S. recession in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR fell
12/32 in price to yield 2.66 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury
bond US30YT=RR fell 44/32 in price to yield 3.38 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's Nikkei average .N225 fell 0.8 percent to close at
its lowest level in almost three months. MSCI's index of
Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.4
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many Asian markets were closed for the Lunar New Year,
while Australia and India were shut for national holidays.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N), the world's biggest technology services company, is cutting about 2,800 jobs in North America, according to documents supplied by a union seeking to represent the company's employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp spokesman Doug Shelton confirmed on Monday that the company last week informed some employees that their positions were being eliminated. But he declined to say how many were being cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's move came as companies in the United States and Europe announced tens of thousands of layoffs on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job cuts at IBM were evenly split between its software division and its sales and distribution unit, according to Lee Conrad, national coordinator for the Alliance at IBM. His group is a local chapter of the Communications Workers of America that is seeking to represent IBM's employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conrad added that he expects further layoffs to be announced, this time at IBM's hardware division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton declined to say which business divisions were cutting jobs. He added that the company regularly eliminates some jobs and adds new ones as business needs change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company -- which is the world's No. 2 maker of software and biggest manufacturer of mainframe computers -- employed nearly 400,000 workers at the end of December, up from about 386,000 a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The nature of our business is such that we must constantly assess employee skills and resources, at any given time, to give IBM the flexibility to match the current and future needs of our clients," Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Managing talent in this way keeps IBM competitive, which we know is very important -- especially when the economy is in a downturn," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laid off workers were given 30 to 90 days notice, were encouraged to apply for other jobs within IBM, and will be granted severance packages upon leaving the company, Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers will receive one week of pay for each six months of service with IBM, up to a maximum of 26 weeks of salary, according to one of the documents provided by Conrad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton declined to discuss details of the severance packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Karen Brettell

 NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Credit default swaps insuring
the debt of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) are reflecting uncertainty over
the fate of the company's planned acquisition of Wyeth WYE.N,
and if the deal goes through as planned its CDSs are likely to
weaken from current levels.

 Pfizer said on Monday it would acquire rival drugmaker
Wyeth for $68 billion in a deal designed to soften the blow of
losing its biggest product to generic competition. For details,
go to [ID:nN26367941]

 CDSs insuring Pfizer's debt jumped to a record 125 basis
points on Monday, or $125,000 per year to insure $10 million
for five years, as looming credit downgrades from the
additional $22.5 billion in debt planned to fund the purchase
weighed on its bonds.

 The CDS levels, however, still indicate doubt over whether
the deal will be completed.

 "At 125 basis points the CDS market is giving the deal a
50/50 chance," said Gary Kelly, director of research at broker
Tradition Asiel Securities. "I don't think it's a total done
deal."

 Standard  Poor's said it expects to cut Pfizer's rating to
"AA," the third highest investment grade, if the deal is
completed as planned. Moody's Investors Service said it is
likely to cut the firm to "A1," the fifth highest investment
grade.

 "Moody's A1 rating would imply CDS spreads should be a
little higher than they are now, the average for A1 is 150
basis points or higher," Kelly said.

 "I think there's a little bit of skepticism because its not
the perfect environment to get any sort of debt raising done,"
he added. "That said, if anyone could do it you'd think a
company like Pfizer could."

 Rohm and Haas Co ROH.N sued Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N) on
Monday after Dow refused to close its $15.3 billion takeover of
its rival, demonstrating how challenging it is to complete big
deals amid the global economic downturn. [ID:nN26354885]

 Credit default swaps based on Wyeth's debt, meanwhile, have
significantly outperformed those on Pfizer, weakening to only
70 basis points on Monday, from 67 basis points last Thursday.

 One factor keeping Wyeth's swaps relatively tight may be
the expectation that the company's bonds will be repaid as part
of the acquisition, leaving the CDSs effectively insuring no
debt, a process known as orphaning.

 "There is some talk of the possibility that Wyeth's bonds
go away on this, and that is why Wyeth's spreads are being held
down," said Tim Backshall, chief derivatives strategist at
Credit Derivatives Research in Walnut Creek, California. "But
there is nothing to suspect that this is the case so far."

 If the deal proceeds as planned Wyeth's ratings are likely
to be raised to the same level as Pfizer's and CDSs on Wyeth,
if the bonds are not repaid, should weaken to similar levels as
Pfizer's.

 "There's a number of hurdles that have to get cleared,"
said Tradition's Kelly. "I would expect CDS levels to notch up
as we clear those, and ultimately converge."

December, up from about 386,000 a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The nature of our business is such that we must constantly
assess employee skills and resources, at any given time, to
give IBM the flexibility to match the current and future needs
of our clients," Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Managing talent in this way keeps IBM competitive, which
we know is very important -- especially when the economy is in
a downturn," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Laid off workers were given 30 to 90 days notice, were
encouraged to apply for other jobs within IBM, and will be
granted severance packages upon leaving the company, Shelton
said.   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Workers will receive one week of pay for each six months of
service with IBM, up to a maximum of 26 weeks of salary,
according to one of the documents provided by Conrad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shelton declined to discuss details of the severance
packages.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc will be able to prosper and grow after merging with Wyeth, despite skepticism by some critics that a drugmaker that large can prosper, Pfizer Chief Executive Jeff Kindler said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, with annual sales of about $48 billion, would obtain an array of Wyeth prescription drugs, consumer products and animal health brands with annual sales of almost $23 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler, in an interview, said he disagreed with one analyst prediction that it would be "nearly impossible" for Pfizer to generate revenue growth from such a large combined new revenue base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What that kind of thinking might miss is the very different way we've organized our company and run the company" in the past two years, said Kindler, who took the helm of Pfizer in July 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has discovered very few big drugs over the past decade, despite buoyant optimism about important future drugs after buying Warner-Lambert Co in 2000 for $89 billion and scooping up Pharmacia Corp for $61 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Kindler predicted drugs will flow impressively again from its laboratories and bolster results of the combined Pfizer and Wyeth, thanks to recent changes that have narrowed Pfizer's focus to fewer disease areas and divided its operations into six independent business units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We've moved away from a centralized, monolithic one-size fits all approach," Kindler said, by creating separate units for primary care medicines, specialty medicines, oncology, established products (mature drugs and generics), emerging markets and animal health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Each of these is led, effectively, by their own CEO, with clear accountability and the ability to move their business to seize revenue opportunities quickly and within the best cost base for their organization," Kindler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler, who would remain CEO after Wyeth is acquired, said a consumer products business unit will now also be created at Pfizer. It would include Wyeth's many consumer brands, including Advil painkiller, ChapStick and Centrum vitamins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expressed admiration that Johnson  Johnson, a diversified healthcare company with annual revenue of $60 billion, has been able to generate consistently strong results over the years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I admire greatly what they've done and like their business model; it is very similar to what we're describing," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kinder earlier on Monday told journalists a handful of banks that are lending Pfizer $22.5 billion to help finance the Wyeth purchase were helping "advance the American economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if feared big jobs cuts after the planned Wyeth acquisition would instead hurt the economy, Kindler said, "You can't have good well-paying jobs without healthy American companies that are in a position to create those jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our obligation is to our shareholders, which requires us to run our company as effectively and efficiently as we can do, and that's what we intend to do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Bernard Orr); Reuters Messaging:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's $68 billion deal to buy Wyeth may spark more deals in the healthcare sector, but it is unlikely to revive the flailing merger market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer secured $22.5 billion in funding from a consortium of banks to help pay for the deal, a major feat at a time when credit markets remain tight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the U.S. recession and swooning global financial markets, the volume of mergers worldwide dropped 30 percent last year, according to data from Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're going to loan money, you're going to take a risk on the Pfizers of the world," said Richard Scheff, vice chairman of Montgomery McCracken.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not withstanding the lower profits, Pfizer is a very strong company with a lot of cash socked away. The banks have been criticized for making bad loans in the past, so you can't fault them for making a seemingly safer bet," Scheff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, not every would-be suitor has Pfizer's strong credit rating, hefty cash flow and marquee name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sign of how fragile the deals market remains, Dow Chemical Co said on Monday it will not close the acquisition of rival Rohm and Haas Co by January 27, breaking a key condition of the merger pact and sparking speculation the deal might collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rohm  Haas sued Dow Chemical in Delaware Chancery Court on Monday to try to enforce the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's ability to get funding may initially seem like a good omen for other suitors looking to do deals, but each deal is competing against every other transaction being shopped around to banks, investment bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Roche Holding AG, for example, is looking for funding as it aims to raise its bid for the 44 percent of Genentech Inc it does not already own, sources previously told Reuters. Last year, the Swiss drugmaker offered $43.7 billion, or $89 per share, to acquire the stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers have said  Roche is now waiting for the right moment to tap the difficult, expensive and illiquid credit markets before raising its bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Though there do seem to be banks willing to lend and the corporate debt market appears to be receptive to deals of this sort, the issues faced by Roche in its attempt to get financing to purchase Genentech ... should give some investors at least some pause," Les Funtleyder, analyst with Miller Tabak  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Pfizer deal may spur MA activity in pharmaceuticals and healthcare, as rivals respond to the Pfizer-Wyeth behemoth and the financing package could be a good sign for other cash-rich sectors looking to merge, said one lawyer who specializes in mergers and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MERGERS OF WEAKNESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Deals will be tough and bloody," said one merger lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another MA lawyer said job cuts would be the end game for many transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's all about either surviving or coming out of this as a dominant player in their sector," the lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer bought Wyeth in a move to diversify its revenue stream ahead of its key Lipitor cholesterol drug facing U.S. generic competition in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In announcing the Wyeth deal, Pfizer said it would halve its dividend to help fund the acquisition and would cut 15 percent of the combined company's workforce of about 130,000 employees. Together, the combined companies will save about $4 billion as they consolidate overlapping operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PROPER USE OF TARP FUNDS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fact that Pfizer was advised by and received funding from some banks that got billions of taxpayer dollars from the TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) also raised questions among some analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is a sign of the scrutiny banks will face going forward as they finance deals, oversight that could also serve as a deterrent to similar transactions going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We also wonder whether some of the banks who appear to have taken money under the TARP will than turn around and loan that money to finance a deal that will obviously -- to us -- lead to job losses -- something we assume the authors of the legislation would be vehemently against." said Funtleyder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scheff agreed, saying that, although the combination of Pfizer and Wyeth may be beneficial for the healthcare sector and economy over the long-term, the short-term effects may raise criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you listen to everything the government has said about trying to get money back into the economy and help small businesses survive and expand -- at the end of this day this deal isn't going to put people back to work soon. This can't be what government intended," Scheff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Kindler, however, took a different view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's good to see banks doing what they're supposed to be doing to lend money to advance the American economy," he said at a news conference. "Pfizer is a U.S. company that creates high paying good jobs for Americans."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Megan Davies in New York; Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Recasts with U.S. markets, changes dateline; previous
LONDON)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Herbert Lash&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. and European shares rose
on Monday as a $68 billion pharmaceutical takeover and a bright
spot in U.S. housing data spurred investors' optimism while oil
prices rose on speculation supply cuts were taking hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain's Barclays (BARC.L) added to the positive tone
after it said it did not need to raise fresh capital, sending
its battered shares soaring 73 percent and helping a recovery
in other financial shares on both sides of the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Longer-dated U.S. and euro zone government debt prices
fell, weighed by persistent concerns about the amount of new
issuance to flood markets this year to fund financial sector
bailouts and stimulus packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a sign of those concerns, gold climbed above $900 an
ounce, the highest level in more than three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lifting of gloom from equity markets overcame more bad
news on the jobs front after more than 70,000 layoffs were
announced by global corporate icons including Philips (PHG.AS),
ING (ING.AS) and Caterpillar (CAT.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The International Monetary Fund slashed its forecast for
2009 global growth to 0.5 percent from 2.2 percent in its
previous economic outlook in November, a source told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) proposed takeover of U.S. rival
Wyeth WYE.N opened the possibility of more deals ahead,
analysts said, as companies seek to position themselves
defensively in the midst of faltering global economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Deals of this quality and this magnitude will rekindle
enthusiasm and hope about equity markets," said Andre Bakhos,
president of Princeton Financial Group in New Brunswick, New
Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, fell 9.5
percent and Wyeth shares rose 0.55 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shortly after 1 p.m., the Dow Jones industrial average
.DJI was up 103.78 points, or 1.28 percent, at 8,181.34. The
Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 13.95 points, or 1.68
percent, at 845.90. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC was up
25.58 points, or 1.73 percent, at 1,502.87.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Any kind of MA is a positive and is seen as marking the
beginning of the light at the end of the tunnel," said Alan
Lancz, president of Alan B. Lancz  Associates Inc, an
investment advisory firm in Toledo, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You're going to see a lot of deals in health care. It's
cheap. Even in the utilities sector there's a lot of deals
waiting to happen."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Financial stocks in Europe surged, driving the FTSEurofirst
300 .FTEU3 index of leading European shares 3.2 percent
higher at 784.66 points. The index had fallen in 12 of the
previous 13 sessions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among other European banks, Lloyds (LLOY.L) jumped 32
percent, ING (ING.AS) gained 28 percent and Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS.L) added 19.8 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among U.S. banking shares, Bank of America (BAC.N) gained 7
percent and JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) rose 4.9 percent. The
SP financial index .GSPF rose 1.65 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worries about a deepening global slowdown and ongoing
turmoil in the financial sector have proven enormous hurdles
for investors to overcome in January, a month that often sets
the tone for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N), however, fell more than
9 percent after the heavy equipment maker forecast earnings in
2009 would drop significantly from last year. The company also
said it would shed about 20,000 workers as it grapples with
fallout from the economic turndown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of previously owned U.S. homes rebounded unexpectedly
in December, rising 6.5 percent, closing out a bleak year in
which prices dropped a record 15.3 percent, the National
Association of Realtors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The euro extended gains against the dollar to a one-week
high and the dollar rose against the yen after the U.S. housing
data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dollar was down against a basket of major currencies,
with the U.S. Dollar Index .DXY off 0.90 percent at 84.813.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The euro EUR= rose 1.04 percent at $1.3124, and against
the yen the dollar JPY= rose 0.47 percent at 89.23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. government bond prices were knocked lower on the home
sales data, as housing remains a key factor in the credit
crisis and the worst U.S. recession in decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note US10YT=RR fell
19/32 in price to yield 2.68 percent. The 30-year U.S. Treasury
bond US30YT=RR fell 62/32 in price to yield 3.41 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we get any glimmer of hope in housing, that would be a
huge change," said  Charlie Smith, chief investment officer of
Fort Pitt Capital Group in Greentree, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we can get clarity on the foreclosure aspect of this
number, that could be very bullish (for the economy) and
bearish for government bond prices," Smith added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. light sweet crude oil CLc1 rose 5 cents to $46.52 a
barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spot gold prices XAU= rose $7.80 to $906.20 an ounce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japan's Nikkei average .N225 fell 0.8 percent to close at
its lowest level in almost three months. MSCI's index of
Asia-Pacific stocks outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS rose 0.4
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many Asian markets were closed for the Lunar New Year,
while Australia and India were shut for national holidays.

acquisition of rival Rohm and Haas Co ROH.N by Jan. 27,
breaking a key condition of the merger pact and sparking
speculation the deal might collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rohm  Haas sued Dow Chemical in Delaware Chancery Court on
Monday to try to enforce the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's ability to get funding may initially seem like a
good omen for other suitors looking to do deals, but each deal
is competing against every other transaction being shopped
around to banks, investment bankers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Roche Holding AG (ROG.VX), for example, is looking for
funding as it aims to raise its bid for the 44 percent of
Genentech Inc DNA.N it does not already own, sources
previously told Reuters. Last year, the Swiss drugmaker offered
$43.7 billion, or $89 per share, to acquire the stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bankers have said said Roche is now waiting for the right
moment to tap the difficult, expensive and illiquid credit
markets before raising its bid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Though there do seem to be banks willing to lend and the
corporate debt market appears to be receptive to deals of this
sort, the issues faced by Roche in its attempt to get financing
to purchase Genentech ... should give some investors at least
some pause," Les Funtleyder, analyst with Miller Tabak  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the Pfizer deal may spur MA activity in
pharmaceuticals and healthcare, as rivals respond to the
Pfizer-Wyeth behemoth and the financing package could be a good
sign for other cash-rich sectors looking to merge, said one
lawyer who specializes in mergers and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MERGERS OF WEAKNESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Deals will be tough and bloody," said one merger lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another MA lawyer said job cuts would be the end game for
many transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's all about either surviving or coming out of this as a
dominant player in their sector," the lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer bought Wyeth in a move to diversify its revenue
stream ahead of its key Lipitor cholesterol drug facing U.S.
generic competition in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In announcing the Wyeth deal, Pfizer said it would halve
its dividend to help fund the acquisition and would cut 15
percent of the combined company's workforce of about 130,000
employees. Together, the combined companies will save about $4
billion as they consolidate overlapping operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PROPER USE OF TARP FUNDS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fact that Pfizer was advised by and received funding
from some banks that got billions of taxpayer dollars from the
TARP (Troubled Asset Relief Program) also raised questions
among some analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That is a sign of the scrutiny banks will face going
forward as they finance deals, oversight that could also serve
as a deterrent to similar transactions going forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "We also wonder whether some of the banks who appear to
have taken money under the TARP will than turn around and loan
that money to finance a deal that will obviously -- to us --
lead to job losses -- something we assume the authors of the
legislation would be vehemently against." said Funtleyder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Scheff agreed, saying that, although the combination of
Pfizer and Wyeth may be beneficial for the healthcare sector
and economy over the long-term, the short-term effects may
raise criticism.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you listen to everything the government has said about
trying to get money back into the economy and help small
businesses survive and expand -- at the end of this day this
deal isn't going to put people back to work soon. This can't be
what government intended," Scheff said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's Chief Executive Officer Jeff Kindler, however,
took a different view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's good to see banks doing what they're supposed to be
doing to lend money to advance the American economy," he said
at a news conference. "Pfizer is a U.S. company that creates
high paying good jobs for Americans."

 By Rodrigo Campos

 NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Monday
after an unexpected rise in home sales and a $68 billion
takeover in the drug industry sparked investor optimism
following three straight weekly losses.

 An SP index of financial stocks .GSPF gained as much as
4.2 percent after British bank Barclays (BARC.L) said it won't
need new capital -- a huge loss of about $11 billion
notwithstanding. For details see [ID:nLQ148329]. At midday,
the SP financial index had trimmed its earlier gain, but was
still up 1.6 percent.

 In a rare piece of good news for an economy in recession,
sales of existing U.S. homes surprisingly rebounded, rising
6.5 percent in December, while the inventories of unsold homes
registered their biggest one-month drop since December 2001.
The Dow Jones index of home builders' stocks .DJUSHB
advanced 3.8 percent.

 Positive news also came from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the
world's largest drugmaker, as it said it would buy its U.S.
rival Wyeth WYE.N for about $68 billion in a move to
diversify its revenue base. [ID:nN26367941].

 "The market is arguably six months ahead of the economy
and we are starting to see people plan for what will happen in
the future and nibble away on positive days like today," said
Jim Fehrenbach, head of equity distribution at Piper Jaffray
in Minneapolis.

 "You add all this small news together and you can
construct a more positive story for the future than what you
have right now."

 The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI gained 90.94
points, or 1.13 percent, to 8,168.20. The Standard  Poor's
500 Index .SPX rose 12.46 points, or 1.50 percent, to
844.41. The Nasdaq Composite Index .IXIC added 24.03 points,
or 1.63 percent, to 1,501.32.

 In the financial sector, shares of JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) rose almost 5 percent to $25.47 and helped bolter the
Dow industrials. The U.S.-listed shares of Barclays Plc
(BCS.N) surged nearly 64 percent to $5.03 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

 Among home builders' shares, Lennar Corp (LEN.N) shares
rose 13.2 percent to $7.74 and the stock of luxury builder
Toll Brothers (TOL.N) gained 3.8 percent to $18.59.

 Shares of Dow component General Electric (GE.N) rose 3.3
percent to $12.43 after investors welcomed news that credit
ratings agency Standard  Poor's said it will not cut GE's
'AAA' debt rating despite a 44 percent drop in fourth-quarter
profit and a warning of an "extremely difficult" 2009. For
details see  [ID:nN26381174].

 A rise in NYMEX crude futures CLc1 above $47 a barrel
prompted investors to buy energy companies' shares and lifted
the SP energy index .GSPE about 2 percent.

 Caterpillar Inc (CAT.N) shares, however, fell almost 9
percent to $32.51 after the heavy equipment maker forecast its
2009 profit would drop significantly from 2008.
[ID:nN21475857]

 Caterpillar and Pfizer were among the companies announcing
job cuts on Monday, with the ax falling on some 70,000 workers
in the United States and Europe as corporations cut costs to
battle the ongoing recession. [ID:nN26221005]

 Pfizer's stock fell 9.5 percent to $15.80, following news
of its plan to buy Wyeth and its report of lower
fourth-quarter profit. In contrast, Wyeth's stock was up 0.6
percent at $43.98.

COKE ZERO AND COCA-COLA TO DEBUT NEW ADS DURING TELECAST OF SUPER BOWL XLIII

This Sunday, Pittsburgh Steeler Troy Polamalu, one of football`s most
electrifying players, takes on the starring role in "Mean Troy," a new Coke Zero
ad that puts an unexpected twist on the iconic Coca-Cola "Mean Joe Greene"
commercial. 

On February 1, nearly 100 million fans watching NBC`s broadcast of Super Bowl
XLIII will see Polamalu shine on the field, but one of the Pro Bowl safety`s
biggest hits of the day may come in the first Coke Zero ad ever to air during
the Super Bowl telecast. In the 30-second spot, Polamalu reprises the part made
famous by Pittsburgh Steelers legend "Mean" Joe Greene, but in true Coke Zero
style, he takes the role in an entirely different direction. 

The first 12 seconds of the new Coke Zero spot are certain to cause double-takes
as they mimic the look of the original ad. The scene opens with Polamalu limping
down a tunnel to the locker room, followed closely by a young fan who offers an
ice-cold Coke Zero to his battered hero. All similarities end there as the
action takes a surprising turn to humorously reinforce that with Coke Zero, it`s
possible to have "Real Coke Taste and Zero Calories." 

"The Coca-Cola `Mean Joe Greene` ad is one of the most famous commercials of all
time, so I was blown away when they asked me to be in this new spot," said
Polamalu. "Following Joe`s performance is tough, but because my Coke Zero ad has
a totally unpredictable twist, we got to put a new spin on it. We`re keeping the
ending a surprise, but I think people will get a kick out of the intensity I
display to get my hands on the real Coke taste of Coke Zero." 

Since its launch in 2005, growth for Coke Zero continues to accelerate. The
brand grew by 35 percent in 2007 and maintained this level of performance
through August 2008, reaching a 1.5 share in the Sparkling Soft Drink category
(Neilsen - Q3 2008). 

For the third consecutive year, new commercials for Coca-Cola will also appear
in the Super Bowl telecast with the introduction of two spots from the brand`s
new global "Open Happiness" campaign. "Open Happiness," which launched just last
week, invites people to open a Coke and enjoy a simple moment of pleasure. 

"Our brands are part of the fun and celebrations that friends and families
experience when they gather to enjoy big events," said Katie Bayne, chief
marketing officer, Coca-Cola North America. "People watch the Super Bowl
broadcast as much for the ads as the game itself, so it`s a great way to remind
people of what Coca-Cola and Coke Zero share in common - great Coca-Cola taste."


A 60-second animated spot, entitled "Heist," features a man dozing off in a
park, unaware of a plot among the park`s smaller inhabitants to unite in an
effort to abscond with his Coca-Cola. 

The 30-second "Avatar" shows how people in today`s busy world use technology to
stay virtually linked, creating a lack of real connection. When two people in a
diner unexpectedly share a Coca-Cola, the human connection breaks down digital
walls and creates a moment of happiness. 

Following its debut, "Mean Troy" will continue to air in a variety of
programming and an expanded 60-second version will run in movie theaters across
the country. The Coca-Cola "Open Happiness" campaign made its debut on American
Idol last week and additional spots are slated to launch in coming weeks.
Crispin Porter + Bogusky created the new "Mean Troy" ad and the "Open Happiness"
campaign was developed by Wieden + Kennedy in Portland.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 26 (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve's near
zero percent interest rate policy has resulted in a massive
withdrawal from money market funds that invest only in safe but
low-yielding U.S. government securities, J.P. Morgan Securities
said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan analysts predicted assets in Treasury-only
money market funds could shrink 50 percent by the end of 2009
from its peak of about $760 billion in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The pace of asset declines at Treasury Only funds
accelerated into year-end and continues to decline in 2009,"
J.P. Morgan analysts Alex Roever and Cie-Jai Brown wrote in a
report published on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In about a month, assets in Treasury-only money funds have
fallen approximately $100 billion or 13 percent, according to
iMoneyNet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the Fed's adoption of near zero interest rate policy
(ZIRP) in December in an attempt to revive economic growth,
short-term U.S. rates including those on Treasury bills have
plummeted. The rates on one-month to one-year Treasury bills,
which Treasury-only money funds could own, ranged from 0.03
percent to 0.45 percent as of midday Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prior to the Fed's unprecedented rate move, investors had
flocked into Treasury-only money funds in hopes of shielding
their money from the wild swings in stocks and other risky
assets which have been hammered by the global downturn and
credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With safe but short-term Treasury bills rates running at
these historic lows, investors which have slightly more risk
appetite have favored government/agencies money funds that can
purchase higher-yielding securities issued by mortgage finance
agencies Fannie Mae FNM.P, Freddie Mac FRE.P and Federal
Home Loan Bank system, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This distinction has not only allowed them to survive the
onset of ZIRP, but over the past month assets have grown,
cannibalizing the Treasury Only cash," the J.P. Morgan analysts
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These government/agencies money funds on average hold more
than 70 percent of assets in agency securities, some of which
are yielding 95 basis points above the Overnight Indexed Swap
(OIS) rates or the market's expected Fed policy rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The three-month U.S. OIS was traded at about 0.20
percentage point midday Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Richard Leong; Editing by Diane Craft)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - John Thain, Bank of America's just ousted head of investment banking, securities and wealth management, is only the latest alumnus from Wall Street powerhouse Goldman Sachs to fall abruptly from grace as the legendary bank loses its aura of invincibility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thain -- the former chief operating officer at Merrill Lynch -- masterminded that bank's sale to Bank of America Corp. But he was forced to leave BofA under the shadow of a $15.31 billion fourth-quarter loss at Merrill, as well as allegations he was a lavish spender.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thain was among the many former executives from what once was Wall Street's most profitable investment bank who went on to other top companies, as well as the upper echelons of government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once they were the brightest stars in the investment universe, but Goldman alumni -- including Thain, former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and former Citigroup Chairman Robert Rubin -- look much less brilliant now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Goldman feet of clay is the way I look at it," said Nancy Bush, an analyst at NAB Research, referring to the one-time "masters of the universe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thain has made the biggest headlines lately. Along with a report that he spent $1.2 million redecorating his office shortly after joining Merrill Lynch in December 2007, his reputation was tarnished even more by a request for a bonus -- after Merrill racked up more than $20 billion in writedowns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he joined BofA, Thain brought on at least one other highly paid Goldman Sachs Group Inc executive -- Thomas Montag, who was paid a bonus of $39.4 million plus a $600,000 salary -- and other staff, such as former chief risk officer Noel Donohoe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet they did little to reverse the crisis at the firm, although their defenders say turning around Merrill, loaded up on risk as it was under its former management, might have been too much for anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond Merrill, former Goldman Chief Executive Henry Paulson's reign as U.S. Treasury Secretary came to an end this month, overshadowed by increasing criticism of his expensive efforts to revive the U.S. economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And earlier this month, former Goldman executive and Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin left his post as senior counselor at Citigroup Inc after coming under fire for his performance at the giant bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The list of Goldman executives whose names have lost their luster extends to Robert Steel, former Goldman vice chairman, who was parachuted into Wachovia Bank to save it and wound up selling it to Wells Fargo  Co, and Neel Kashkari, the Goldman wunderkind, who at 35 was named by Paulson to manage the government's $700 billion Troubled Asset Relief Program -- an increasingly unpopular bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The firm's reputation has taken some hits," said NAB Research's Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN REPRICED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Current Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein may have hoped he could rely on the bank's reputation as the financial crisis spun into a global recession. But that status looks increasingly tenuous now and Goldman Sachs' share price fell 61 percent last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lloyd Blankfein must be smacking his forehead about this," said Bush after Thain's exit from Bank of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not that things have been easy for those who stayed behind. Last month, the firm posted its first quarterly loss since going public and was forced to raise more than $20 billion in capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Goldman became a bank holding company regulated by the Federal Reserve in September after Merrill Lynch's sale to Bank of America and Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy left the markets reeling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Altogether during the fourth quarter, the bank was forced to seek $21 billion in capital from the U.S. Treasury, public investors and Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To be fair, Goldman and its former stars are not the only victims of a crisis that has overwhelmed many top bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a sense, the inability of executives such as Steel and Thain to keep struggling banks independent, or the difficulties of Paulson and Kashkari in managing the sprawling TARP bailout simply triggered a repricing of Goldman's talent -- much as many other once prized assets across Wall Street have had to be repriced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Stein, president and co-founder of investment firm FSI Group in Cincinnati perhaps says it best: "They are not cut from a different cloth than anyone else on Wall Street."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

Fitch does not rate the $66.6 million class NR. 

The rating downgrades are due to projected losses on the seven loans that are
specially serviced or will be imminently transferred to the special servicer
(1.7%). The Rating Outlooks reflect the likely direction of any rating changes
over the next one or two years. Forty loans (15.2%) are considered Fitch Loans
of Concern, including the specially serviced loans. Eleven additional loans
(6.3%) have been identified as Loans of Concern since the last Fitch rating
action. 

The largest specially serviced loan is Lembi Multifamily Portfolio (0.9%),
collateralized by eight multifamily properties in San Francisco, CA. The loan
transferred to the special servicer when the borrower failed to replenish a debt
service reserve as the loan documents require. The loan is current, and the
special servicer is considering forbearance on the requirement as long as the
loan remains current. Losses are not expected. 

The second largest specially serviced loan is the Anchor Government Assets
Portfolio (0.6%), collateralized by five office properties in Columbus, OH. The
primary tenants are state government entities, and the portfolio's tenants have
contracted due to budget cuts. The loan is 30 days delinquent, and losses are
expected. 

The largest Loan of Concern (2.3%) is collateralized by a regional mall located
in Miami, FL that was in the process of stabilizing at issuance due to a
recently added lifestyle center. Based on the September 2008 rent roll, the
property is approximately 95% occupied. The servicer reported debt service
coverage ratio (DSCR) through May 2008 was 1.16 times (x). Leases on
approximately 6% of the net rentable area have recently expired or will expire
in 2009. Given the rollover and the current outlook for retail properties, the
stabilization as originally expected is not likely to occur. 

The largest loan in the pool (4.3%) is secured by a regional mall in Estrero,
FL. The property was completed in 2006. The majority of the leases expire in
2016 or later. The servicer reported DSCR and occupancy through September 2008
were 1.26x and 99.8%, respectively. 

There are two shadow rated loans within the transaction: Centro Heritage
Portfolio V (2.4%) and Center West (1.7%). Occupancy as of June 2008 for Centro
Heritage Portfolio V and as of September 2008 for Center West were 89.5% and
72%, respectively, consistent with issuance. Both of the loans maintain
investment grade shadow ratings.

the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc, the No. 1 drugmaker, said on Monday that it would acquire U.S. rival Wyeth for about $68 billion in a move to diversify its revenue base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest drugmaker, which raised $22.5 billion in debt from a consortium of banks to finance the deal, also cut its dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following is reaction from industry analysts and investors:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEAMUS FERNANDEZ, ANALYST, LEERINK SWANN IN BOSTON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Pfizer ideally suited to buy Wyeth in the current environment, we believe additional suitors are unlikely to emerge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Although several companies may have the capability to execute a mega-merger in the current environment (JNJ, ABT, GSK, SNY), we believe that Pfizer is ideally suited to execute the deal due to limited overlap in its businesses and what we perceive to be reasonably aligned corporate cultures. We believe that Pfizer is best-positioned to deliver on the financing necessary to close the deal in the current environment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MICHAEL CASTOR, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, SIO CAPITAL MANAGEMENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IN NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"An acquisition of this nature can be valuable if management recognizes how rich their spending is and really cuts to maximize the profitability of the new organization. $4 billion in cuts a good first step. There's a lot of potential to go deeper across the combined organization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With the cost cuts that they've articulated, it's an OK deal, it's not destructive. But they could really make it into a good deal if they cut deeper, and I think there's the potential to do so."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LES FUNTLEYDER, HEALTHCARE ANALYST, MILLER TABAK IN NEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Big mergers tend not to be value creators historically, maybe with the exception of Pfizer's Warner-Lambert deal to get Lipitor, and that is still is even an open question."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The odds do not favor necessarily the big merger working, but they had to do something. They had to buy time for their RD units to kick out new drugs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the market will be glad that Pfizer is actually doing something. I do question the financing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PETER BOOCKVAR, EQUITY STRATEGIST AT MILLER TABAK  CO IN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Obviously those companies that are cash rich can afford to pay something like this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has a major issue with Lipitor going generic in a couple years so they have a major pipeline that they have to fill. They're cash rich so a combination of that has them in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wouldn't extrapolate this deal and say we're going to see a lot more deals because it's still a difficult financing environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer has a top tier balance sheet and they can handle something like this."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANDRE BAKHOS, PRESIDENT PRINCETON FINANCIAL GROUP, NEW&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUNSWICK, NEW JERSEY:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Deals of this quality and this magnitude will rekindle enthusiasm and hope about equity markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the midst of a global recession, here is Pfizer, hopefully spending their dollar's wisely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ellis Mnyandu, Leah Schnurr and Lewis Krauskopf)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pittsburgh Steeler Troy Polamalu to Star on the Field and in a New Coke Zero Ad
Reminiscent of Iconic `Mean Joe Greene` Commercial

Coca-Cola to Debut Two Ads from New "Open Happiness" Campaign
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
This Sunday, Pittsburgh Steeler Troy Polamalu, one of football`s most
electrifying players, takes on the starring role in "Mean Troy," a new Coke Zero
ad that puts an unexpected twist on the iconic Coca-Cola "Mean Joe Greene"
commercial. 

On February 1, nearly 100 million fans watching NBC`s broadcast of Super Bowl
XLIII will see Polamalu shine on the field, but one of the Pro Bowl safety`s
biggest hits of the day may come in the first Coke Zero ad ever to air during
the Super Bowl telecast. In the 30-second spot, Polamalu reprises the part made
famous by Pittsburgh Steelers legend "Mean" Joe Greene, but in true Coke Zero
style, he takes the role in an entirely different direction. 

The first 12 seconds of the new Coke Zero spot are certain to cause double-takes
as they mimic the look of the original ad. The scene opens with Polamalu limping
down a tunnel to the locker room, followed closely by a young fan who offers an
ice-cold Coke Zero to his battered hero. All similarities end there as the
action takes a surprising turn to humorously reinforce that with Coke Zero, it`s
possible to have "Real Coke Taste and Zero Calories." 

"The Coca-Cola `Mean Joe Greene` ad is one of the most famous commercials of all
time, so I was blown away when they asked me to be in this new spot," said
Polamalu. "Following Joe`s performance is tough, but because my Coke Zero ad has
a totally unpredictable twist, we got to put a new spin on it. We`re keeping the
ending a surprise, but I think people will get a kick out of the intensity I
display to get my hands on the real Coke taste of Coke Zero." 

Since its launch in 2005, growth for Coke Zero continues to accelerate. The
brand grew by 35 percent in 2007 and maintained this level of performance
through August 2008, reaching a 1.5 share in the Sparkling Soft Drink category
(Neilsen - Q3 2008). 

For the third consecutive year, new commercials for Coca-Cola will also appear
in the Super Bowl telecast with the introduction of two spots from the brand`s
new global "Open Happiness" campaign. "Open Happiness," which launched just last
week, invites people to open a Coke and enjoy a simple moment of pleasure. 

"Our brands are part of the fun and celebrations that friends and families
experience when they gather to enjoy big events," said Katie Bayne, chief
marketing officer, Coca-Cola North America. "People watch the Super Bowl
broadcast as much for the ads as the game itself, so it`s a great way to remind
people of what Coca-Cola and Coke Zero share in common - great Coca-Cola taste."


A 60-second animated spot, entitled "Heist," features a man dozing off in a
park, unaware of a plot among the park`s smaller inhabitants to unite in an
effort to abscond with his Coca-Cola. 

The 30-second "Avatar" shows how people in today`s busy use technology to stay
virtually linked, creating a lack of real connection. When two people in a diner
unexpectedly share a Coca-Cola, the human connection breaks down digital walls
and creates a moment of happiness. 

Following its debut, "Mean Troy" will continue to air in a variety of
programming and an expanded 60-second version will run in movie theaters across
the country. The Coca-Cola "Open Happiness" campaign made its debut on American
Idol last week and additional spots are slated to launch in coming weeks.
Crispin Porter + Bogusky created the new "Mean Troy" ad and the "Open Happiness"
campaign was developed by Wieden + Kennedy in Portland.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The top 50 U.S. banks need to raise another $200 billion of common equity to absorb shocks from bad mortgage loans and other assets, Goldman Sachs said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Analyst Richard Ramsden said the big U.S. banks face the risk of becoming the "new utilities" as increased regulation and higher capital requirements pressure their return on equity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He expects consumer and residential real estate problems to accelerate in 2009, increasing capital risks for the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Ramsden re-launched his coverage on U.S. large-cap banks with a cautious view and warned investors to avoid Citigroup Inc (C.N) stock because of its unclear equity value and lack of clarity on its core earnings power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramsden, who reinstated Citigroup with a "sell" rating, said the third-largest U.S. bank by assets must absorb $29 billion in pre-tax losses before the loss sharing by the government kicks in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup's market value was about $19 billion based on Friday's close of $3.47, according to Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is not enough equity at Citigroup to absorb those kinds of losses in the near term without further recapitalization," analyst Ramsden said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage reinstated PNC Financial Services Group (PNC.N), Wells Fargo (WFC.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) with a "neutral" rating and resumed JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) by adding it to the Americas conviction buy list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage cut Bank of America (BAC.N) to "neutral" from "buy" and reduced its price target to $7 from $35. It also lowered U.S. Bancorp (USB.N) to "sell" from "neutral" and added it to Americas conviction sell list.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst said he expects U.S. commercial banks to cut dividend in the first half of 2009 and continue to raise capital, but added that the theme would be "stronger banks raising capital to execute take-unders of weaker banks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Supantha Mukherjee in Bangalore; Editing by Himani Sarkar, Anil D'Silva)&lt;/p&gt;

sending Crucell's shares tumbling, as the U.S. drugmaker's own
$68 billion takeover by Pfizer neared agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source familiar with the matter said Crucell CRCL.AS had
only talked to Wyeth because of an "extremely attractive"
proposal of at least 20 euros a share, and it was not actively
seeking an alternative buyer. Crucell declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Crucell fell as much as 23 percent but later
trimmed losses. They stood 16 percent lower at 13.035 euros a
share by 1337 GMT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hours after Crucell said its talks with Wyeth had been
discontinued, Pfizer (PFE.N), the world's largest drugmaker,
said it would buy Wyeth for about $68 billion, helping it
diversify its revenue base. [ID:nN26291129]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Leiden-based Crucell is one of the world's few remaining
independent vaccine makers. Its shares leapt after it revealed
earlier this month it was talking to Wyeth, but then fell last
week on fears that a Pfizer-Wyeth tie-up could scupper the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another major drugmaker such as Novartis (NOVN.VX) or
Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) could be interested in Crucell but it
would not formally put itself up for sale, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The only reason (Crucell) opened up the discussions is
because what was considered an extremely attractive offer was
put on the table," the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Sanofi fell 2.1 percent on talk it could bid for
Crucell, traders said. A spokesman declined to comment.
[ID:nWEA3338]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A 20-euro-per-share bid for Crucell would value the
company's stock at more than 1.3 billion euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking on CNBC, Pfizer Inc Chairman and Chief Executive
Jeff Kindler declined to comment on whether Pfizer would now
seek to acquire Crucell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crucell in November posted its first quarterly profit,
boosted by sales of its vaccines and cost savings, and raised
its 2008 sales outlook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its sales have been fuelled by strong growth in its
paediatric vaccines, especially Quinvaxem, a vaccine cocktail
for the childhood diseases diphtheria, tetanus, whooping cough
and hepatitis B.

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer cuts dividend&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Wyeth pulls out of Crucell talks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Wyeth up, Pfizer down in premarket
 (Adds details)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the No. 1
drugmaker, said on Monday that it would acquire U.S. rival
Wyeth WYE.N for about $68 billion in a move to diversify its
revenue base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest drugmaker, which raised $22.5 billion
in debt from a consortium of banks to finance the deal, also
cut its dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal helps Pfizer cope with a major gap in revenue in
2011, when its blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol treatment will
begin to face U.S. generic competition. Next year, Wyeth loses
patent protection on its own top drug, the anti-depressant
Effexor XR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the deal would help Pfizer diversify into vaccines
and injectable biologic medicines by adding Wyeth's big-selling
Prevnar vaccine for childhood infections and Enbrel rheumatoid
arthritis treatment. Pfizer would also realize major cost
savings by streamlining areas that overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For each share of Wyeth, Pfizer will pay roughly $50.19 --
$33 in cash and 0.985 of a share of its stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on Wyeth's 1.33 billion shares outstanding as of Oct.
31, the deal would be valued at about $66.8 billion. Including
Wyeth's stock options, the deal would be worth $68 billion,
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At $50.19 per share, the deal would mark a 15 percent
premium over Wyeth's closing stock price of $43.74 on Friday.
Wyeth's stock had surged 12.6 percent on Friday on news of the
possible deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is expected to add to Pfizer's adjusted diluted
earnings per share in the second full year after closing and to
result in cost savings of $4 billion by the third year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONSOLIDATION WAVE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer typifies many large drugmakers, which have struggled
to produce new blockbusters to replace those on which they lose
exclusivity. [ID:nN23318400]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A merger of Pfizer and Wyeth could trigger a wave of
consolidation in the cash-rich pharmaceutical sector as
drugmakers look to diversify revenues in the face of
competition from generic-drug rivals, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The outlook for the industry has steadily waned, (with)
industry P/E multiples declining under the combined onslaught
of price pressure, aggressive generic competition and low RD
productivity," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The result is that many leading companies face a decline
in revenues and earnings next decade, as profitable products
reach the end of their patented lives and are not replaced by
new drugs," the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They said AstraZeneca (AZN.L) could be a target, although
there were also reasons a deal might not happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In sealing the Pfizer deal, Wyeth went ahead and ended
talks to buy Dutch vaccine firm Crucell CRCL.AS. Crucell
shares plummeted 21.1 percent to 12.23 euros. [ID:nLQ120204]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal is subject to Pfizer's financing sources not
backing out due to a material adverse change in Pfizer's
financial health or due to the company's failure to maintain a
certain credit rating. Pfizer and Wyeth expect the transaction
to close at the end of the third quarter or during the fourth
quarter 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares fell to $16.70 in trading before the market
opened from Friday's close of $17.45, while Wyeth rose to
$45.90 from $43.74.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc posted a lower net profit on Monday, as its fourth-quarter results were hurt by a higher tax rate, charges related to cost reduction initiatives and settlement costs from an investigation by U.S. authorities.&lt;/p&gt;

Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for fourth-quarter and
full-year 2008. For fourth-quarter 2008, the Company recorded reported revenues
of $12.3 billion, a decrease of 4% compared with the year-ago quarter. This
decrease was primarily attributable to the negative impact of the loss of U.S.
exclusivity for Zyrtec in January 2008, and for Camptosar in February 2008, as
well as the loss of exclusivity for Norvasc in Korea and Japan in February 2008
and July 2008, respectively. Zyrtec, Camptosar and Norvasc fourth-quarter 2008
revenues decreased by $515 million ($263 million, $144 million and $108 million,
respectively), compared with the year-ago quarter. In addition, foreign exchange
unfavorably impacted reported revenues by approximately $380 million or 3%,
partially offset by the solid performance of key products. 

U.S. reported revenues were $5.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2008, a decrease of
8% compared with the year-ago quarter. International reported revenues were $7.1
billion, a decrease of 1% compared with the year-ago quarter, and reflect
operational growth of 5%, which was more than offset by the unfavorable impact
of foreign exchange of 6%. U.S. reported revenues accounted for 43% of the total
compared with 44% in the year-ago quarter, while international reported revenues
accounted for 57% of the total compared with 56% in the year-ago quarter. 

For fourth-quarter 2008, Pfizer posted reported net income of $266 million, a
decline of 90% compared with the prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS of
$0.04, a decrease of 90% compared with the prior-year quarter. Fourth-quarter
2008 results were impacted by a $2.3 billion pre-tax and after-tax charge
resulting from an agreement in principle with the Office of Michael Sullivan,
the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, to resolve
previously disclosed investigations regarding allegations of past off-label
promotional practices concerning Bextra, as well as other open investigations.
In addition, results were unfavorably impacted by an increased effective tax
rate, as well as an increase in pre-tax charges of $1.2 billion ($700 million
after-tax) associated with cost-reduction initiatives, which were partially
offset by savings from those initiatives. 

For full-year 2008, Pfizer recorded reported revenues of $48.3 billion,
essentially flat compared with 2007 full-year revenues of $48.4 billion, despite
the loss of exclusivity of Norvasc, Zyrtec and Camptosar, which collectively
decreased revenues by $2.6 billion. Full-year revenues were favorably impacted
by foreign exchange of approximately $1.6 billion, or 3%, and the solid
performance of many key products. U.S. reported revenues were $20.4 billion, a
decrease of 12% year over year, while international reported revenues were $27.9
billion, an increase of 10%, reflecting the favorable impact of foreign exchange
of 6% and operational growth of 4%. U.S. reported revenues accounted for 42% of
the total compared with 48% in the year-ago period, while international reported
revenues accounted for 58% of the total compared with 52% in the year-ago
period. 

For full-year 2008, the Company posted reported net income of $8.1 billion,
essentially flat compared with the prior year, and reported diluted EPS of
$1.20, an increase of 3% compared with $1.17. This was primarily attributable to
savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, the 2007 after-tax
charges of $1.8 billion related to the decision to exit Exubera and the
favorable impact of foreign exchange, offset by the aforementioned charge
related to Bextra and other open investigations in fourth-quarter 2008, as well
as the after-tax charge of $640 million resulting from the agreements in
principle to resolve certain litigation involving the Company`s non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain medicines in third-quarter 2008 and an increased
effective tax rate. 

Adjusted Revenues(1), Adjusted Income(1) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(1) Results

For fourth-quarter 2008, Pfizer posted adjusted revenues(1) of $12.3 billion, a
decrease of 4% compared with $12.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. For
full-year 2008, Pfizer posted adjusted revenues(1) of $48.3 billion, essentially
flat compared with $48.2 billion in full-year 2007. Adjusted revenues(1) in both
periods were positively impacted by the solid performance of key products, and
negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Norvasc, Zyrtec and Camptosar.
In addition, foreign exchange unfavorably impacted fourth-quarter 2008 revenues
compared with the year-ago period by $389 million, but favorably impacted
full-year 2008 revenues by $1.6 billion compared with the prior year. 

Fourth-quarter 2008 adjusted income(1) was $4.4 billion, an increase of 29%
compared with $3.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(1)
was $0.65, an increase of 30% compared with $0.50 in the year-ago quarter. Both
adjusted income(1) and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were positively impacted by
savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and higher fourth-quarter
2007 spending levels in comparison with fourth-quarter 2008, partially offset by
an increase in the effective tax rate. Full-year 2008 adjusted income(1) was
$16.4 billion, an increase of 8% compared with $15.1 billion in the year-ago
period, and adjusted diluted EPS(1) was $2.42, an increase of 11% compared with
$2.18. Full-year 2008 adjusted income(1) and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were
primarily impacted by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and savings from
cost-reduction initiatives. 

Reported and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were also positively impacted by the full
benefit of Pfizer`s purchase of $10.0 billion of the Company`s common stock in
2007. 

Executive Commentary

"We are pleased with our performance in 2008," said Chairman and Chief Executive
Jeff Kindler. "We achieved our financial objectives, including exceeding our
cost-reduction target, despite the tumultuous global economy. Notwithstanding an
extremely competitive and increasingly challenging environment in 2008, we made
significant progress by: establishing customer-focused business units;
reprioritizing and refocusing our research on the greatest opportunities for
scientific, medical and commercial success; and increasing our Phase 3 portfolio
by approximately 60%, from 16 to 26 programs at year-end. These successes have
provided the ideal platform from which we`re advancing Pfizer forward." 

"As part of this advancement, today we announced that we have entered into an
agreement to acquire Wyeth to create the world`s premier biopharmaceutical
company. The combination of Pfizer and Wyeth will meaningfully deliver Pfizer`s
strategic priorities in a single transaction. Our combined company will be one
of the most diversified in the industry and will benefit from complementary
patient-centric units that match speed with the benefits of a global company`s
scale and resources," continued Kindler. 

Frank D`Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "In 2008, we exceeded our
cost-reduction target by decreasing our adjusted total costs(2) by $2.8 billion
in comparison to 2006 on a constant currency basis(3). In addition, we are
implementing a new cost-reduction initiative that will drive a lower, more
variable cost structure to achieve anticipated incremental savings of
approximately $3 billion by the end of 2011 compared with our 2008 adjusted
total costs(2) level. After allocating approximately $1 billion of investment to
high-growth opportunities, we anticipate net savings of about $2 billion
compared with our 2008 adjusted total costs(2) at 2008 average foreign exchange
rates. The anticipated net savings from this new initiative in addition to the
savings we achieved at year-end 2008 under our previous cost-reduction
initiative total approximately $4.8 billion." 

"Further, as part of the proposed acquisition of Wyeth, we expect to achieve
synergies of approximately $4 billion by the end of 2012, which will be in
addition to the savings from our previous cost-reduction initiatives," continued
D`Amelio. 

"In 2009, Pfizer expects to generate revenues of $44.0 to $46.0 billion, and
adjusted diluted EPS(1) of $1.85 to $1.95, which includes most of the
anticipated $1 billion investment intended to create new sources of revenue.
This also assumes a reduction in revenues of approximately $3.0 billion compared
with 2008 directly related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar," stated
D`Amelio. 

New Cost-Reduction Initiative

Pfizer will implement a new cost-reduction initiative, which is expected to
achieve incremental cost savings of approximately $3 billion, at 2008 average
foreign exchange rates, compared with 2008 adjusted total costs(2) of $28.6
billion. The program will be substantially complete by the end of 2010, with the
full savings to be realized by the end of 2011. Approximately $1 billion of
these savings will be reinvested in the business, resulting in an expected $2
billion net decrease. With this initiative and our recently completed
initiative, the Company expects to reduce adjusted total costs(2) by about $4.8
billion while absorbing inflation and compensation increases. 

As part of this cost-reduction initiative, Pfizer intends to reduce its
workforce by approximately 10%. Reductions will span sales, manufacturing,
research and development, and administrative organizations. The Company also
intends to reduce the number of manufacturing sites to 41 from 46 today, as well
as reduce its facilities square footage by approximately 15%. In conjunction
with this program, Pfizer expects to incur costs of approximately $6 billion on
a pre-tax basis, of which $1.5 billion has been incurred.

Pharmaceutical

Pharmaceutical revenues for fourth-quarter 2008 were $11.2 billion, a decrease
of 4% compared with the prior-year quarter, including the unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange of approximately $340 million or 3%. Fourth-quarter 2008
revenues were unfavorably impacted by the aforementioned loss of exclusivity of
Norvasc, Zyrtec and Camptosar, partially offset by revenues from in-line
products(4), which increased 1% compared with the year-ago quarter. 

Pharmaceutical revenues for full-year 2008 were $44.2 billion, a decrease of 1%
compared with the prior year, including the favorable impact of foreign exchange
of approximately $1.5 billion or 3%. Full-year 2008 revenues were unfavorably
impacted by the aforementioned loss of exclusivity of Norvasc, Zyrtec and
Camptosar, partially offset by revenues from in-line and new products(6), which
increased 7% from the prior year. In addition, full-year 2008 pharmaceutical
revenues were negatively impacted by a $217 million adjustment to the prior
years` product returns liabilities recorded in third-quarter 2008. 

Lipitor revenues in fourth-quarter 2008 were $3.1 billion, a decrease of 8%
compared with the prior-year quarter. In the U.S., Lipitor revenues were $1.6
billion, a decrease of 13% compared with the prior-year quarter. Revenues from
international markets were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 2%, reflecting the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of approximately $124 million, or 8%,
which more than offset operational growth of 6%. 

Lyrica revenues in fourth-quarter 2008 were $702 million, a year-over-year
increase of 25%, driven by strong physician prescribing patterns and patient
satisfaction, as well as increased use of Lyrica for fibromyalgia in the U.S.,
where the product continues to build on its leadership position for this
indication. In the U.S., Lyrica revenues were $384 million, a year-over-year
increase of 20%, while international revenues were $318 million, an increase of
31%, reflecting operational growth of 42% and the unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange of 11%. 

Celebrex revenues in fourth-quarter 2008 were $664 million, an increase of 4%
compared with the year-ago quarter, supported by continued educational and
promotional efforts highlighting the benefit-risk proposition of Celebrex. In
the U.S., Celebrex revenues were $489 million, an increase of 4% compared with
the prior-year quarter, while international revenues were $175 million, an
increase of 4%. 

Sutent revenues in fourth-quarter 2008 were $220 million, a year-over-year
increase of 21%, demonstrating continued strong performance and market
leadership in its approved indications. In the U.S., Sutent revenues were $66
million, an increase of 5% year over year, while international revenues were
$154 million, an increase of 30%. Sutent is available in all major markets and
is supported by efficacy, survival and cost-effectiveness data. Further, its
robust life cycle plan currently includes Phase 3 clinical trials in cancers
with unmet medical need, such as breast, lung, colorectal, liver and prostate
cancers. 

Chantix (known as Champix outside the U.S.) revenues in fourth-quarter 2008 were
$180 million, a decrease of 36% year over year. In the U.S., Chantix revenues
were $91 million, a decline of 55% compared with the prior-year quarter, while
international revenues were $89 million, an increase of 13%. Fourth-quarter 2008
U.S. results continued to be negatively impacted by the changes to the Chantix
U.S. label in prior quarters. Pfizer continues its educational and promotional
efforts with physicians and patients, focused on Chantix`s benefit-risk
proposition given the significant negative health consequences of smoking, as
well as the importance of physician-patient dialogue in helping patients quit
smoking. Chantix has now been launched in all major markets, with nine launches
planned in 2009 in emerging markets. 

Animal Health

Animal Health revenues for fourth-quarter 2008 were $783 million, essentially
flat compared with $785 million in the year-ago quarter. Full-year 2008 Animal
Health revenues were $2.8 billion, an increase of 7% compared with $2.6 billion
in 2007, driven by strong global livestock and companion animal product
performance. In fourth-quarter 2008, foreign exchange unfavorably impacted
revenues by approximately $35 million or 4%, while in full-year 2008, foreign
exchange positively impacted revenues by approximately $80 million or 3%,
compared with the prior-year respective periods. 

Costs and Expenses

In fourth-quarter 2008, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of revenues
was 11.7% compared with 17.7% in fourth-quarter 2007. For the full-year 2008,
adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of revenues was 14.6% compared with
16.0% in 2007, an improvement from our previous guidance of 15.0% to 15.5%. This
improvement reflects the benefits from our cost-reduction initiatives and
foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of
sales(1) as a percentage of revenues was 15.6% in fourth-quarter 2008 and 15.2%
for the full-year 2008. 

Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI) expenses(1) were $3.5
billion in fourth-quarter 2008, a decrease of 23% compared with the prior-year
quarter. For the full-year 2008, adjusted SI expenses(1) were $14.0 billion, a
decrease of 8% compared with 2007. These decreases were primarily due to the
favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives. In addition, higher
fourth-quarter 2007 spending levels contributed to the quarter-over-quarter
decline in adjusted SI expenses(1). Foreign exchange positively impacted
fourth-quarter 2008 by $103 million and negatively impacted full-year 2008 by
$379 million compared with the respective year-ago periods. 

Adjusted research and development (R) expenses(1) were $2.2 billion in
fourth-quarter 2008, an increase of 2% compared with the prior-year period. For
full-year 2008, adjusted R expenses(1) were $7.5 billion, a decrease of 1%
compared with 2007. The increase in fourth-quarter 2008 is primarily the result
of up-front payments totaling $300 million related to the licensing agreements
with Medivation, Inc. and Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Both periods also
benefited from the favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives. 

Overall, operational improvements decreased adjusted total costs(2) by $1.1
billion or 12% in fourth-quarter 2008 compared with the prior-year period, and
foreign exchange decreased adjusted total costs(2) by $702 million or 8%.
Foreign exchange increased full-year 2008 adjusted total costs(2) by $312
million or 1% compared with 2007. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange,
full-year 2008 adjusted total costs(2) decreased by approximately $2.2 billion,
or 7%, compared with 2007. The operational improvement was driven partially by
the reduction in workforce to approximately 81,900 at year-end 2008, a decline
of 4,700 compared with the year-end 2007, as well as manufacturing and research
and development site exits. 

At the end of fourth-quarter 2008, Pfizer exceeded its goal to reduce absolute
adjusted total costs(2) by at least $2.0 billion by the end of 2008 compared
with 2006 on a constant currency basis(3), realizing a total reduction of $2.8
billion. 

Financial Guidance

For full-year 2009, Pfizer`s financial guidance, at current exchange rates(9) is
summarized below. The 2009 financial guidance, in comparison with 2008 financial
results, reflects the projected impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar,
increased pension expenses and lower interest income. It also reflects an
increase in the effective tax rate resulting from financial strategies in
connection with the proposed acquisition of Wyeth. These factors contributed to
a reduction in our Adjusted Diluted EPS(1) of approximately $0.50.

PFIZER INC

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

1) Change in Revenues

The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the
euro, U.K. pound, and Canadian dollar, unfavorably impacted our revenues by
approximately $380 million, or 3%, in fourth-quarter 2008, compared to the same
period in 2007. The weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies,
primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar, favorably impacted our
revenues by approximately $1.6 billion, or 3%, in full-year 2008, compared to
full-year 2007. 

Reported revenues in full-year 2008 include a reduction of $217 million, to
adjust our prior years` liabilities for product returns. In third-quarter 2008,
after a detailed review of our returns experience, we determined that our
previous methodology needed to be revised, as the lag time between product sale
and return was actually much longer than we had previously assumed. Although
recorded in third-quarter 2008, virtually all of the adjustment relates back
several years. We have also reviewed our expense calculations for the prior
years and determined that the expense recorded in those years was not materially
different from what would have been recorded under our revised approach. 

2) Change in Cost of Sales

Reported cost of sales decreased 35% in fourth-quarter 2008, compared to the
same period in 2007, and decreased 28% in full-year 2008, compared to full-year
2007. The decrease for fourth-quarter 2008 primarily reflects a favorable impact
from foreign exchange and the savings impact of our cost-reduction initiatives.
The decrease for full-year 2008 primarily reflects a $2.6 billion charge in
third-quarter 2007 related to our decision to exit Exubera, the savings impact
of our cost-reduction initiatives and a favorable impact from foreign exchange,
partially offset by higher implementation costs associated with our
cost-reduction initiatives. 

Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $225 million for fourth-quarter 2008, $745 million
for full-year 2008, $263 million for fourth-quarter 2007, and $700 million for
full-year 2007. 

Reported cost of sales also included $31 million for fourth-quarter 2008, $162
million for full-year 2008, $73 million for fourth-quarter 2007 and $194 million
for full-year 2007, related to business-transition activities associated with
the sale of our Consumer Healthcare business, completed in December 2006. This
continuing activity is transitional in nature and generally results from
agreements that seek to facilitate the orderly transfer of operations of our
former Consumer Healthcare business to the new owner. 

Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 6.5 percentage
points to 13.9% in fourth quarter 2008, compared to the same period in 2007,
reflecting the favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and the impact
of foreign exchange, as well as lower implementation costs associated with our
cost-reduction initiatives. Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues
decreased 6.4 percentage points to 16.8% in full-year 2008, compared to
full-year 2007, reflecting a $2.6 billion charge in third-quarter 2007 related
to our decision to exit Exubera, the favorable impact of our cost-reduction
initiatives and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher
implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives. 

3) Change in Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI) Expenses and
Research &amp; Development (R) Expenses

Reported SI expenses decreased 21% in fourth-quarter 2008, reflecting the
savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and a favorable impact
from foreign exchange. Reported SI expenses decreased 7% in full-year 2008,
compared to the same periods in 2007, reflecting the savings associated with our
cost-reduction initiatives and a $85 million charge in 2007 related to our
decision to exit Exubera, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign
exchange and the impact of higher implementation costs associated with our
cost-reduction initiatives. 

Reported SI expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $143 million for fourth-quarter 2008, $413 million
for full-year 2008, $136 million for fourth-quarter 2007 and $334 million for
full-year 2007. 

Reported R expenses, excluding acquisition-related in-process research and
development charges (IPR), increased 2% in fourth-quarter 2008, and decreased
2% in full-year 2008, compared to the same periods in 2007. The increase for
fourth-quarter 2008 was primarily due to an up-front payment to Medivation, Inc.
in connection with our collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize
Dimebon, partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign exchange and the
realization of savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives. The
decrease for full-year 2008 compared to full-year 2007 was primarily due to the
collaboration payments made to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in second-quarter
2007 in connection with our collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban
and a $100 million charge in 2007 related to our decision to exit Exubera, in
addition to the realization of savings associated with our cost-reduction
initiatives, partially offset by the up-front payment to Medivation, Inc. in the
fourth quarter of 2008 and higher R spending related to Phase 3 clinical
trials in 2008. 

Reported R expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $85 million for fourth-quarter 2008, $433 million
for full-year 2008, $124 million for fourth-quarter 2007 and $416 million for
full-year 2007. 

IPR charges of $633 million in 2008 primarily related to our acquisitions of
Serenex, Inc., Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CovX, Coley Pharmaceutical Group,
Inc. and a number of animal health product lines from Schering-Plough
Corporation, as well as two smaller acquisitions also related to Animal Health.
IPR charges in 2007 of $283 million primarily related to our acquisitions of
BioRexis Pharmaceutical Corp. and Embrex, Inc. 

4) Asset Impairment Charges and Other Costs Associated with Exiting Exubera

In third-quarter 2007, after an assessment of the financial performance of
Exubera, an inhalable form of insulin for the treatment of diabetes, as well as
its lack of acceptance by patients, physicians and payers, we decided to exit
the product. 

Total pre-tax charges for 2007 were $2.8 billion and were primarily included in
Cost of sales ($2.6 billion), Selling, informational andadministrative expenses
($85 million), and Research and development expenses ($100 million). Total
pre-tax charges for 2008 were not significant.

*Certain prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation. 

(a) The decreases in net interest income in fourth-quarter and full-year 2008,
compared to the same periods in 2007, were due primarily to lower net financial
assets and lower interest rates. 

(b) In third-quarter 2008, we recorded charges of approximately $900 million
related to our agreements in principle to resolve certain litigation involving
our non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medicines and in fourth-quarter 2008,
we recorded charges of approximately $2.3 billion resulting from an agreement in
principle to resolve previously disclosed investigations regarding allegations
of past off-label promotional practices concerning Bextra, as well as other open
investigations. 

6) Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision for taxes on income and minority interests for fourth-quarter 2008 was
a 63.1% cost compared to a 7.5% cost in fourth-quarter 2007, and in full-year
2008 was a 17.0% cost compared to a 11.0% cost for full-year 2007. The higher
tax rates for 2008 reflect the impact of the fourth-quarter 2008 legal
settlement provisions, which are either not deductible or deductible at lower
tax rates, and higher acquired IPR expenses in 2008, which are primarily not
deductible for tax purposes, partially offset by tax benefits recorded in
second-quarter 2008 of $305 million related to favorable tax settlements for
multiple tax years and $426 million related to the sale of one of our
biopharmaceutical companies (Esperion Therapeutic Inc.). The lower tax rates in
2007 reflect a tax benefit in 2007 related to charges associated with Exubera. 

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was a cost of 23.5% in
fourth-quarter 2008, a cost of 18.1% in fourth-quarter 2007, a cost of 22.0% in
full-year 2008 and a cost of 21.0% in full-year 2007. The higher rates on
adjusted income(1) in 2008 reflects a change in jurisdictional mix of income,
partially offset by the $305 million in tax benefits related to the resolution
of tax issues noted above. 

On October 3, 2008, the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act
(the Extenders Act) extended the research and development tax credit from
January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009. This research and development credit
reduced income tax expense for fourth-quarter 2008 by approximately $110
million.

________________ 

(1) "Adjusted income" and "adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS)" are
defined as reported net income and reported diluted EPS excluding
purchase-accounting adjustments, acquisition-related costs, discontinued
operations and certain significant items. As described under Adjusted Income in
the Management`s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations section of Pfizer`s Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
September 28, 2008, management uses adjusted income, among other factors, to set
performance goals and to measure the performance of the overall company. We
believe that investors` understanding of our performance is enhanced by
disclosing this measure. The adjusted income and adjusted diluted EPS measures
are not, and should not be viewed as, substitutes for U.S. GAAP net income and
diluted EPS.

Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) today reported financial results for fourth-quarter and
full-year 2008. For fourth-quarter 2008, the Company recorded reported revenues
of $12.3 billion, a decrease of 4% compared with the year-ago quarter. This
decrease was primarily attributable to the negative impact of the loss of U.S.
exclusivity for Zyrtec in January 2008, and for Camptosar in February 2008, as
well as the loss of exclusivity for Norvasc in Korea and Japan in February 2008
and July 2008, respectively. Zyrtec, Camptosar and Norvasc fourth-quarter 2008
revenues decreased by $515 million ($263 million, $144 million and $108 million,
respectively), compared with the year-ago quarter. In addition, foreign exchange
unfavorably impacted reported revenues by approximately $380 million or 3%,
partially offset by the solid performance of key products. 

U.S. reported revenues were $5.3 billion in fourth-quarter 2008, a decrease of
8% compared with the year-ago quarter. International reported revenues were $7.1
billion, a decrease of 1% compared with the year-ago quarter, and reflect
operational growth of 5%, which was more than offset by the unfavorable impact
of foreign exchange of 6%. U.S. reported revenues accounted for 43% of the total
compared with 44% in the year-ago quarter, while international reported revenues
accounted for 57% of the total compared with 56% in the year-ago quarter. 

For fourth-quarter 2008, Pfizer posted reported net income of $266 million, a
decline of 90% compared with the prior-year quarter, and reported diluted EPS of
$0.04, a decrease of 90% compared with the prior-year quarter. Fourth-quarter
2008 results were impacted by a $2.3 billion pre-tax and after-tax charge
resulting from an agreement in principle with the Office of Michael Sullivan,
the United States Attorney for the District of Massachusetts, to resolve
previously disclosed investigations regarding allegations of past off-label
promotional practices concerning Bextra, as well as other open investigations.
In addition, results were unfavorably impacted by an increased effective tax
rate, as well as an increase in pre-tax charges of $1.2 billion ($700 million
after-tax) associated with cost-reduction initiatives, which were partially
offset by savings from those initiatives. 

For full-year 2008, Pfizer recorded reported revenues of $48.3 billion,
essentially flat compared with 2007 full-year revenues of $48.4 billion, despite
the loss of exclusivity of Norvasc, Zyrtec and Camptosar, which collectively
decreased revenues by $2.6 billion. Full-year revenues were favorably impacted
by foreign exchange of approximately $1.6 billion, or 3%, and the solid
performance of many key products. U.S. reported revenues were $20.4 billion, a
decrease of 12% year over year, while international reported revenues were $27.9
billion, an increase of 10%, reflecting the favorable impact of foreign exchange
of 6% and operational growth of 4%. U.S. reported revenues accounted for 42% of
the total compared with 48% in the year-ago period, while international reported
revenues accounted for 58% of the total compared with 52% in the year-ago
period. 

For full-year 2008, the Company posted reported net income of $8.1 billion,
essentially flat compared with the prior year, and reported diluted EPS of
$1.20, an increase of 3% compared with $1.17. This was primarily attributable to
savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives, the 2007 after-tax
charges of $1.8 billion related to the decision to exit Exubera and the
favorable impact of foreign exchange, offset by the aforementioned charge
related to Bextra and other open investigations in fourth-quarter 2008, as well
as the after-tax charge of $640 million resulting from the agreements in
principle to resolve certain litigation involving the Company`s non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory (NSAID) pain medicines in third-quarter 2008 and an increased
effective tax rate. 

Adjusted Revenues(1), Adjusted Income(1) and Adjusted Diluted EPS(1) Results

For fourth-quarter 2008, Pfizer posted adjusted revenues(1) of $12.3 billion, a
decrease of 4% compared with $12.8 billion in the year-ago quarter. For
full-year 2008, Pfizer posted adjusted revenues(1) of $48.3 billion, essentially
flat compared with $48.2 billion in full-year 2007. Adjusted revenues(1) in both
periods were positively impacted by the solid performance of key products, and
negatively impacted by the loss of exclusivity of Norvasc, Zyrtec and Camptosar.
In addition, foreign exchange unfavorably impacted fourth-quarter 2008 revenues
compared with the year-ago period by $389 million, but favorably impacted
full-year 2008 revenues by $1.6 billion compared with the prior year. 

Fourth-quarter 2008 adjusted income(1) was $4.4 billion, an increase of 29%
compared with $3.4 billion in the year-ago quarter, and adjusted diluted EPS(1)
was $0.65, an increase of 30% compared with $0.50 in the year-ago quarter. Both
adjusted income(1) and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were positively impacted by
savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and higher fourth-quarter
2007 spending levels in comparison with fourth-quarter 2008, partially offset by
an increase in the effective tax rate. Full-year 2008 adjusted income(1) was
$16.4 billion, an increase of 8% compared with $15.1 billion in the year-ago
period, and adjusted diluted EPS(1) was $2.42, an increase of 11% compared with
$2.18. Full-year 2008 adjusted income(1) and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were
primarily impacted by the favorable impact of foreign exchange and savings from
cost-reduction initiatives. 

Reported and adjusted diluted EPS(1) were also positively impacted by the full
benefit of Pfizer`s purchase of $10.0 billion of the Company`s common stock in
2007. 

Executive Commentary

"We are pleased with our performance in 2008," said Chairman and Chief Executive
Jeff Kindler. "We achieved our financial objectives, including exceeding our
cost-reduction target, despite the tumultuous global economy. Notwithstanding an
extremely competitive and increasingly challenging environment in 2008, we made
significant progress by: establishing customer-focused business units;
reprioritizing and refocusing our research on the greatest opportunities for
scientific, medical and commercial success; and increasing our Phase 3 portfolio
by approximately 60%, from 16 to 26 programs at year-end. These successes have
provided the ideal platform from which we`re advancing Pfizer forward." 

"As part of this advancement, today we announced that we have entered into an
agreement to acquire Wyeth to create the world`s premier biopharmaceutical
company. The combination of Pfizer and Wyeth will meaningfully deliver Pfizer`s
strategic priorities in a single transaction. Our combined company will be one
of the most diversified in the industry and will benefit from complementary
patient-centric units that match speed with the benefits of a global company`s
scale and resources," continued Kindler. 

Frank D`Amelio, Chief Financial Officer, stated, "In 2008, we exceeded our
cost-reduction target by decreasing our adjusted total costs(2) by $2.8 billion
in comparison to 2006 on a constant currency basis(3). In addition, we are
implementing a new cost-reduction initiative that will drive a lower, more
variable cost structure to achieve anticipated incremental savings of
approximately $3 billion by the end of 2011 compared with our 2008 adjusted
total costs(2) level. After allocating approximately $1 billion of investment to
high-growth opportunities, we anticipate net savings of about $2 billion
compared with our 2008 adjusted total costs(2) at 2008 average foreign exchange
rates. The anticipated net savings from this new initiative in addition to the
savings we achieved at year-end 2008 under our previous cost-reduction
initiative total approximately $4.8 billion." 

"Further, as part of the proposed acquisition of Wyeth, we expect to achieve
synergies of approximately $4 billion by the end of 2012, which will be in
addition to the savings from our previous cost-reduction initiatives," continued
D`Amelio. 

"In 2009, Pfizer expects to generate revenues of $44.0 to $46.0 billion, and
adjusted diluted EPS(1) of $1.85 to $1.95, which includes most of the
anticipated $1 billion investment intended to create new sources of revenue.
This also assumes a reduction in revenues of approximately $3.0 billion compared
with 2008 directly related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar," stated
D`Amelio. 

New Cost-Reduction Initiative

Pfizer will implement a new cost-reduction initiative, which is expected to
achieve incremental cost savings of approximately $3 billion, at 2008 average
foreign exchange rates, compared with 2008 adjusted total costs(2) of $28.6
billion. The program will be substantially complete by the end of 2010, with the
full savings to be realized by the end of 2011. Approximately $1 billion of
these savings will be reinvested in the business, resulting in an expected $2
billion net decrease. With this initiative and our recently completed
initiative, the Company expects to reduce adjusted total costs(2) by about $4.8
billion while absorbing inflation and compensation increases. 

As part of this cost-reduction initiative, Pfizer intends to reduce its
workforce by approximately 10%. Reductions will span sales, manufacturing,
research and development, and administrative organizations. The Company also
intends to reduce the number of manufacturing sites to 41 from 46 today, as well
as reduce its facilities square footage by approximately 15%. In conjunction
with this program, Pfizer expects to incur costs of approximately $6 billion on
a pre-tax basis, of which $1.5 billion has been incurred.

Pharmaceutical

Pharmaceutical revenues for fourth-quarter 2008 were $11.2 billion, a decrease
of 4% compared with the prior-year quarter, including the unfavorable impact of
foreign exchange of approximately $340 million or 3%. Fourth-quarter 2008
revenues were unfavorably impacted by the aforementioned loss of exclusivity of
Norvasc, Zyrtec and Camptosar, partially offset by revenues from in-line
products(4), which increased 1% compared with the year-ago quarter. 

Pharmaceutical revenues for full-year 2008 were $44.2 billion, a decrease of 1%
compared with the prior year, including the favorable impact of foreign exchange
of approximately $1.5 billion or 3%. Full-year 2008 revenues were unfavorably
impacted by the aforementioned loss of exclusivity of Norvasc, Zyrtec and
Camptosar, partially offset by revenues from in-line and new products(6), which
increased 7% from the prior year. In addition, full-year 2008 pharmaceutical
revenues were negatively impacted by a $217 million adjustment to the prior
years` product returns liabilities recorded in third-quarter 2008. 

Lipitor revenues in fourth-quarter 2008 were $3.1 billion, a decrease of 8%
compared with the prior-year quarter. In the U.S., Lipitor revenues were $1.6
billion, a decrease of 13% compared with the prior-year quarter. Revenues from
international markets were $1.5 billion, a decrease of 2%, reflecting the
unfavorable impact of foreign exchange of approximately $124 million, or 8%,
which more than offset operational growth of 6%. 

Lyrica revenues in fourth-quarter 2008 were $702 million, a year-over-year
increase of 25%, driven by strong physician prescribing patterns and patient
satisfaction, as well as increased use of Lyrica for fibromyalgia in the U.S.,
where the product continues to build on its leadership position for this
indication. In the U.S., Lyrica revenues were $384 million, a year-over-year
increase of 20%, while international revenues were $318 million, an increase of
31%, reflecting operational growth of 42% and the unfavorable impact of foreign
exchange of 11%. 

Celebrex revenues in fourth-quarter 2008 were $664 million, an increase of 4%
compared with the year-ago quarter, supported by continued educational and
promotional efforts highlighting the benefit-risk proposition of Celebrex. In
the U.S., Celebrex revenues were $489 million, an increase of 4% compared with
the prior-year quarter, while international revenues were $175 million, an
increase of 4%. 

Sutent revenues in fourth-quarter 2008 were $220 million, a year-over-year
increase of 21%, demonstrating continued strong performance and market
leadership in its approved indications. In the U.S., Sutent revenues were $66
million, an increase of 5% year over year, while international revenues were
$154 million, an increase of 30%. Sutent is available in all major markets and
is supported by efficacy, survival and cost-effectiveness data. Further, its
robust life cycle plan currently includes Phase 3 clinical trials in cancers
with unmet medical need, such as breast, lung, colorectal, liver and prostate
cancers. 

Chantix (known as Champix outside the U.S.) revenues in fourth-quarter 2008 were
$180 million, a decrease of 36% year over year. In the U.S., Chantix revenues
were $91 million, a decline of 55% compared with the prior-year quarter, while
international revenues were $89 million, an increase of 13%. Fourth-quarter 2008
U.S. results continued to be negatively impacted by the changes to the Chantix
U.S. label in prior quarters. Pfizer continues its educational and promotional
efforts with physicians and patients, focused on Chantix`s benefit-risk
proposition given the significant negative health consequences of smoking, as
well as the importance of physician-patient dialogue in helping patients quit
smoking. Chantix has now been launched in all major markets, with nine launches
planned in 2009 in emerging markets. 

Animal Health

Animal Health revenues for fourth-quarter 2008 were $783 million, essentially
flat compared with $785 million in the year-ago quarter. Full-year 2008 Animal
Health revenues were $2.8 billion, an increase of 7% compared with $2.6 billion
in 2007, driven by strong global livestock and companion animal product
performance. In fourth-quarter 2008, foreign exchange unfavorably impacted
revenues by approximately $35 million or 4%, while in full-year 2008, foreign
exchange positively impacted revenues by approximately $80 million or 3%,
compared with the prior-year respective periods. 

Costs and Expenses

In fourth-quarter 2008, adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of revenues
was 11.7% compared with 17.7% in fourth-quarter 2007. For the full-year 2008,
adjusted cost of sales(1) as a percentage of revenues was 14.6% compared with
16.0% in 2007, an improvement from our previous guidance of 15.0% to 15.5%. This
improvement reflects the benefits from our cost-reduction initiatives and
foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange, adjusted cost of
sales(1) as a percentage of revenues was 15.6% in fourth-quarter 2008 and 15.2%
for the full-year 2008. 

Adjusted selling, informational and administrative (SI) expenses(1) were $3.5
billion in fourth-quarter 2008, a decrease of 23% compared with the prior-year
quarter. For the full-year 2008, adjusted SI expenses(1) were $14.0 billion, a
decrease of 8% compared with 2007. These decreases were primarily due to the
favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives. In addition, higher
fourth-quarter 2007 spending levels contributed to the quarter-over-quarter
decline in adjusted SI expenses(1). Foreign exchange positively impacted
fourth-quarter 2008 by $103 million and negatively impacted full-year 2008 by
$379 million compared with the respective year-ago periods. 

Adjusted research and development (R) expenses(1) were $2.2 billion in
fourth-quarter 2008, an increase of 2% compared with the prior-year period. For
full-year 2008, adjusted R expenses(1) were $7.5 billion, a decrease of 1%
compared with 2007. The increase in fourth-quarter 2008 is primarily the result
of up-front payments totaling $300 million related to the licensing agreements
with Medivation, Inc. and Auxilium Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Both periods also
benefited from the favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives. 

Overall, operational improvements decreased adjusted total costs(2) by $1.1
billion or 12% in fourth-quarter 2008 compared with the prior-year period, and
foreign exchange decreased adjusted total costs(2) by $702 million or 8%.
Foreign exchange increased full-year 2008 adjusted total costs(2) by $312
million or 1% compared with 2007. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange,
full-year 2008 adjusted total costs(2) decreased by approximately $2.2 billion,
or 7%, compared with 2007. The operational improvement was driven partially by
the reduction in workforce to approximately 81,900 at year-end 2008, a decline
of 4,700 compared with the year-end 2007, as well as manufacturing and research
and development site exits. 

At the end of fourth-quarter 2008, Pfizer exceeded its goal to reduce absolute
adjusted total costs(2) by at least $2.0 billion by the end of 2008 compared
with 2006 on a constant currency basis(3), realizing a total reduction of $2.8
billion. 

Financial Guidance

For full-year 2009, Pfizer`s financial guidance, at current exchange rates(9) is
summarized below. The 2009 financial guidance, in comparison with 2008 financial
results, reflects the projected impact of the strengthening of the U.S. dollar,
increased pension expenses and lower interest income. It also reflects an
increase in the effective tax rate resulting from financial strategies in
connection with the proposed acquisition of Wyeth. These factors contributed to
a reduction in our Adjusted Diluted EPS(1) of approximately $0.50.

                                                                                                               of our diverse Pharmaceutical product portfolio in 2008. Because of its non-standardized definition, this     
                                                                                                               total in-line and new products Pharmaceutical revenues measure has limitations as it may not be comparable

PFIZER INC

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION

1) Change in Revenues

The strengthening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies, primarily the
euro, U.K. pound, and Canadian dollar, unfavorably impacted our revenues by
approximately $380 million, or 3%, in fourth-quarter 2008, compared to the same
period in 2007. The weakening of the U.S. dollar relative to other currencies,
primarily the euro, Japanese yen and Canadian dollar, favorably impacted our
revenues by approximately $1.6 billion, or 3%, in full-year 2008, compared to
full-year 2007. 

Reported revenues in full-year 2008 include a reduction of $217 million, to
adjust our prior years` liabilities for product returns. In third-quarter 2008,
after a detailed review of our returns experience, we determined that our
previous methodology needed to be revised, as the lag time between product sale
and return was actually much longer than we had previously assumed. Although
recorded in third-quarter 2008, virtually all of the adjustment relates back
several years. We have also reviewed our expense calculations for the prior
years and determined that the expense recorded in those years was not materially
different from what would have been recorded under our revised approach. 

2) Change in Cost of Sales

Reported cost of sales decreased 35% in fourth-quarter 2008, compared to the
same period in 2007, and decreased 28% in full-year 2008, compared to full-year
2007. The decrease for fourth-quarter 2008 primarily reflects a favorable impact
from foreign exchange and the savings impact of our cost-reduction initiatives.
The decrease for full-year 2008 primarily reflects a $2.6 billion charge in
third-quarter 2007 related to our decision to exit Exubera, the savings impact
of our cost-reduction initiatives and a favorable impact from foreign exchange,
partially offset by higher implementation costs associated with our
cost-reduction initiatives. 

Reported cost of sales included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $225 million for fourth-quarter 2008, $745 million
for full-year 2008, $263 million for fourth-quarter 2007, and $700 million for
full-year 2007. 

Reported cost of sales also included $31 million for fourth-quarter 2008, $162
million for full-year 2008, $73 million for fourth-quarter 2007 and $194 million
for full-year 2007, related to business-transition activities associated with
the sale of our Consumer Healthcare business, completed in December 2006. This
continuing activity is transitional in nature and generally results from
agreements that seek to facilitate the orderly transfer of operations of our
former Consumer Healthcare business to the new owner. 

Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased 6.5 percentage
points to 13.9% in fourth quarter 2008, compared to the same period in 2007,
reflecting the favorable impact of our cost-reduction initiatives and the impact
of foreign exchange, as well as lower implementation costs associated with our
cost-reduction initiatives. Reported cost of sales as a percentage of revenues
decreased 6.4 percentage points to 16.8% in full-year 2008, compared to
full-year 2007, reflecting a $2.6 billion charge in third-quarter 2007 related
to our decision to exit Exubera, the favorable impact of our cost-reduction
initiatives and the impact of foreign exchange, partially offset by higher
implementation costs associated with our cost-reduction initiatives. 

3) Change in Selling, Informational &amp; Administrative (SI) Expenses and
Research &amp; Development (R) Expenses

Reported SI expenses decreased 21% in fourth-quarter 2008, reflecting the
savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives and a favorable impact
from foreign exchange. Reported SI expenses decreased 7% in full-year 2008,
compared to the same periods in 2007, reflecting the savings associated with our
cost-reduction initiatives and a $85 million charge in 2007 related to our
decision to exit Exubera, partially offset by an unfavorable impact from foreign
exchange and the impact of higher implementation costs associated with our
cost-reduction initiatives. 

Reported SI expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $143 million for fourth-quarter 2008, $413 million
for full-year 2008, $136 million for fourth-quarter 2007 and $334 million for
full-year 2007. 

Reported R expenses, excluding acquisition-related in-process research and
development charges (IPR), increased 2% in fourth-quarter 2008, and decreased
2% in full-year 2008, compared to the same periods in 2007. The increase for
fourth-quarter 2008 was primarily due to an up-front payment to Medivation, Inc.
in connection with our collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize
Dimebon, partially offset by a favorable impact from foreign exchange and the
realization of savings associated with our cost-reduction initiatives. The
decrease for full-year 2008 compared to full-year 2007 was primarily due to the
collaboration payments made to Bristol-Myers Squibb Company in second-quarter
2007 in connection with our collaboration to develop and commercialize apixaban
and a $100 million charge in 2007 related to our decision to exit Exubera, in
addition to the realization of savings associated with our cost-reduction
initiatives, partially offset by the up-front payment to Medivation, Inc. in the
fourth quarter of 2008 and higher R spending related to Phase 3 clinical
trials in 2008. 

Reported R expenses included implementation charges related to our
cost-reduction initiatives of $85 million for fourth-quarter 2008, $433 million
for full-year 2008, $124 million for fourth-quarter 2007 and $416 million for
full-year 2007. 

IPR charges of $633 million in 2008 primarily related to our acquisitions of
Serenex, Inc., Encysive Pharmaceuticals, Inc., CovX, Coley Pharmaceutical Group,
Inc. and a number of animal health product lines from Schering-Plough
Corporation, as well as two smaller acquisitions also related to Animal Health.
IPR charges in 2007 of $283 million primarily related to our acquisitions of
BioRexis Pharmaceutical Corp. and Embrex, Inc. 

4) Asset Impairment Charges and Other Costs Associated with Exiting Exubera

In third-quarter 2007, after an assessment of the financial performance of
Exubera, an inhalable form of insulin for the treatment of diabetes, as well as
its lack of acceptance by patients, physicians and payers, we decided to exit
the product. 

Total pre-tax charges for 2007 were $2.8 billion and were primarily included in
Cost of sales ($2.6 billion), Selling, informational andadministrative expenses
($85 million), and Research and development expenses ($100 million). Total
pre-tax charges for 2008 were not significant.

*Certain prior period amounts were reclassified to conform to the current period
presentation. 

(a) The decreases in net interest income in fourth-quarter and full-year 2008,
compared to the same periods in 2007, were due primarily to lower net financial
assets and lower interest rates. 

(b) In third-quarter 2008, we recorded charges of approximately $900 million
related to our agreements in principle to resolve certain litigation involving
our non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medicines and in fourth-quarter 2008,
we recorded charges of approximately $2.3 billion resulting from an agreement in
principle to resolve previously disclosed investigations regarding allegations
of past off-label promotional practices concerning Bextra, as well as other open
investigations. 

6) Effective Tax Rate

The effective tax rate on reported Income from continuing operations before
provision for taxes on income and minority interests for fourth-quarter 2008 was
a 63.1% cost compared to a 7.5% cost in fourth-quarter 2007, and in full-year
2008 was a 17.0% cost compared to a 11.0% cost for full-year 2007. The higher
tax rates for 2008 reflect the impact of the fourth-quarter 2008 legal
settlement provisions, which are either not deductible or deductible at lower
tax rates, and higher acquired IPR expenses in 2008, which are primarily not
deductible for tax purposes, partially offset by tax benefits recorded in
second-quarter 2008 of $305 million related to favorable tax settlements for
multiple tax years and $426 million related to the sale of one of our
biopharmaceutical companies (Esperion Therapeutic Inc.). The lower tax rates in
2007 reflect a tax benefit in 2007 related to charges associated with Exubera. 

The effective tax rate on adjusted income(1) was a cost of 23.5% in
fourth-quarter 2008, a cost of 18.1% in fourth-quarter 2007, a cost of 22.0% in
full-year 2008 and a cost of 21.0% in full-year 2007. The higher rates on
adjusted income(1) in 2008 reflects a change in jurisdictional mix of income,
partially offset by the $305 million in tax benefits related to the resolution
of tax issues noted above. 

On October 3, 2008, the Tax Extenders and Alternative Minimum Tax Relief Act
(the Extenders Act) extended the research and development tax credit from
January 1, 2008 through December 31, 2009. This research and development credit
reduced income tax expense for fourth-quarter 2008 by approximately $110
million.

and stable top-line and EPS growth and sustainable shareholder value in the
short and long term. It is expected that no drug will account for more than 10
percent of the combined company`s revenue in 2012. 

Financial Highlights

Under the terms of the transaction, each outstanding share of Wyeth common stock
will be converted into the right to receive $33 in cash and 0.985 of a share of
Pfizer common stock, subject to the terms of the merger agreement. Based on the
closing price of Pfizer stock as of January 23, 2009, the stock component is
valued at $17.19 per share. The transaction provides immediate value to Wyeth
shareholders through the cash component, as well as continued participation in
the future prospects expected to result from the combination through their
ownership of approximately 16 percent of Pfizer`s shares. 

The deal is expected to be accretive to Pfizer`s adjusted diluted earnings per
share in the second full year after closing(1). The transaction is anticipated
to yield cost savings of approximately $4 billion to be fully realized by the
third year after closing. Savings are expected in selling, informational and
administrative functions, research and development, and manufacturing. 

The transaction will be financed through a combination of cash, debt and stock.
A consortium of banks has provided commitments for a total of $22.5 billion in
debt. 

In connection with the proposed transaction between Pfizer and Wyeth, the Board
of Directors of Pfizer has determined that, effective with the dividend to be
paid in the second quarter of 2009, it will reduce Pfizer`s quarterly dividend
per share to $0.16, which continues to be competitive with other industry
participants. Pfizer believes the transaction offers significant opportunities
to enhance long-term shareholder value. 

Strategic Overview

Jeffrey B. Kindler, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Pfizer, said: "The
combination of Pfizer and Wyeth provides a powerful opportunity to transform our
industry. It will produce the world`s premier biopharmaceutical company whose
distinct blend of diversification, flexibility, and scale positions it for
success in a dynamic global health care environment. The new company will be an
industry leader in human, animal and consumer health. With our combined
biopharmaceuticals business, it will lead in primary and specialty care as well
as in small and large molecules. Its geographic presence in most of the world`s
developed and developing countries will be unrivaled." 

Bernard Poussot, Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Wyeth, said,
"Wyeth`s commitment to scientific innovation has enabled us to build a
diversified biopharmaceutical company with leadership in attractive growth areas
such as vaccines, nutritionals and biologics. For example, Wyeth developed
Prevnar, the first pneumococcal vaccine for infants. In addition, because we
were early to see the potential of biotechnology to create life-changing
medicines, we now have a strong franchise which includes Enbrel, the number one
biotechnology product in the world. With our business focused on prevention and
wellness, Wyeth is well positioned in today`s rapidly changing health care
environment. Our employees should be enormously proud of what we have built and
confident that combining with Pfizer will accelerate our pursuit of innovative
new medicines to meet critical unmet patient needs. Wyeth and Pfizer are highly
complementary businesses, and together we can build the best diversified health
care company in the world. We believe we can better execute our strategy and can
accomplish far more together in the years ahead than either company could have
achieved on its own." 

Mr. Kindler continued, "With this combination, Pfizer will offer patients around
the world a uniquely broad and diversified portfolio of biopharmaceutical
innovations through business units--each one focused on different customer needs
and backed by the resources of a premier global organization. By combining the
spirit of small, agile enterprises with our combined scale, Pfizer will advance
its mission of working together toward a healthier world." 

Over the last two years, Pfizer has become a leaner, more disciplined, and far
stronger company that is now capable of - and has demonstrated - superior and
consistent execution of its strategies and commitments. As separately announced
today, for example, Pfizer achieved its 2008 objectives despite the challenging
economy, including meeting or exceeding its financial guidance and
cost-reduction target. 

With this essential foundation established, the combination with Wyeth
meaningfully advances in a single transaction each of the strategic priorities
that Pfizer has identified and pursued over the last two years, including:

* Enhancing the in-line and pipeline patent-protected portfolio in key "Invest
to Win" disease areas, such as Alzheimer`s disease, inflammation, oncology, pain
and psychosis; 
* Becoming a top-tier player in biotherapeutics and vaccines; 
* Accelerating growth in emerging markets; 
* Creating new opportunities for established products; 
* Investing in complementary businesses; and 
* Creating a lower, more flexible cost base.

Mr. Kindler added, "Over the last several years, Wyeth`s leadership and its
employees have done an outstanding job creating a strong, diversified
biopharmaceutical company. The people, products, and technologies that Wyeth
brings to the new company will enhance our scientific capabilities and drive
further commercial innovation to improve the health of the patients we serve.
The compelling combination of Pfizer and Wyeth allows us to advance our newly
strengthened organization to the next level by harnessing the talents of the
best people from both companies. This will enable us to accelerate significantly
our progress along `Our Path Forward` as we pursue our mission of applying
innovative science to improve world health." 

Global Biopharmaceutical Leadership and Business Diversification

The combination of Pfizer and Wyeth will create the world`s premier
biopharmaceutical company with a broad range of therapeutic solutions for many
health challenges and preventive care. 

For Patients Today - A Broad Portfolio of Health Care Solutions and Treatments

The combined company will offer customers and patients a broad range of products
for every stage of life--with top tier portfolios in key therapeutic areas such
as cardiovascular, oncology, women`s health, central nervous system, and
infectious disease and a diverse product portfolio that includes 17 products
with more than $1 billion each in annual revenue. Pfizer will be the second
largest specialty care provider, with products including the world`s leading
biologic, Enbrel; Prevnar, the world`s largest-selling vaccine; Sutent for
cancer; Geodon for schizophrenia; and Zyvox for infection. The transaction also
builds upon Pfizer`s position as a global leader in animal health, with strong
product lines in attractive segments, for companion animals, biologics and
anti-infectives. 

For Patients Tomorrow - A Diverse Range of Technology and Research Platforms

The new company will have more resources to invest in research and development
than any other biopharmaceutical company and access to all leading scientific
technology platforms, including vaccines, small and large molecules,
nutritionals and consumer products. 

The combination also brings together a robust pipeline of biopharmaceutical
research and development projects, including programs in diabetes,
inflammation/immunology, oncology and pain, as well as significant opportunities
in Wyeth`s Alzheimer`s disease pipeline, which has a number of compounds in
development, including phase three biotech compound Bapineuzumab. These will be
added to the exciting agents currently in early and later stage development at
Pfizer for Alzheimer`s disease, illustrating the breadth and depth the new
company will be able to use in targeting the diseases that most affect patients.


The new company will have an enhanced ability to innovate, operating as focused
business units tailored to patients and other customers. Each business unit will
oversee product development from clinical trials to commercialization. This
approach will allow for rapid decision-making and a more efficient use of
resources and, as a result, will enhance the company`s ability to invest in
long-term opportunities. The combination will also provide additional high
quality and high volume manufacturing capabilities, including Wyeth`s Grange
Castle, Ireland facility, the largest integrated biotechnology manufacturing
facility in the world. 

For Patients Everywhere - A Strong Global Presence

Geographically, the combination will enhance Pfizer`s and Wyeth`s compelling
portfolios in important growth areas. Based on IMS data, the combined company
will be number one in terms of biopharmaceutical revenues in the United States
with an approximately 12% market share; in Europe with an approximately 10%
share; in Asia (ex-Japan) with an approximately 7% share; in Japan with a 6%
share; and in Latin America with a 6% share. 

Pfizer and Wyeth`s combined presence will be significant in high-growth emerging
markets, such as Latin America, the Middle East and China, where Wyeth has an
impressive presence in infant nutritionals and Pfizer is a recognized leader in
pharmaceuticals. This enhanced geographic position will further strengthen the
combined company`s business, provide increased exposure to high-growth,
less-developed and under-penetrated markets, and provide compelling
opportunities for expense savings. 

Conditions

The proposed transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including
approval by the stockholders of Wyeth and notification and clearance under
certain antitrust statutes. In addition, the proposed transaction is subject to
Pfizer`s financing sources not declining to provide the financing due to a
material adverse change with respect to Pfizer or Pfizer failing to maintain
credit ratings of A2/A long-term stable/stable and A1/P1 short term affirmed.
There are no other financing conditions to closing in the merger agreement.
Pfizer and Wyeth expect the transaction to close at the end of the third quarter
or during the fourth quarter 2009.

Forward Looking Statements

This Press Release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, but are not limited to,
statements about the benefits of the proposed merger between Pfizer and Wyeth,
including future financial and operating results, the combined company`s plans,
objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not

expectations of Pfizer`s and Wyeth's management and are subject to significant
risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the

conditions; dependence on the effectiveness of Pfizer`s and Wyeth`s patents and
other protections for innovative products; the risk of new and changing
regulation and health policies in the U.S. and internationally and the exposure
to litigation and/or regulatory actions. Additional factors that could cause
results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking
statements can be found in Pfizer`s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Wyeth`s

NEW YORK &amp; MADISON, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Wyeth (NYSE: WYE) today announced that they have entered
into a definitive merger agreement under which Pfizer will acquire Wyeth in a
cash-and-stock transaction currently valued at $50.19 per share, or a total of
approximately $68 billion. The Boards of Directors of both companies have
approved the combination. 

The combined company will create one of the most diversified companies in the
global health care industry. Operating through patient-centric businesses that
match the speed and agility of small, focused enterprises with the benefits of a
global organization`s scale and resources, the company will respond more quickly
and effectively to meet changing health care needs. The combined company will
have product offerings in numerous growing therapeutic areas, a strong product
pipeline, leading scientific and manufacturing capabilities, and a premier
global footprint in health care. 

With its broad and diversified global product portfolio and reduced dependence
on small molecules, the new company will be positioned for improved, consistent,
and stable top-line and EPS growth and sustainable shareholder value in the
short and long term. It is expected that no drug will account for more than 10

Forward Looking Statements

This Press Release includes "forward-looking statements" within the meaning of
the safe harbor provisions of the United States Private Securities Litigation
Reform Act of 1995. Such statements may include, but are not limited to,
statements about the benefits of the proposed merger between Pfizer and Wyeth,
including future financial and operating results, the combined company`s plans,
objectives, expectations and intentions and other statements that are not
historical facts. Such statements are based upon the current beliefs and
expectations of Pfizer`s and Wyeth's management and are subject to significant
risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ from those set forth in the
forward-looking statements. 

The following factors, among others, could cause actual results to differ from
those set forth in the forward-looking statements: the possibility that the
expected synergies from the proposed merger of Pfizer and Wyeth will not be
realized, or will not be realized within the expected time period, due to, among
other things, the impact of pharmaceutical industry regulation and pending
legislation that could affect the pharmaceutical industry; the ability to obtain
governmental and self-regulatory organization approvals of the merger on the
proposed terms and schedule; the failure of Wyeth stockholders to approve the
merger; the risk that the businesses will not be integrated successfully;
disruption from the merger making it more difficult to maintain business and
operational relationships; the possibility that the merger does not close,
including, but not limited to, due to the failure to satisfy the closing
conditions; Pfizer`s and Wyeth`s ability to accurately predict future market
conditions; dependence on the effectiveness of Pfizer`s and Wyeth`s patents and
other protections for innovative products; the risk of new and changing
regulation and health policies in the U.S. and internationally and the exposure
to litigation and/or regulatory actions. Additional factors that could cause
results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking
statements can be found in Pfizer`s 2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K, Wyeth`s
2007 Annual Report on Form 10-K and each company`s other filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") available at the SEC`s Internet
site (http://www.sec.gov).

that also constitutes a prospectus of Pfizer. Wyeth will mail the proxy
statement/prospectus to its stockholders. Pfizer and Wyeth urge investors and
security holders to read the proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed
merger when it becomes available because it will contain important information.

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Sony Warns of a Loss

Sony Corporation (NYSE: SNE) has announced that it will report a loss for its
2009 fiscal year. This would be the first loss in 14 years. 

The company has three major problems: 1.) The value of the Yen (with half of its
manufacturing plants and one third of its employees based in Japan) has
increased production costs and reduced operating margins. 2.) The world-wide
economic downturn and increased competition in Flat Panel TVs (FPTV) from the
likes of Vizio and Westinghouse has forced Sony to cut prices to maintain market
share. 3.) Its LCD FPTV sets are sold at premium prices and consumers are not
willing to pay those prices in the current economic environment. 

China Eastern Airlines a Sell

We are lowering our rating on China Eastern Airlines Corporation Limited (NYSE:
CEA, or China Eastern) to Sell from Hold as we now expect even larger losses
following the company's recent disclosure of a RMB6.2 oil hedging loss and a
likely loss for full-year 2008. 

Moreover, foreign exchange translation gains are also subsiding. As a result, we
are significantly increasing our full-year loss estimates for both 2008 and
2009. To prop up its balance sheet, CEA has sold about 2.9 billion A and H
shares, raising close to RMB7 billion and received a RMB5.5 billion working
capital loan from its parent company. 

Aegon a Buy on Valuation

Aegon N.V. (NYSE: AEG) provides a multitude of insurance and pension-based
saving and investment solutions. It is one of the world's ten largest life
insurance companies ranked by assets, profits and market capitalization.
Insurance services include personal and commercial life, health and accident
insurance. 

We are maintaining our Buy recommendation on Aegon after its third quarter
results. While the current environment will be challenging for investment
portfolios, we think that, at its current multiple, the stock is at a
significant discount to its peers. Our six-month target price is $7.00. 

Pfizer Eyes Wyeth. We Ask "Why?"

This morning the rumors are circulating that Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) is in talks to
acquire fellow drug maker Wyeth (NYSE: WYE). In fact, sources close to the two
firms say talks have been ongoing for months, but that a potential deal is still
far off. 

Nevertheless, should Pfizer absorb Wyeth, it would be the largest drug merger
combination in years.

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer to pay about $50.19 per share for Wyeth - sources&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Deal would be valued at roughly $68 billion - sources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Wyeth pulls out of Crucell talks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Wyeth shares rise 11 pct, Pfizer falls 1 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds Frankfurt share prices, Wyeth out of Crucell talks,
analyst comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jessica Hall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHILADELPHIA/AMSTERDAM, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc
(PFE.N), the No.1 drugmaker, was close to a $68 billion purchase
of U.S. rival Wyeth WYE.N in a move to diversify its revenue
base, sources familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The boards of the U.S. rivals held separate meetings on
Sunday to finalize an agreement and an announcement was seen as
imminent, said three sources with direct knowledge of the talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One source said Pfizer was still finalizing a $25 billion
financing package to fund the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth shares rose 10.6 percent to 36.35 euros WYE.F in
Frankfurt by 0833 on Monday. Pfizer shares fell 1.0 percent to
13.00 euros (PFE.F).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wyeth had been in talks to buy Dutch vaccine firm Crucell
CRCL.AS, which said on Monday that Wyeth had withdrawn from
the discussions. Crucell shares plummeted 21.1 percent to 12.23
euros. [ID:nLQ120204]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal would help Pfizer cope with a major gap in revenue
in 2011, when its blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol treatment will
begin to face U.S. generic competition. Next year, Wyeth loses
patent protection on its own top drug, the antidepressant
Effexor XR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, buying Wyeth would help Pfizer diversify into
vaccines and injectable biologic medicines by adding Wyeth's
big-selling Prevnar vaccine for childhood infections and Enbrel
rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Pfizer would realize major cost
savings by streamlining areas that overlap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer was expected to pay roughly $50.19 per share for
Wyeth, sources said. Pfizer would pay $33 per share in cash and
0.985 per share of Pfizer stock for each share of Wyeth. The
sources were not authorised to talk to the media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Based on Wyeth's 1.33 billion shares outstanding as of
October 31, the deal would be valued at about $66.8 billion.
Including Wyeth's stock options, the deal would be worth $68
billion, sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At $50.19 per share, the deal would mark a 15-percent
premium over Wyeth's closing stock price of $43.74 on Friday.
Wyeth's stock had surged 12.6 percent on Friday on news of the
possible deal.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CONSOLIDATION WAVE?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer typifies many large drugmakers, which have struggled
to produce new blockbusters to replace those on which they lose
exclusivity. [ID:nN23318400] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A merger of Pfizer and Wyeth could trigger a wave of
consolidation in the cash-rich pharmaceutical sector as drug
makers look to diversify revenues in the face of competition
from generic-drug rivals, analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The outlook for the industry has steadily waned, (with)
industry P/E multiples declining under the combined onslaught of
price pressure, aggressive generic competition and low RD
productivity," Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The result is that many leading companies face a decline in
revenues and earnings next decade, as profitable products reach
the end of their patented lives and are not replaced by new
drugs," the analysts said, adding that AstraZeneca (AZN.L) could
be a target, though there were also reasons it might not happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Chief Executive Jeff Kindler was expected to head the
combined company, sources said. Wyeth Chairman Bernard Poussot
was expected to leave after the deal closed, one source said.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Jan 26 (Reuters) - Japanese soy sauce maker Kikkoman
Corp (2801.T) said on Monday U.S. drinks maker Coca-Cola Co
(KO.N) was seeking a 50 percent stake in an unlisted Kikkoman
subsidiary, Tone Coca-Cola Bottling Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola aimed to acquire the stake by the end of March and

or how much of its stake it would sell to Coca-Cola.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tone Coca-Cola, based in Chiba, on the outskirts of Tokyo,
manufactures and sells Coca-Cola brand soft drinks in Chiba and
nearby areas outside of Tokyo.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska (Reuters) - Alaska's natural resources commissioner on Tuesday granted a temporary reprieve to Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) and its oil-company partners, which are seeking to drill in a long-dormant oil and gas field where the state has revoked leases for non-performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Natural Resources Commissioner Tom Irwin announced he has "conditionally reinstated" two of the leases at Point Thomson, an oil-field unit that once encompassed more than 100,000 acres (40,000 sq km) and 45 individual leases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irwin's department had dissolved the unit and canceled leases in response to what state officials characterized as a breach of contractual obligation to develop the field, located on the eastern North Slope.

&lt;p&gt; By Yereth Rosen&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska Jan 27 (Reuters) - Alaska's natural

month in which Exxon and its partner companies presented details
to him about their plans to build a 50-mile (80 km) ice road and
drill at least two wells this winter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Irwin said Exxon and its partners will be allowed to hold onto
the two leases only if they follow through with drilling pledges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In my interim decision, I made clear to Appellants that I

&lt;p&gt; (Adds balance sheet details from filings, Fitch ratings)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
said on Tuesday it incurred a loss of about $850 million last
month on loans extended to bankrupt units of petrochemicals
company LyondellBasell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yet the December loss, equal to more than 1 percent of
Goldman's book value, may never be reflected in any of Goldman's
announced annual results. That is because the bank closed its
fiscal 2008 books in November but starting this year will report
on a calendar-year basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In December 2008, there was continued deterioration in the
credit of LyondellBasell Finance Co, to which the firm had
provided bridge loan financing," Goldman said in its 10-K annual
report filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For most of the past two years, most bank losses stemmed
from the waning value of good loans that became difficult to
trade in dysfunctional markets. Goldman's loss illustrates the
next phase of the credit crisis could be write-downs triggered
by actual defaults.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. operations of LyondellBasell, the world's
third-largest petrochemical company, filed for bankruptcy
protection on Jan. 6 after they were no longer able to carry a
massive debt load amid slumping demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Results from December 2008 will be disclosed in April when
Goldman files its first-quarter 10-Q report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox-Pitt, Kelton banking analyst David Trone said the
writedown value was expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RATINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In related news, Fitch Ratings said it would cut its ratings
on Goldman by one notch to "A-plus" and said it expects stress
in the financial markets will hurt the bank's earnings for the
next few quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman reported a $2.1 billion fourth-quarter loss on
writedowns across its investment and trading portfolios.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A loss of confidence in the Wall Street broker dealer model
last fall forced Goldman and other banks to protect themselves
by slashing debt, shedding assets and stockpiling capital and
cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By the end of November, Goldman reduced total assets to 13.7
times equity, half of what it was a year earlier. Higher
leverage makes a bank or trading firm more vulnerable to market
swings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unsecured short-term debt fell 19 percent to $53 billion
during the fourth quarter, while long-term debt fell 5 percent
to $168 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The annual report also showed a 2 percent increase in "Level
3" assets, the most illiquid and difficult to value, to $60
billion during the fourth quarter. Goldman said the increase was
driven by its holdings of derivatives and loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Level 3 assets comprised 10 percent of Goldman's total
financial assets, up from 8 percent in the third quarter.
Goldman also disclosed $10.9 billion of commercial mortgage
exposure, 68 percent of which was in the Americas, and $8
billion of leveraged loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman stock rose 5.5 percent to $78.26 on the New York
Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) today welcomed the announcement by Medicines
Malaria Venture (MMV) and Novartis of the development of the world`s first
malaria drug for children, Coartem Dispersible. ExxonMobil has provided $3
million in funding to MMV, including $1.5 million in specific funding for the
development of the drug. 

"Through our operations in Africa we became aware of the unacceptable human toll
of malaria on families and especially children. ExxonMobil is proud to have
played a role in this exciting and significant new development in the battle
against malaria," said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief executive officer of
ExxonMobil. 

Tillerson said that ExxonMobil`s efforts against malaria are focused on saving
lives through the acceleration, development and delivery of new medicines and
vaccines and the distribution of bed nets. He will be speaking at a panel
discussion on malaria at the World Economic Forum in Switzerland on January 30. 

Coartem Dispersible is an easy-to-administer, sweet-tasting, child-friendly
formulation that provides effective treatment for children with malaria. It is
the first pediatric malaria drug to be recognized by the World Health
Organization. 

ExxonMobil is the largest non-pharmaceutical corporate donor to malaria research
and development efforts, and since 2000 has committed $130 million to Africa
community outreach programs, including $54 million on programs to fight malaria.


The company established its Africa Health Initiative in 2000 in support of the
Abuja Declaration on Roll Back Malaria in Africa and its goal to halve malaria
deaths by 2010. Since then, ExxonMobil has developed on-the-ground
public-private partnerships to fight malaria at the community level, progress
treatment and vaccine research and raise awareness and international support,
and contributes to anti-malaria efforts in more than 20 African countries. 

Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by a parasite and transmitted to
humans by the bite of a mosquito. With between 1 million and 3 million deaths
annually and 3,000 children deaths daily, it remains one of the globe's leading
infectious killers. The majority of its victims are children under the age of
five and pregnant women.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
said on Tuesday it incurred a loss of about $850 million last
month after marking down on its balance sheet to recovery
levels LyondellBasell Finance Co bridge and bank loan
facilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "In December 2008, there was continued deterioration in the
credit of LyondellBasell Finance Co, to which the firm had
provided bridge loan financing," Goldman said in its 10-K
annual financial report filed with the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Certain units of LyondellBasell Industries AF SCA
[ACCEIN.UL] filed for bankruptcy protection on Jan. 6, the
filing said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman detailed the write-down, which represents about 1.3
percent of its book value, as a material event that took place
after the bank's 2008 fiscal year ended in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fox-Pitt, Kelton banking analyst David Trone said the write
down was expected.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms and assigns Rating Outlooks to J.P. Morgan Commercial
Mortgage Finance Corp.'s mortgage pass-through certificates, series 1998-C6, as
follows: 

--Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$2 million class C at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$47.8 million class D at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$15.9 million class E at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$39.8 million class F at 'BBB-'; Outlook Stable; 

--$19.9 million class G at 'B-'; Outlook Negative. 

The $2.4 million class H remains at 'C/DR5'. Classes A1, A2, A3 and B have paid
in full. 

Although the transaction has paid down 18.8% since Fitch's last rating action,
affirmations are warranted due to the increased concentration within the pool
and high percentage of Fitch Loans of Concern. Rating Outlooks reflect the
likely direction of any rating changes over the next one to two years. As of the
January 2009 distribution date, the pool's certificate balance has been reduced
84% to $127.8 million from $796.4 million at issuance. Currently 16 of the
original 91 loans remain in the pool, all of which are scheduled to mature in
2012 or later. 

Fitch has identified two Loans of Concern (21.1%). The largest Loan of Concern
(20.2%) is secured by a retail plaza in Deptford, NJ. Servicer reported
occupancy as of September 2008 was 89.5%. The property had a large space vacated
by Circuit City, which filed for bankruptcy and is in the liquidation process,
and another space vacated by Sam's Club, which is paying rent through rent
expiration in August 2010. The loan is scheduled to mature in 2012. 

Of the original four shadow-rated loans in the pool, three have paid in full and
one (36.9%), which is the largest remaining loan, maintains its investment grade
shadow-rating. The Crystal Gateway Marriott is a 697-room full-service hotel in
Arlington, VA. The servicer reported the September 2008 occupancy at 76.5%,
average daily rate (ADR) at $184 and revenue per available room (RevPAR) at $141
compared to year-end (YE) 2007 occupancy of 79.4%, ADR of $179 and RevPAR of
$142. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 27 (Reuters) - Fitch Ratings on Tuesday cut
ratings on Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) and said it expects the
stress in the financial markets to hurt the bank's operating
earnings for the next few quarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Fitch cut the bank's long-term issuer default rating by one
notch, to "A-plus," or fifth-highest investment grade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank has $168 billion of debt outstanding, according to
Fitch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman had limited exposure to subprime mortgages and
other risky assets, allowing it to avoid the massive
write-downs suffered by rivals, said the agency. But the bank's
fourth-quarter loss "underscores the company's vulnerability to
current market stresses."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fitch is expecting mark-to-market valuations on certain
exposures to weigh on earnings for several quarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency said it will monitor Goldman's transition to a
bank holding company, which will expose it to closer regulatory
scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Goldman must acclimate to the altered competitive
landscape as well as adapt to this evolving regulatory
environment," said the agency.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Weak global economic conditions will continue to adversely impact revenues and
profitability in a number of Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s major business lines
such as debt underwriting, credit, and proprietary investments, according to
Fitch Ratings, which has downgraded the long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR),
debt and outstanding credit ratings of Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (Goldman) and
subsidiaries as outlined below: 

--Long-term IDR to 'A+' from 'AA-'; 

--Senior debt to 'A+' from 'AA-'; 

--Subordinated debt to 'A' from 'A+'; 

--Preferred stock to 'A-' from 'A+'; 

--Individual to 'B/C' from 'B'. 

The Rating Outlook is Stable. As of Nov. 28, 2008, total unsecured, long-term
debt of $168 billion was outstanding. A complete list of ratings is shown below.


While product diversity within the franchise has brought and should continue to
bring some balance to revenue streams, Fitch expects that ongoing mark-to-market
valuations on remaining high risk exposures combined with lower revenue
prospects will hinder operating performance over the next several quarters. In
addition, because results generated by principal trading and investment
activities are inherently unpredictable, they cannot be relied upon for core
earnings, although Goldman has effectively managed funding and capital support
for these business lines to date. 

By limiting its exposure to subprime mortgages and related derivative
instruments, Goldman has avoided the most severe valuation losses incurred by
many other participants in the securitized mortgage arena. But its fourth
quarter-2008 loss underscores the company's vulnerability to current market
stresses. During the period, the equity and credit markets experienced extreme
volatility, illiquidity and asset price depreciation, resulting in negative net
revenues in Fixed Income, Currencies and Commodities (FICC) and Principal
Investments. Going forward, sales and hedges will be tools likely employed to
reduce exposures to high risk or illiquid assets. However, Fitch anticipates
that weak investor appetite, tight liquidity and imperfect, costly hedges may
limit the potential success of these strategies. 

Fitch will monitor Goldman's transition to a bank holding company and assess any
changes in its business platform, funding profile or risk appetite. Fitch
believes U.S. financial institutions, in general, will be subject to increased
oversight and regulation. However, Goldman must acclimate to the altered
competitive landscape as well as adapt to this evolving regulatory environment
as a recently converted bank holding company. 

In the meantime, Goldman prudently manages its balance sheet, reducing leverage
in Fiscal Year 2008 by offloading assets and raising common and preferred
equity. Goldman's capital raises and reductions in leverage serve to limit
ratings downside as well. It continues to exhibit strong liquidity management,
increasing its global core excess over the last four quarters. As general market
liquidity returns, Fitch expects Goldman to reduce the global core excess
balance and increase leverage, although not necessarily to the respectively low

&lt;p&gt;ARMONK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
IBM (NYSE: IBM) announced today that it has resolved its lawsuit against former
IBM employee, Mark D. Papermaster, on terms that protect IBM`s proprietary and
confidential information. 

After Mr. Papermaster left IBM to begin employment with Apple Inc., a federal
district court granted IBM`s request for preliminary injunctive relief and
ordered that Mr. Papermaster immediately cease employment with Apple Inc.
pending further order of the Court. 

IBM and Mr. Papermaster have now agreed on a resolution of the lawsuit under
which Mr. Papermaster may not begin employment with Apple until April 24, 2009,
six months after leaving IBM, and will remain subject thereafter to all of his
contractual and other legal duties to IBM, including the obligation not to use
or disclose IBM`s confidential information. Following commencement of his
employment with Apple, Mr. Papermaster will be required to certify, in July 2009
and again in October 2009, that he has complied with his legal obligations not
to use or disclose IBM`s confidential or proprietary information. The
preliminary injunction will be replaced by a court order under which the Court
will have continuing jurisdiction over this matter, including compliance
enforcement powers, until October 24, 2009, one year after Mr. Papermaster`s
departure from IBM.

&lt;p&gt;Penned by a top technical writer, free guide shows users how to transform their
desktop Access databases into full-blown, AJAX-powered Web apps with Alpha Five
Version 9
BURLINGTON, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Alpha Software has released a new, 40-page downloadable e-book, dubbed, "Moving
an MS Access Database Application to the Web with Alpha Five Version 9." The
free title provides step-by-step instructions that will help any developer who
wants to move Microsoft Access desktop database and applications to the Web. The
e-book, which simplifies what`s usually a tedious process, is written by Martin
Heller, an experienced Web and desktop application developer and database
designer, and the author of thousands of technical articles and several
programming books. 

"Alpha Software asked me to provide an instructional, easy-to-follow guide that
would help users transfer their Microsoft Access applications to the Web, using
Alpha Five," Heller says. "I`m not endorsing Alpha Software or Microsoft here.
But I am giving developers an easy way to add power and usability to their
applications, without having to devote weeks of their time. No one can deny the
importance of the Web, especially when you`re trying to reach a large audience
of users. It`s important that developers be able to accomplish that with speed
and scalability, and with this guide, I`m showing them how." 

The e-book shows users how to migrate existing Access schema and data, and then
connect them to Web forms built with Alpha Five. The process uses seven
high-level Alpha Web components, AJAX widgets, and HTML, based on existing
Access forms. Readers will learn to use Alpha Five`s HTML Designer to rapidly
add saved components to a Web page. They`ll use Alpha`s Builders to configure
page components, recreating forms in Alpha in less time than it took to create
desktop Access forms. They see how they can interweave HTML and Xbasic code on
the server to process queries and forms on Web pages, operate on a database, and
display formatted data. And they`ll learn how to tap Alpha Five`s built-in SQL
capabilities to improve database scalability. 

"Martin has given us an outstanding addition to our customer education library,"
says Richard Rabins, Co-Chairman of Alpha Software. "We take pride in delivering
intuitive tools to build great-looking and well-performing applications. And
that means we need to provide developers with a steady diet of training
materials, so they can take full advantage of the power a rich Web database
application like Alpha Five provides. The need to move legacy MS Access apps to
the Web is increasingly important for companies looking to increase their
competitiveness with modern, cost-effective Web and intranet systems. With this
new e-book, we`re making the move from Access on the desktop to Alpha on the Web
fast, easy, and best of all, free."

instructional videos, white papers, and educational books, visit

&lt;p&gt;Authentication Provider Gives HealthVault Users an Option for Secure Login
PORTLAND, Ore.--(Business Wire)--
Vidoop, a provider of identity and authentication solutions to the healthcare
and financial services industries, announced today its authentication solution
will be available to Microsoft HealthVault users to access and share health
information online. 

"Our objective is to give our customers choice and make their Web experience
easier, while helping them safeguard their privacy," said George Scriban, senior
product manager, Health Solutions Group, Microsoft. "We're happy to be working
with Vidoop to give HealthVault users the option of using their log-in and
authentication solutions with their HealthVault account." 

HealthVault enables consumers to share health data with family members,
healthcare providers and others they trust, and use it to make more informed
healthcare decisions. Vidoop gives HealthVault users another option for secure
login to easily access and control their personal information and medical
records online. Vidoop`s unique ImageShield replaces the traditional password
field with an array of photos that are different with every login. When the
ImageShield is presented, the consumer selects the images that fit pre-selected
secret categories and are granted access to their medical records. 

"Strong authentication does not have to be a source of frustration for
healthcare providers or patients," says Joel Norvell, co-founder and chief
executive officer for Vidoop. "Our solution effectively defends against
prevalent forms of hacking with a straightforward, intuitive process that limits
access to personal information to authorized users." 

Vidoop offers its single sign-on solution at no charge at www.myVidoop.com. Once
a personal account is created, a simple registration process restricts access to
that user`s web browser. Strong authentication is achieved with a combination of
a shared secret and a device activation method. 

"The weakest point in Internet security is the front line - where users log-in -
but with strong authentication the front line can become the strongest point,"
said Scott Kveton, Vidoop`s vice president of Engineering. 

About Vidoop

Portland, Ore.-based Vidoop provides strong authentication solutions without the
use of tokens or additional hardware. The company was founded in 2006 by
principals Joel Norvell and Luke Sontag to bring corporate-grade security to the
consumer web. Vidoop employs experienced developers from Microsoft, the U.S.
Naval Research Laboratory and the National Institute of Standards and
Technology, as well as the banking and healthcare industries. For more

&lt;p&gt;  LONDON, Jan 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and SAP (NYSE: SAP) today announced an agreement with
Marks &amp; Spencer (M) to implement a suite of SAP Retail applications.

    The programme aims to provide M with accurate business data and robust
core processes to enable business improvement initiatives in cost and
operating efficiencies. Specifically, the programme will improve stock
visibility and management of information, while increasing process
efficiency which M believes will enhance the customer experience and
drive greater control over net margin.

    Marks &amp; Spencer Director of IT &amp; Logistics, Darrell Stein, says: "We
selected IBM and SAP after an extensive assessment of the market. In
addition to strong retail credentials, we felt there was also a strong

    Protecting the environment is also considered by the IBM programme, and

&lt;p&gt;Panorama, Maker of NovaView&#174; BI, is Committed to Long-Term Enterprise BI
Development; January 29 Webinar Event to Explain Migration Option to PPS and
Proclarity Users
TORONTO--(Business Wire)--
Panorama Software, a global leader in proactive Business Intelligence (BI)
solutions and the company that sold its OLAP technology to Microsoft, announced
today that its flagship BI product, NovaView&#174;, is immediately available as a
reliable, long-term BI solution for Microsoft PerformancePoint Server and
Proclarity customers adversely affected by Microsoft`s recent discontinuation
announcement. 

Panorama NovaView is a comprehensive BI solution designed for the Microsoft SQL
Server BI Platform. It includes virtually all features of the PerformancePoint
Server BI dashboard, analytics and monitoring in a fully Web-based or desktop
client. NovaView is available in both On-premise and SaaS versions. 

To ensure a seamless changeover for interested customers, Panorama is offering a
migration path to NovaView, including the company`s offsite SaaS product.
Panorama has set a special Webinar event on January 29, 2009, to answer
questions and explain alternatives for Microsoft PerformancePoint Server
customers. Register at:
http://www.panorama.com/webcasts/archives/2009/microsoft-alternative-business-intelligence-jan-2009.html.


On January 23, Microsoft announced that it will discontinue offering standalone
versions of PerformancePoint Server, its integrated performance management
product. As part of that announcement Microsoft announced it will also stop
selling the Proclarity Pro product which will have no future versions. When that
occurs, there will no longer a dedicated Business Intelligence product; instead,
Microsoft will simply offer BI as a set of services among others in Microsoft
Office and SharePoint. 

"Panorama is a BI company, one that has invested heavily in providing the best
BI solution for the Microsoft BI platform," said Oudi Antebi, Vice President of
Marketing and Strategy for Panorama Software. "We believe companies deserve a
Business Intelligence solution that is supported by someone completely dedicated
to its development and success, rather than something that is a small portion of
a larger business solution. Panorama was, is, and will be the best overall
solution for customers who choose the Microsoft SQL Server platform for BI." 

With Microsoft`s shift to providing BI within Office and SharePoint, users will
be able to accomplish a limited range of analysis and scorecarding. However,
Panorama intends to aggressively pursue its strategy of offering full enterprise
BI functionality in a single, complete and integrated suite that surpasses the
basic capabilities to be found in Office or SharePoint, and with a greater pace
of innovation. 

Panorama is offering a special promotion for Proclarity customers looking to
migrate to Panorama NovaView. Details can be received by emailing to
proclarity@Panorama.com. The company is also providing complete technical
assistance to enterprise users wishing to migrate to its NovaView Server
platform. To register for the January 29th Q webinar, log on to

dedicated NovaView BI solutions, go to www.panorama.com.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 27 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added Bristol-Myers Squibb
Co (BMY.N) to America's conviction buy list, saying it believes
the drugmaker was "aggressively pursuing" strategic options,
including takeovers and spin-offs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Bristol-Myers continues to be active in mergers and
acquisitions, enhancing its strategic attractiveness to an
acquirer or as a break-up candidate," analyst Jami Rubin wrote
in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The majority of the company's cash is also generated in
the United States, increasing both strategic value and
flexibility," the analyst added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Takeovers and spin-offs are now more likely given the
blockbuster Pfizer-Wyeth deal announced on Monday, Rubin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) proposed $68 billion acquisition of
Wyeth WYE.N is expected to be the first in a string of
strategic moves to restructure the pharmaceutical industry,
Rubin wrote. Rubin has a $27 price target on Bristol-Myers
stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were up 3 percent at $23 on low
volumes before the bell. They closed at $22.25 Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N), the world's biggest technology services company, is cutting about 2,800 jobs in North America, according to documents supplied by a union seeking to represent the company's employees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp spokesman Doug Shelton confirmed on Monday that the company last week informed some employees that their positions were being eliminated. But he declined to say how many were being cut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's move came as companies in the United States and Europe announced tens of thousands of layoffs on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The job cuts at IBM were evenly split between its software division and its sales and distribution unit, according to Lee Conrad, national coordinator for the Alliance at IBM. His group is a local chapter of the Communications Workers of America that is seeking to represent IBM's employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conrad added that he expects further layoffs to be announced, this time at IBM's hardware division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton declined to say which business divisions were cutting jobs. He added that the company regularly eliminates some jobs and adds new ones as business needs change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Armonk, New York-based company -- which is the world's No. 2 maker of software and biggest manufacturer of mainframe computers -- employed nearly 400,000 workers at the end of December, up from about 386,000 a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The nature of our business is such that we must constantly assess employee skills and resources, at any given time, to give IBM the flexibility to match the current and future needs of our clients," Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Managing talent in this way keeps IBM competitive, which we know is very important -- especially when the economy is in a downturn," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Laid off workers were given 30 to 90 days notice, were encouraged to apply for other jobs within IBM, and will be granted severance packages upon leaving the company, Shelton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Workers will receive one week of pay for each six months of service with IBM, up to a maximum of 26 weeks of salary, according to one of the documents provided by Conrad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shelton declined to discuss details of the severance packages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jim Finkle; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

HYDERABAD, Inde--(Business Wire)--
Le Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) s'est joint aujourd'hui &#224; des &#233;tudiantes
de l'Indian School of Business (ISB) pour c&#233;l&#233;brer la remise des dipl&#244;mes &#224; la
premi&#232;re promotion des &#233;tudiantes de l'initiative 10.000 Femmes en Inde. 10.000
Femmes est une initiative mondiale qui permet &#224; des femmes d&#233;favoris&#233;es,
principalement dans les march&#233;s des pays en d&#233;veloppement et &#233;mergents,
d'&#233;tudier les affaires et la gestion des entreprises. Les &#233;tudiantes recevant
leur dipl&#244;me ont rencontr&#233; les dirigeants de Goldman Sachs et de l'ISB et ont
pr&#233;sent&#233; des plans d'affaires qu'elles ont d&#233;velopp&#233;s tout au long de leur
programme d'&#233;tudes et qu'elles destinent &#224; l'&#233;largissement de leurs entreprises
existantes. 

Les 29 femmes de la premi&#232;re promotion de dipl&#244;m&#233;es ont commenc&#233; leur programme
d'&#233;tudes en octobre. Les dipl&#244;m&#233;es ont achev&#233; un programme de 150 heures leur
donnant un certificat en entrepreneuriat avec trois semaines de cours en salle
de classe et neuf semaines de mentorat et de soutien chez leur employeur.
L'objectif final du programme d'&#233;tudes &#233;tait d'aider les femmes &#224; d&#233;velopper
leurs entreprises en les faisant passer du statut de start-up &#224; celui
d'entreprises &#224; la croissance durable. Un deuxi&#232;me groupe de femmes commencera
son programme d'&#233;tudes &#224; Bangalore en f&#233;vrier. Au total, 300 Indiennes recevront
une formation dans le cadre de ce programme qui se d&#233;roule sur cinq ann&#233;es. 

&#171; Ces dipl&#244;m&#233;es de l'initiative10,000 Women illustrent brillamment le potentiel
quasiment illimit&#233; de l'&#233;conomie indienne &#187;, d&#233;clare Brooks Entwistle, directeur
g&#233;n&#233;ral et CEO de Goldman Sachs India. &#171; Les &#233;tudes ont montr&#233; que les
investissements r&#233;alis&#233;s dans de telles formes d'enseignement de la gestion des
entreprises ont un effet multiplicateur spectaculaire et positif &#224; la fois sur
les &#233;conomies locales et sur les niveaux de vie. &#187; 

L'initiative 10.000 Femmes a son origine dans une &#233;tude dirig&#233;e par la Banque
mondiale, Goldman Sachs et d'autres, qui a d&#233;montr&#233; que le fait de permettre aux
femmes de faire des &#233;tudes est l'une des mani&#232;res les plus efficaces de
d&#233;velopper la croissance &#233;conomique et d'am&#233;liorer les niveaux de vie dans les
&#233;conomies des pays en d&#233;veloppement. La conclusion de ces recherches est que, en
moyenne, une augmentation d'un point de pourcentage de l'enseignement f&#233;minin se
traduit par une hausse annuelle des taux de croissance du PIB de 0,2 points de
pourcentage. &#171; Women Hold Up Half the Sky &#187; (les femmes soutiennent la moiti&#233; du
ciel), une analyse publi&#233;e par Goldman Sachs Economic Research, a montr&#233; que
l'augmentation du nombre des femmes dans la population active, un cas de figure
qui d&#233;rive naturellement du d&#233;veloppement du syst&#232;me &#233;ducatif, pourrait ajouter
un point de pourcentage au taux de croissance annuel du PIB de l'Inde et
pourrait aboutir &#224; une hausse de 10 % de son PIB par habitant en une d&#233;cennie. 

Le programme d'&#233;tudes de l'ISB offre aux &#233;tudiantes un enseignement en salle de
classe, un mentorat, des possibilit&#233;s de travailler en r&#233;seau ainsi que des
&#233;tudes de cas portant sur des entreprises du monde entier qui ont r&#233;ussi. Dans
la phase finale du programme, les &#233;tudiantes se sont mesur&#233;es lors d'une
pr&#233;sentation de plans d'affaires qu'elles ont mis au point dans le but de
d&#233;velopper leurs propres entreprises existantes. 

L'initiative de Goldman Sachs 10.000 Femmes a &#233;t&#233; lanc&#233;e le 5 mars 2008. Elle
engagera 100 millions de dollars au cours des cinq prochaines ann&#233;es et elle est
associ&#233;e &#224; plus de 50 universit&#233;s et organisations en Afrique, en Asie, en
Europe, en Am&#233;rique latine, au Moyen-Orient et aux &#201;tats-Unis dans le but de
rechercher, de cr&#233;er et de mettre au point des programmes visant &#224; influencer la
qualit&#233; et les capacit&#233;s de l'enseignement de la gestion des entreprises dans
les r&#233;gions en d&#233;veloppement du monde entier. Pour de plus amples informations

van de eerste lichting studenten die hebben deelgenomen aan het initiatief
10,000 Women in India. 10,000 Women is een internationaal programma om minder
bevoorrechte vrouwen, met name in markten die in ontwikkeling en in opkomst
zijn, een zakelijke of bestuurlijke opleiding te bieden. De afgestudeerde
studenten hadden een ontmoeting met de leiding van Goldman Sachs, ISB, en
presenteerden de bedrijfsplannen die ze als onderdeel van de cursus hadden
ontwikkeld en die bedoeld zijn om hun bestaande zakelijke activiteiten uit te
breiden. 

De eerste lichting van 29 vrouwen begon in oktober aan de cursus De
afgestudeerden voltooiden een certificaatopleiding van 150 uur in
ondernemerschap, inclusief drie weken instructie in klasvorm en negen weken
begeleiding en ondersteuning in de praktijk. Het uiteindelijke doel van de
cursus was de vrouwen te helpen bij het laten uitgroeien van hun bedrijf van een
startende onderneming naar een groeiende en stabiele onderneming. In februari
begint een tweede groep vrouwen aan de cursus in Bangalore. In de loop van het
vijfjarige programma zullen in totaal 300 Indiase vrouwen de opleiding kunnen
volgen. 

"Deze afgestudeerden van het programma 10,000 Women vormen een schitterend
voorbeeld van de nagenoeg onbegrensde mogelijkheden van de Indiase economie,"
aldus Brooks Entwistle, Managing Director en Chief Executive Officer van Goldman
Sachs India. "Onderzoek heeft uitgewezen dat investeringen een zakelijke
opleidingen zoals deze een dramatisch en positief vermenigvuldigingseffect
kunnen hebben op zowel de plaatselijke economie als de levensstandaard." 

Het initiatief 10,000 Women is gebaseerd op onderzoek uitgevoerd door de
Wereldbank, Goldman Sachs, en anderen, waaruit bleek dat het opleiden van
vrouwen een van de meest effectieve manieren is om de economische groei te
bevorderen en de levensstandaard in economie&#235;n in ontwikkeling te verbeteren. De
conclusie van de studies is dat een toename van 1 procent in de scholing van
vrouwen de jaarlijkse groei van het BNP gemiddeld met 0,2 procent verhoogt.
"Women Hold Up Half the Sky," een analyse gepubliceerd door Goldman Sachs
Economic Research, concludeert dat een groter aantal vrouwen in het
arbeidspotentieel, een natuurlijk gevolg van meer scholing, de jaarlijkse groei
van het BNP in India met 1% zou kunnen verhogen en het BNP per hoofd van de
bevolking in tien jaar met 10% zou kunnen laten stijgen. 

Het curriculum van het ISB-programma biedt studenten instructie in een
klaslokaal, begeleiding, contacten en case studies van succesvolle bedrijven
wereldwijd. In de laatste fase van het programma presenteren de studenten een
bedrijfsplan dat ze hebben opgezet om hun bestaande onderneming uit te breiden. 

Het initiatief 10,000 Women van Goldman Sachs ging op 5 maart 2008 van start. In
het kader van het programma wordt verspreid over de komende vijf jaar US$ 100
miljoen besteed, en wordt samengewerkt met meer dan 50 universiteiten en
organisaties in Afrika, Azi&#235;, Europa, Latijns-Amerika, het Midden-Oosten en de
Verenigde Staten voor het vinden, opzetten en ontwikkelen van programma`s om de
kwaliteit en capaciteit van zakelijk onderwijs in ontwikkelingsregio`s
wereldwijd te bevorderen. Voor meer informatie over het programma 10,000 Women

HYDERABAD, India--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) si &#232; unito oggi con gli studenti della
Indian School of Business (ISB) per caratterizzare il diploma delle prime
studentesse della iniziativa 10.000 Women in India. 10.000 Women &#232; un'opera
globale per offrire alle donne provenienti da aree sotto-servite, in prevalenza
dei mercati emergenti e in via di sviluppo, formazione nel settore della
gestione ed amministrazione degli affari. Le studentesse diplomande hanno
incontrato i leader di Goldman Sachs e della ISB, e hanno presentato i piani di
attivit&#224; (business plan) sviluppati durante i loro studi e progettati per
espandere le loro attivit&#224; gi&#224; esistenti. 

Il primo corso costituito da 29 donne era iniziato ad ottobre. Le studentesse
hanno completato un programma di 150 ore per l'imprenditorialit&#224; che ha incluso
tre settimane di lezioni in classe e nove settimane di tutoraggio e supporto sul
luogo di lavoro. L'obiettivo finale del corso &#232; stato quello di aiutare le donne
ad espandere le loro attivit&#224; facendole passare dalle fasi iniziali, fino a
diventare imprese crescenti e sostenibili. Un secondo gruppo di donne inizier&#224;
gli studi a Bangalore nel mese di febbraio. Un totale di 300 donne indiane
ricever&#224; formazione durante un programma di cinque anni. 

"Queste diplomate dell'iniziativa 10,000 Women sono un brillante esempio del
potenziale quasi infinito dell'economia indiana", ha detto Brooks Entwistle,
amministratore delegato e direttore generale di Goldman Sachs India. "La ricerca
ha mostrato che investimenti come questi, effettuati nell'istruzione
imprenditoriale, possono avere un notevole effetto moltiplicatore e positivo sia
sulle economie locali che sugli standard di vita".

della Banca Mondiale, di Goldman Sachs, e di altre istituzioni che hanno
scoperto che l'educazione delle donne &#232; uno dei modi pi&#249; efficaci per aumentare
la crescita economica e migliorare i livelli di vita per le economie in via di
sviluppo. Gli studi effettuati hanno concluso che, in media, l'aumento di un
punto percentuale nell'educazione femminile aumenta la crescita del PIL annuale
dello 0,2 percento. "Le donne sostengono met&#224; del cielo", ha intitolato un
analista del gruppo per la ricerca sull'economia di Goldman Sachs, scoprendo che
un aumento nel numero delle donne nella forza lavoro, che &#232; una conseguenza
naturale di una maggiore istruzione, potrebbe aumentare dell'1% i livelli di
crescita annuale del PIL dell'India e potrebbe aumentare il suo PIL pro capite
del 10% in una decade. 

Il programma del corso di studi della ISB offre agli studenti fasi di formazione
in classe, tutoraggio, formazione professionale esterna (networking) e studio di
casi specifici relativi ad imprese di successo in tutto il mondo. Nella fase
finale del programma, le studentesse hanno gareggiato nella presentazione di un

GDP per Capita Could Increase By Up To 10%
HYDERABAD, India--(Business Wire)--
The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) today joined with students at the
Indian School of Business (ISB) to mark the graduation of the first students in
the 10,000 Women initiative in India. 10,000 Women is a global effort providing
underserved women, predominantly in developing and emerging markets, with
business and management education. Graduating students met with leaders from
Goldman Sachs, ISB, and presented business plans developed through their
coursework and intended to expand their existing businesses. 

The first graduating class of 29 women began their course work in October.
Graduates completed a 150-hour certificate program in entrepreneurship that
included three weeks of classroom instruction and nine weeks of mentoring and
on-the-job support. The end goal of the coursework was to help the women expand
their businesses from start-ups to growing and sustainable enterprises. A second
group of women will begin their studies in Bangalore in February. A total of 300
Indian women will receive training over the five-year program. 

"These graduates of 10,000 Women are a shining example of the near limitless
potential of the Indian economy," said Brooks Entwistle, Managing Director and
Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs India. "Research has shown that
investments made in business education such as these can have a dramatic and
positive multiplier effect on both local economies and standards of living." 

The 10,000 Women initiativewas founded on research conducted by the World Bank,
Goldman Sachs, and others, which found that educating women is one of the most
effective ways to increase economic growth and improve living standards in
developing economies. Studies conclude that, on average, a one percentage point
increase in female education raises annual GDP growth rates by 0.2 percentage
point. "Women Hold Up Half the Sky," an analysis published by Goldman Sachs
Economic Research, found that increasing the number of women in the labor force,
which is a natural outcome of more education, could add 1% to India`s annual GDP
growth rates and could raise its GDP per capita by 10% in a decade. 

The ISB program curriculum offers students classroom instruction, mentoring,
networking, and case studies of successful firms from around the globe. In the
final phase of the program, students competed in a presentation of business
plans they designed to expand their own existing businesses. 

The Goldman Sachs 10,000 Women initiative was launched March 5, 2008. It will
commit US$100 million over the next five years and has partnered with more than
50 universities and organizations in Africa, Asia, Europe, Latin America, the
Middle East and United States to seek, create and develop programs to impact the
quality and capacity of business education in developing regions around the
world. For further information on the 10,000 Women program, please visit

HYDERABAD, Indien--(Business Wire)--
Die Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE: GS) kam heute mit Studentinnen der Indian
School of Business (ISB) zusammen, um die Graduierung der ersten Teilnehmerinnen
der 10,000 Women-Initiative in Indien zu feiern.10,000 Women ist eine globale
Kampagne, die darauf abzielt, unterprivilegierten Frauen in erster Linie aus
Entwicklungs- und Schwellenl&#228;ndern in Betriebswirtschaft und Unternehmensf&#252;hrung
auszubilden. Die Absolventinnen trafen F&#252;hrungskr&#228;fte von Goldman Sachs und ISB
und pr&#228;sentierten Gesch&#228;ftspl&#228;ne zur Ausweitung ihrer bestehenden Unternehmen,
die sie im Rahmen ihrer Studien entwickelt hatten. 

Die erste Abgangsklasse besteht aus 29 Frauen, die ihr Studium im Oktober
letzten Jahres begannen. Die Absolventinnen schlossen ein 150-st&#252;ndiges
Zertifizierungsprogramm ab, das drei Wochen von Klassenunterricht und neun
Wochen von praktischer Betreuung und berufsbegleitender Unterst&#252;tzung umfasste.
Das Endziel des Studiums war, den Frauen zu helfen, ihre Gesch&#228;fte &#252;ber die
Gr&#252;ndungsphase hinaus in wachsende und nachhaltige Unternehmen auszubauen. Im
Februar wird eine zweite Gruppe von Frauen ihr Studium in Bangalore beginnen.
Das F&#252;nf-Jahres-Programm wird insgesamt 300 indischen Frauen eine Ausbildung
vermitteln. 

&#8222;Diese Absolventinnen der 10,000 Women-Initiative sind ein leuchtendes Beispiel
f&#252;r das nahezu grenzenlose Potenzial der indischen Wirtschaft", sagte Brooks
Entwistle, der Gesch&#228;ftsf&#252;hrer und CEO von Goldman Sachs India. &#8222;Studien
belegen, dass Investitionen in die unternehmerische Ausbildung wie diese einen
dramatischen und positiven Multiplikationseffekt auf die &#246;rtliche Wirtschaft wie
auch den Lebensstandard haben k&#246;nnen." 

Die 10,000 Women -Initiative beruht auf von der World Bank, Goldman Sachs und
anderen durchgef&#252;hrten Studien, die fanden, dass die Ausbildung von Frauen eine
der wirkungsvollsten M&#246;glichkeiten zur F&#246;rderung des Wirtschaftswachstums und
der Lebensbedingungen in Entwicklungsl&#228;ndern ist. Diese Studien ergaben, dass
eine durchschnittliche Steigerung der Ausbildung von Frauen und M&#228;dchen um einen
Prozentpunkt das j&#228;hrliche Wachstum des Bruttosozialproduktes um 0,2
Prozentpunkte steigert. Die von Goldman Sachs Economic Research ver&#246;ffentlichte
Analyse mit dem englischen Originaltitel &#8222;Women Hold Up Half the Sky" (zu
Deutsch: &#8222;Frauen st&#252;tzen den halben Himmel") stellte fest, dass ein erh&#246;hter
Anteil von Frauen am Arbeitsmarkt - eine nat&#252;rliche Folge von mehr Bildung - das
j&#228;hrliche Wachstum von Indiens Bruttosozialprodukt um 1 Prozent steigern und
sein Bruttosozialprodukt pro Einwohner innerhalb eines Jahrzehntes um 10 Prozent
erh&#246;hen k&#246;nnte. 

Der Lehrplan der ISB bietet Studentinnen des Programms Klassenunterricht,
berufsbegleitende Betreuung, Kontakte und Fallstudien erfolgreicher Firmen aus
aller Welt. In der Endphase bereiteten die Studentinnen eine Pr&#228;sentation von
Gesch&#228;ftspl&#228;nen zur Erweiterung ihrer bestehenden Unternehmen vor. 

Die 10,000 Women-Initiative von Goldman Sachs wurde am 5. M&#228;rz 2008 ins Leben

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Onyx Pharma's Nexavar Gleaming

Onyx Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: ONXX) is engaged in the development of novel
cancer therapies that target the molecular basis of cancer. With its
collaborator Bayer Healthcare, the company develops the small molecule drug
Nexavar (sorafenib). 

Nexavar sales in the third quarter of 2008 remained strong. This is mainly
attributed to the market penetration in the liver cancer market, while Nexavar
market share in kidney cancer market has stabilized due to heavy competition
from Pfizer (NYSE: PFE) and Wyeth (NYSE: WYE). 

Energizer with Big Upside

Energizer Holdings, Inc. (NYSE: ENR) has generated top-line growth both through
organic growth in the razor blade and battery businesses and though the
acquisition of Playtex and Hawaiian Tropic. 

In addition, integration savings, originally estimated to be $57 million, was
increased to $70 million. Management is incentivized with annual and two-year
bonus plans and a stock incentive plan. Historically, management has been
successful in qualifying for performance-based awards. 

Newfield E from Buy to Sell

Newfield Exploration (NYSE: NFX), based in Houston, Texas, is an independent
energy company engaged in the exploration and production (E) of crude oil and
natural gas. In an asset-diversification strategy, management has turned what
was once an exclusive concentration in the Gulf of Mexico into a balanced
portfolio. 

We are downgrading Newfield shares to Sell from Buy to reflect the company's
weak competitive position in the current unfavorable macro backdrop. We believe
that the Newfield asset portfolio centered around the Rockies and Gulf Coast
regions are lacking in a meaningful exposure to the emerging shale plays.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
AMB Property Corp. (NYSE: AMB), Charlotte Russe Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHIC),
Arch Coal (NYSE: ACI), Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (NYSE: BNI)and
Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. (NYSE: CCH).

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

AMB Ppy Announces Impairments

AMB Property Corp. (NYSE: AMB) today announced large impairment charges on its
in-process development pipeline and land holdings. The company will take a $0.96
per share charge in 4Q08 to write down the value of in process developments and
a $0.94 per share impairment on land holdings. 

In addition, the company will lay off about 22% of its global workforce. AMB
depends on merchant building sales to third parties or funds which have
historically made up a large part of the company's earnings. Cap-rate increases
have decreased the value of the company's current development pipeline. 

Charlotte Russe Ests Lowered

Charlotte Russe Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: CHIC) is a mall-based specialty apparel
retailer, which carries both branded and private-label merchandise, targeting
women in their teens and twenties. The retailer offers a broad assortment of
fashionable merchandise. 

The company reported weaker-than-expected results for its fiscal first quarter,
and CHIC's second quarter EPS guidance was below the market's expectations. We
are lowering our estimates for fiscal 2009 and 2010. The company also announced
that it was exploring strategic alternatives including selling the company. 

Arch Coal Rating Downed to Hold

We are downgrading our recommendation on Arch Coal (NYSE: ACI) to Hold from Buy
before the company releases its 4Q and full-year '08 results. Although coal
prices have outperformed other commodities like steel, copper and oil, there
looks to be no upside catalyst in the next six months for the industry and a
result, ACI will likely trade flat during 1H'09. 

As the effects of global monetary and fiscal stimulatory efforts work their way
into Wall Street and Main Street, it will be more apparent as to the direction
of the global economy. However, we do anticipate emerging markets to start
recovering late in '09, which would spur new demand for electricity and steel,
driving coal stocks higher. 

Burlington Northern Balances Out

We are continuing our Hold on Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation (NYSE:
BNI), but decreasing our target price to $66. BNI reported 2008 fourth quarter
diluted EPS of $1.79, up 23% year over year and above consensus of $1.74 and our
$1.75 estimate, as expenses, primarily for fuel, were lower than estimated. 

Revenues were also below expectations, reflecting a 5% decline in volume that
accelerated in the second half of the fourth quarter due to the global economic
slowdown. We are sharply reducing our 2009 diluted EPS estimate to $5.05 from
$6.90. 

CCH a Play on Eastern Europe

Headquartered in Athens, Greece, Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company S.A. (NYSE:
CCH) produces, markets, and distributes primarily products of The Coca-Cola
Company in 28 countries, including Greece, Italy, Austria, Russia, Ukraine,
Poland and Hungary, to name but a few. 

Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company enjoys an attractive geographic mix with 66%
of revenues being derived from developing or emerging markets. In addition, the
company's product mix is less dependent on CSDs (carbonated soft drinks) than
other bottlers.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jan 27 (Reuters) - Retail investors have begun to
pile into oil attracted by its low price and are investing via
exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which have seen unprecedented
inflows, U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Investor positions or "length" in the oil market has climbed
back towards levels seen last summer, when prices were headed
towards a record peak of more than $147 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, over this time period, we have seen a shift in the
type of investor interest," Goldman Sachs said in its latest
Energy Weekly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The most recent surge in investor interest in oil has been
mostly concentrated in ETF instruments," it said. "We believe
that this has come mostly from the retail and private banking
sectors."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exchange traded funds are securities which track the value
of an underlying instrument such as gold or oil futures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said these investors tended to focus on the price
level of oil, which contrasts with institutional investors,
which focus more on the shape of oil's forward price curve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman estimated the number of oil barrels owned by
investors is only down 13 percent since the oil market peaked in
July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We estimate index investors now own 837 million barrels of
oil versus 1,032 million barrels when oil prices peaked."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil has dropped more than $100 from its record high in July
last year, depressed by sharp falls in demand as global economic
growth has been hit by the fallout from the credit crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investor interest in oil and other commodities as an asset
class surged over the past few years, with commodities seen as
offering portfolio diversification versus equities and bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bulk of these institutional investors have tended to
access the oil market via commodity indexes created from baskets
of commodities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said inflows into ETFs had contributed to oil's
rally this month from lows near $30 a barrel towards $50 a
barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the U.S. bank does not believe oil's bear market is over
yet, pointing to a massive counter-seasonal stock build in the
top energy consumer the United States and extremely weak demand
from China, the world's second biggest energy user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see this recent rally as being transient," the bank
said. "We believe that this recent surge of investor length in
the oil market is premature and would prefer to remain short oil
until inventories stop building and demand weakness subsides."

&lt;p&gt;JPT Launches 'PepTrack(tm) -- Peptide Library Technologies' for T-cell Assays in
Vaccine Development

BERLIN, Jan. 27, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- JPT Peptide Technologies GmbH (JPT), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Jerini AG (Frankfurt:JI4), announced today the launch
of its new product line: PepTrack(tm). Designed for peptides in T-cell assays
(ELISPOT, CFC, ICS and others), this approach represents the most efficient
technique for producing large numbers of peptides simultaneously. In addition,
PepTrack(tm) production is in compliance with DIN ISO 9001:2008 and Good
Clinical Laboratory Practices.

JPT offers four delivery options for T-cell assays: 1) Fast Track for
proteome-wide T-cell epitope discovery programs 2) Research Track for T-cell
epitope mapping studies 3) Discovery Track for immune monitoring applications
and 4) Trial Track for vaccination trials. The new product line combines JPT's
proprietary technologies with its in-depth knowledge of T-cell assays in
discovery research and clinical trials.

"Our clients' experience has shown that peptides with inappropriate
specifications can, potentially, not only jeopardize T-cell assay performance,
but also entire clinical studies," states Holger Wenschuh, Managing Director at
JPT. "Avoiding sources of false positive T-cell response, eliminating toxic
contaminants that inhibit T-cell activation, and developing and validating
reproducible production processes have been the key drivers in the development
of this new product line."

As a worldwide leader in peptide research and production, JPT has now increased
its production capacity to more than 2 million peptides per year.

&lt;p&gt;The Site is a New WebSphere 6.0 Implementation with an Unprecedented Level of
Customization and Content-to-Commerce Integration


VAN NUYS, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Zobrist Consulting is pleased to announce its recognition for the launch of the
new thenorthface.com website, featuring the first ever ecommerce store for The
North Face. The site launch won Zobrist the IBM Leadership Award for "Best B2C
Deployment in 2008." 

The Zobrist team created a completely new WebSphere 6.0 Commerce / Content site
architecture to deliver an integrated brand experience on thenorthface.com. This

of rich brand content such as product animations and video. 

Zobrist communicated regularly with IBM, holding six System Assurance Reviews
over the course of the 18 month long project. "The hard work paid off," said
David Privett, eCommerce Sr. Solution Specialist with IBM. "The new site is
state of the art. When you can't actually be out skiing or climbing, it's the
next best thing. Zobrist has helped The North Face create a site that will build
long lasting customer relationships." For this reason, along with the
foundational excellence of the complex custom site and the high degree of client
satisfaction, IBM selected Zobrist for the `Best B2C Deployment` WebSphere
Commerce Leadership Award. 

"In conjunction with our agency partners, we've created a site that will enable
The North Face`s customers to easily and enjoyably shop for the gear they need,"
explains Teresa Zobrist, Principal at Zobrist Consulting. "The new site will
provide outdoor enthusiasts with inspiration to get outside, push their limits
and keep going back to thenorthface.com for motivation and gear."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Two days after Pfizer said it would buy Wyeth for $68 billion, Pfizer shares have fallen to nearly a 12-year low and some shareholders are questioning the wisdom of the planned union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer on Monday said it would pay $50.19 -- $33 in cash and 0.985 share of its stock -- for each Wyeth share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pfizer's stock has fallen 10 percent since news of the merger talks leaked out early on Friday -- including a 2.4 percent decline on Wednesday -- which would now allow $48.21 for Wyeth shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People seem underwhelmed by the deal, maybe thinking Pfizer made a safe move with Wyeth rather than trying to shoot the lights out with a more aggressive company better able to produce blockbuster drugs," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of OakBrook Investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Pfizer shareholders may be bailing because the deal will force the drugmaker to halve its dividend, whose rich 8 percent yield has eased the pain as company profit and shares have steadily fallen in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth's Prevnar childhood vaccine and Enbrel arthritis drug -- both big blockbusters -- will likely help prevent Pfizer earnings from crashing when its $12 billion-a-year Lipitor cholesterol drug faces generic competition in late 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth reported Prevnar sales of $2.7 billion and Enbrel sales of $3.8 billion for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jankovskis, whose firm in Lisle, Illinois, holds about one million shares of Pfizer and 250,000 shares of Wyeth, noted Pfizer expects flat earnings through 2012 and there is no certainty profit will grow significantly soon after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors will need fairly extreme patience," he said. "Maybe the best thing is not to go through with the Wyeth deal. Then Pfizer would be able to maintain their dividend and perhaps look for a better opportunity that would excite investors more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth shares on Wednesday closed at $43.85, a bit higher than their closing price on Monday, after the deal was announced. Although they have risen 13 percent since January 22, the day before news of the merger talks leaked out, shares remain far lower than the 29 percent premium offered by Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There could be some pushback here from those that think Wyeth may be worth more than Pfizer is paying for it, especially when you consider Wyeth's stock was close to $50 back in July," said Russell Croft, portfolio manager of Baltimore-based asset manager Croft-Leominster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Croft, whose company holds more shares of Pfizer than Wyeth, said he's inclined to support the deal which is slated to close in the second half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At first glance it looks like a pretty good combination because, with Lipitor running out, Wyeth would help fill Pfizer's drug pipeline," he said. "And Pfizer could cut out a lot of costs, including back-office expenses and probably sales positions," after the deal closes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Fisher, portfolio manager of Fifth Third Asset Management in Minneapolis, panned the deal, although he predicted ultimately it will not be deemed as harmful to Pfizer as its costly acquisitions of rival drugmakers Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia Corp over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's neutral at best; I don't think they'll generate a great return on the capital they're investing in this deal," he said, noting that Pfizer -- the world's largest drugmaker -- will get substantially bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see what's going to re-invigorate the company. They're just making themselves very large, and it's very difficult to grow a huge business like that," Fisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What they'll add to the company will help prevent a big earnings drop, but it doesn't enhance Pfizer's growth profile," Fisher said. He said Prevnar and Enbrel won't be big enough to greatly help Pfizer, whose current array of products generate $48 billion in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the deal has dealt a setback for Wyeth's vaccine business, by prompting Wyeth to end its own negotiations to acquire Dutch vaccine maker Crucell CRCL.AS, Fisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite longstanding investor pain and lingering worries about Pfizer, some of its stockholders think continued patience will yet pay off, including David Katz of asset manager Matrix Asset Advisors in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Wyeth deal is not a panacea, but moves Pfizer in a better direction by alleviating the Lipitor problem," said Katz, who is co-chief investment officer of Matrix. "It flattens the earnings to get back to growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares now trade at 6.5 times annual earnings per share, less than half their traditional price-to-earnings ratio, Katz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But shares could eventually double if the P/E goes back to its historic average," which he said could happen once earnings growth returns to a high-single-digit percentage range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer will not be a robust 20 percent-a-year grower like a biotech," he said, but can nevertheless amply reward investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Burnick, director of research with Weiss Capital Management in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, also plans to remain patient. (Pfizer) "has been kind of dead money for the last five years. That kind of apathy about a stock tends to create a good value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're still bullish on it now," said Burnick, who predicted Wyeth's drugs and expertise will benefit Pfizer's drug development. "We have no intention at this time of parting ways with the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Jan 28 (Reuters) - A hearing to determine if
Microsoft (MSFT.O) was complying with a 2002 antitrust
settlement was unusually friendly on Wednesday, but states
leading the legal charge declined to say if they would ask for
oversight to be extended past November.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; At the hearing, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly of the U.S.
District Court for the District of Columbia reviewed progress in
several areas, remarking at one point, "That's good news."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stephen Houck, who represents a group of plaintiff states,
was unusually complimentary, saying Microsoft was "working hard"
to resolve outstanding issues and saying they were "thinking
very hard" about whether they would ask for extended oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kollar-Kotelly has previously said she wanted to see court
oversight of Microsoft end on schedule on Nov. 12, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judge also expressed concern that Microsoft's decision
to cut up to 5,000 jobs could affect progress in producing the
technical documents required for software makers to write
applications for the Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's chief technical person involved in the case, Bob
Muglia, reassured her, saying that "in no way will any change in
staffing" affect progress. "I've said before this was our
highest priority and will remain so," he told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hearing on Wednesday was to review Microsoft's
compliance with the pact that settled findings the company had
abused its dominance in personal computer operating systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 2002 consent decree covers the company's ties to
computer makers, how its software works with other types of
software and enforcement to ensure it does not repeat past
practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft was required to issue licenses for companies which
want to write programs for the Windows operating system, and
provide technical information about Windows to help make the
programs work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The next hearing is set for April 22.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
An ExxonMobil Chemical Exxtral performance polyolefin has been specified for the
front and rear bumper fasciae of the new globally available VW Golf VI. Exxtral
BMU130 polyolefin was developed specifically to meet the performance targets set
by Volkswagen (VW). VW is the first German original equipment manufacturer (OEM)
to select strong, light-weight Exxtral polyolefins for fasciae. 

"The specification criteria set by VW are some of the most challenging in the
industry. Using our technology and application expertise to develop a specific
grade for these bumper fasciae ensured we could meet VW`s functional and cost
needs, which was crucial in earning their business," said Marty E. Levine,
global automotive marketing manager, ExxonMobil Chemical specialty compounds
business. 

The new TPO is characterized by a unique impact strength at low temperatures
that provides the essential balance between stiffness and toughness required for
bumper applications. 

Exxtral BMU130 performance polyolefin is designed for tight tolerances and
excellent dimensional stability. Its low coefficient of linear thermal expansion
(CLTE) allows parts to be designed with narrow gap dimensions for an aesthetic
and stylish appearance. 

This grade also meets part shrinkage requirements specified by VW and provides
good surface appearance due to its fluidity. The product has a broad operating
window, which helps to eliminate processing problems, such as "tiger stripes." A
ready-to-inject, fully-stabilized, colored compound, Exxtral BMU130 polyolefin
can improve productivity and deliver cost savings as it requires no mixing or
blending at the molding presses. Available in black or grey, it also offers good
paintability and has high UV resistance. 

The portfolio of Exxtral performance polyolefins is becoming increasingly
popular with automotive designers and processors looking for new materials that
offer opportunities to reduce weight and cost without sacrificing performance.
Durable in adverse conditions, they provide outstanding surface hardness, good
"fit and finish" characteristics, fast cycle times and are competitively priced.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jan 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today unveiled a new report, "The Changing Face of
Communications," available at www.ibm.com/telecom, that highlights the
need for Communication Service Providers (CSPs) to embrace social
networking in order to protect and enhance their role in the
communications industry. CSPs who don't take bold steps to adapt to this
rapidly evolving cultural phenomenon -- which is redefining communications
as we know it today -- risk losing revenue and marketshare.

    Social Networks have become primary destinations for a rapidly expanding
universe of online users to manage and enrich their digital lifestyles
both personally and professionally. In June 2008, unique monthly visitors
to social networks represented approximately two-thirds of the world's
Internet audience.(i) Based on the projected growth of the global Internet
audience, IBM estimates that by 2012, the number of unique monthly
visitors to online social networking sites will surpass 800 million.(ii)

    Social Networking Today

    Social networking, considered a "communication fad" in recent years, is
transcending that phase and is weaving itself into the intrinsic fabric of
the Internet. Throughout the world, Internet users are turning en masse to
such sites as Facebook and MySpace to meet their communication needs. For
example, before 2005, not a single social media network was ranked among
the world's top 20 English-language Web sites.(iii) By June 2008, social
networking sites comprised half of the same list, surpassing many
traditional Internet "stars," such as AOL, eBay and Amazon in the upper
tier.

    Not only have social networking sites become a primary communication
platform, but these sites are also increasingly being used as distribution
channels for digital content which leverages the "viral" nature of an
individual's network of relationships. While first gaining a foothold
among individual online users, companies are now more actively
recognizing the potential benefits of a social media strategy to build
brand loyalty by involving these networks of consumers. Depending on the
brand and its goals, establishing a social network site dedicated to its
clients can attract a better-targeted audience, more actively engage
them, and allow them to exchange information among a community that is
most suitable for the user.

    Transforming the Telecommunications Industry

    "Successful communications systems are those that beyond providing basic
connectivity allow individuals, organizations, communities and objects to
interact and communicate in ways that were not possible before," said
Chris Pearson, Partner and Global Telecom Industry Leader, IBM Global
Business Services. "Driven by the widespread growth of Internet
connectivity and the emergence of interactive online communication tools,
our century-old telecommunications industry is being redefined by this
phenomenon and is changing the way people around the world communicate in
both their personal and business lives."

    According to the IBM study, the rise of social networking is changing the
fundamentals of the telecom industry and creating a future that is being
shaped by two key trends:


--  Communication patterns are shifting from point-to-point and two-way
conversations, to many-to-many, collaborative communications; sharing
videos, photos and other multimedia content that substantially enrich the
user experience.
--  Control of communications is shifting away from the proprietary domain
of Telecom providers to open Internet platform service providers.

    
These two trends are enabling new entrants, such as Skype, Google,
Microsoft, Facebook and MySpace, to enter the communications marketplace,
undercutting the position of traditional providers and capturing a
significant share of incremental communication time. These providers
feature disruptive Internet-based business models and a diverse set of
communication tools and applications, ranging from e-mail and instant
messaging to social networking and collaboration.

    The Future of Communication

    "The option of doing nothing is not a luxury many providers can afford, as
a new ecosystem is emerging from these long-term shifts in communication
patterns and trends that will require bold, significant changes by
existing providers," said Gary Cohen, General Manager of IBM's
Communications Sector. "By adapting new capabilities like social
networking, communication service providers can develop new forms of
communications and spark interactions that breed collaboration and

    The evolving communications marketplace represents both a window of
opportunity and a challenge for telecom providers. Over the long-term,
CSPs should broaden the scope of their traditional "voice" business to
more actively encompass both point-to-point communication and many-to-many
collaborative models that include "voice, internet-based communications
and content," and align their organizations and industry partnerships
accordingly. This has strategic and transformational implications for the
business, impacting areas such as product and services offerings, skills,
platforms, revenue models and markets, among others.

networking and thought leadership. Additionally, IBM has invested heavily
in industry-specific solutions and partnerships that leverage social
networking, positioning clients to achieve results quickly. To view the

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

U.S. Steel Global Pricing Down

United States Steel Corporation (NYSE: X) is a leading steel manufacturer in the
U.S. However, rising supply from China, low demand from the automotive and
residential sector and rising commodity and labor costs lead us to rate the
stock a Hold with a six-month target price of $30.00. 

U.S. Steel Corp. reported fourth quarter 2008 net income of $308 million, or
$2.65 per diluted share, compared to fourth quarter 2007 net income of $35
million, or $0.29 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2008 net income was
increased by $76 million, or 65 cents per diluted share. 

Iconix Brands' Lasting Impression

Iconix Brand Group (NASDAQ: ICON) is a is a brand management company engaged in
licensing, marketing and providing trend direction for a diversified and growing
consumer brand portfolio. The company's brands are sold across every major
segment of retail distribution, from luxury to mass. 

As of December 31, 2007, the company owned 16 iconic consumer brands: Candie's,
Bongo, Badgley Mischka, Joe Boxer, Rampage, Mudd, London Fog, Mossimo, Ocean
Pacific/OP, Danskin, Rocawear, Cannon, Royal Velvet, Fieldcrest, Charisma and
Starter. 

Bristol-Myers Squibb Announces

This morning Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE: BMY) announced financial results for
the 4th quarter and issued 2009 financial guidance. Fourth quarter revenue of
$5.25 billion increased by 4% from the same period in 2007, and below our
estimate of $5.44 billion. Operational revenue growth remained strong, up 8%,
but the negative effects of foreign exchange [FX] impacted revenue growth by 4%.


Pharmaceutical sales increased by 4% in the quarter to $4.5 billion while the
nutritional business posted sales of $707 million, up 6% from the 4th quarter of
2007. U.S. pharmaceutical sales increased by 13% in the quarter while
international pharmaceutical sales fell 9%, primarily as a result of an 8% FX
headwind. 

Pfizer Lowered to a Hold

We believe Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) continues to face an uphill battle in growing
its top-line given the company's sheer size and lack of a significant pipeline.
Near-term earnings growth will come in the form of cost-cutting and share
repurchases. 

The Wyeth (NYSE: WYE) deal will bring additional size and further opportunity to
cut costs, but little in the way of revenue growth. The Lipitor patent
expiration in 2011 remains a concern.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co plans to lay off 200 people at its ABC division, a Disney executive familiar with the situation said, underscoring the media industry's struggle with sliding ad sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The media giant intends to also freeze 200 vacant jobs, resulting in an overall, 5 percent reduction of Disney-ABC TV Group's workforce of about 6,500 to 7,000, said the Disney source, who declined to be identified because the cuts had not been made public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney said last week it planned to combine its two ABC divisions -- ABC Entertainment and ABC Studios -- into one umbrella organization, hoping to streamline the twin business units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After months of making hard decisions across our businesses to help us adjust to a weakening economy, we're now faced with the harsh reality of having to eliminate jobs in some areas," Anne Sweeney, co-chair of Disney-Media Networks and president of Disney-ABC Television, said in a memo sent to workers and obtained by Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This was not an easy decision, nor one made lightly.

Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
After being smacked with a downgrade yesterday, Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:
XOM) fell victim again today to another bout of bearish brokerage action.
Specifically, UBS dropped its opinion on the shares from "buy" to "neutral"
yesterday, and today Goldman Sachs lowered its rating from "buy to "neutral,"
removed the oil mogul from its Americas Buy List, and slashed its 6-month price
target from $75 to $70. 

The firm said that it continues to see downside risk to oil prices in the near
future. "We continue to have a favorable longer-term view of the company and
believe the stock should provide steady, above-market returns over the long run.
However, as we get closer to the bottom of the energy cycle we continue to
transition our top picks into select higher-beta stocks and away from defensive
stocks like Exxon," it reported.

&lt;p&gt;Employees and Retirees Donate Time and Money
IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation announced today that together with 650 Dallas-area
employees and retirees, more than $1.5 million in contributions has been pledged
to the United Way of Metropolitan Dallas as a part of the 2008 campaign. 

For several years, ExxonMobil has been the largest per capita donor to the
Dallas campaign, donating more than $8.7 million since 2002. In addition to
providing financial support, more than 200 ExxonMobil employees gave a gift of
their time by volunteering at 12 North Texas non-profit agencies during the
United Way`s Day of Caring. 

"Giving back to our community is a high priority for ExxonMobil and our
employees," said Donald Humphreys, senior vice president and treasurer of Exxon
Mobil Corporation. 

"Supporting the United Way not only allows us to work alongside our colleagues
to make a difference in our city, it also gives us an opportunity to interact
with the organizations that benefit from our contributions. It is exciting to
watch employees become actively involved in the Day of Caring projects, and then
to see them return to the same agencies year after year." 

"We are truly grateful to ExxonMobil for its continued support of the United
Way," said Gary Godsey, Chief Executive Officer of the United Way of
Metropolitan Dallas. 

"As more individuals and families in our community experience need, the demand
on resources grows. This year, ExxonMobil employees have again stepped up and
generously donated their time and resources to the United Way community." 

ExxonMobil employees have made up one of the largest single corporate volunteer
groups in the Day of Caring, and this year`s event, held in September, marked
ExxonMobil`s highest employee participation to date. Activities included serving
lunch and dinner to the homeless at The Salvation Army; spending time with
elderly clients at Senior Source; and reading books and newscasts for the
visually impaired at Reading and Radio Resource. ExxonMobil employees also
volunteered at Camp Summit, Child Care Group, Citizens Development Center,
Collin County Children`s Advocacy Center, GRACE, Nexus Recovery Center,
PediPlace, St. Philip`s School and Community Center, and Special Care and Career
Services. 

The agencies are also eligible to receive grants from ExxonMobil through the
corporation`s Volunteer Involvement Program, which encourages employees,
retirees and other eligible participants to actively contribute their time and
talent to nonprofit organizations by providing contributions on the employees'
behalf. Also contributing to ExxonMobil`s campaign total were the proceeds of a
golf tournament and a silent auction. 

The 2008 campaign results were a slight increase over 2007, when ExxonMobil
raised more than $1.4 million for the United Way in Metropolitan Dallas and
Tarrant counties. ExxonMobil employees volunteered nearly 22,000 hours in the
DFW area during 2007, resulting in more than $234,000 in grants awarded to area
organizations through the Volunteer Involvement Program.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms the 'AAA/V1+' ratings assigned to JP Morgan Prime Money
Market Fund, a money market fund managed by JP Morgan Investment Management,
Inc. (JPMIM). The affirmation is a result of Fitch's annual review of the fund
and is based on the high credit quality of the funds' assets and the
capabilities of JPMIM as investment advisor. As of Jan. 7, 2009, the portfolio
had approximately $150.4 billion in total assets under management. 

The JP Morgan Prime Money Market Fund aims to provide the highest possible level
of current income while still maintaining liquidity and preserving capital. As
of Jan. 7, 2009, the fund was the world's largest money market fund and
benefited from high levels of overnight and one-month asset maturities in order
to accommodate substantial asset flow. As of the same date, 32% of total assets
were invested in bank certificates of deposit, 28% were in commercial paper,
both asset-backed (ABCP) and unsecured, 21% were in time deposits, 8% were in
securities issued by U.S. government agencies, 6% were in overnight repurchase
agreements and 5% were in corporate notes. 

The fund invests in ABCP programs sponsored by large money center banks as well
as non-banking organizations. Eligible ABCP programs include conduits backed by
pools of receivables as well as high quality debt securities and hybrid
programs. In addition to liquidity support facilities associated with such ABCP
conduits, the portfolios benefit, albeit on a temporary basis, from the
liquidity afforded to ABCP programs under the terms of the Asset-Backed
Commercial Paper Money Market Fund Liquidity Facility. 

The fund maintains a high credit quality by investing in securities rated at
least 'A/F1' by Fitch or being of a comparable credit quality by other global
rating agencies. In addition, the fund continues to participate in the U.S.
Treasury Department's Temporary Guarantee Program for Money Market Funds. Under
the term of the program, only shareholders on records as of the close of
business as of Sept. 19, 2008 may benefit from such guarantee to receive $1.00
for each share held in the fund on that day. As of Jan. 7, 2009 the fund
portfolio's weighted-average maturity was 46 days. 

JPMIM is a wholly-owned subsidiary of JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (rated 'AA-/F1+' by
Fitch). The firm manages assets on behalf of institutions and individuals
worldwide through a variety of equity, fixed income, cash management and
alternative investment products. Fitch views JPMIM's investment advisory
capabilities, resource commitment, operational controls, corporate governance,
and compliance procedures as consistent with the rating assigned to the fund. 

Fitch will publish the fund's credit profile on its website www.fitchratings.com
in the near future. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, www.fitchratings.com. Published ratings, criteria and
methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance
and other relevant policies and procedures are also available from the 'Code of
Conduct' section of this site.

&lt;p&gt;  MUMBAI, INDIA, Jan 29 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it will integrate the end-to-end
information technology (IT) operations of IDEA Cellular, a leading
telecom operator, in two service areas of Punjab and Karnataka in India.
Through the acquisition of Spice Communications, IDEA Cellular has
recently launched its services in the two areas with a subscriber base of
approximately four million.

    The scope of the eight-year agreement, signed in December 2008, includes
integration, transition and migration of existing Spice applications,
hardware, packages and products to the IDEA Transformed Applications
platform. As part of the deal, IBM will manage all IT operations and
services for IDEA's business in Punjab and Karnataka. In addition, IBM
will migrate the IT help desk services to its state-of-the-art centralized
helpdesk in Pune.

    The complete integration, transition and migration of the IT operations
and business processes of Spice Communications with IDEA is expected to be
completed within 27 months and is valued at US$19.2 million (Rs. 86
crores). After completing the transition, IBM will manage IT operations in
the two service areas, under the existing outsourcing services contract
with IDEA.

    "IBM has showcased in-depth knowledge and expertise in managing and
augmenting IDEA's IT infrastructure and business processes," said Mr.
Prakash Paranjape, Chief Information Officer, IDEA Cellular. "Our
experience with IBM over the last two years gives us confidence that the
two new service areas will be integrated seamlessly into the IDEA
network."

    The deal builds on the existing 10-year business transformation pact that
IBM had signed with IDEA Cellular in March 2007 to integrate, innovate and
transform IDEA's business processes and IT infrastructure. The pact is
designed on an innovative risk-reward sharing model that is based on a
shared revenue arrangement. It covered all of IDEA's existing operations,
expansion into new circles and potential new additions. In June 2007, IBM
signed another 10-year contract to deploy, integrate, innovate and
transform IDEA's Interactive Voice Response Self-Service project.

    Commenting on the extended partnership, Ashish Kumar, IBM Vice President,
Client Services in India and Southeast Asia, said, "This agreement further
strengthens our relationship with IDEA Cellular. The integration of Spice
Communication into IDEA Cellular's IT infrastructure will help showcase
some of the best practices and deep domain knowledge within IBM. This will
allow IDEA to provide its stakeholders with greater value, scalability and
service delivery innovation. We are delighted to extend this partnership

&lt;p&gt;Partnership Brings Exciting New Incentive to Increase Recycling
CHARLOTTE, N.C.--(Business Wire)--
If you live in Mecklenburg County, you have a chance to be rewarded-just for
doing the right thing! 

Charlotte-based Coca-Cola Consolidated, the City of Charlotte, Mecklenburg
County, and six Mecklenburg County Towns (Matthews, Pineville, Mint Hill,
Davidson, Huntersville, Cornelius), and Harris Teeter today announced a new
partnership designed to increase recycling throughout the area. Recycle and Win
is a public/private initiative designed to reduce the amount of waste sent to
landfills. 

The program will kick-off on Monday, February 2, 2009 and will run for a year.
Coca-Cola is sending an educational mailer to all 271,000 single-family
households in Mecklenburg County that features the Do`s and Don`ts of recycling,
along with an opportunity to win a $50 Harris Teeter gift card simply for doing
the right thing-recycling and recycling the right way! The educational mailer
contains a sticker, which residents should place on their red `Curb It`
recycling bins in order to win. If they are spotted recycling-and recycling the
right way-they could be rewarded. 

"The beauty of this program is its simplicity," said Jake Wilson, Executive
Director of program partner Keep Mecklenburg Beautiful. "All the public has to
do is place the weather-resistant sticker provided by Coca-Cola on their
recycling bin, recycle materials properly and place the recycling bin with the
sticker facing the street. If the Coca-Cola Recycling Prize Patrol spots their
stickered bin, they could win a $50 Harris Teeter gift card." 

Edwin Peacock, At-Large Charlotte City Council Member and Chairman of the
Environmental Committee, said, "This is an exciting partnership that can really
make a difference in reducing the amount of waste material going to the
landfill. As our community continues to grow, we need innovative solutions such
as the Recycle and Win program to help extend the life of our landfill. This
helps the environment and saves tax dollars, as well." 

"Coca-Cola is proud to sponsor this worthy initiative," said Lauren Steele, Vice
President Corporate Affairs, Coca-Cola Bottling Company. "We want to make
recycling a rewarding experience, and what better way to encourage people to
recycle than by giving them an opportunity to win! All of this is part of our
Global Live Positively campaign." Steele, a long-term proponent of recycling,
believes a re-launch campaign for Mecklenburg County`s curbside recycling
program definitely is needed. "With so many people moving to the Charlotte area
over the last 10 years, it is necessary to educate new residents and remind all
the others how to recycle properly," he said. 

The Coca-Cola Prize Patrol will be visiting Mecklenburg County communities
starting in early February and plans to award (10) $50 Harris Teeter Gift Cards
a week for a total of 520 prizes throughout the year. Coca-Cola has set up a
toll free number -- 866-393-2146 -- to answer questions and supply information
on the program. In addition, information is available at www.cokecharlotte.com. 

"Rewards like these are instrumental in building positive recycling habits,"
said Rod Antolock, Executive Vice President of Operations and Merchandising for
Harris Teeter. "I know our fellow citizens will take advantage of this campaign.
I speak on behalf of the entire Harris Teeter family when I say we are very
proud to be a part of Recycle and Win."

&lt;p&gt;"Much of our 2009 spending continues to be on large, multiyear projects aimed at increasing energy supplies to meet global demand and also improving operating efficiency and reliability," Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Dave O'Reilly said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy companies, hit by steep declines in crude oil and natural gas prices and fallout from the global credit crisis, have had to adopt a cautious view on spending for 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For example ConocoPhillips (COP.N), the third-largest U.S. oil company, slashed its 2009 spending 38 percent and said it will cut about 1,300 jobs, while Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), the world's largest publicly traded company, plans to stick to its 5-year $125 billion spending plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crude oil futures prices have fallen about 70 percent from their peak of over $147 per barrel, while natural gas prices have tumbled 67 percent from summer highs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UPSTREAM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Upstream, or exploration and production, spending was estimated at $17.5 billion and the downstream, or refining and marketing, budget was set at $4.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big investments are planned for deepwater exploration in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, development of the Frade Field in Brazil, development of the Agbami and Usan deepwater fields off Nigeria and the construction of liquefied natural gas facilities in Angola, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its refining and marketing arm, Chevron said $2 billion is budgeted for projects in the United States, which includes spending on improvements to the company's refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron plans to fund projects at its refineries in Mississippi and California, and its 50 percent-owned GS Caltex affiliate is also expected to continue development work on upgrading of its Yeosu refining complex in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in the 2009 program are $1.8 billion of expenditures by affiliates, which do not require cash outlays by Chevron's consolidated companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"About 10 percent of the budget is for large, one-time payments related to upstream production concessions outside the United States," O'Reilly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron fell 2 percent, or $1.49, to $72.30 on the New York Stock Exchange, in line with a 2 percent drop in the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of oil companies .OIX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Driver, with additional reporting by Steve James in New York; editing by John Wallace and Gerald E.

upgrading of its Yeosu refining complex in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Included in the 2009 program are $1.8 billion of
expenditures by affiliates, which do not require cash outlays
by Chevron's consolidated companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "About 10 percent of the budget is for large, one-time
payments related to upstream production concessions outside
the United States," O'Reilly said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Chevron fell 2 percent, or $1.49, to $72.30 on
the New York Stock Exchange, in line with a 2 percent drop in

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Days after Pfizer said it would buy Wyeth for $68 billion, Pfizer shares fell to nearly a 12-year low and some shareholders are questioning the wisdom of the planned union.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer on Monday said it would pay $50.19 -- $33 in cash and 0.985 share of its stock -- for each Wyeth share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pfizer's stock has fallen 10 percent since news of the merger talks leaked out early on Friday -- including a 2.4 percent decline on Wednesday -- which would now allow $48.21 for Wyeth shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People seem underwhelmed by the deal, maybe thinking Pfizer made a safe move with Wyeth rather than trying to shoot the lights out with a more aggressive company better able to produce blockbuster drugs," said Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of OakBrook Investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Pfizer shareholders may be bailing because the deal will force the drugmaker to halve its dividend, whose rich 8 percent yield has eased the pain as company profit and shares have steadily fallen in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth's Prevnar childhood vaccine and Enbrel arthritis drug -- both big blockbusters -- will likely help prevent Pfizer earnings from crashing when its $12 billion-a-year Lipitor cholesterol drug faces generic competition in late 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth reported Prevnar sales of $2.7 billion and Enbrel sales of $3.8 billion for 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jankovskis, whose firm in Lisle, Illinois, holds about 1 million shares of Pfizer and 250,000 shares of Wyeth, noted Pfizer expects flat earnings through 2012 and there is no certainty profit will grow significantly soon after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors will need fairly extreme patience," he said. "Maybe the best thing is not to go through with the Wyeth deal. Then Pfizer would be able to maintain their dividend and perhaps look for a better opportunity that would excite investors more."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wyeth shares on Wednesday closed at $43.85, a bit higher than their closing price on Monday, after the deal was announced. Although they have risen 13 percent since January 22, the day before news of the merger talks leaked out, shares remain far lower than the 29 percent premium offered by Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There could be some pushback here from those that think Wyeth may be worth more than Pfizer is paying for it, especially when you consider Wyeth's stock was close to $50 back in July," said Russell Croft, portfolio manager of Baltimore-based asset manager Croft-Leominster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Croft, whose company holds more shares of Pfizer than Wyeth, said he's inclined to support the deal which is slated to close in the second half of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At first glance it looks like a pretty good combination because, with Lipitor running out, Wyeth would help fill Pfizer's drug pipeline," he said. "And Pfizer could cut out a lot of costs, including back-office expenses and probably sales positions," after the deal closes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jon Fisher, portfolio manager of Fifth Third Asset Management in Minneapolis, panned the deal, although he predicted ultimately it will not be deemed as harmful to Pfizer as its costly acquisitions of rival drugmakers Warner-Lambert and Pharmacia Corp over the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's neutral at best; I don't think they'll generate a great return on the capital they're investing in this deal," he said, noting that Pfizer -- the world's largest drugmaker -- will get substantially bigger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't see what's going to re-invigorate the company. They're just making themselves very large, and it's very difficult to grow a huge business like that," Fisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What they'll add to the company will help prevent a big earnings drop, but it doesn't enhance Pfizer's growth profile," Fisher said. He said Prevnar and Enbrel will not be big enough to greatly help Pfizer, whose current array of products generate $48 billion in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moreover, the deal has dealt a setback for Wyeth's vaccine business, by prompting Wyeth to end its own negotiations to acquire Dutch vaccine maker Crucell, Fisher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite longstanding investor pain and lingering worries about Pfizer, some of its stockholders think continued patience will yet pay off, including David Katz of asset manager Matrix Asset Advisors in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Wyeth deal is not a panacea, but moves Pfizer in a better direction by alleviating the Lipitor problem," said Katz, who is co-chief investment officer of Matrix. "It flattens the earnings to get back to growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares now trade at 6.5 times annual earnings per share, less than half their traditional price-to-earnings ratio, Katz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But shares could eventually double if the P/E goes back to its historic average," which he said could happen once earnings growth returns to a high-single-digit percentage range.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer will not be a robust 20 percent-a-year grower like a biotech," he said, but can nevertheless amply reward investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Burnick, director of research with Weiss Capital Management in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, also plans to remain patient. (Pfizer) "has been kind of dead money for the last five years. That kind of apathy about a stock tends to create a good value."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're still bullish on it now," said Burnick, who predicted Wyeth's drugs and expertise will benefit Pfizer's drug development. "We have no intention at this time of parting ways with the company."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 29 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said its
2009 capital spending program totals $22.8 billion, unchanged
from 2008, with about 75 percent going toward oil and gas

SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced a $22.8 billion capital and
exploratory spending program for 2009, unchanged from the level of expenditures
in 2008. Included in the 2009 program are $1.8 billion of expenditures by

companies. 

"Our company`s financial strength enables the funding of attractive investments
consistent with our long-term strategies," said Chairman and CEO Dave O`Reilly. 

O`Reilly said about 75 percent of the 2009 spending program is for upstream oil

associated with the company`s downstream businesses that manufacture, transport
and sell gasoline, diesel fuel and other refined products.

increasing energy supplies to meet global demand and also improving operating

Upstream - Exploration and Production

Spending of $17.5 billion is planned for exploration, production and natural
gas-related projects. A significant portion relates to development projects that
build on the company`s successful and focused exploration results in recent
years, including opportunities in the deepwater U.S. Gulf of Mexico, western
Africa and the Gulf of Thailand. Funding also is earmarked for further appraisal
and evaluation of other prospective areas in the world`s major hydrocarbon
basins, including Northwest Australia. 

"Our upstream investments are aimed at finding and developing oil and gas
resources to increase production and help supply the energy needs of markets
around the world," said George Kirkland, Chevron`s executive vice president of
Upstream and Gas. "Start-ups of major projects in 2009 are expected to include
Tahiti in the Gulf of Mexico, Tombua-Landana offshore Angola and Frade offshore
Brazil. We also anticipate significant production increases from recent
start-ups at Agbami offshore Nigeria and Blind Faith in the Gulf of Mexico and
from expansion activity at Tengiz in Kazakhstan." 

Major upstream spending in 2009 includes activities in the following areas:

* U.S. Gulf of Mexico - deepwater exploration and development, including Perdido
and Jack- St. Malo. 
* Brazil - development of the Frade Field. 
* Nigeria - development of the Agbami and Usan deepwater fields. 
* Angola - development of Block 14 assets, including Tombua-Landana, and
construction of LNG facilities. 
* Western Australia - development of Gorgon, Wheatstone and North West Shelf
offshore natural gas resources, including LNG facilities. 
* Thailand - development of the Platong Gas II project offshore Thailand. 
* Indonesia - northern expansion of the Duri Field steamflood project. 
* China - one-time payment and initial development of the Chuandongbei gas
field. 
* Middle East - one-time payment for concession extension and development in the
Partitioned Neutral Zone of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait.

Downstream - Refining, Marketing and Transportation

Capital spending of $4.3 billion in 2009 is budgeted for global downstream
operations, including $2.0 billion for projects in the United States. Included
in the U.S. spending is $1.5 billion for improvements to the refinery network. 

Downstream expenditures are aimed at enhancing the company`s ability to safely
and reliably manufacture transportation fuels from a variety of feedstocks,
increasing energy efficiency and providing environmental benefits. 

Outlays in 2009 include projects in the company`s refineries in Mississippi and
California. The company`s 50 percent-owned GS Caltex affiliate is also expected
to continue development work on upgrading of its Yeosu refining complex in South
Korea. In support of projects to commercialize the company`s large natural gas
resource base, downstream expenditures will be made in 2009 on gas-to-liquids
manufacturing facilities. 

Chemicals and Other

Expenditures of approximately $1.0 billion in 2009 are budgeted for chemicals,
technology, power generation and other corporate activities. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world`s leading integrated energy companies.
We have approximately 60,000 employees and conduct business across the entire

&lt;p&gt;DAVOS, Switzerland (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co has "plenty of capital" and wants governments to stop talking about nationalizing banks, its CEO said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan would be fine if we stopped talking about (the) damn nationalization of banks ... we've got plenty of capital," Jamie Dimon said at the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On January 15, JP Morgan reported a 76-percent fall in fourth-quarter profit as it wrote down bad loans, signaling that even the bank that has avoided the worst of the credit crunch is struggling with the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Dimon called the results "very disappointing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Underlining the bank's confidence, Dimon said JP Morgan had lent $150 billion in the last 90 days including $50 billion in the interbank market, also to European and British banks, but added: "It's scary because at the end of the day you have to survive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm hoping by the end of the year we're coming out of the crisis," he told journalists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said more acquisitions were unlikely as JP Morgan was busy absorbing recent buys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon admitted bankers had done "some really stupid things" but he also hit out at policy makers and regulators, adding that the Basel II capital rules has flaws and needed to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I haven't yet seen people get all the right people in a room, close the damn door and come out with a solution," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. and other countries are considering setting up a so-called "bad bank" to mop up the toxic assets of stricken lenders. It would take billions of dollars of the worst assets off banks' balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon welcomed the idea: "It's all in the execution. If it's executed well, set up properly, it would be good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also supported creating a clearing house for credit default swaps - insurance-like protection against defaults or restructuring - although he disputed the view that a lack of regulation of the CDS market caused the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon questioned China's tendency to blame the U.S. policy of running a large current account deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was an imbalance that both benefited from and both are losing from. It's kind of immature and childish to act like one was to blame. One was the other side of the coin," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Emma Thomasson; editing by Guy Dresser)&lt;/p&gt;

the Basel II capital rules has flaws and needed to be adjusted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I haven't yet seen people get all the right people in a
room, close the damn door and come out with a solution," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. and other countries are considering setting up a
so-called "bad bank" to mop up the toxic assets of stricken
lenders. It would take billions of dollars of the worst assets
off banks' balance sheets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon welcomed the idea: "It's all in the execution. If it's
executed well, set up properly, it would be good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also supported creating a clearing house for credit
default swaps - insurance-like protection against defaults or
restructuring - although he disputed the view that a lack of
regulation of the CDS market caused the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon questioned China's tendency to blame the U.S. policy
of running a large current account deficit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was an imbalance that both benefited from and both are
losing from. It's kind of immature and childish to act like one
was to blame. One was the other side of the coin," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  For full coverage, blogs and TV from Davos go to

&lt;p&gt;DAVOS, Switzerland Jan 29 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co
(JPM.N) has "plenty of capital" and wants governments to stop
talking about nationalising banks, its CEO said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan would be fine if we stopped talking about (the)
damn nationalisation of banks ... we've got plenty of capital,"
Jamie Dimon said, at the annual meeting of the World Economic
Forum in Davos, Switzerland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Jan. 15, JP Morgan reported a 76-percent fall in
fourth-quarter profit as it wrote down bad loans, signalling
that even the bank that has avoided the worst of the credit
crunch is struggling with the recession. [ID:nN1491543]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the time, Dimon called the results "very disappointing".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Jan 30 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), in its
latest research setback, said on Friday it stopped a late stage
study of an experimental drug to treat advanced pancreatic
cancer after an independent monitoring board found no evidence
that it prolongs survival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The drug, axitinib, is still being studied for kidney
cancer in late stage clinical trials, and is in mid-stage
trials for non-small cell lung cancer, colon cancer and other
tumor types.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axitinib had shown promise against notoriously tough to
treat advanced pancreatic cancer in combination with
chemotherapy in mid-stage trials, and the company decided to
proceed with larger, more expensive Phase III trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These results were disappointing, given the trend toward
prolonged survival seen in a Phase II study of axitinib in this
extremely difficult-to-treat patient population," Mace
Rothenberg, head of Pfizer's oncology business unit, said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it has notified all clinical trial
investigators involved in the study and regulatory agencies of
the findings and recommends patients discontinue treatment with
axitinib.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, said it would try to
find other compounds in its developmental pipeline that can be
tested against pancreatic cancer, which has few treatment
options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the company has endured a long list of research
disappointments in recent years as it struggles to find a way
to replace the cholesterol fighter Lipitor before the more than
$12 billion a year drug goes off patent in late 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The dearth of important new medicines coming out of its
research labs is one of the primary reasons Pfizer decided to
buy smaller rival Wyeth for $68 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its shares, which closed down 3.5 percent at $14.48 on
Friday, are hovering just above a 12-year low.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc announced today the discontinuation of a Phase III study of its
investigational agent axitinib for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer.
Based on an interim analysis, an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB)
found no evidence of improvement in the primary endpoint of survival in patients
treated with axitinib and gemcitabine, compared to gemcitabine alone, the
current standard of care for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. 

"These results were disappointing, given the trend towards prolonged survival
seen in a Phase II study of axitinib in this extremely difficult-to-treat
patient population," said Mace L. Rothenberg, M.D., senior vice president,
clinical development and medical affairs, Pfizer`s Oncology Business Unit.
"However, we remain steadfastly committed to continued investigation of axitinib
in renal cell carcinoma where it is currently in Phase III for 2nd line
treatment." 

The Company has notified all clinical trial investigators involved in the study
and regulatory agencies of these interim findings and recommends patients
discontinue treatment with axitinib. Pfizer encourages investigators to
determine the best course of action for their patients. The full data set from
this study is being analyzed and more details will be presented at an upcoming
medical meeting. 

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer deaths in the United
States. In the past 20 years, there have been only 2 widely approved treatments,
with many other drugs failing in Phase III trials. 

"We have a robust pipeline of compounds in clinical development and will
determine if one or more of those compounds can move forward in pancreatic
cancer," said Dr. Rothenberg. "We also are continuing to evaluate axitinib in
Phase II trials in other tumor types, including advanced non-small cell lung
cancer and colorectal cancer." 

Axitinib is an oral and selective inhibitor of VEGF receptors 1, 2 and 3.
Axitinib is an investigational agent and has not yet been approved by the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration or other global regulatory agencies.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings affirms and assigns Rating Outlooks to J.P. Morgan Commercial
Mortgage Finance Corp.'s mortgage pass-through certificates, series 1997-C5, as
follows: 

--Interest-only class X at 'AAA'; Outlook Stable; 

--$51.7 million class F at 'A-'; Outlook Stable. 

Fitch does not rate the $8 million class D, $15.5 million class E, $36.2 million
class G or the $370 thousand class H certificates. Classes A-1, A-2, A-3, B and
C have paid in full. 

The classes are affirmed due to limited paydown since the last Fitch review. As
of the January 2009 distribution date, the pool's aggregate certificate balance
has been reduced 89% to $111.7 million from $1.03 billion at issuance.
Thirty-five loans remain in the pool. 

The largest loan in the pool is an anchored retail property in Reston, VA (19%).
As of June 2008, occupancy was 100% with a debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) of
1.85 times (x), compared to issuance DSCR of 1.28x. 

Currently there are six Fitch loans of concern (6%) due to declining occupancy
and/or DSCRs less than 1.0x. The largest loan of concern is a multifamily
property in Clarksville, TN (1.4%), which reported a third-quarter 2008 DSCR
less than 1.0x, and September 2008 occupancy of 38%. 

Three loans, 7.8% of the deal, mature in 2009, and no loans mature in 2010. The
weighted average year-end 2007 DSCR for the loans that mature in 2009 is 1.73x.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Procter  Gamble Co (PG.N) lowered its expectations for the year on Friday after sales slowed in its second quarter, the latest signal that consumers and retailers are cutting spending in the recession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of PG, the world's largest consumer products company that sells everything from Tide laundry detergent to Gillette razors, fell as much as 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're in a very volatile and obviously uncertain period and it's going to take months and quarters for that to sort out," Chairman and Chief Executive A.G. Lafley said during a conference call. As recently as December, Lafley had referred to the company as recession-resistant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investors are kind of racing to the exits here," said BMO Capital Markets analyst Connie Maneaty. She said the market could be reacting to the possibility that PG's volume growth may not recover soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG earned $5 billion, or $1.58 per share, in its fiscal second quarter, compared with a profit of $3.27 billion, or 98 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG had forecast earnings of $1.58 to $1.63 per share. Thirteen analysts, on average, expected it to earn $1.58 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. The results include a gain of 63 cents per share from the sale of its Folgers coffee business to JM Smucker Co (SJM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings from continuing operations totaled 94 cents per share, compared with an average forecast of 99 cents per share, based on six analysts polled by Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG lowered its earnings and sales forecast for the fiscal year ending in June, adding to the list of household products makers tempering expectations as they deal with the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N) forecast a lower-than-expected profit and Colgate-Palmolive Co (CL.N) said it was comfortable with analysts' expectations, which were below its prior forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG expects fiscal 2009 sales to be flat to down 4 percent. Organic sales, which exclude the impact of acquisitions, divestitures and foreign exchange, are now expected to rise 2 to 5 percent, down from an earlier forecast of 4 percent to 6 percent growth that PG stood by as recently as December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Colgate forecast volume growth in its various geographic regions for the current quarter and year, PG said organic volume should fall 2 percent to 3 percent this quarter and be flat to down 2 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Colgate for the most part has medium priced products and you really can't do without toothpaste.

While such costs will still be higher this year, PG now expects to incur slightly less than $2 billion in incremental costs, down from a forecast of about $2 billion it issued in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lafley said he does not expect to see a return to price wars in the industry if commodity costs come down and consumers remain under pressure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter sales fell 3 percent to $20.37 billion, while volume dropped 3 percent. Organic sales rose 2 percent. On a net basis, sales fell in every unit except for baby and family care, where sales rose 3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG said it is comfortable with analysts' current consensus estimate of $4.29 per share for the year, which ends in June. PG lowered its own guidance to a range of $4.20 to $4.35 per share from a range of $4.28 to $4.38 per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PG forecast third quarter earnings of 78 cents to 86 cents per share, including Folgers-related restructuring charges. It said total sales should fall 2 percent to 7 percent in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of PG, a component of the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI, were down 5.9 percent at $54.77 in midafternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jessica Wohl; Editing by Derek Caney and Gunna Dickson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Oil giants Exxon Mobil Corp and Chevron Corp posted higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Friday as refining profits helped offset a steep decline in crude oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded company, said fourth-quarter earnings fell by a third, but full-year profit of $45.2 billion set a new company and U.S. record.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The results speak for themselves," said Fred Burke, president of Johnston Lemon Asset Management in Washington, D.C. "I still think Exxon is a low-cost producer, and at some point the price of oil will increase. They are doing all the right things right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sector has been hit hard by the twin blows of plunging energy prices and the credit crunch. But the financial depth of the top oil companies means they can spend through the slump, having learned a lesson from past cycles, when under-investment left them exposed once oil demand recovered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's fourth-quarter net profit fell to $7.8 billion, or $1.55 per share, from $11.7 billion, or $2.13 per share, a year earlier. Analysts, on average, had expected $1.45 a share from the Irving, Texas-based giant, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales fell 27 percent to $84.7 billion, but Exxon had $31 billion in cash at the end of the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company will spend $7 billion buying back stock this quarter, down from $8 billion in the fourth quarter. Chevron, its nearest U.S. rival, said it would halt buybacks this quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Patricia Yarrington, the new chief financial officer of San Ramon, California-based Chevron, said her priorities were the dividend, the capital program and staying flexible. "So we've always seen the share repurchase program as sort of the discretionary part of that," she said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's profit rose to $4.9 billion, or $2.44 per share, from $4.88 billion, or $2.32 per share, helped by $600 million from an asset swap in which it received stock for a producing field. Excluding that one-time gain, it earned $2.23 per share, down from a year earlier but topping analysts' average forecast of $1.79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, European major Royal Dutch Shell Plc said profit fell 28 percent to $4.79 billion. Britain's BP Plc is due to report earnings on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REFINERY SURPRISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's refining operations benefited from the drop in crude prices versus the price for products such as gasoline and diesel, widening its profit margins and boosting quarterly profit from refining by $147 million to $2.41 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in oil and gas production, profit tumbled $2.57 billion to $5.63 billion as crude prices averaged about $59 a barrel in the fourth quarter, down from $90 a year earlier. Including natural gas, production fell to 4.11 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (boed) from 4.25 million a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Exxon's production decline was less than what it has been in previous quarters," said Brian Youngberg, senior energy analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. "That's been a concern so far this year. But hopefully the ramp-up in capital spending over the last few years will bear fruit down the road."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's 2008 exploration budget was $26.1 billion, up 25 percent from 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's production from fell about 70,000 boed to 2.54 million boed, largely from reductions in the Gulf of Mexico due to the hurricanes that hit the region in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That knocked down earnings from production by 35 percent to $3.15 billion, but the decline was more than offset by a jump in refining profit to $2.08 billion from $204 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron aims to produce 2.63 million boed in 2009, assuming oil at $50 a barrel, but said it would not meet a 3 percent compound annual production growth goal for 2005 to 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares rose 1.3 percent to $77.80 in late trade on the New York Stock Exchange, while Chevron rose 0.4 percent to $70.90.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked by an analyst about challenges for Chevron, Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly identified growing government pressure for carbon management as a leading one -- political pressure also keenly felt by Texas-based Exxon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rep. Edward Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat who chairs key energy panels in the House of Representatives, criticized Exxon for buying back shares and paying bonuses instead of investing in "job-creating industries like renewable energy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If Exxon won't do its part to help recover our economy by investing money back into consumers and into the American economy, we will have to compel them to do so," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Matt Daily in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Updates share prices, adds analyst comment, earnings data)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Anna Driver&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, Jan 30 (Reuters) - Oil giants Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N) posted higher-than-expected
quarterly earnings on Friday as profits from refineries helped
offset a steep decline in crude oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, the world's largest publicly traded company, said

D.C. "I still think Exxon is a low-cost producer, and at some
point the price of oil will increase. They are doing all the
right things right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The energy sector has been hit hard by the twin blows of a
selloff in oil and gas prices and the global credit crunch, but
the largest companies like Exxon and Chevron, which have
billions in cash, are well suited to weather the downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon has lots of strength and flexibility," said Brian
Youngberg, senior energy analyst with Edward Jones in St.
Louis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Irving, Texas-based Exxon said net profit in the quarter
was $7.8 billion, or $1.55 per share, compared with $11.7
billion, or $2.13 per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts on average had expected $1.45 per share, according
to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales fell 27 percent to $84.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said it plans to spend about $7 billion buying back
its stock in the current quarter, down from $8 billion spent in
the 2008 fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon,
said quarterly profit rose to $4.9 billion, or $2.44 per share,
from $4.88 billion, or $2.32 per share, helped by a one-time
gain of $600 million from an asset swap in which it received
stock for a producing field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding that one-time gain, Chevron earned $2.23 per
share, down from a year earlier but topping analysts' average
forecast of $1.79.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REFINERY SURPRISE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's refining operations benefited from the decline in
crude oil prices versus the price for products such as gasoline
and diesel, widening its profit margins and boosting quarterly
profits from refining by $147 million to $2.41 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But in oil and gas production, profit tumbled $2.57 billion
to $5.63 billion as average crude oil prices fell to about $59
a barrel in the fourth quarter from about $90 a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil production fell 45,000 barrels per day to 2.47 million
bpd, largely because of assets sales and cuts in OPEC quotas in
countries where Exxon operates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Including natural gas, Exxon's total production fell to
4.11 million barrels of oil equivalent per day from 4.25
million a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the output figures showed promise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon's production decline was less than what it has been
in previous quarters," Edward Jones' Youngberg said. "That's

barrels per day to 2.54 million barrels of oil equivalent per
day, largely from reductions in the Gulf of Mexico due to the
hurricanes that hit the region in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That knocked down earnings from its production side by 35
percent to $3.15 billion, but the decline was more than offset
by a jump in refining profit to $2.08 billion from $204
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's sales fell 28 percent to $43 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon rose 95 cents, or 1.24 percent, to $77.75
in late-morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange, while
Chevron climbed 88 cents, or 1.25 percent, to $71.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, European oil major Royal Dutch Shell Plc
(RDSa.L) said quarterly profit fell 28 percent to $4.79
billion. Britain's BP Plc (BP.L) is due to report earnings on
Feb. 3.

&lt;p&gt;  ARMONK, NY, Jan 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and iEnterprises, are working with small and mid-sized
construction companies to help them run their businesses more
intelligently by reconfiguring their customer relationship management
(CRM) systems via Software as a Service (SaaS). Hosted on IBM technology,
iEnterprises provides CRM software -- tailored to industries including
construction, pharmaceutical, legal and others -- as an affordable
service designed to allow smaller businesses to significantly increase
productivity and reduce strains on time and staffed resources.

    A Software as a Service-based offering eliminates the cost of developing,
purchasing and maintaining an in-house technology solution for its users.
IBM offers advanced hardware, software and infrastructure technologies to
help IBM Business Partners, such as iEnterprises, deliver secure and
scaleable cloud-enabled services with a wide variety of SaaS offerings.

    MAPP Construction, a Baton Rouge, Louisiana-based construction company,
uses iEnterprises' SaaS offering, Empower CRM. This software helps its
users to better manage their business and gain instant access to the
latest client interactions and company information from the office and
remotely from mobile devices.

    MAPP Construction, like other mid-sized construction companies, had relied
on basic spreadsheets for several years to keep track of multiple
customer-related activities. To handle expansion, company leaders realized
they needed a more centralized and automated system as greater risk of
human error, security measures and the inability to consolidate
information became increasing challenges.

    As a result, MAPP Construction sought an affordable, hosted CRM solution
that was not only configurable enough to handle opportunities, contacts
and other traditional CRM tasks but also able to support and streamline
extensive pre-bid requests required to help ensure that projects would be
a positive financial venture. Additionally, they required software that
could eventually be deployed behind their firewall if needed, and would
accommodate the company's mobile workforce.

    "We needed an affordable solution that was easy to use and could handle
our specific industry needs," said Derrick Jackson, systems manager, MAPP
Construction. "Empower CRM allowed us to be smart about what we wanted
from a CRM system as it was easily integrated with our IBM WebSphere
server and gave us mobile access to important information without extreme
costs and time constraints."

    By design, iEnterprises' Empower CRM is easily configurable, and MAPP's
entire implementation occurred in less than two weeks. MAPP now can
automatically grade the potential of each project bid and more easily
categorize and identify project type by industry, profitability and bid
procurement status -- even showing if the bid was invited, negotiated or
made public. These capabilities have enabled the company to get a firm
grasp on all proposals and share updates across the entire company
quickly, when changes occur. Additionally, with Empower CRM's mobile
integration, updates can be shared across the company from an employee's
BlackBerry handheld device.

    "Through our strong relationship with IBM, we have enhanced our services
and SaaS-based offerings to cater to the needs of our customers," said
John Carini, CEO of iEnterprises. "With our portfolio of CRM offerings,
we are committed to helping customers improve their sales and project
management efforts to positively affect their bottom line."

&lt;p&gt;  SEOUL,  KOREA, Jan 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) today announced that it has renewed a contract for
integrated maintenance services with the Korea Exchange (KRX). IBM has
been providing integrated maintenance services to KRX since December 2006.

    IBM is offering comprehensive maintenance and contract management services
to KRX, ranging from system hardware, software, middleware, network,
facilities and equipment. IBM provides KRX with integrated maintenance and
management for system-related services that ensures a single point of
contact to users and IT support departments.

    By standardizing and integrating infrastructure maintenance under IBM, KRX
is able to address complicated internal communication and management
challenges. This has resulted in better problem solving and error
analysis; provision of various management information on overall service
operations and maintenance; and establishment of a regular inspection
system of business situations for a more systematic decision-making
process.

    According to KRX, the integrated maintenance services of IBM have allowed
the company to adjust to the continuously changing IT environment in a
smarter way. IBM's services considerably reduced the burden on KRX's
contract management work, which is becoming more complicated each day.
This in turn helps KRX improve its cost effectiveness.

    The KRX was created in 2005 through the integration of the three Korean
spot and futures exchanges -- Korea Stock Exchange, Korea Futures Exchange
and KOSDAQ (Korea Securities Dealers Automated Quotations). To effectively
respond to the rapidly evolving changes in the highly volatile financial
market, KRX spearheaded a new-generation system migration project in 2008.
It required a partner to manage its overall system operations that consist
of technology and equipment from several vendors. KRX chose to award the
maintenance service contract to IBM over other vendors, including Hewlett
Packard, because IBM's delivery excellence exceeded KRX's expectations in
the last two years.

    Won-jong Kim, General Manager, IBM Global Technology Services in Korea,
said, "The renewal of the contract for the third consecutive year proves
that our client has trust in the integrated services of IBM. We will
continue to support KRX so that it can efficiently manage IT resources and
focus its competencies on key tasks."

    The latest contract was signed in November 2008.

&lt;p&gt;Jan 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs upgraded Boston Beer
(SAM.N) to "neutral" from "sell" and said the brewer's
attractive long-term sales prospects and potential for margin
recovery in 2010 present an interesting opportunity for
longer-minded investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of Boston Beer, the maker of Samuel Adams beers,
were up almost 9 percent in early trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We still expect volume moderation and margin degradation
in 2009, but these now appear factored into shares," analyst
Lindsay Mann wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company faces significant margin pressure due to
higherglass bottle costs and additional expenses related to a
new brewery and longer shipping distances, Mann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, long-term opportunity remains attractive as there
is significant room for revenue growth over time, given the
company's 1 percent industry share and the secular consumer
trend towards craft beer that is still intact, Mann said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the brewer were at $24.35 in morning trade on the
New York Stock Exchange. The shares have shed about 45 percent
over the past six months.

an after-tax special gain of $1,620 million from the sale of a natural gas
transportation business in Germany and after-tax special charges of $460 million
related to the Valdez litigation.

"ExxonMobil`s financial strength continued to support its disciplined capital
investment approach in the midst of a growing global economic slowdown.Capital
and exploration project spending increased to $26.1 billion in 2008, up 25% from
2007.Through these investments we continued to demonstrate our long-term focus
throughout the business cycle.

"The Corporation distributed a total of $40.1 billion to shareholders in 2008,
up 12% or $4.4 billion from 2007.This reflects a 13% increase in per share
dividends versus 2007 and an overall reduction in shares outstanding of 7.5%.

"ExxonMobil`s fourth quarter earnings excluding special items were $7,820
million, a decrease of 33% from the fourth quarter of 2007.Weaker crude oil
prices, higher operating expenses, lower chemical volumes and the impact of the
Gulf Coast hurricanes were partly offset by higher downstream margins."

FOURTH QUARTER HIGHLIGHTS

* Net income was $7,820 million, a decrease of 33% or $3,840 million from the
fourth quarter of 2007. Earnings were $570 million lower due to damage repairs
and lower volumes associated with Hurricanes Gustav and Ike. 
* Earnings per share were $1.55, a decrease of 27%. 
* Capital and exploration expenditures were $6.8 billion, up 11% from the fourth
quarter of 2007. 
* Oil-equivalent production decreased 3% from the fourth quarter of 2007.
Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and
divestments, production was down about 1%. 
* Share purchases of $8.0 billion reduced shares outstanding by 2.2%. 
* Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately $12.2 billion,
including asset sales of $1.8 billion. 
* ExxonMobil started up the offshore facilities for the Qatargas II Train 4 LNG
project in Qatar. Commissioning activities are continuing onshore, and first LNG
from the project is anticipated in the first quarter of 2009. 
* Commissioning of ExxonMobil`s South Hook LNG Terminal in the United Kingdom
progressed in the fourth quarter, with initial LNG receipt and processing
expected in the first quarter. 
* ExxonMobil announced it will invest more than $1 billion in three refineries
in the U.S. and Europe to increase the supply of cleaner burning diesel by about
six million gallons per day. The increased diesel production at these three
sites will be equivalent to the diesel produced from about four average-sized
refineries and underscores the company's ongoing commitment to meet the growing
needs of the marketplace while providing cleaner burning fuels to consumers.

Fourth Quarter 2008 vs. Fourth Quarter 2007

Upstream earnings were $5,634 million, down $2,570 million from the fourth
quarter of 2007. Lower crude oil realizations reduced earnings approximately
$3.2 billion while higher natural gas prices increased earnings about $500
million. 

On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 3% from the fourth quarter of
2007. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, OPEC quota effects and
divestments, production was down about 1%. 

Liquids production totaled 2,472 kbd (thousands of barrels per day), down 45 kbd
from the fourth quarter of 2007. Excluding the impacts of lower entitlement
volumes, OPEC quota effects and divestments, liquids production was up 1%, as
increased production from projects in west Africa and the North Sea and lower
maintenance activity more than offset field decline. 

Fourth quarter natural gas production was 9,849 mcfd (millions of cubic feet per
day), down 565 mcfd from 2007. New production volumes from project additions in
the North Sea, Qatar and Malaysia were more than offset by field decline and
lower European demand. 

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations were $699 million, $576 million lower
than the fourth quarter of 2007. Non-U.S. Upstream earnings were $4,935 million,
down $1,994 million from last year. 

Downstream earnings of $2,414 million were up $147 million from the fourth
quarter of 2007. Higher margins increased earnings by about $900 million.
Unfavorable foreign exchange, volume and mix effects and higher operating
expenses, including hurricane repair costs, reduced earnings by about $800
million. Petroleum product sales of 6,761 kbd were 364 kbd lower than last
year's fourth quarter, mainly reflecting asset sales and lower demand. 

The U.S. Downstream recorded a loss of $20 million, down $642 million from the
fourth quarter of 2007. Non-U.S. Downstream earnings of $2,434 million were $789
million higher than last year. 

Chemical earnings of $155 million were $957 million lower than the fourth
quarter of 2007. Lower volumes reduced earnings approximately $350 million,
while lower margins decreased earnings by about $300 million. Hurricane repair
costs and unfavorable foreign exchange effects also reduced earnings. Fourth
quarter prime product sales of 5,626 kt (thousands of metric tons) were 1,423 kt
lower than the prior year due to lower demand and hurricane effects. 

Corporate and financing expenses of $383 million increased by $460 million due
to net higher taxes and lower interest income. 

During the fourth quarter of 2008, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 119 million
shares of its common stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $8.8 billion.
These purchases included $8.0 billion to reduce the number of shares
outstanding, with the balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with
the company's benefit plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced from
5,087 million at the end of the third quarter to 4,976 million at the end of the
fourth quarter. Share purchases to reduce shares outstanding are currently
anticipated to equal $7.0 billion through the first quarter of 2009. Purchases
may be made in both the open market and through negotiated transactions, and may
be increased, decreased or discontinued at any time without prior notice. 

Full Year 2008 vs. Full Year 2007

Net income of $45,220 million ($8.69 per share) was a record and increased
$4,610 million from 2007. Net income for 2008 included an after-tax special gain
of $1,620 million from the sale of a natural gas transportation business in
Germany and after-tax special charges of $460 million related to the Valdez
litigation. Excluding these impacts, 2008 earnings increased by $3,450 million. 

FULL YEAR HIGHLIGHTS

* Earnings excluding special items were a record $44,060 million, up 8%. 
* Earnings per share excluding special items increased 16% to $8.47, reflecting
strong business results and the continued reduction in the number of shares
outstanding. 
* Net income was up 11% from 2007. Net income for 2008 included an after-tax
special gain of $1,620 million from the sale of a natural gas transportation
business in Germany and after-tax special charges of $460 million related to the
Valdez litigation. Net income for 2007 did not include any special items. 
* The effective income tax rate increased to 47% from 44% in 2007. 
* Oil-equivalent production decreased 6% from 2007. Excluding the impacts of
lower entitlement volumes, the Venezuela expropriation and divestments,
production was down about 3%. 
* Cash flow from operations and asset sales was approximately $65.6 billion,
including $6.0 billion from asset sales. 
* The Corporation distributed a total of $40.1 billion to shareholders in 2008,
up 12% or $4.4 billion from 2007. This reflects a 13% increase in per share
dividends versus 2007 and an overall reduction in shares outstanding of 7.5%. 
* Dividends per share of $1.55 increased 13%. 
* Capital and exploration expenditures were $26.1 billion, an increase of 25%
versus 2007.

Upstream earnings, excluding the gain related to the sale of the German natural
gas transportation business, were a record $33,782 million, up $7,285 million
from 2007. Record high crude oil and natural gas realizations increased earnings
approximately $11.8 billion. Lower sales volumes reduced earnings about $3.7
billion. Higher taxes and increased operating costs decreased earnings
approximately $1.5 billion, partially offset by favorable foreign exchange. 

On an oil-equivalent basis, production decreased 6% from last year. Excluding
the impacts of lower entitlement volumes, the Venezuela expropriation and
divestments, production was down about 3%. 

Liquids production of 2,405 kbd decreased 211 kbd from 2007. Excluding the
impacts of lower entitlement volumes, the Venezuela expropriation and
divestments, liquids production was down about 3%, as new volumes from project
additions, mainly in Africa, were more than offset by field decline. 

Natural gas production of 9,095 mcfd decreased 289 mcfd from 2007. Higher
volumes from North Sea, Malaysia and Qatar projects and higher European demand
were more than offset by field decline. 

Earnings from U.S. Upstream operations for 2008 were $6,243 million, an increase
of $1,373 million. Earnings outside the U.S., excluding the gain related to the
sale of the German natural gas transportation business, were $27,539 million,
$5,912 million higher than 2007. 

Downstream earnings of $8,151 million were $1,422 million lower than 2007. Lower
margins reduced earnings approximately $900 million as weaker refining margins
more than offset stronger marketing margins. Higher operating costs mainly
associated with planned work activity reduced earnings about $700 million while
unfavorable foreign exchange effects decreased earnings by approximately $600
million. Improved refinery operations provided a partial offset, increasing
earnings about $800 million. Petroleum product sales of 6,761 kbd decreased from
7,099 kbd in 2007, mainly reflecting asset sales and lower demand. 

U.S. Downstream earnings were $1,649 million, down $2,471 million. Non-U.S.
Downstream earnings were $6,502 million, $1,049 million higher than last year. 

Chemical earnings of $2,957 million decreased $1,606 million from 2007. Lower
margins decreased earnings approximately $1.2 billion, while lower volumes
reduced earnings by about $500 million. Prime product sales of 24,982 kt were
down 2,498 kt from 2007. 

Corporate and financing expenses of $830 million, excluding the charges related
to the Valdez litigation, increased by $807 million, mainly due to net higher
taxes and lower interest income. 

In 2008, Exxon Mobil Corporation purchased 434 million shares of its common
stock for the treasury at a gross cost of $35.7 billion. These purchases
included $32.0 billion to reduce the number of shares outstanding, with the
balance used to offset shares issued in conjunction with the company's benefit
plans and programs. Shares outstanding were reduced from 5,382 million at the
end of 2007 to 4,976 million at the end of 2008, a decrease of 7.5%.

"Fourth-quarter earnings for our downstream business improved as the lower cost
of crude-oil feedstocks used in the refining process helped boost margins on the
sale of gasoline and other refined products," said Chairman and CEO Dave
O`Reilly. "Lower quarterly profits for our upstream operations reflected a sharp
decline in crude-oil prices from a year ago. 

"We achieved much success in 2008," O`Reilly added. "Record earnings and strong
cash flows for the year enabled us to invest $23 billion in an attractive
portfolio of capital and exploratory projects, buy back $8 billion of our common
stock and increase the dividend payment on our common shares for the 21st
consecutive year. We enter 2009 with the financial strength to meet the
challenges of a difficult economy and with a continued focus on cost management
and capital stewardship." 

O`Reilly also noted other activities of operational and strategic importance in
recent months:

* United States - Began production at the 75 percent-owned and operated Blind
Faith project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Total volumes are expected to
ramp up during the first quarter to approximately 65,000 barrels of crude oil
and 55 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. Blind Faith was the third
major project completed in the second half of 2008. In the third quarter,
crude-oil production began at the deepwater Agbami Field offshore Nigeria, and
full facility expansion at Tengiz in Kazakhstan nearly doubled production
capacity. 
* Indonesia - Achieved first oil at North Duri Field Area 12, which Chevron
operates with a 100 percent interest. Maximum total crude-oil production of
34,000 barrels per day is expected in 2012. 
* Proved Reserves of Oil and Gas - Added 1.34 billion barrels of oil-equivalent
proved reserves in 2008. These additions, which are subject to final reviews,
equate to 146 percent of oil-equivalent production for the year. Included in the
additions are favorable effects of lower year-end prices on the calculation of
reserves associated with production-sharing and variable-royalty contracts. The
company will provide additional details relating to 2008 reserve activity in its
Annual Report on Form 10-K scheduled for filing with the SEC on February 26.

UPSTREAM - EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION

Worldwide oil-equivalent production averaged 2.54 million barrels per day in the
fourth quarter 2008, compared with 2.61 million barrels per day in the
corresponding 2007 period. The decline between periods was primarily associated
with the ongoing effect of damage to production facilities caused by hurricanes
in the Gulf of Mexico in September 2008.

U.S. upstream income of $1.15 billion in the fourth quarter 2008 decreased $229
million from a year earlier. The 2008 period included an approximate $600
million gain on a transaction involving the receipt of Chevron stock in exchange
for a producing property, plus cash. Prices for crude oil and natural gas were
lower in the 2008 fourth quarter. Oil-equivalent production was also lower, and
operating expenses were higher. 

The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids was $49
in the fourth quarter 2008, down from $79 in the corresponding 2007 period. The
average sales price per thousand cubic feet of natural gas decreased from $6.08
to $5.23. 

Net oil-equivalent production was 619,000 barrels per day in the 2008 fourth
quarter, down 111,000 from a year earlier. About 75 percent of the decline was
associated with the continuing effects of production that was shut-in as a
result of September hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico. The net liquids component
of production was down 12 percent at 399,000 barrels per day, and net natural
gas production declined 21 percent to 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. 

At the end of 2008, approximately 50,000 barrels per day of oil-equivalent
production remained offline in the Gulf of Mexico due to the hurricanes, with
restoration of the volumes to occur as repairs to third-party pipelines and
producing facilities are completed.

International upstream earnings of $2 billion in the fourth quarter 2008
decreased $1.46 billion from a year earlier due to lower prices for crude oil, a
reduction in sales volumes associated with the timing of certain cargo liftings
and higher depreciation expense. Foreign-currency effects benefited earnings by
$644 million in the 2008 quarter, compared with an $88 million reduction to
income in the 2007 corresponding period. 

The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids was $47
in the 2008 quarter, down from $80 a year earlier. The average sales price per
thousand cubic feet of natural gas increased from $4.32 to $5.10. 

Net oil-equivalent production was 1.92 million barrels per day in the 2008
fourth quarter, up 38,000 barrels per day from a year earlier. The 2008 period
included an increase of approximately 150,000 barrels per day from the project
start-up earlier in the year at Agbami in Nigeria and the ramp-up of production
associated with the expansion project at Tengiz in Kazakhstan. Production was
lower in Azerbaijan, Thailand and Venezuela. The net liquids component of
production increased 2 percent from a year ago to 1.34 million barrels per day,
while natural gas production increased 2 percent to 3.49 billion cubic feet per
day.

U.S. downstream earned approximately $1.03 billion in the fourth quarter 2008,
compared with a loss of $55 million a year earlier. The improvement between
periods was mainly the result of significantly higher margins on the sale of
refined products, improved refinery operations and gains on commodity derivative
instruments. 

Refinery crude-input of 930,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2008 was
92,000 higher than the corresponding 2007 period. The increase was primarily due
to significantly less planned and unplanned downtime in this year`s fourth
quarter. 

Refined-product sales volumes declined 1 percent from the fourth quarter of 2007
to 1.4 million barrels per day, primarily the result of lower gasoline and fuel
oil sales. Branded gasoline sales volumes of 606,000 barrels per day were down 2
percent between quarters.

International downstream income of $1.05 billion increased $788 million from the
2007 quarter due largely to gains on commodity derivative instruments and
improved margins on the sale of refined products. These benefits were partially
offset by lower refined-product sales volumes. Foreign-currency effects reduced
earnings by $27 million in the 2008 quarter, compared with a benefit of $87
million a year earlier. 

Refinery crude-input was 973,000 barrels per day, about 6 percent lower than the
fourth quarter of 2007 due to an increase in planned and unplanned downtime. 

Refined-product sales volumes of 1.9 million barrels per day in the 2008 fourth
quarter were about 6 percent lower than a year earlier due primarily to reduced
sales of gasoline, gas oil and fuel oil.

&lt;p&gt;BUCHAREST Jan 31 (Reuters) - Romanian authorities have seized 1.2 tonnes of cocaine worth at least 100 million euros ($129 million) found in containers at a Black Sea port, one of the biggest hauls in a decade, police said on Saturday. Police said the drugs, which belonged to an international crime ring comprised of three Romanians and a Spanish man, were hidden in two containers loaded with cedar timber in the port of Constanta. The containers had arrived from Brazil in late 2008. The purity of the cocaine exceeded 90 percent and the consignment had a minimum street value of 100 million euros, police said. Arrest warrants would be issued on Saturday for the four members of the crime ring who face indictment on charges of drug trafficking, police said.
