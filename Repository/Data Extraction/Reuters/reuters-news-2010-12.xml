      Popeyes&#174; today announced multi-year agreements with two powerful 
      marketing partners &#8211; The Coca-Cola Company and Dr Pepper Snapple Group &#8211; 
      to implement a beverage strategy that is designed to be exciting for 
      guests and more profitable for the restaurants.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Popeyes has been working for quite some time on a common beverage 
      strategy that will deliver results for our system,&#8221; explains Cheryl 
      Bachelder, president and chief executive officer of Popeyes and AFC 
      Enterprises, Inc. &#8220;The successful launch of Popeyes&#174; Cane Sweeeet Iced 
      Tea this year demonstrated the power of a system-wide approach to 
      beverage sales. Today we are putting in place a unified strategy for 
      fountain beverages that we expect will provide great beverage brands to 
      our guests and strong results to the operators of our 1,500+ restaurants 
      nationwide.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The announcement follows a thorough selection process conducted by a 
      joint committee of franchise and corporate representatives. The 
      committee reviewed proposals from all of the major beverage companies to 
      identify the best options for the Popeyes system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The new beverage strategy and the selection of Coca-Cola and Dr Pepper 
      are a win/win/win for everyone &#8211; a win for our brand, a win for the 
      franchisees and most importantly, a win for our guests,&#8221; stated Popeyes 
      franchisee Joe Haberkorn, chair of the joint beverage committee. 
      &#8220;Working through this selection process as a team shows the power of 
      what can be accomplished when our franchisor and franchisees work 
      together with integrity and a shared commitment to the franchisees that 
      will benefit from these partnerships.&#8221;

      Jason worked closely with Director Joseph Kosinski and Composers Daft 
      Punk to realize the visionary soundtrack. &#8220;We were fortunate to work 
      with such talents as Daft Punk, and their score has helped make the 
      experience of &#8216;TRON: Legacy&#8217; truly unforgettable,&#8221; said Bentley.

      For the premiere, Bentley had something special in mind. &#8220;Joe [Kosinski] 
      and I wanted to feature a musician who has a firm grasp of the 
      futuristic aesthetic of &#8216;TRON: Legacy&#8217; and would take it to another 
      level. Boys Noize, who is a major &#8216;TRON&#8217; fan and disciple of Daft Punk, 
      is the perfect choice. I can&#8217;t wait to see people&#8217;s reaction as they 
      spill out of the premiere, and walk straight into the thrilling 
      environment of the after-party with Boys Noise churning out the techno

&lt;p&gt; * JP Morgan has traded 20 physical cargoes this year

 * Strong presence in U.S. and European gas markets

 * Intends to build further in LNG
 (Adds quotes, details)

 BARCELONA, Dec 1 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase (JPM.N) has
traded 20 physical cargoes of liquefied natural gas since it
began LNG dealing nearly a year ago and plans further growth in
that area, a company executive said on Wednesday.

 JP Morgan, like other banks, has entered the LNG trade as
production increases and the spot market grows, potentially
allowing room for new entrants in a space traditionally run by
a few gas-producing majors.

 "We did 20 single spot cargoes physically this year, as of
December 1, with 15 different clients," said Andrew Slocum,
executive director of LNG marketing and trading at JP Morgan.

 JP Morgan visibly entered the LNG market in March in a deal
with U.S. LNG importer Cheniere Energy (LNG.A). Under the
agreement, the two companies jointly look to buy and trade
cargoes, and JP Morgan has gained import access at Cheniere's
Sabine Pass terminal in Louisiana. [ID:nN31243314]

 This deal, and JP Morgan's import capacity at the Montoir
import terminal in France, have given the bank a foothold in
the tight-knit market.

 Trading LNG is a natural step for JP Morgan given its
gas-marketing presence in Europe and the United States, Slocum
said. JP Morgan, which recently bought the key North American
trading assets of RBS Sempra Commodities, is the No. 2 physical
gas marketer in North America behind BP (BP.L), he said.

 "We have grown into a leadership position in both the U.S.
and European swing gas markets for LNG," he said.

 JP Morgan is unlikely to stop there. "I would be surprised
if next year we did not do something strategic and large in
LNG," Slocum said.

 Other banks entering the LNG market over the past couple of
years include Barclays Capital (BARC.L) and Citigroup (C.N),

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) sought help from a Federal Reserve program for Wall Street dealers 84 times during the financial crisis, according to data released by the U.S. central bank on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Dec 1 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) doesn't
expect production at its 150,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los
Angeles-area refinery in Torrance, California to affected by
minor maintenance on an unidentified unit on Wednesday, a

&lt;p&gt;IBM said today that it has made new breakthroughs in an industry-wide race to create laser-based chips that can send data at high speeds through computers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Big Blue told the Wall Street Journal that it has made advances in optical communications components using silicon, which is the main material used in conventional electrical chips. The IBM chips, still in an experimental stage, use lasers to send data in the form of pulses of light through the silicon chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If IBM can commercialize the technology in the years ahead, it could make chips that can send data at a rate of a trillion bits per second. That is 25 times the capacity of similar optical components used in the fastest computers today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasers are used to send pulses of light through stretched glass known as fiber optic cables for long-distance communications today. But the bottleneck has always been in the hand-off, when the data reaches the end of the fiber optic network and merges with an electrical network within a computer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silicon photonics, as the field is called, has been under research for years as the potential answer. Besides IBM, Intel and Luxtera have been working on silicon components to get past the bottleneck, by using chips that essentially replicate the optical functions on a much tinier scale inside a chip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlsbad, Calif.-based Luxtera, a nine-year-old startup, was the first to commercialize silicon photonics and it disputes the value of IBM&#8217;s breakthrough, saying Luxtera&#8217;s current chips are already more capable than the technology described by IBM. Luxtera currently makes 40-gigabit per second chips that can connect two computers starting at a $150 to $200. Over time, that cost will drop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yurii Vlasov, manager of IBM&#8217;s silicon integrated nanophotonics effort, told the WSJ that his group&#8217;s first commercial products could hit the market in three to five years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: silicon photonics&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies: IBM, Intel, Luxtera&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;People: Yurii Vlasov&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Transaction processors Visa Inc and MasterCard Inc are both huge, predictable cash generators that are ready to return more money to shareholders by buying back shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet the world's two largest credit and debit card networks are skimping on their dividend payouts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard escaped the worst of the financial crisis with billions of dollars each in unrestricted cash, and analysts expect their piles to continue growing. Both have spent some of that money on acquisitions this year, and each recently committed to $1 billion in share buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the two networks have some of the smallest dividend yields -- 0.7 percent for Visa and 0.3 percent for MasterCard -- among companies with big stockpiles. MasterCard in particular could pay its dividend 27 times over based on its forward cash flow, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would like to see increased dividends. It would be a way to differentiate themselves especially versus other financial services, because many of the banks are unable to increase their dividends," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager with Bahl  Gaynor, who owns Visa shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Visa and MasterCard "have the ability" to increase their payouts in the next year, McCormick said. But he is more optimistic that Visa, which raised its dividend by 20 percent in October, will do so again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard has not raised its dividend since 2007. Spokeswoman Jennifer Stalzer said in an email that the company is "committed to return cash to our shareholders if we don't reinvest it back into the business, with a current preference for share repurchases over dividend increases."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some investors are hesitant to demand immediate dividend increases in the midst of ongoing regulatory and legal uncertainty. Both companies are awaiting U.S. rules that could restrict their profits. They are also facing a long-simmering merchants' lawsuit over their processing rules and fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, which went public two years before Visa, is as a result more exposed to the lawsuit and needs to reserve more cash against a potential settlement, analysts said. Both companies also need to keep some cash at hand to backstop their bank partners through technological glitches, although those reserves are much smaller than the stashes at banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But once the regulatory and legal clouds clear, most shareholders are expecting a reward for their patience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Until we get some clarity behind these regulatory issues, the prudent thing for them to do is to hold tight," said Michael Nix, principal at Greenwood Capital Associates, which owns Visa shares. "Once that clarity's there and we understand the financial impact, you can clearly assess what they can afford to do to."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jim Tierney, chief investment officer of money management firm W.P. Stewart, called the companies' recent stock buyback plans "absolutely appropriate" and said he prefers that type of return to an increased dividend.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Once you start a dividend policy, you're really locked in to that. It's not one of those things you can fall back on" if conditions worsen, said Tierney, whose firm includes MasterCard and Visa shares in its $1.5 billion of assets under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, "as you move forward, as you get more clarity,... Both companies have room, and I would expect them to increase their payouts or their dividend yields," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POTENTIAL PAYOUTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard's dividend yield is at the bottom of the list of the 25 richest dividend-paying U.S. non-bank and non-insurance companies, based on those companies' net cash piles, according to StarMine. Visa, which has an even bigger net cash position than MasterCard, has its dividend tied for third-lowest of those companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks and insurers' cash reserves are considered separately because they need to keep much bigger cash reserves on hand as a matter of course.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa and MasterCard, which process credit and debit card payments, do not take on credit risk and were relatively insulated from the 2008 financial crisis. Their businesses have grown as the economy stabilizes and consumers spend more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa reported about $3 billion in profit on $8 billion in revenues for its fiscal year ended in September. The world's largest card processing network is sitting on about $3.87 billion in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents -- compared with about $2.48 billion at rival MasterCard -- and it should keep piling up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are in very strong cash positions, partly because they generate a ton of cash and they don't have a ton of use for that cash," said Sanjay Sakhrani, analyst at Keefe, Bruyette  Woods. "That'll grow as earnings grow."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;READY TO SPEND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neither is sitting idly on its stockpiles. Visa spent $2 billion on e-commerce processing company CyberSource in July and the next month MasterCard bid $520 million for similar European firm DataCash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are a number of new technologies coming along ... and both companies want to make sure that they're in all the places around the globe," Tierney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies' efforts to buy or develop new technology comes as consumers are increasingly shopping online or even using their mobile phones to buy things instead of using traditional credit and debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both are also trying to grow in emerging markets, where most consumers still use cash and checks instead of plastic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Maria Aspan, editing by Gerald E.

      Fitch Downgrades Walt Disney Family Museum's $58.2MM Rev Bonds to 'A'; 
      Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings downgrades the rating on the following California 
      Infrastructure and Economic Development Bank (CIEDB, or the issuer) 
      revenue bonds issued on behalf of the Walt Disney Family Museum (WDFM, 
      or the museum) to 'A' from 'AA-':
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$58.2 million CIEDB revenue bonds (the Walt Disney Family Museum)
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING RATIONALE:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The downgrade to 'A' from 'AA-' primarily reflects the substantial 
      market-driven decline in balance sheet resources of The Walt and Lilly 
      Disney Foundation (the Disney Foundation), which serves as the guarantor 
      for the bonds.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --While it was never envisioned that the museum's financial performance 
      would be sufficient to pay principal and interest on the bonds, lower 
      than forecast attendance since its opening in October 2009 has 
      necessitated a higher level of support from the Disney Foundation in the 
      form of an annual contribution for both operations and debt service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Resources of the Disney Foundation are, however, expected to continue 
      to provide a cushion relative to both operating expenditures and debt 
      consistent with the 'A' category despite the possibility that annual 
      Foundation contributions will remain higher than amounts originally 
      forecast through the intermediate term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Maintenance of the guarantor's liquidity at or above current levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Continued adjustment of WDFM's operating budget to ensure the 
      guarantor's available funds are not materially weakened by the magnitude 
      of the required annual contribution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SECURITY:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bonds are an absolute and unconditional obligation of the Disney 
      Foundation, under a guaranty agreement with the museum.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CREDIT SUMMARY:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating for the series 2008 bonds relies primarily on the strength of 
      the balance sheet of The Walt and Lilly Disney Foundation, which has yet 
      to fully recover from the severe impacts of the financial markets 
      downturn in 2008 and 2009. Between fiscal 2007 and 2009, the Disney 
      Foundation's available funds (cash and investments that are not 
      permanently restricted) declined 34.1% from $260.7 million to $171.8 
      million. Fitch notes that a portion of the decline was attributable to a 
      planned $23 million equity contribution toward the museum's construction 
      and other grants made by the Disney Foundation. Coverage of total debt 
      weakened to 232.9% at the end of 2009, from 351.4% in 2007. Total debt 
      includes the series 2008 bonds and a non-cancellable operating lease 
      between the museum and the Presidio Trust for approximately $16 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coverage of operating expenses of the Disney Foundation also weakened to 
      594% at the end of 2009, from 1,795.8% at the end of 2007. Operating 
      expenses include grants and various overhead costs. In 2009, grants to 
      the museum increased significantly to $26 million to fund construction 
      and startup costs. The Disney Foundation also supports other non-profit 
      organizations, including educational and cultural institutions. In each 
      of the past three fiscal years, annual non-museum related contributions 
      totaled approximately $1 million, of which $500 thousand represented a 
      payment on a pledge commitment scheduled to extend through 2013. Fitch 
      expects non-museum related grants to remain modest going forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2010, the Disney Foundation's operating expenses are expected to 
      decline significantly. Grants in 2010 for the museum to date are just $8 
      million as construction largely ended the prior year, and 2010 grants 
      are primarily for operating support pursuant to a museum support 
      agreement between the Disney Foundation and WDFM. The Disney 
      Foundation's original projections for the museum anticipated annual 
      grants of approximately $6 million to support operations, including debt 
      service. Due to low attendance, revenues have been below projections 
      leading to a higher operating subsidy. In response, management plans to 
      trim operating expenses, cultivate additional corporate philanthropic 
      support, and strengthen attendance-based revenues through more targeted 
      marketing. Fitch does not anticipate significant attendance growth given 
      the museum's relatively isolated location within the Presidio and its 
      narrow subject matter focus. A preliminary fiscal 2011 budget for an $8 
      million subsidy is slightly less than 5% of the Disney Foundation's 2009 
      available funds ($8.6 million). Subsidies in excess of the budgeted 
      amount could pressure the Disney Foundation's level of available funds, 
      especially in the event of further volatility in global financial 
      markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Disney Foundation's only revenue sources are investment income 
      (interest, dividends, and partnership income) and realized gains on 
      investments. Investment management for the Disney Foundation is handled 
      primarily by two separate managers, each of which oversees between 
      40%-50% of the Disney Foundation's total investments. The Disney 
      Foundation also separately dedicates a small portion of its portfolio to 
      a fixed-income mutual fund and stock in the Walt Disney Company. The 
      Disney Foundation's board of three members regularly reviews investment 
      performance, and did not make any significant adjustments in overall 
      policy in recent years. Fitch notes that the board is considering hiring 
      a single investment adviser to provide overall guidance on investment 
      policy, which could be helpful in making strategic decisions. Investment 
      results through the first eight months of 2010 provided by the Disney 
      Foundation's counsel indicate limited growth in the overall portfolio. 
      Alternative investments comprised a moderately high 21.3% of the total 
      portfolio at the end of 2009, which was consistent with prior years. 
      Despite this exposure, 2009 adjusted available funds (adjusted to 
      exclude alternative assets) covered a still solid 183.3% of total debt 
      and 467.5% of operating expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WDFM opened in October 2009, on schedule and approximately $7 million 
      under its construction budget. The museum is dedicated to the life and 
      work of Walt Disney and is located in three historic buildings in the 
      Presidio of San Francisco, a former Army base that became part of Golden 
      Gate National Recreation Area in 1994. The Walt Disney Family Foundation 
      is the sole corporate member of the museum, and shares two of its three 
      board members with the Disney Foundation. The bylaws of both foundations 
      require that all board members be descendants of Walt Disney, reflecting 
      their commitment to the museum's mission.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, Dec 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Sempra Energy (NYSE: SRE) and The Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) today
completed the sale of key North American assets of RBS Sempra Commodities
to J.P. Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., a unit of JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co.

    The assets include wholesale natural gas and power trading agreements, as
well as over-the-counter and exchange-traded transactions, with
counterparties across North America. 

    The sale, which was originally announced Oct. 7, together with previous
sales of the joint-venture assets, has essentially completed Sempra
Energy's exit from the commodities trading business. 

    Last month, Noble Group Ltd. acquired the San Diego-based Sempra Energy
Solutions unit of RBS Sempra Commodities. In July, Sempra Energy and RBS
completed the first phase of the asset sales with a transaction to sell
to JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. the joint venture's global metals and oil
businesses, as well as the European natural gas and power businesses. 

    Sempra Energy, based in San Diego, is a Fortune 500 energy services
holding company with 2009 revenues of more than $8 billion. The Sempra
Energy companies' 13,800 employees serve about 25 million consumers
worldwide.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Former U.S. Astronaut Bernard Harris gave students and teachers in 
      Nashville a first-hand experience with the wonders of science, 
      technology, engineering and mathematics when &#8220;The Dream Tour, presented 
      by ExxonMobil&#8221; made its ninth stop of 2010 on December 1 speaking to 400 
      students from Bailey and Litton Middle Schools at Stratford High School.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The tour is designed to encourage today&#8217;s middle school students to 
      realize their potential and strive to acquire strong math and science 
      skills. The program included an interactive and inspirational program by 
      Dr. Harris, a demonstration on space and engaging dialogue about 
      achieving goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is critical that American students are prepared with the 
      problem-solving skills and tools to tackle challenges they may face in 
      the future. Providing them with a strong foundation in math and science 
      education is imperative, and with The Dream Tour, I hope to inspire 
      students to pursue studies and careers in these fields,&#8221; Dr. Harris said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      From humble beginnings in Houston, Texas to making history as the first 
      African American to walk in space, Dr. Harris is a living example of 
      achieving high aspirations. His story provides a powerful backdrop to 
      bring his message to students in cities across America. Since 2008, Dr. 
      Harris has encouraged nearly 35,000 middle school students in more than 
      20 cities nationwide. This year, The Dream Tour will visit Anchorage, 
      Baton Rouge, Billings, Cleveland, Denver, Nashville, Philadelphia, 
      Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco as Dr. Harris continues to motivate 
      and inspire students to pursue math and science.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;ExxonMobil Foundation is proud to partner with Dr. Harris in getting 
      the message out to thousands of young adults about the importance of 
      careers in science, technology, engineering and math,&#8221; said Suzanne 
      McCarron, president, ExxonMobil Foundation. &#8220;The Dream Tour inspires 
      students to investigate the unlimited possibilities available to them 
      when they choose math and science as a means to realize their dreams.&#8221;

			Here are highlights from Tuesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			A Kraft, Starbucks Rift After 12 Years
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Kraft Foods Inc. (NYSE: KFT) 
      is claiming arbitration from Starbucks Corporation (Nasdaq: SBUX), 
      as Starbucks attempts to end the 12-year agreement, under which Kraft 
      Foods has been distributing packaged Starbucks coffee to retail grocery 
      stores.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kraft stated that the deal was in effect indefinitely and it requires 
      sufficient time to execute an orderly transition. Kraft insists that 
      Starbucks must compensate it for the fair market value of the business 
      with a premium of up to 35% of that value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Marc Firestone, Executive Vice President, Corporate and Legal Affairs 
      and General Counsel, said that Starbucks is trying to walk away from a 
      long-term strategic partnership -- from which it has greatly benefited 
      -- without abiding by contractual conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On the other hand, Starbucks stated that it decided to end the contract 
      with Kraft, as Kraft did not actively protect and promote the Starbucks 
      Coffee and Seattle&#8217;s Best Coffee brands. It further stated that as per 
      the agreement, Kraft was required to closely work with Starbucks to 
      maintain its involvement in making important marketing decisions and 
      customer contracts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The contract between Kraft and Starbucks started back when the retail 
      grocery coffee business of Starbucks was generating less than $50 
      million in annual revenues. Kraft, through its expertise and resources, 
      has grown it to approximately a $500 million business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There are predictions among various analysts that Starbucks will enter 
      into new partnerships, especially in the single-cup coffee market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Jakks Pacific and Microsoft Team Up
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Jakks Pacific Inc. (Nasdaq: JAKK) 
      recently inked a licensing agreement with Microsoft Corp. 
      (Nasdaq: MSFT) to 
      design and manufacture interactive plush toys beginning with King 
      Cheetah and Maltese Tiger that integrate with the &#8216;Kinectimals&#8217; video 
      game for Kinect for Xbox 360 entertainment system that was launched 
      worldwide this month. Jakks Pacific has a partnership with Kinect games 
      to manufacture the interactive toy range, which falls under the 
      pre-school category.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Jakks will produce a mainline plush assortment to be 
      available at retail counters in the U.S. starting in spring 2011. The 
      first slot is slated to feature five plush animals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jakks limited collector&#8217;s edition of Kinectimals plush toys will deploy 
      the Microsoft Tag technology, allowing players to scan the tag on their 
      toys and watch the King Cheetah or Maltese Tiger appear in the game.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We expect the company to benefit from this new initiative in 2011. 
      Additionally, many of the company&#8217;s launches in 2010 and early 2011 look 
      much better than products of previous years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company&#8217;s range of new toys and electronics provide solid momentum 
      to its 2010 holiday season. Toys &#8220;R&#8221; Us recently listed its Disney 
      Princess  Me 18-inch dolls as one of the Top 15 best new toys of the 
      holiday season.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jakks Pacific currently retains the Zacks #1 Rank, which translates into 
      a short-term Strong Buy rating. We are also maintaining our long-term 
      Outperform recommendation on the stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fred&#8217;s Posts Healthy Sales
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fred&#8217;s
			Inc. (Nasdaq: FRED), 
      a leading discount general merchandise store operator in the United 
      States, recently posted healthy sales results for the four-week period 
      ended November 27, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      After registering a growth of 1.2% in October 2010, Fred&#8217;s experienced 
      comparable store sales growth of 4.7% in November. For the third quarter 
      of 2010, comps climbed 1.5%. Increased store traffic and sound 
      merchandise positively impacted the comparable store sales during the 
      reported month and the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company witnessed increased comparable store sales in all the four 
      weeks compared to a decline of 3.3% in the prior-year period. Management 
      stated that with excellent merchandising and marketing strategy in 
      place, Fred&#8217;s has created exciting shopping experiences for its 
      customers. Moreover, the company has a strong balance sheet with a 
      strong cash position, quality inventory and no outstanding debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net sales for November jumped 4.0% to $1.506 billion from $1.453 billion 
      in the same month last year. In the third quarter, sales climbed 3.0% to 
      $435 million from $422.4 million posted in the same period last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The strong third quarter has made Fred&#8217;s more confident. The company 
      expects total earnings per diluted share for 2010 to be in the range of 
      74 cents to 78 cents, representing an increase of 25% to 32% over last 
      year. This was further backed by solid comparable store sales in 
      November.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The Maximum Tender Offer is scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m., EST, on 
      December 14, 2010, unless extended or earlier terminated. If more than 
      the maximum tender amount of $1,601,783,000 in aggregate principal 
      amount of notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer are validly tendered 
      and not validly withdrawn before the expiration of the Maximum Tender 
      Offer, the tendered notes will be purchased in accordance with the 
      acceptance priority levels set forth above. If there are insufficient 
      remaining funds to purchase all the notes of a series in an applicable 
      priority level, then the amount of notes purchased in that series will 
      be prorated based on the aggregate principal amount tendered for that 
      series of notes. In that event, notes of other series subject to the 
      Maximum Tender Offer with a lower acceptance priority level than the 
      prorated series of notes will not be accepted for purchase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Holders of notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer who validly 
      tendered and did not validly withdraw their notes before the early 
      tender date will receive the total consideration, which includes an 
      early tender premium of $30.00 per $1,000 principal amount of notes 
      tendered by such holders that are accepted for purchase. Holders of 
      notes subject to the Maximum Tender Offer who validly tender their notes 
      after the early tender date and before the expiration date for the 
      Maximum Tender Offer will receive the tender offer consideration, which

			Metropolitan D.C. Charities Receive $2.8 Million from ExxonMobil 
      Employee Giving Program
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Annual Program Raises Record Amount for Local Community Organizations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil&#8217;s employees in the Metropolitan D.C. area raised more than 
      $2.8 million for local community and charitable organizations during the 
      2010 Employees' Favorite Charities Campaign. The amount is another 
      record level for the campaign, eclipsing last year&#8217;s record-setting 
      amount of $2.7 million. The campaign has raised nearly $19 million for 
      organizations in the Metropolitan D.C. area since 2002.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a significant achievement, especially in these tough economic 
      times when funding for many worthy organizations has declined while 
      demand for their services has increased,&#8221; said Debra King, chair of the 
      2010 ExxonMobil Employees&#8217; Favorite Charities Campaign. &#8220;Once again, our 
      employees have continued their proud tradition of giving in the 
      communities where we live and work.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This year, employees donated to over 500 charities with nearly half 
      qualifying for ExxonMobil&#8217;s charitable matching program. As a result, 
      233 local non-profit organizations providing health and human services 
      will receive contributions from ExxonMobil in addition to the individual 
      donations made by employees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil has a long history of supporting community groups and 
      educational organizations in the greater Washington D.C. area, not only 
      with contributions and grants, but also with thousands of employees and 
      retirees who volunteer their time and talent.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Organizations receiving both individual employee and corporate matching 
      contributions include:

			CACI Chairman Dr. J.P. (Jack) London Inducted as 2010 Washington 
      Business Hall of Fame Laureate
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Dr. London Accepts Lifetime Achievement Award on Behalf
			of 
      CACI&#8217;s Dedicated and Innovative Employees
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CACI International Inc (NYSE:CACI) 
      announced today that CACI Chairman of the Board Dr. J.P. (Jack) London 
      has been inducted as a laureate into the Washington Business Hall of 
      Fame at its annual gala held last night in Washington, DC. The honor is 
      a lifetime achievement award for executives who have made a major impact 
      on the Greater Washington Region by demonstrating business excellence, 
      visionary, innovative leadership, and community involvement throughout 
      their professional lives. More than 1,000 people attended the gala, with 
      proceeds from the dinner and awards ceremony benefiting Junior 
      Achievement's efforts to inspire and prepare young people to succeed in 
      a global economy. The laureates are selected annually by a committee 
      comprised of members of the Hall's three founding organizations: The 
      Greater Washington Board of Trade, Junior 
      Achievement of the National Capital Area, and The 
      Washingtonian.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. London's selection recognizes his achievement in growing CACI from a 
      small consulting firm into a worldwide professional services and IT 
      company serving vital national needs in defense, intelligence, homeland 
      security, and the modernization of government. A market visionary, Dr. 
      London was the architect of CACI strategies that continually positioned 
      the company for growth in rapidly changing business climates, while also 
      helping to expand the region's IT capabilities. London's creation and 
      leadership of a robust mergers and acquisition program have brought some 
      50 acquisitions to CACI to-date. These have strengthened the company's 
      capabilities in managed networks and integrated security and 
      intelligence solutions and helped to grow revenue from $1.6 million in 
      1972, the year London joined CACI, to more than $3 billion today. This 
      significant growth is also the result of the company&#8217;s concentration on 
      well-funded, critical areas of the federal government and the innovative 
      solutions it provides customers. Dr. London's leadership in developing 
      CACI's reputation for its culture of ethics and integrity is known 
      throughout the industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In his remarks made when accepting the award, Dr. London thanked the 
      more than 13,000 people of CACI, pointing out, &#8220;We are proud of the work 
      we do for our military in supporting America&#8217;s defense needs around the 
      world.&#8221; He went on to say, &#8220;In business I know that people are 
      everything. People with 'great attitudes' are vital. People of 
      initiative and integrity are critical. After we hire these great people, 
      we empower them to achieve their goals. Then we reward their 
      achievements. This is CACI&#8217;s success formula.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Joining Dr. London as fellow laureates at the event were distinguished 
      Greater Washington business leaders Theodore 
      "Ted" J. Leonsis, Majority Owner of the Washington 
      Capitals; Debra 
      L. Lee, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of BET Networks; John 
      G. Laytham, President of Clyde's Restaurant Group; and Gerald 
      T. Halpin, Founder, President and CEO, Chairman of the Board of 
      Directors, WEST*GROUP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CACI President and CEO Paul Cofoni noted, &#8220;All of us at CACI 
      congratulate Jack London on his induction into such a vitally important 
      organization as the Washington Business Hall of Fame. In the government

      innovative support we provide our customers.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, quote)	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Dec 1 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co 
has cut five staff from its energy trading operations in 
Singapore with immediate effect, industry sources said on 
Wednesday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMorgan spokeswoman based in Hong Kong declined to 
comment on the cuts, when contacted by Reuters.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cuts include one operations employee, one structuring 
staffer, one naphtha trader, one energy salesperson and one 
risk management employee, sources with knowledge of the matter 
told Reuters.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In October, the Wall Street Journal reported that 
JPMorgan's aggressive push into commodities trading would fall 
short of revenue goals this year and the business would be 
re-evaluated if it lagged again in 2011. [ID:nN09285898]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides the changes in Singapore, some jobs in JPMorgan's 
Japan operations could also be axed, said the sources, who 
asked not to be named.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said the cuts might also be related to 
consolidation efforts after the bank bought RBS Sempra's 
global oil operations in July.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It takes about 12 to 18 months to integrate the two 
companies, and the bank is probably doing some 
house-cleaning," said a trader.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And JPMorgan looks to be an easy target, not having met 
their revenue goals this year."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trustee seeking money for defrauded former clients of Bernard Madoff said he filed a $6.4 billion lawsuit accusing JPMorgan Chase  Co of aiding the imprisoned Ponzi schemer's fraud as his main banker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit is the second largest that trustee Irving Picard has filed against former Madoff clients or others he believes assisted in the estimated $65 billion Ponzi scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, the No. 2 U.S. bank, was for more than 20 years the main banker for Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, which the trustee is liquidating following its December 11, 2008 collapse. Picard must file "clawback" lawsuits to recover money lost in the fraud by the two-year anniversary of the Madoff firm's demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan was willfully blind to the fraud, even after learning about numerous red flags surrounding Madoff," said David Sheehan, a lawyer representing the trustee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While many financial institutions enabled Madoff's fraud, JPMorgan was at the very center of that fraud, and thoroughly complicit in it," Sheehan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it will defend against Picard's lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any suggestion that JPMorgan supported Madoff's fraud is utterly baseless and demonstrably false," spokesman Brian Marchiony said in a statement. "Contrary to the trustee's allegations, JPMorgan did not know about or in any way assist in the fraud orchestrated by Bernard Madoff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, seeks to recover nearly $1 billion in fees and profits, plus $5.4 billion in damages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HUNDREDS OF LAWSUITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard has filed hundreds of lawsuits, including more than 500 this week, to recover well in excess of $25 billion for Madoff investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest case remains the $7.2 billion lawsuit against the estate of former Madoff client Jeffry Picower, who died in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's name surfaced soon after Madoff's fraud was revealed. Madoff admitted during his March 2009 guilty plea that the essence of his scheme was to deposit client money into a Chase account, rather than invest it and generate steady returns as clients had believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When clients wanted their money, "I used the money in the Chase Manhattan bank account that belonged to them or other clients to pay the requested funds," he told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year sentence in a North Carolina federal prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trustee filed his complaint under seal, and said he intends to make it public as soon as possible. A spokesman declined to provide a copy or to provide further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UBS, LEE ALSO DEFENDANTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the other defendants in Picard's lawsuits are the Swiss bank UBS AG, an affiliate of private equity executive Thomas H. Lee, "feeder funds" that sent client money to Madoff, and Madoff relatives including his wife, Ruth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard has said he has recovered $1.5 billion for Madoff victims through September 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Picard and Sheehan are partners at Baker  Hostetler LLP, a law firm in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares rose $1.05, or 2.8 percent, t0 $39.20 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co et al, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-ap-04932.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; Additional reporting by Martha Graybow, editing by Gerald E.

 (Adds comment, details throughout)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 2 (Reuters) - The trustee seeking to recoup
money lost to Bernard Madoff sued JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
for $6.4 billion, accusing the Ponzi schemer's main banker of

by the two-year anniversary of the Madoff firm's demise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan was willfully blind to the fraud, even after
learning about numerous red flags surrounding Madoff," said
David Sheehan, a lawyer representing the trustee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While many financial institutions enabled Madoff's fraud,
JPMorgan was at the very center of that fraud, and thoroughly
complicit in it," Sheehan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, pledged to defend
against the lawsuit, which it said "blatantly" distorts the
facts and law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Any suggestion that JPMorgan supported Madoff's fraud is
utterly baseless and demonstrably false," spokesman Brian
Marchiony said in a statement. "Contrary to the trustee's
allegations, JPMorgan did not know about or in any way assist
in the fraud orchestrated by Bernard Madoff."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Picard said he seeks to recover nearly $1 billion in fees
and profits plus $5.4 billion in damages. The complaint was
filed under seal in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, and
Picard intends to make it public as soon as possible. A
spokesman declined to provide a copy or further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This action is appropriate and overdue," said Ron Stein,
president of the Network for Investor Action and Protection,
formed by Madoff investors. "The trustee has drawn a clear line
between the facilitators of the fraud and innocent victims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HUNDREDS OF LAWSUITS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The biggest case filed by Picard remains the $7.2 billion
lawsuit against the estate of former Madoff client Jeffry
Picower, who drowned in October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many of Picard's lawsuits seek money from former Madoff
clients he considers "net winners" for having withdrawn more
from the firm than they invested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's name quickly after Madoff's fraud was revealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Madoff admitted in his March 2009 guilty plea that the
essence of his scheme was to deposit client money into a Chase
account, rather than invest it and generate steady returns as
clients had believed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When clients wanted their money, "I used the money in the
Chase Manhattan bank account that belonged to them or other
clients to pay the requested funds," Madoff told the court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawyers for Picard said JPMorgan did not properly monitor
cash flows in Madoff accounts, and failed to act once it
suspected illegal activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They knew the emperor had no clothes, but looked the other
say," said Deborah Renner, one of Picard's lawyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan last year told The New York Times it quietly
withdrew some of its own money in early autumn 2008 from hedge
funds that invested with Madoff, amid "a lack of transparency"
to questions it raised when reviewing its hedge fund exposure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year sentence in a North
Carolina federal prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REPUTATION A CONCERN; UBS ALSO SUED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lawyers have said it is too soon to predict how much Picard
might recover, including through settlements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's definitely in JPMorgan Chase's interests not to let
this go on from a reputational standpoint," said Linus Wilson,
a finance professor at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette
who co-wrote papers about JPMorgan's involvement with Madoff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Among the other defendants in Picard's lawsuits are the
Swiss bank UBS AG (UBSN.VX), an affiliate of private equity
executive Thomas H. Lee, "feeder funds" that sent client money
to Madoff, and Madoff relatives including his wife, Ruth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trustee has said he has recovered $1.5 billion for
Madoff victims through Sept. 30. Picard, Renner and Sheehan are
partners at Baker  Hostetler LLP, a law firm in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan shares rose $1.16, or 3 percent, to close at
$39.31 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is Picard v. JPMorgan Chase  Co et al, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trial of a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc computer programer was briefly shuttered to the public due to the sensitivity of some testimony accusing him of stealing the bank's secret trading code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Observers and journalists were shut out of a New York courtroom for about 40 minutes on orders of a U.S. judge while the jury heard testimony from a Goldman manager about the Wall Street bank's lucrative speed-trading system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A grand jury indicted programer Sergey Aleynikov, 40, in February on a charge of trade secrets theft and one other criminal count. Prosecutors accused him of stealing critical parts of the trading code in June 2009 before going to a new job with Teza Technologies LLC, a speed-trading start-up firm in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov has been free on bail since his July 2009 arrest. If convicted, he faces a possible maximum prison sentence of up to 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least one news organization and one member of the public formally objected to any part of the trial being closed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is no lack of public notice here," U.S. District Judge Denise Cote said, referring to the government's application to close parts of the trial more than a month ago so as to protect the secrecy of Goldman's system from competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have had numerous conferences about it," the judge said from the bench while the jury was not present. "There has been nothing done off the record or in secret yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is common for parties to request the closure of courtrooms when proprietary secrets or sensitive information might otherwise be disclosed publicly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cote had said she would consider the government's applications as they came up during the trial. Prosecutors have asked for the court to be closed for portions of the testimony by three witnesses, all Goldman employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of those, Aleynikov's former supervisor, Adam Schlesinger, began his testimony on Wednesday and continued on Thursday. The courtroom was locked for about 40 minutes for a portion of his testimony to the jury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five people were permitted by the judge to remain in the public seats, including representatives of Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have also asked the judge to close the courtroom for the testimony of two other witnesses -- Konstantin Shakhovich, one of the lead developers of Goldman's high-frequency trading team, and Navin Kumar, a programer, according to court records.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman, Ed Canaday, declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer for Aleynikov said in Tuesday's opening arguments that the programer did not harm and could not have harmed Goldman Sachs. He said his client may have breached Goldman's confidentiality policy, but criminal prosecution under the Economic Espionage Act was inappropriate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge has allowed three weeks for the trial, which could end by December 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v Aleynikov, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 10-96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool; editing by Derek Caney and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

      Telerik, an end-to-end provider of software application lifecycle and 
      content management solutions, today announced the official release of 
      Telerik f!acedeck &#8211; a Microsoft Silverlight-based client application for

      developed by Telerik and is now available as the first official version 
      under its new brand name, Telerik f!acedeck. Telerik will take over the 
      application from Microsoft Corp. and continue its further evolution and 
      support as a free tool for the public. Powered by Silverlight 4, Telerik 
      f!acedeck delivers superior experience to Facebook users and offers 
      unique features, such as drag-and-drop from the local file system and 
      access to the video camera. The highly requested new features in the

      Facebook wall, notifications and chat.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The most important new feature in Telerik f!acedeck is the chat 
      capability, which allows users to send messages and instantly 
      communicate with their friends. Also new is the notifications menu, 
      which displays all relevant recent activities mimicking the official 
      Facebook site. Finally, the central wall has been significantly enhanced 
      to offer instant loading and smooth scrolling even with a very long list 
      of items.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft built the Facebook Toolkit to empower developers to create 
      rich, compelling user experiences on the Web and we&#8217;re pleased to see 
      Telerik taking advantage of the resources provided,&#8221; said Brad Becker, 
      director of product management at Microsoft Corp. &#8220;Telerik&#8217;s innovative 
      use of the Microsoft Silverlight-based toolkit demonstrates that next

			Autonomic Resources Delivers ROI to National Guard with Deployment of 
      IBM&#8217;s BigFix Information Security Solution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Partnership with 4K Solutions dramatically reduces time to administer 
      patches; companies to present solution at National Guard Bureau 
      Conference Dec. 6 - 8
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Autonomic 
      Resources,&#160;an IT and service integration firm 
      serving the U.S. federal government, in partnership with 4K 
      Solutions, has successfully deployed IBM's 
      BigFix Endpoint Security Software for the National Guard across 
      multiple states. BigFix has reduced the time it takes to administer 
      patches to the entire state&#8217;s servers, desktops and laptops from over a 
      week to less than a day and in some cases to just minutes, while 
      providing real-time, continuous visibility and control for all endpoints 
      across the state agencies&#8217; networks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With more than 7,000 National Guard end-points currently protected by 
      Autonomic Resource&#8217;s BigFix deployments, state Army Reserve National 
      Guard agencies have achieved a level of ROI based on the dramatic time 
      savings on administering patches, as well as their ability to now:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Use one Information Assurance (IA) console to complete more than 98 
        percent of all daily and weekly IA patch management tasks;
      
			
        Manage its patch and configuration changes quickly and easily across 
        heterogeneous computing environments;
      
			
        Deploy patches intelligently across all of its operating systems, 
        servers, and desktops, regardless of physical location, operating 
        system or native language;
      
			
        Identify vulnerabilities on intermittently connected end points, such 
        as laptops, and remediate them regardless of network connectivity;
      
			
        Secure their networks proactively and quickly, freeing time to 
        concentrate on more critical activities;
      
			
        Provide real-time updates to the Chain of Command through &#8220;State of 
        IT&#8221; reports; and
      
			
        Eliminate the need for SMS, GFI LanGuard and McAfee eEye Retina 
        security vulnerability scanning.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Intelligent computing at the endpoint is a strategic approach to 
      extending security and compliance globally, while streamlining often 
      time-consuming IT processes,&#8221; said John Keese, Autonomic Resources&#8217; 
      president. &#8220;Autonomic recognizes the importance of delivering these 
      advantages through technologies that are well-suited to address the 
      complexities of state and federal government agency networks. We are 
      pleased to welcome 4K Solutions as a strategic partner and BixFix by IBM 
      to our growing product line.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To demonstrate the solution&#8217;s capabilities and successes, Autonomic 
      Resources will co-exhibit with 4K Solutions and BigFix at the upcoming National 
      Guard Bureau NGB JC41 2010 Joint C41 Conference  Exposition 
      (booth number 835P), which runs December 6 - 8 in Nashville, Tenn. The 
      companies will also host a free webinar January 6, 2011; for more 
      information or to register, http://www1.autonomicresources.com/l/3312/2010-12-02/4X5YF.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to an Information Assurance manager with the State Army 
      National Guard, every state National Guard agency should implement a 
      solution like BigFix, and the collaboration between Autonomic Resources 
      and 4K Solutions means packages are affordable and can be customized 
      appropriately. &#8220;BigFix is the easiest solution for putting third party 
      software updates onto the machines that need it; the first I&#8217;ve seen 
      that is virtually plug-and-play on such a large scale. What&#8217;s more, the 
      product is based on &#8216;Pull&#8217; not &#8216;Push&#8217; for getting the updates out, which 
      means patch delivery is assured not assumed.&#8221; He added that the solution 
      is able to help with DAIG inspections, IAVA compliance, STIG compliance, 
      Report generating, Asset management, power (green) management and 
      network access control. &#8220;In fact, the IAVAs that came out recently were 
      actually already patched on 480 of my machines because we didn't have to 
      wait on our antivirus software, resulting in huge efficiencies and time 
      savings.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;CHARLOTTE, North Carolina (Reuters) - U.S. bank stocks surged on Thursday with regional lender Marshall  Ilsley Corp's MI.N stock price spiking as much as 12 percent, after Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) released an optimistic research note on the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman said U.S. banks are on stronger footing due to an improving U.S. economy, higher equity prices and a favorable interest rate environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The gains are the latest in a series of rapid price increases and decreases for bank stocks in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you get a shop like Goldman out supporting the sector, it can't help but boost investor confidence," said Michael Nix, principal at Greenwood Capital Associates, adding that he expects bank stocks to continue to be volatile in the coming quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The largest morning gains were posted by regional banks, whose shares have been battered in recent weeks as they continue to struggle with real estate-related loan losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The KBW Bank Index .BKX, a leading sector index, was up 3.5 percent in late morning trading, led by Marshal and Ilsley's 10.2 percent increase to $5.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions Financial Corp's (RF.N) shares increased 6.5 percent to $6.03. Atlanta-based SunTrust Banks Inc (STI.N) shares rose 5.3 percent to $25.26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Larger U.S. money center banks' shares also showed gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) shares were up 2.8 percent at $11.61, just two days after closing at a new 52-week low of $10.91.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joe Rauch; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

interest rate environment. [ID:nSGE6B109L]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gains are the latest in a series of rapid price
increases and decreases for bank stocks in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you get a shop like Goldman out supporting the
sector, it can't help but boost investor confidence," said
Michael Nix, principal at Greenwood Capital Associates, adding
that he expects bank stocks to continue to be volatile in the
coming quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The largest morning gains were posted by regional banks,
whose shares have been battered in recent weeks as they
continue to struggle with real estate-related loan losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The KBW Bank Index .BKX, a leading sector index, was up
3.5 percent in late morning trading, led by Marshal and
Ilsley's 10.2 percent increase to $5.38.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions Financial Corp's (RF.N)
shares increased 6.5 percent to $6.03. Atlanta-based SunTrust
Banks Inc (STI.N) shares rose 5.3 percent to $25.26.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Larger U.S. money center banks' shares also showed gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) shares were up 2.8 percent at
$11.61, just two days after closing at a new 52-week low of
$10.91.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BANGALORE (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co countersued Lehman Brothers Holding Inc, accusing the bankrupt investment bank of sticking it with tens of billions of dollars of loans that might never be repaid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Responding to Lehman's $8.6 billion lawsuit, JPMorgan accused Lehman of fraud for having left it with more than $25 billion of unpaid loans backed by some of its U.S. brokerage unit's "most toxic" securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it had lent the unit more than $70 billion on September 18, 2008, three days after Lehman's record bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said it expected to be repaid when Barclays Plc finished buying that unit. Instead, JPMorgan said Barclays did not buy all the debt underlying the loans, as Lehman promised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also accused senior Lehman employees in its countersuit of having "greased the wheels" of the transaction by winning offers of "lucrative" employment with Barclays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Lehman's help, Barclays cherry picked the securities it wanted" and took $5 billion of margin, according to the countersuit filed Wednesday in the U.S. bankruptcy court in Manhattan. "JPMorgan was left holding the bag."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is seeking unspecified damages, according to the edited version of the countersuit that was made public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman spokeswoman Kimberly Macleod declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The countersuit escalates JPMorgan's legal battle with Lehman, which accused it a May 26 lawsuit of illegally siphoning $8.6 billion of desperately-needed collateral in the four business days prior to its bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said JPMorgan took the collateral while knowing both of Lehman's distress through its role as the main "clearing" bank for Lehman transactions with other parties, and that the government would not bail Lehman out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman was once the fourth-largest U.S. investment bank. It is trying to repay creditors still owed hundreds of billions of dollars, and is also suing Barclays to recover an $11 billion "windfall" profit from the purchase of the brokerage unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. Bankruptcy Judge James Peck oversees the Lehman bankruptcy and related litigation. A ruling in the Barclays case is expected in early 2011. A trial in the JPMorgan case may not begin until 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has sought court approval to made an unedited version of its countersuit public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-ap-03266.

      Executive Summary
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brief Excerpt from Industry Overview Chapter:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US chemicals industry includes about 11,000 companies with combined 
      annual revenue of about $700 billion. Major companies include Dow, 
      DuPont, Eastman Chemical, ExxonMobil Chemical, and Huntsman. The 
      industry is concentrated: the 50 largest firms generate more than half 
      of industry revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Because chemicals are used to make a wide variety of industrial and 
      consumer products, demand is driven by the overall health of the US 
      economy. The profitability of individual companies is closely tied to 
      efficient operations. Big companies have large economies of scale in 
      production. Small companies can compete effectively by producing 
      specialty products, of which there are a large number, or by operating a 
      single plant highly efficiently. The industry is capital-intensive: 
      average annual revenue per employee is more than $900,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS  TECHNOLOGY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Basic chemicals include petrochemicals, industrial gases, dyes and 
      pigments, alkalies and chlorine, alcohols, and various other organic 
      (based on the chemistry of carbon and oxygen) and inorganic chemicals. 
      These basic chemicals are made from mined materials like crude oil, 
      natural gas, and minerals, or from crops and other natural substances. 
      The raw materials are called feedstocks. Chemicals 
      companies use basic chemicals to produce intermediate products like 
      polyethylene; polyethylene oxide (PO); ethylene oxide (EO); and ethylene 
      glycol, or final products like phosphate and nitrogen agricultural 
      fertilizers.

			Chevron Deepwater Gas Project in Indonesia Enters Design Phase
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Major front-end engineering and design contracts awarded for 
      liquefied natural gas project
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX)
			today announced the award of major 
      front-end engineering and design (FEED) contracts for the Gendalo-Gehem 
      natural gas development in East Kalimantan, Indonesia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Chevron-operated Gendalo-Gehem project is located in the Makassar 
      Strait offshore East Kalimantan in water depths of approximately 6,000 
      feet. The project will include two separate hub developments, each with 
      its own floating production unit (FPU), subsea drill centers, export gas 
      and condensate pipelines and an onshore receiving facility. Gas from the 
      project will be used both domestically and also converted to liquefied 
      natural gas (LNG) at the Bontang LNG facility in Indonesia for export. 
      Maximum daily production from the project is expected to be 1.1 billion 
      cubic feet of natural gas and 31,000 barrels of condensate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron&#8217;s Indonesia subsidiary awarded the contract for the FPUs to PT 
      Technip Indonesia; the contract for the subsea and flowline system to PT 
      Worley Parsons Indonesia; the contract for the export pipelines to PT 
      Worley Parsons Indonesia; and the contract for the onshore receiving 
      facility to PT. Singgar Mulia.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Awarding these contracts moves the Gendalo-Gehem project closer to 
      commercialization. The completion of this project will strengthen our 
      regional portfolio of major gas projects and enhance our position as a 
      leading supplier of natural gas and LNG in the Asia-Pacific region,&#8221; 
      said George Kirkland, vice chairman, Chevron.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jim Blackwell, president, Chevron Asia Pacific Exploration and 
      Production, said Chevron welcomed the opportunity to partner with 
      Indonesia in developing the country&#8217;s first ultra-deepwater natural gas 
      project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Chevron has been a key part of the energy sector in Indonesia for more 
      than 80 years and we are committed to assisting the country in 
      developing its resources, and meeting the growing demand for natural gas 
      in Indonesia and the region.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron currently has an 80 percent interest in the project and is 
      seeking regulatory approval for a partial farm-down of the holding.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! The clear implication of the higher oil prices is
that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make more
efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar screen,
dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a leading
supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details regarding
this unique opportunity please visit: www.microcapsdaily.com

    In the United States alone, there are 250 million registered passenger
vehicles and dPollution (RMGX) owns the exclusive manufacturing and
distribution rights to a patented fuel conditioning technology which
significantly increases mileage and lowers harmful GHG emissions.
dPollution's revolutionary device improves engine performance by causing
fuel to combust more thoroughly and efficiently. This technology works on
every internal combustion engine on the planet. Considering that IC
engines are used in cars, buses, trucks, diesel trains, construction
equipment, farm equipment and a variety of military vehicles the market
for this device is virtually limitless. For more information, please

providers. Alerting investors to promising early-stage small cap
companies is our specialty. It is a niche often missed by the typical Big
Board focused Wall Street investment advisor. Here at MicroCapsDaily we
know it is more valuable to spot a stock that can go from $1 - $10.00 in
a matter of days than it is to find one which can go from $10.00 -
$100.00 in a year. MicroCapsDaily provides its clients with extensive

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase is countersuing Lehman Brothers Holdings saying it was misled it into lending more than $70 billion to the bankrupt U.S. investment bank in the belief it would be repaid in full.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said in court papers that it loaned the money to Lehman Brothers on Sept 18, 2008, believing it would be paid back in full after British bank Barclays' purchase of Lehman's U.S. brokerage business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank, in a countersuit filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, contends that senior Lehman employees "greased the wheels" of a deal with Barclays Plc in exchange for future employment and allowed Barclays to buy the securities of its choice, leaving behind billions of dollars of illiquid securities with JPMorgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it loaned more than $70 billion to Lehman brothers on Sept 18, 2008, believing it would be paid back in full after British bank Barclays's purchase of Lehman's U.S. brokerage business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early this year, Lehman Brothers sued JPMorgan, accusing the second-largest U.S. bank of illegally siphoning billions of dollars of desperately-needed assets in the days leading up to its record bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lehman has also sued Barclays to recover more than $11 billion saying the British bank took advantage of market chaos to arrange an unfair "windfall profit" in its purchase of Lehman's core U.S. brokerage business in September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said that following the commencement of Lehman's liquidation on Sept 19, 2008, it was stuck with more than $25 billion of loans secured of Lehman securities that it considers toxic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Only later was JPMorgan able to determine that the position in which it unexpectedly found itself was the result of collusion and deception by Lehman and Barclays," JPMorgan said in the court filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In its countersuit, JPMorgan has requested damages and asked the court for protection from Lehman's claims of losses and liabilities against it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many portions of the 48-page filing by JPMorgan were filed under seal. However, the company has sought court approval to file an unredacted version of the documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sakthi Prasad and Santosh Nadgir in Bangalore; Editing by Matthew Jones)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - With a contract set to expire on December 11 for 27,000 service workers at Walt Disney World, neither side proposed any plan on Friday to move forward after mediation broke down a day earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Commenting on Disney's original offer, Steve Eisenhardt, vice president of Disney Parks and Resorts labor relations, said in a statement: "This is a good deal for our cast members who are clearly being misled by some union leaders."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eisenhardt was referring in part to a documentary published on YouTube by the union in which Disney employees paint a bleak picture of wages and benefits at the theme parks. The union released the documentary in its entirety after mediation broke down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The site on YouTube that is showing the film has had over 20,000 views in the last few days. I never expected that many," said Eric Clinton, president of one of the unions under the Service Trades Council which is negotiating the contract with Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clinton says the company is raising the cost of health insurance to employees by more than the proposed pay raise, meaning most employees will experience a net drop in pay. Disney, however, contends Clinton is using an example applicable to few employees, and most will bring home more money under the company's offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company and union have been in negotiations since September for a new 42-month contact. The current contract expired October 2 but has been extended. Covered employees include bus drivers, waiters, custodians, parking attendants and front desk staff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Barbara Liston; Editing by Jerry Norton)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON/TORONTO (Reuters) - U.S.-based Walter Energy Inc (WLT.N) said on Friday it will buy Canada's Western Coal WTN.TOWTN.L in a C$3.3 billion ($3.3 billion) deal that will put it on track to becoming the world's No. 3 producer of steel-making metallurgical coal at a time of booming demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walter, looking for ways to boost output since the metallurgical coal market bounced back from the global economic crisis about a year ago, will pay C$11.50 a share in cash and stock for Western Coal, a 56 percent premium to Western's share price on November 17, the day before Walter Energy announced its proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is going to create basically the largest pure play met coal producer in the world," said Meredith Brandy, an analyst at BMO Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only two companies that will be larger in terms of their presence in the met coal market are going to be BHP Billiton (BLT.L) and Teck Resources (TCKb.TO)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company does not foresee regulatory obstacles like the ones that saw Canada block BHP Billiton's $39 billion bid for Potash Corp (POT.TO) a month ago. That would have been the world's largest takeover to date this year in any industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SURGING STEEL PRODUCTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Western Coal deal plays directly to a surge in global steel production being led by China and Brazil, and will eventually double Walter's output base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enlarged Birmingham, Alabama-based company will have total coal reserves of about 385 million tons and expects to produce more than 20 million tons of coal a year by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our combined production capacity and geographic footprint leaves us extremely well positioned to benefit from favorable sector dynamics driven by increased steel production in markets such as China, India and Brazil," said Walter Energy interim Chief Executive Joe Leonard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the company will also be in an improved position to pursue more acquisitions further down the road.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A year ago, Walter and other coal producers were at the tail end of the worst recession in decades, with plunging steel and electricity demand forcing them to slice production, idle operations and cut jobs to keep prices from plummeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The slump pushed down Teck's share price by 93 percent after the company borrowed heavily to buy Fording Coal for about US$14 billion at the height of the market in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teck's shares rebounded with the industry's fortunes, and on Friday touched a record high of C$55.04.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATORY CONCERNS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal with Walter Energy, Western Coal shareholders will get about C$2.1 billion in cash and own about 14 percent of the enlarged company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Completion of the deal is contingent on approvals by Canadian courts and at least two-thirds of Western Coal shareholders, including Walter Energy and Audley Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other regulatory approvals, and a majority of the votes cast by Western Coal's shareholders excluding Walter Energy and Audley Capital, are also required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Coal has mines in British Columbia and West Virginia, and metallurgical coal makes up more than three-quarters its portfolio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to boost Walter Energy's earnings per share in the first full year after completion, which is expected by the second quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hedge fund Audley Capital, which owns about 18 percent in Western Coal, nets a C$650 million windfall from the bid, marking a return to prominence for managing partner Julian Treger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metallurgical coal is a key ingredient in about 70 percent of worldwide steel production and steel demand is forecast to hit a record 1.34 billion tonnes in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Western Coal were up 11.5 percent in Toronto at C$11.49 in early afternoon trade on Friday. Stock in Walter Energy was up 1.9 percent at $107.63 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=$1.005 Canadian)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gowri Jayakumar in Bangalore and Cameron French in Toronto; editing by Peter Galloway)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Pipe Line Co has agreed to pay a $400,000 penalty in a June 2010 Utah oil pipeline leak as federal investigators probe a new spill from the same line this week, a government spokesman said Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Officials have no projected restart date for the Rangely, Colorado, to Salt Lake City line. It has had no effect on Chevron's Salt Lake City refinery or the Rangely field, which are using storage while the line is shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The June spill of about 800 barrels entered Salt Lake City waterways. The penalty was due to safety violations found during investigation of that earlier spill, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHMSA was investigating the more recent leak of about 100 barrels, which occurred late Wednesday. It stopped short of a nearby creek, but booms were deployed anyway as a precaution during cleanup, a Chevron spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spills involved different system failures but were about 500 feet apart, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bruce Nichols; editing by Sofina Mirza-Reid)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Adaptable System Recovery (ASR) for AIX, Solaris and Linux
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Storix, Inc., provider of Unix-based backup and disaster recovery 
      solutions for AIX, Solaris and Linux systems, today announced general 
      availability of System Backup Administrator (SBAdmin) version 7.2; now 
      with support for AIX&#174; 7 and Tivoli&#174; Storage Manager 6.2. SBAdmin version 
      7.2 TSM Edition compliments an existing TSM environment with the added 
      benefit of Adaptable System Recovery (ASR), now available for AIX 7.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With SBAdmin 7.2 TSM Edition, administrators can configure and manage 
      system backups from a central management console,&#8221; says Anthony Johnson, 
      President and Founder of Storix, Inc. &#8220;Backups are written directly to a 
      TSM server, and administrators can boot and recover entire systems 
      directly from their TSM backup. SBAdmin embraces something that is 
      potentially very complicated and transforms it into an intuitive, 
      reliable, yet highly flexible system recovery solution.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Summary of SBAdmin v7.2 Features and Enhancements:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				New System Recovery Features
			
			
				Alternate Backup Networks
			
			
				AIX 7  TSM v6.2 Support
			
			
				New Backup Device Management
			
			
				Enhanced Management Interface
			
			
				Support for New ZFS Features
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      SBAdmin provides Adaptable System Recovery (ASR), the ability to rebuild 
      AIX, Solaris, or Linux systems from bare-metal, giving customers the 
      flexibility to alter the configuration as needed to fit onto any 
      hardware or virtual configuration. ASR essentially adapts a backup to 
      the hardware detected during installation, rebuilding the new system to 
      the same state as the prior system. The complete restore from bare-metal 
      can be managed locally or remotely and can take just minutes. If SBAdmin 
      detects differences between the backup and newly detected hardware, it 
      will make recommendations, such as selection of new disks or automated 
      shrinking of filesystems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The power and flexibility of ASR greatly reduces downtime during 
      disasters or planned outages by providing: system recovery onto newer or 
      virtual systems; provisioning/cloning of multiple systems; and system 
      storage alteration for improved system availability, recoverability and 
      performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SBAdmin is available for Solaris SPARC and x86/x64, all Intel-based 
      (x86/Pentium), IBM pSeries (32/64-bit) and HP Itanium 2 systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      for a single Linux/x86 client license and $842 USD for a single AIX 
      client license. Licenses include 1-year maintenance for access to 
      technical support, software updates and new releases during the coverage 
      period. Technical support is provided via phone or online, with 24/7 
      support at no charge for urgent recovery situations.

waterways. The penalty was due to safety violations found
during investigation of that earlier spill, a spokeswoman for
the U.S Pipeline and Hazardous Material Safety Administration
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHMSA was investigating the more recent leak of about 100
barrels, which occurred late Wednesday. It stopped short of a
nearby creek, but booms were deployed anyway as a precaution
during cleanup, a Chevron spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spills involved different system failures but were
about 500 feet apart, officials said.

      Research and Markets: US Technology Sector Analysis: 140,000 companies 
      such as IBM, Intel and Microsoft with Combined Annual Revenue of Nearly 
      $1.2 Trillion
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/84e29e/technology_sector) 
      has announced the addition of the "Technology 
      Sector " report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The technology sector in the US includes more than 140,000 companies 
      with combined annual revenue of nearly $1.2 trillion. Major companies 
      include ATT, IBM, Intel, and Microsoft. Industry concentration is high 
      in many segments: the largest 50 participants often generate more than 
      60 percent of segment revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The technology sector includes telecommunications, IT services, 
      semiconductor manufacturing, software, Internet services, biotechnology, 
      and scientific research, including aerospace research. Related 
      manufacturing industries covered in separate profiles include aerospace 
      products and parts, computer hardware, pharmaceuticals, and 
      telecommunications equipment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand often depends on the income of consumers or the profitability of 
      business customers, because many technology products and services are 
      expensive. The profitability of individual companies is driven by their 
      ability to develop and market new products. Large companies often have 
      advantages in access to capital and marketing. Small companies can 
      compete successfully if they have expertise in a particular field of 
      knowledge. The industry is capital-intensive: average annual revenue per 
      worker is more than $300,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      PRODUCTS, OPERATIONS  TECHNOLOGY
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Companies in the technology sector take advantage of scientific 
      discoveries and turn them into marketable products. Of the several 
      distinct fields within the technology sector, most are based on computer 
      technology. Even biotech and aerospace rely heavily on computers.

      Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Highlights: Shutterfly, Central Garden  
      Pet Company, Google, Yahoo
			and Microsoft Corp.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Zacks Equity Research highlights: Shutterfly 
      Inc. (Nasdaq: SFLY) 
      as the Bull of the Day and Central Garden  Pet Company 
      (Nasdaq: CENT) as 
      the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides 
      analysis on Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG), 
      Yahoo Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO) 
      and Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bull 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Shutterfly Inc.'s (Nasdaq: SFLY) 
      third quarter loss was lower than the Zacks Consensus Estimate, driven 
      primarily by higher revenues from the photo book. Product innovation, a 
      focus on developing a successful commercial printing business, strategic 
      partnerships with retailers and opportunistic acquisitions also bode 
      well for the company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although we find the ongoing economic weakness and rising unemployment 
      hurting the company's profitability, we believe margins will further 
      expand in the coming quarters backed by technology leverage, lower 
      material costs and labor efficiency. The holiday season is also likely 
      to act as a key driver of the stock in its ongoing fourth quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moreover, recent acquisition of WMSG will likely enhance Shutterfly's 
      presence in the commercial printing market. Hence, we maintain our 
      Outperform rating on the stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bear 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Central Garden  Pet Company (Nasdaq: CENT) 
      delivered disappointing fourth-quarter 2010 results with top line 
      continuing its sluggish performance and bottom line swinging to a loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We witnessed a weak Garden Products segment, with sales falling 17% due 
      to soft demand and lower prices. However, the Pet Products segment 
      remained the bright spot with sales increasing 5%. Although management 
      hinted increased focus on growth during fiscal 2011, a consistent 
      improvement in the stock has yet to be seen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consequently, we downgrade our recommendation to Underperform from 
      Neutral. Moreover, we will continue to hold a negative outlook on the 
      stock, until we see persistent improvement in the top line.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Yahoo Japan-Google Deal Approved
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Regulators in Japan have okayed the agreement between Yahoo Japan and Google 
      Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG), 
      which enables the former to use Google technology to power its search 
      services in the country.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      What this means is that Yahoo Japan would basically be licensing 
      Google&#8217;s search technology and touching it up with its own personalized 
      products to serve its customers better search results and ads.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The advantage to Yahoo Japan, in which Yahoo Inc. (Nasdaq: YHOO) 
      of the U.S. has a 35% stake, would be better customer satisfaction. The 
      advantage to Google is additional revenue generated from a competitor&#8217;s 
      offerings. This advantage, which will be based on the amount of searches 
      generated, may not be meager, since Yahoo Japan already holds in excess 
      of a 50% market share. Moreover, the Japanese Internet market is 
      developed, with Yahoo Japan serving 2.5 billion queries in June alone 
      (Google handled 1.6 billion queries in June).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft Corp.&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) 
      Bing has a very small share (less than 3%) of the Japanese Internet 
      market. The company&#8217;s global agreement with Yahoo meant that it should 
      have been chosen by Yahoo in Japan as well. However, Yahoo Japan, now 
      led by former Yahoo CEO, Jerry Yang, determined that Google technology 
      was more advanced, not to mention more experienced in handling Japanese 
      language queries. It is therefore no surprise that Microsoft was peeved 
      at the announcement, as was local online shopping site Rakuten, both of 
      which made applications to regulators claiming that the deal was 
      anti-competitive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As expected, regulators have set aside these concerns, although they 
      will no doubt keep an eye on things.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While we await further details of the financial impact on Google, we 
      cannot help but see it as a feather in its cap. It will be interesting 
      to see how Yahoo conducts its search business in other Asian markets 
      that do not have a strong English influence, although as things stand 
      now, Yahoo will be bound by its agreement with Microsoft.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Yahoo shares have a Zacks #3 Rank (short term Hold recommendation), 
      while Google shares have a Zacks #2 Rank (short term Buy recommendation).

			Here are highlights from Thursday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Lower Home Sales: The Tax Credit Dent
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      So paperwork flaws can be let off the hook, it seems. We had earlier 
      been worried that the chaos in foreclosure documentation would lead to 
      lower home sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Data brought out by RealtyTrac, the leading online marketplace for 
      foreclosure properties, discloses that the sale of U.S. foreclosed 
      properties fell 25% sequentially and 31% year over year in the third 
      quarter of 2010. However, the real offender here is the withdrawal of 
      tax credits by the government, or so the site claims.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RealtyTrac has also stated that the average sale price of foreclosed 
      properties in the quarter was $169,523, down 2.5% sequentially and 0.4% 
      year over year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the quarter, foreclosed homes accounted for 25% of total U.S. 
      residential property sales. The average sale price of foreclosed 
      properties was more than 32% down from the average sale price of 
      properties not in the foreclosure process. This compares with a 26% 
      discount in the prior quarter and a 29% discount in the year-ago quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			What Drove the Lower Sales
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Due to the expiry of federal homebuyer tax credits in April, a slowdown 
      in the overall housing market was witnessed. This was primarily 
      responsible for the decline in third quarter sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rampant paperwork lapses in evaluating the authenticity of information 
      provided in the mortgage documents have embroiled major lenders 
      including Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC), 
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) 
      and PNC Financial Services Group Inc. (NYSE: PNC) 
      in a number of lawsuits by homeowners in September. As a result, these 
      lenders have temporarily suspended foreclosures. Though this was not a 
      momentous factor in the third quarter, there could be a significant 
      impact on fourth quarter sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RealtyTrac has already noticed a decline in foreclosure sales in 
      November as a result of the hangover of paperwork mess. Additionally, 
      December is a slow period by tradition, so only a few home sales are 
      expected in the final month of the fourth quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Reaction of Buyers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      From the buyers&#8217; point of view, a weaker demand for foreclosed 
      properties due to the expiry of homebuyer tax credits and restlessness 
      arising from the paperwork mess has afforded more space to bargain for 
      better prices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, in some markets such as Las Vegas, the competition for buying 
      foreclosed properties is still very high and would stop prices from 
      climbing down.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Solution Ahoy?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a redemptive measure, lawmakers and bank regulators are pushing 
      lenders to modify loans rather than foreclose, which could probably 
      lessen the paperwork flaws.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Congressional Oversight Panel is also pushing for loan modifications 
      as any more untidiness could damage the Home Affordable Modification 
      Program (HAMP), the main foreclosure prevention effort of the Treasury.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      U.S. bank regulators and a task force of Attorneys General (AGs) of all 
      50 states of the nation are gearing up to settle the foreclosure issue 
      at large financial institutions early next year. This would undoubtedly 
      lessen the threat looming on housing recovery. But the aftermath of 
      faulty paperwork might still make it difficult for the lenders to find 
      home buyers in the years to come. The foreclosure mess would probably 
      cast a long shadow on the U.S. housing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One of the important approaches of the upcoming settlement is that major 
      lenders would contribute money into a fund that will be used to 
      compensate borrowers who have lost homes due to the foreclosure, if they 
      can prove that they were the victims of the flawed paperwork. The AGs 
      would administer the payment process.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Homes Still at Risk?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Some of the analysts feel that the documentation mess may hinder 
      potential buyers in the short term, but the upshot will not change in 
      the long run and there will be no impact on housing recovery as such. 
      However, after reviewing the foreclosure sales data of the current 
      quarter as well as the expectations for the next quarter, we think the 
      problem is going to persist for a longer period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Also, there will definitely be a significant stress in housing recovery 
      as lenders could be unable to prove their ownership on mortgage loans 
      due to wrong documentation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While the negative sentiment about the expiry of the homebuyer tax 
      credits has already been factored in the third quarter, the issue of the 
      paperwork mess will linger. We will have to wait till the settlement to 
      see how strong the initiatives are to fend off the distress.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			DB Partners with Informatica
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Provider of business information, Dun  Bradstreet Corp. 
      (NYSE: DNB) announced 
      its partnership with Informatica Corp. (Nasdaq: INFA), 
      the premier provider of data integration software. The partnership is 
      formed with the intent to offer a new technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Informatica Cloud will enable cloud-based, on-demand access to DB via 
      the latter&#8217;s recently introduced data-as-a-service solution, entitled 
      DB360. The solution reduces data quality challenges and improves 
      productivity through its on-demand access to users.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We expect DB to benefit from the partnership, going forward. DB&#8217;s key 
      differentiating characteristics are its database management and credit 
      information products&#8217; marketing capabilities in domestic as well as 
      international markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Informatica Cloud will provide the back-end integration platform for 
      DB360, providing critical data integration, data synchronization and 
      data quality as an on-demand service, according to management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Users will benefit from automatically updated insights via integration 
      and synchronization capabilities provided by Informatica from DB's 
      database.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Informatica Cloud will support the on-demand model fundamental to 
      data-as-a-service, and provide the performance and scalability required 
      to keep users adequately posted, the company pointed out.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We feel that DB will continue to gain from the inclusion of value-added 
      products in its mix, as customers express greater interest in buying 
      such offerings to improve their own businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      DB&#8217;s third quarter 2010 earnings beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate. DB 
      also affirmed its 2010 guidance. The growth was primarily driven by the 
      strength in emerging markets and a robust demand for the company's 
      products and service.

      The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a surprise 
      climb in crude stockpiles, while distillate supplies posted a 
      smaller-than-expected draw. The agency&#8217;s report further added that 
      refinery utilization dropped sharply and gasoline inventories climbed 
      last week.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Energy Information Administration (&#8220;EIA&#8221;) Petroleum Status Report &#8211; 
      that contains data for the previous week ending on Friday &#8211; outlines 
      information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held 
      and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad. This report provides 
      an overview on the level of reserves and their movements, thereby 
      helping investors to understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum 
      products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that 
      affect businesses of companies engaged in oil and refining industry like ExxonMobil 
      (NYSE: XOM), Chevron 
      Corp. (NYSE: CVX), 
      ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), 
      Valero (NYSE: VLO) 
      and Tesoro (NYSE: TSO).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Crude Oil
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The federal government&#8217;s EIA reported that crude inventories rose by 
      1,066 thousand barrels for the week ending November 26, 2010, against 
      expectation of a drop. The increase in oil stocks, the second in as many 
      weeks, can be attributed to curtailed refinery operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At 359.7 million barrels, crude supplies are 5.8% above the year-earlier 
      level and remain above the upper limit of the average for this time of 
      the year. The crude supply cover, at 25.4 days, remained unchanged from 
      the previous week. In the year-ago period, the supply cover was 24.5 
      days.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Gasoline
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Supplies of gasoline rose for the second consecutive week, though the 
      increase was less than forecasted. The 561 thousand barrels jump came on 
      the back of a rise in blending components inventories. At 210.2 million 
      barrels, current stockpiles are 1.8% below the year-earlier levels but 
      still remain in the upper half of the average range.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Distillate
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Distillate fuel inventories (including diesel and heating oil) were down 
      by 194 thousand barrels last week, less than anticipated. The decrease 
      in distillate fuel supplies reflects a dip in imports and lower 
      production levels. At 158.1 million barrels, distillate supplies were 
      4.6% less than the year-ago level and just below the upper boundary of 
      the average range for this time of the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Refinery Rates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Refinery utilization was down 2.9% from the prior week to 82.6%. 
      Analysts were looking for the refinery run rate to increase to 85.94%.

&lt;p&gt;   * Expects a gradual erosion in the long-term HDD market&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cites RIM's lossing market share&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dec 3 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Marvell
Technology Group (MRVL.O) a notch to 'neutral' citing the
company's  limited exposure to the growing tablet market and
signs of slowing growth at Research in Motion RIM.TO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Santa Clara, California-based Marvell draws majority of its
revenue through sales of its Hard Disk Drive (HDD) controllers
and also sells chips used in smartphones including the
Blackberry Torch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst James Schneider, who has a $22 target price on the
stock warned of a the growing adoption of tablets over netbooks
and laptops as a possible catalyst for cannibalisation of HDD
sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Hard drive unit growth is likely to slow substantially in
2011... We expect a gradual erosion in the long-term HDD market
unit growth rate given the secular threat posed by alternative
storage solutions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tablets and other small-form factor computing devices are
heralding the switch to flash memory and Solid State Drives
(SSDs) from the traditional HDDs because of their inherent
speed and size advantage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wireless and mobile business is likely to slow down
with RIM subscribers falling and uncertainty over China
Mobile's (0941.HK) 'Ophone' opportunity -- for which Marvell is
a key supplier, Schneider said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Marvell last month gave fourth-quarter outlook that lagged
estimates on account of seasonality in its wireless and mobile
business. [ID:nSGE6AH003]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares, which have gained 6 percent since the
start of  the Nov-January quarter, closed at $20.46 on Thursday
on Nasdaq. They were down 3 percent at $19.46 in pre-market

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S.-based mining group Walter Energy Inc (WLT.N) is to buy Canada's Western Coal WTN.TO WTN.L for C$3.3 billion ($3.3 billion) to create one of the largest producers of steel-making metallurgical coal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal shows how surging global steel production, driven mainly by China, is stimulating MA activity in the mining sector, with coal producers scrambling to take advantage of booming Asian demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy will pay C$11.50 a share, a 56 percent premium to Western Coal's closing price on November 17, the day before Walter Energy announced its proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a transformative transaction at a time when global demand for metallurgical coal is surging," said Joe Leonard, interim Chief Executive of Walter Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enlarged company will have total coal reserves of about 385 million tons and expects to produce more than 20 million tons of coal by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the deal, Western Coal shareholders will get about C$2.1 billion in cash and own about 14 percent of the enlarged company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The transaction is expected to boost Walter Energy's earnings per share in the first full year after completion which is expected by the second quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walter Energy had said on November 18 that it was in talks to buy its Canadian peer and on Thursday extended the 14-day period for exclusive talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The completion of the deal is contingent on approvals by Canadian courts and at least two-thirds of Western Coal shareholders' votes, including Walter Energy and Audley Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other regulatory approvals, and a majority of the votes cast by Western Coal's shareholders excluding Walter Energy and Audley Capital, at a special meeting of shareholders, are also required.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hedge fund Audley Capital, which owns about 18 percent in Western Coal, netted a C$650 million windfall from the bid, marking a return to prominence for managing partner Julian Treger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Western Coal's financial adviser is RBC Capital, and Walter Energy is being advised by Morgan Stanley  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steelmaking or metallurgical coal is a key ingredient used in about 70 percent of worldwide steel production and with steel demand forecast to hit a record 1.34 billion tonnes in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our combined production capacity and geographic footprint leaves us extremely well positioned to benefit from favorable sector dynamics driven by increased steel production in markets such as China, India and Brazil," said Leonard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in London-listed Western Coal were up 7.2 percent at 0933 GMT, outperforming a 0.1 percent climb in a British mining index .FTNMX1770&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Gowri Jayakumar in Bangalore; Editing by Matt Scuffham and Jane Merriman)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=1.014 CANADIAN DOLLAR)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Julie Crust &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Dec 3 (Reuters) - U.S.-based mining group Walter
Energy Inc (WLT.N) is to buy Canada's Western Coal WTN.TO
WTN.L for C$3.3 billion ($3.3 billion) to create the world's
leading producer of metallurgical coal used by steelmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal shows how surging global steel production, driven
mainly by China, is stimulating MA activity in the mining
sector, with coal producers scrambling to take advantage of
booming Asian demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter Energy will pay C$11.50 a share, a 56 percent premium
to Western Coal's closing price on Nov. 17, the day before
Walter Energy announced its proposal. [ID:nSGE6AH0BN]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a transformative transaction at a time when global
demand for metallurgical coal is surging," said Joe Leonard,
interim Chief Executive of Walter Energy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The enlarged company will have total coal reserves of about
385 million tons and expects to produce more than 20 million
tons of coal by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the deal, Western Coal shareholders will get about
C$2.1 billion in cash and own about 14 percent of the enlarged
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The transaction is expected to boost Walter Energy's
earnings per share in the first full year after completion which
is expected by the second quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter Energy had said on Nov. 18 that it was in talks to
buy its Canadian peer and on Thursday extended the 14-day period
for exclusive talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

sector dynamics driven by increased steel production in markets
such as China, India and Brazil," said Leonard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in London-listed Western Coal were up 7.2 percent at

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Dec 3 (Reuters) - Indonesian state oil and gas 
firm PT Pertamina said on Friday it had signed an agreement 
with Exxon Mobil to make it a partner in the 
development of the huge Natuna gas field, and was still 
talking to other potential partners.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pertamina, which does not have the technical expertise or 
financing to develop the project alone, has said it wants to 
keep a 40 percent stake, with 60 percent to be shared among 
partners. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said the agreement signified progress in 
negotiations to commercialise the Natuna gas field. 
Negotiations on the field have been running for years and 
development is still likely to remain years away.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The agreement provides a framework for finalizing 
negotiations and working cooperatively to optimize the 
development of this world class and technically challenging 
resource," said Maman Budiman, a spokesman for Exxon.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Natuna D-Alpha block has about 222 trillion cubic feet 
(tcf) of which 46 tcf is thought to be commercially recoverable.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Natuna block is about 1,100 kilometres (700 miles) 
north of Jakarta and 200 km east of the West Natuna fields, 
which feeds gas to Singapore and accounts for about a quarter 
of Indonesia's total commercially recoverable gas reserves of 
182 tcf. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2008 Indonesia named eight potential partners: Petronas 
 , Exxon Mobil , Chevron , Total 
 , Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), Statoil , Eni 
 , and CNPC, which is the parent of PetroChina 
 .

&lt;p&gt;MILAN (Reuters) - Allowing European states to become insolvent makes no sense and imposing taxes on banks indiscriminately is not right, JP Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an interview with Italy's Il Sole 24 Ore, Dimon said if a European state became insolvent and there was a default on its debt, Europe would find itself having to save the banks holding that country's bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I don't think that's the way to go," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said if a European state was allowed to default on its debt "the situation would precipitate triggering a whole chain of events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Maastricht Treaty had not worked and its criteria needed changing, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the idea of taxing banks for triggering the financial crisis, Damon said indiscriminate taxes do not work. "Only those that made a mistake should be punished," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the new taxes introduced in the UK were a good example of his point. "They are indiscriminate and so not fair."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said banks that have made mistakes should be allowed to go bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he agreed with higher capital requirements for banks and liquidity standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But we are now running the risk of excessive regulation and creating confusion and duplicating many norms," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Stephen Jewkes; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  TAMPA, FL and VANCOUVER, BC, Dec 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT) and Western Coal Corp. (TSX: WTN) (TSX: WTN.WT)
(AIM: WTN) announced today that they have entered into an arrangement
agreement (the "Agreement") for Walter Energy to acquire all of the
outstanding common shares of Western Coal for CAD$11.50 per share in cash
or 0.114 of a Walter Energy share, or for a combination thereof, all
subject to proration. The transaction represents a total enterprise value
of CAD$3.3 billion (USD$3.3 billion), net of cash on the balance sheet
for Western Coal. The Agreement follows announcements on Nov. 18, 2010 by
Walter Energy and Western Coal that they had begun exclusive negotiations
regarding the potential business combination.

    The transaction will create the world's leading, publicly traded,
"pure-play" metallurgical coal producer with total coal reserves of
approximately 385 million tons(1) and a significant and growing
production profile balanced between Walter Energy's current high
productivity assets and Western Coal's high growth assets in Canada, the
United States and the United Kingdom. The combined company expects to
produce in excess of 20 million tons of coal by 2012. It will also be the
only producer with cost advantaged transportation access to the high
growth Asian and South American seaborne metallurgical coal markets. 

    "This is a transformative transaction at a time when global demand for
metallurgical coal is surging," said Joe Leonard, interim chief executive
officer of Walter Energy. "Western Coal has an attractive high-quality
metallurgical coal asset base and has embarked on an organic growth
strategy that is expected to increase production more than 60 percent by
fiscal 2013. It is a unique strategic fit with Walter Energy's large
scale, high-productivity mines which produce premium-quality
metallurgical coal for customers in South America and Europe. Our
combined production capacity and geographic footprint leaves us extremely
well positioned to benefit from favorable sector dynamics driven by
increased steel production in markets such as China, India and Brazil.
Bottom line, this is the right transaction at the right time."

    The transaction is expected to be accretive to Walter Energy's earnings
per share in the first full year following the close of the transaction,
with continued strong operating cash flows derived from existing
production assets and high return on investment capital expected from
development projects. 

    Keith Calder, president and chief executive officer of Western Coal,
said, "We are pleased to be combining with Walter Energy and believe this
transaction offers Western Coal's shareholders immediate value as well as
future upside from their ownership of approximately 14 percent of the
combined company. The combined business will have substantial reserves
and an experienced management team focused on safety, growth and
shareholder value. With its size and financial strength, the combined
business will have future growth opportunities that neither one of us
would have on our own."

    The agreed price of CAD$11.50 represented a 56 percent premium to Western
Coal's closing share price of CAD$7.38 on Nov. 17, 2010, the day before
Walter Energy announced it had submitted a proposal to Western Coal. 

    Mr. Leonard concluded, "We see tremendous opportunity for the
stakeholders of both companies and we will work closely with the Canadian
national and provincial authorities to give careful attention to any
sensitivities, provide detail on the potential of the combined company
and to describe the broad benefits of this combination."

    Transaction Details

    The transaction will be effected by way of a statutory plan of
arrangement pursuant to the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia).
Under the terms of the agreement, Western Coal shareholders will be
permitted to exchange each of their Western Coal shares for, at their
election, CAD$11.50 in cash or 0.114 of a Walter Energy share (the
"merger consideration"), or for some combination thereof. All elections
will be subject to proration if total cash elections exceed 70 percent of
the total merger consideration to be paid or total share elections exceed
30 percent of the total merger consideration.

    The total amount of cash to be paid to Western Coal shareholders under
the transaction is expected to be approximately CAD$2.1 billion (USD$2.1
billion) and the total number of shares of Walter Energy shares to be
issued to Western Coal shareholders under the transaction is expected to
be approximately 9 million. These amounts assume that 278.1 million
Western Coal shares participate in the arrangement, being a fully diluted
amount of 290.9 million shares, less the 25.3 million shares acquired
under the first closing of Walter Energy's share purchase agreement
announced on Nov. 18, 2010. This further assumes that the second closing
under the share purchase agreement for a further purchase of 29.3 million
Western Coal shares is completed for the merger consideration. Should
this second purchase occur under a separate applicable cash option it
would not affect the merger consideration for remaining shareholders of
Western Coal. The exchange ratio to determine the number of shares to be
issued to Western Coal shareholders was based on a Walter Energy share
price of USD$99.35, which is equal to the 20-day volume weighted average
closing price as of Dec. 1, 2010. Walter Energy has fully committed
financing for the cash portion of the consideration. 

    Following the completion of the transaction, Walter Energy will maintain
its primary listing on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol WLT.
In connection with the transaction, Walter Energy will also apply for a
listing on the Toronto Stock Exchange. Upon completion of the
transaction, three directors nominated by the Western Coal board of
directors will be added to the Walter Energy board of directors. The
senior management team, including the CEO, will be announced prior to the
transaction's closing. 

    The Agreement has been unanimously approved by both companies' boards of
directors and is expected to be completed by the second quarter of 2011.

    An independent committee of Western Coal's board of directors, as part of
the process and in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements,
received a formal valuation of the Western Coal shares from National Bank
Financial. In addition, National Bank Financial has provided an opinion
that, as of Dec. 2, 2010, the consideration under the proposed
transaction is fair, from a financial point of view, to Western Coal's
shareholders other than Walter Energy, Audley Capital Advisors LLP and
their respective associates and affiliates. The board of directors of
Western Coal has also received an opinion from RBC Capital Markets that,
as of Dec. 2, 2010, the consideration under the transaction is fair, from
a financial point of view, to Western Coal's shareholders other than
Walter Energy, Audley Capital Advisors LLP and their respective
associates and affiliates. 

    Morgan Stanley &amp; Co. Incorporated is acting as financial advisor and
Simpson Thacher &amp; Bartlett LLP and Osler, Hoskin &amp; Harcourt LLP are
acting as legal counsel to Walter Energy. 

    RBC Capital Markets is acting as financial advisor to Western Coal.
Goodmans LLP is acting as Western Coal's Canadian legal counsel and Paul,
Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &amp; Garrison LLP as Western's US legal counsel.
Western Coal's UK advisors are Trowers &amp; Hamlins LLP (legal) and Cenkos
Securities plc (Nominated Advisor and Broker). National Bank Financial is
acting as the independent valuator to Western Coal's independent
committee. 

    Regulatory Matters and Other Closing Conditions

    Completion of the transaction is subject to customary closing conditions,
including Canadian court approvals, a favorable vote of at least (i)
two-thirds of the votes cast by Western Coal shareholders (including
Walter Energy and Audley Capital Advisors LLP) and (ii) a majority of the
votes cast by Western Coal's shareholders excluding Walter Energy and
Audley Capital Advisors LLP, at a special meeting of shareholders, and
the receipt of all necessary regulatory approvals. Approval by Walter
Energy shareholders is not required to complete the transaction. The
definitive agreement includes a customary non-solicit clause applicable
to Western Coal and provides for the payment of a CAD$99 million break-up
fee if the transaction is terminated in certain circumstances. 

    Western Coal will call a special meeting of shareholders to approve the
transaction. In connection with the special meeting, Western will mail an
information circular to its shareholders providing further details of the
transaction. Walter Energy beneficially owns and controls a total of
54,547,858 common shares of Western Coal, representing approximately 19.6
percent of the outstanding common shares of Western Coal. Walter Energy
intends to vote these shares in favor of the transaction at the special
meeting.

    Western Coal's shareholders are cautioned that an arrangement where they
would receive Walter Energy shares directly will result in a taxable
event for Canadian shareholders and shareholders in the United States.

&lt;p&gt;MILAN Dec 3 (Reuters) - Allowing European states to become
insolvent makes no sense and imposing taxes on banks
indiscriminately is not right, JP Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon said
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In an interview with Italy's Il Sole 24 Ore, Dimon said if a
European state became insolvent and there was a default on its
debt, Europe would find itself having to save the banks holding
that country's bonds. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think that's the way to go," Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said if a European state was allowed to default on its
debt "the situation would precipitate triggering a whole chain
of events."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Maastricht Treaty had not worked and its criteria needed
changing, Dimon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On the idea of taxing banks for triggering the financial
crisis, Damon said indiscriminate taxes do not work. "Only those
that made a mistake should be punished," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the new taxes introduced in the UK were a good
example of his point. "They are indiscriminate and so not fair."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said banks that have made mistakes should be allowed
to go bankrupt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said he agreed with higher capital requirements for banks
and liquidity standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But we are now running the risk of excessive regulation and
creating confusion and duplicating many norms," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Stephen Jewkes; Editing by David Cowell)

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO Dec 3 (Reuters) - The head of investment banking in
Japan for JP Morgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is set to leave the firm
at a time when the Wall Street giant has been boosting its
presence in the country, sources say.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Yuichi Jimbo, who joined JP Morgan in 1998, will no longer be
the bank's head of investment banking, five people with direct
knowledge of the matter said, asking not to be named because it
has not been publicly announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. bank was ranked No.2 in advising on mergers and
acquisitions for Japanese companies for the 11 months to November
this year, according to Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the No.5 underwriter for equity sales by Japanese
companies for the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, JP Morgan appointed Christopher Harvey as head of
Japan business, replacing Greg Guyett, who was transferred to
London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JP Morgan spokeswoman in Tokyo declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - "Tangled" could move up to the top spot at North American box office this weekend, after the animated take on the Rapunzel fable narrowly failed to unseat Harry Potter during last weekend's Thanksgiving-stretched session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Tangled" enjoyed a five-day debut of almost $69 million, with $49 million of that coming Friday through Sunday. So even with half as much box office this weekend, that would be a $25 million haul for the Disney cartoon's second session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1" fetched $50 million during the three-day period, a 60 percent slide, and is thus sitting in a similar situation. After 13 days, the seventh film in Warner Bros.' boy-wizard series has earned $225 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While "Tangled" was one of four wide new releases last weekend, the upcoming round sees just one rookie: "The Warrior's Way," which is likely to debut in the middle single-digit millions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A $42 million New Zealand project, the Relativity Films-distributed R-rated pic is set in the U.S. badlands and thus something of a Western. Korean actor Dong-gun Jang plays an Asian warrior assassin forced to hide in a small town. Geoffrey Rush, Kate Bosworth and Danny Huston also star. Sngmoo Lee wrote and directed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Male youngsters form the target audience, but must-see interest is slack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also this weekend, Fox Searchlight opens Natalie Portman starrer "The Black Swan" in eight markets. The atmospheric suspenser is among a handful of prestige pictures seeking to use awards-season promos to fuel their initial runs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry pundits will also see if Sony's dance musical "Burlesque," Fox's romantic comedy "Love and Other Drugs" and CBS Films' actioner "Faster" can get a firmer footing after stumbling out of the blocks last weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Dec 6 (Reuters) - Investment bank JP Morgan 
Chase holds between 50 and 80 percent of the 350,000 
tonnes of copper held in London Metal Exchange warehouses, the 
UK's Telegraph newspaper reported, citing a source close to 
the situation.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The report said that the amount was closer to the "lower 
portion of the between 50%/80% range" disclosed by the LME.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JP Morgan official declined to comment.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to the article JP Morgan's name had been 
circulating the market all Thursday as the most likely buyer, 
especially since it is about to launch a physically-backed 
exchange-traded fund  in copper. [ID:nL3E6N30A6]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But traders questioned by Reuters asked why the bank would 
be willing to pay a premium for cash metal -- currently at 
around $50 a tonne MCU0-3 -- when they could buy longer 
dated material at a discount.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't believe the ETF will launch that quickly. It 
makes no sense to launch this year -- I'd wait until after the 
Chinese New Year. These are smart guys. They have it all 
planned out and will have timed their buys so contracts come 
due when they want to launch," a trader in Hong Kong said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Wall Street initially welcomed the abrupt departure of Pfizer Inc CEO Jeffrey Kindler, but quickly turned to questions about the condition of the pharmaceutical company and the behavior of its board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many analysts were amazed that the world's top drugmaker -- a Dow component company, worth $130 billion -- could lose its chief without warning on a Sunday night and with no explanation beyond a claim that the job was simply too tiring for Kindler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pfizer board immediately promoted company veteran and global head of pharmaceutical operations Ian Read, apparently not bothering with a wider CEO search.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has to raise some red flags, and if nothing else, it's poor communication by Pfizer," said Tom Villalta, lead portfolio manager for Jones Villalta Opportunity Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Couldn't the transition have been done more tactfully?" Villalta said. "I like Read's marketing experience and don't think he's a bad choice. But this is a weird way to replace the CEO of one of the largest companies in the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Pfizer rose as much as 2.2 percent on the news of Kindler's resignation, as investors hoped Read would push through asset sales, cost cuts, share buybacks or higher dividends to boost the company's lackluster share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the stock ended the day barely higher with a rise of 0.4 percent, as the suddenness of the news suggested disorganization at Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mike Krensavage, principal at Krensavage Management LLC and a long-time drug industry watcher, said Kindler, 55, had yet to lead Pfizer through the biggest challenge in its history: the U.S. patent expiration of its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol drug in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a big surprise," Krensavage said. "Companies usually have a more orderly change of leadership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nell Minow, editor of GovernanceMetrics International, an independent research firm specializing in corporate governance, said boards have become "a bit trigger-happy when it comes to CEOs," calling it the "new normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're living in an off-with-his-head environment," Minow said. "I'm not saying they should have given him more time. I am saying they should have been clearer with him about what they wanted... This situation reflects poorly on the board. It makes them look impulsive and desperate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, few shed tears over Kindler's exit. Over the course of his tenure, which began in July 2006, Pfizer's shares have lost 27 percent of their value, underperforming a 10 percent decline in the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index of large drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For a graphic on Pfizer's stock performance versus Merck's, see: r.reuters.com/xeh78q)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A lawyer by trade, Kindler was previously Pfizer's general counsel and before that led the McDonald's owned Boston Market restaurant chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts said Read could be more active since he knows the pharmaceutical business inside out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have long thought it would be very positive if Kindler left," said Jordan Schreiber, senior investment officer of Princeton Capital Management Inc. "The manner was highly unusual, but I'm glad he's gone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler said in a statement issued by Pfizer on Sunday night that the job had been "extremely demanding" and that he wanted to "recharge my batteries." He was also replaced by Sanofi-Aventis CEO Christopher Viehbacher as chairman at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America trade group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are hopeful there will be some more aggressive restructuring that takes place within Pfizer," said Edward Jones analyst Linda Bannister. "We're up against the patent expiration of Lipitor...It's right around the corner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler's departure comes more than a year after Pfizer completed the signature move of his tenure -- the $67 billion acquisition of rival Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That acquisition, which brought Pfizer more access to biotech drugs and vaccines as well as cost cuts, was intended to help Pfizer maneuver through the decline of Lipitor. But the deal has failed to spur stock gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin said she had "long argued that Pfizer should be more aggressive in achieving greater efficiencies in both its $28.5 billion operating expenses base as well as its massive balance sheet and portfolio of various businesses, some of which should be divested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are delighted to see the board taking action as Pfizer's share price continues to underperform amid a flurry of questions about strategic direction," Rubin said in research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said the CEO change could lead to more aggressive actions at Pfizer, including share repurchases or dividend increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While a CEO transition in the midst of a major merger integration will likely create added uncertainty with the story, the key question, in our view, remains on the changes this transition will bring to the Pfizer story," Schott said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rubin of Goldman Sachs called Read, who joined Pfizer in 1978, a "seasoned executive with over 20 years of experience running many different regions and businesses in pharma."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Some investors may be concerned that the new CEO may not shake up the company to the degree that some would like to see, but he has the ability to focus the strategy and get the ship going in the right direction," Rubin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Read can only do so much restructuring, and the company will need some promising experimental drugs to succeed, Edward Jones' Bannister said, citing drugs in development for pain, rheumatoid arthritis, blood clots and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In order for the stock to really start to move on a sustainable basis, it's going to have to come from positive results from their pipeline," Bannister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares ended up 7 cents at $16.80 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf and Ransdell Pierson.

 (New throughout, adds analyst, investor, governance expert
comments)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lewis Krauskopf and Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Wall Street initially welcomed
the abrupt departure of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) CEO Jeffrey Kindler,
but quickly turned to questions about the condition of the
pharmaceutical company and the behavior of its board.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many analysts were amazed that the world's top drugmaker --
a Dow component company, worth $130 billion -- could lose its
chief without warning on a Sunday night and with no explanation
beyond a claim that the job was simply too tiring for Kindler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Pfizer board immediately promoted company veteran and
global head of pharmaceutical operations Ian Read, apparently
not bothering with a wider CEO search. [ID:nN05154682]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It has to raise some red flags, and if nothing else, it's
poor communication by Pfizer," said Tom Villalta, lead
portfolio manager for Jones Villalta Opportunity Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Couldn't the transition have been done more tactfully?"
Villalta said. "I like Read's marketing experience and don't
think he's a bad choice. But this is a weird way to replace the
CEO of one of the largest companies in the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Pfizer rose as much as 2.2 percent on the news of
Kindler's resignation, as investors hoped Read would push
through asset sales, cost cuts, share buybacks or higher
dividends to boost the company's lackluster share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the stock ended the day barely higher with a rise of
0.4 percent, as the suddenness of the news suggested
disorganization at Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mike Krensavage, principal at Krensavage Management LLC and
a long-time drug industry watcher, said Kindler, 55, had yet to
lead Pfizer through the biggest challenge in its history: the
U.S. patent expiration of its top-selling Lipitor cholesterol
drug in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a big surprise," Krensavage said. "Companies usually
have a more orderly change of leadership."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nell Minow, editor of GovernanceMetrics International, an
independent research firm specializing in corporate governance,
said boards have become "a bit trigger-happy when it comes to
CEOs," calling it the "new normal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're living in an off-with-his-head environment," Minow
said. "I'm not saying they should have given him more time. I
am saying they should have been clearer with him about what
they wanted... This situation reflects poorly on the board. It
makes them look impulsive and desperate."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, few shed tears over Kindler's exit. Over the course
of his tenure, which began in July 2006, Pfizer's shares have
lost 27 percent of their value, underperforming a 10 percent
decline in the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index .DRG of large
drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For a graphic on Pfizer's stock performance versus
Merck's, see: r.reuters.com/xeh78q)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lawyer by trade, Kindler was previously Pfizer's general
counsel and before that led the McDonald's owned Boston Market
restaurant chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said Read could be more active since he knows the
pharmaceutical business inside out. [ID:nN06184388]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I have long thought it would be very positive if Kindler
left," said Jordan Schreiber, senior investment officer of
Princeton Capital Management Inc. "The manner was highly
unusual, but I'm glad he's gone." (For a Breakingviews column
on Kindler's departure, click here: [ID:nN06130833] )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler said in a statement issued by Pfizer on Sunday
night that the job had been "extremely demanding" and that he
wanted to "recharge my batteries." [ID:nN05154682] He was also
replaced by Sanofi-Aventis (SASY.PA) CEO Christopher Viehbacher
as chairman at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America trade group. [ID:nN06225072]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "People are hopeful there will be some more aggressive
restructuring that takes place within Pfizer," said Edward
Jones analyst Linda Bannister. "We're up against the patent
expiration of Lipitor...It's right around the corner."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler's departure comes more than a year after Pfizer
completed the signature move of his tenure -- the $67 billion
acquisition of rival Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That acquisition, which brought Pfizer more access to
biotech drugs and vaccines as well as cost cuts, was intended
to help Pfizer maneuver through the decline of Lipitor. But the
deal has failed to spur stock gains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin said she had "long argued
that Pfizer should be more aggressive in achieving greater
efficiencies in both its $28.5 billion operating expenses base
as well as its massive balance sheet and portfolio of various
businesses, some of which should be divested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are delighted to see the board taking action as
Pfizer's share price continues to underperform amid a flurry of
questions about strategic direction," Rubin said in research
note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said the CEO change could
lead to more aggressive actions at Pfizer, including share
repurchases or dividend increases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While a CEO transition in the midst of a major merger
integration will likely create added uncertainty with the
story, the key question, in our view, remains on the changes
this transition will bring to the Pfizer story," Schott said in
a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rubin of Goldman Sachs called Read, who joined Pfizer in
1978, a "seasoned executive with over 20 years of experience
running many different regions and businesses in pharma."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some investors may be concerned that the new CEO may not
shake up the company to the degree that some would like to see,
but he has the ability to focus the strategy and get the ship
going in the right direction," Rubin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Read can only do so much restructuring, and the company
will need some promising experimental drugs to succeed, Edward
Jones' Bannister said, citing drugs in development for pain,
rheumatoid arthritis, blood clots and Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In order for the stock to really start to move on a
sustainable basis, it's going to have to come from positive
results from their pipeline," Bannister said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's shares ended up 7 cents at $16.80 on the New York
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt; * Extensive operational experience cited&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Has had roles in developed and emerging markets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Seen as having strengths Kindler lacked&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Four years ago, Pfizer Inc
(PFE.N) put its faith in a lawyer who used to sell chicken
dinners. Now, it's trying someone who knows the business inside
out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ian Read, who was elevated to chief executive of Pfizer Inc
following the sudden Sunday night departure of Jeffrey Kindler,
is a 30-year veteran of the world's largest drugmaker and has
the right pedigree to run the company, analysts and investors
said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read, a Scot who joined Pfizer in 1978, was most recently
head of worldwide biopharmaceutical businesses, which accounts
for about 85 percent of the company's revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That makes him more involved with and knowledgeable about
Pfizer's products, day-to-day operations and science than
Kindler, whose was general counsel before becoming CEO in 2006.
Before that, he led the McDonald's-owned Boston Market
restaurant chain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Having someone who really knows the nuts and bolts of the
organization could really help the organization," said
Morningstar analyst Damien Conover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While Kindler's departure raises a few red flags ... we
believe Ian Read's over 30 years of experience at the company
and his most recent appointment as the leader of the worldwide
biopharmaceuticals well positions him for the top spot,"
Conover said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He has a strong grasp of different parts of this huge
company. He's very methodical and disciplined," said Conover,
who thinks Read will rapidly cut costs in the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 57-year-old Read steps into the breach as Pfizer late
next year faces the patent expiration -- and rapid loss of
revenue -- on the world's biggest selling prescription drug
Lipitor. Pfizer is also widely seen as having failed under
Kindler's tenure to produce any important new medicines despite
the industry's largest research and development budget by far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Read is old school pharma, without doubt cut out of the
old industry model," said Christopher Bowe, U.S. healthcare
analyst for Informa-Scrip Intelligence. "I think he's a pretty
hard-nosed businessman. He had to be tough to survive in
Pfizer's commercial operations for 30 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has addressed its lack of in-house productivity
through acquisitions large and small, as well as numerous
licensing deals to latch onto innovative science discovered by
others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer, in contrast to other (pharmaceutical) companies,
has been a marketing company more than a research-led company,"
said Jordan Schreiber, senior investment officer for Princeton
Capital Management Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Read's experience as head of sales and marketing is
important. He has the type of experience for which the company
has been famous," said Schreiber, who sees Read being more
aggressive in outsourcing than Kindler, whom he described as
lacking "that sense of urgency."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's $67 billion acquisition of rival Wyeth last year
-- the deal for which Kindler's tenure will be most closely
associated -- failed to jumpstart the company's share price.
Pfizer shares are down some 5 percent since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that the board was probably unhappy with the
pace of change, morale and RD productivity at Pfizer and
believed a change was necessary," Cowen and Co analyst Steve
Scala said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors and analysts have also been unhappy with a lack
of detail about how Pfizer would be able to meet its optimistic
2012 earnings and revenue goals without obvious replacements
for lost revenue from Lipitor, which despite recent sales
declines still brings in more than $11 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Read is well equipped to manage Pfizer, having been
responsible for Pfizer's five largest business units.
Additionally, Read has extensive international management
experience, having run Pfizer's International Pharmaceuticals
Group with responsibilities in Latin America, Canada and
Africa/Middle East," Scala said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to those regions, Europe was put under Read's
purview in 2000, giving him extensive experience and insight
into operations in both developed and emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read, a U.S. citizen who was born in Scotland, received a
degree in chemical engineering from London University Imperial
College in 1974. He earned his Chartered Accountants
certification from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of
England and Wales in 1978, according to a biography on the
Pfizer website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read serves on the boards of Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N),
the U.S. Council for International Business and the European
Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays Capital analyst Anthony Butler speculated whether
such a longtime company insider could be the one to bring
change, and what would be the impact of the shift in the
executive suite at a critical juncture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe having Ian Read take the position will be
viewed negatively due to near-term disruptions to management
amidst ongoing merger integration and prior to the immediate
Lipitor patent loss next year," Butler said in a note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Despite Read's extensive history with the company, it
remains unclear if he will be able to accelerate RD
productivity for the company," Butler said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That may be the multibillion-dollar question.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is offering customers of Salesforce.com Inc thousands of dollars in rebates to switch over to its own customer relationship management system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an advertisement placed in the U.S. West Coast edition of the Wall Street Journal on Monday -- timed to coincide with the start of Salesforce.com's annual 'Dreamforce' user conference in San Francisco -- Microsoft is offering companies $200 per user to move to its product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The incentive, to be used as a rebate on the cost of transferring to Microsoft's system, could add up to tens of thousands of dollars or more for some companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's move is the latest in a lively rivalry between the two companies, vying over the emerging role of "cloud computing," or providing computing power and applications over the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com, which sells programs to organize companies' contacts with its customers, is a leader in the "cloud" and aggressively campaigns against the use of installed software, which is Microsoft's stock in trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has countered by taking many of its services online and now offers alternatives to Salesforce.com's products using a combination of installed software and databases accessed online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At Microsoft, we do not believe you should be forced to pay a premium to achieve business success," Microsoft executive Michael Park wrote in an "open letter" to Salesforce.com customers, which appeared as an ad in the Journal on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the letter, he urged customers at the Dreamforce conference to ask Salesforce.com to justify its prices and service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Salesforce.com said it had not yet seen any of its 87,000 customers cancel as a result of Microsoft's offer and dismissed the ad as the ruse of a struggling competitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ad marks a new decade of desperation from Microsoft," said Kendall Collins, Salesforce.com's chief marketing officer.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is only the latest bank to look at selling its mortgage servicing business, and if history is any guide, it will not be an easy process, experts said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment bank is asking potential buyers if they are interested in buying Litton Loan Servicing, a company that collects subprime mortgage payments from homeowners and forecloses on delinquent borrowers, a source familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many potential buyers are likely to be spooked by the rising costs in the servicing business, further limiting the small pool of acquirers, bankers said. Still, experts say a deal is possible for Litton.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has owned the business since 2007, when according to published reports it paid around $470 million to buy it from Credit-Based Asset Servicing and Securitization LLC. C-Bass, a pioneer in the packaging of subprime mortgages into bonds that investors could buy, filed for bankruptcy protection in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the business estimated the Litton business could now fetch at least as much as Goldman originally paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks often bought these kinds of businesses in part because they could give an informational edge for mortgage bond trading, according to bankers that helped their institutions evaluate these deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The businesses can also generate solid cash flow, and can perform particularly well when interest rates are rising, an environment that can hurt other investment banking businesses like bond trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the expected profits from the servicing business have fallen as a mortgage crisis has turned into a foreclosure crisis, bankers and analysts said. There could be unexpected legal liability associated with foreclosing, and when a loan goes bad, servicers often have to advance money to investors in the bonds that funded the mortgage until the actual repossession happens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New regulations require banks to support their mortgage servicing operations with more capital, which also weighs on potential profits for the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's not a main business for Goldman Sachs, and it's not coming back," said Brad Hintz, an analyst covering investment banks at Sanford C. Bernstein.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These difficulties may explain why so many of Goldman Sachs' competitors have exited the business. But the problems that Goldman is running into could also be concerns for potential buyers, which could limit demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PAYS TO BE BIG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is relatively small in the subprime mortgage servicing business. It pays to be big in the servicing business, because larger companies have relatively lower costs, an industry source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some big commercial banks have large servicing operations, but these companies are not usually interested in taking on more assets now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most likely bidders for Litton are large standalone mortgage servicing businesses, like Ocwen Financial Corp. (OCN.N), Fortress Investment Group's (FIG.N) Nationstar Mortgage and Wilbur Ross' American Home Mortgage Servicing, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives for Ocwen and Fortress declined to comment. Wilbur Ross did not reply to an email Friday seeking a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other banks have had success selling or trimming down servicing assets. In May, Morgan Stanley's (MS.N) Saxon Mortgage Services sold $6.9 billion servicing portfolio to Ocwen Financial Corp. Ocwen also bought Barclays (BARC.L) U.S. mortgage servicing business HomEq for $1.3 billion that month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October 2009, IBM (IBM.N) agreed to buy the core operating assets of a Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) mortgage servicing unit, Wilshire Credit Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was not clear how much demand there is for additional servicing assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One servicer that had been buying assets is now up for sale itself: private equity firm Centerbridge Partners is selling its Green Tree Servicing business. The books on the unit are out and bids are expected later this month, the source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Centerbridge declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GMAC's Residential Capital considered selling its mortgage servicing business, but after an extensive sales process decided it was not happy with the prices that buyers were willing to pay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ResCap drew final bids Centerbridge, Fortress and Ocwen, sources have said, which shows how small the pool of potential buyers is for such assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Litton's valuation is based on its having roughly $50 billion of home loans to collect payments on. Those servicing rights are usually worth around half a percentage point of the value of the loans, or around $250 million, the source familiar with the Litton business said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Additional assets like equity value and paybacks on funds advanced to mortgage investors could bring the total value of the business to closer to $500 million, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Paritosh Bansal and Dan Wilchins; editing by Gunna Dickson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds details from company)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE Dec 6 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said
on Monday production will take a slight hit from the planned
maintenance at a process unit in its joint-venture 192,500
barrel-per-day refinery at Chalmette, Louisiana.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company did not specify which unit was being worked on,
but expects all customer needs to be met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The maintenance at the refinery began Dec. 4 and is likely
to last a couple of weeks, according to spokesman Kevin
Allexon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The refinery is co-owned by the Venezuelan state oil
company PDVSA and Exxon is the managing partner in charge of
operations.

&lt;p&gt; The maintenance which began Dec. 4, is expected to last for
a couple of weeks, spokesman Kevin Allexon said. He did not
specify which unit was being worked on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 192,500 barrel-per-day refinery is a 50-50 joint
venture between Exxon and the Venezuelan state oil company
PDVSA. Exxon is the managing partner in charge of operations.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 6 (Reuters) - Inflows to emerging market debt
should hit a record $75 billion this year, with similar levels
likely in 2011 as well, says J.P Morgan which runs the
widely-used EMBI and GBI-EM emerging bond index series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The bank said in a note that year-to-date flows stand at
$61.8 billion, or $7 billion a month on average, compared to
$3.9 billion per month in 2009, the previous record year. J.P.
Morgan's previous forecast for 2010 had been $50-$55 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Local currency debt took the most inflows of around $35.8
billion year-to-date, compared to $26 billion for hard currency,
J.P. Morgan said, adding that around 17 percent of the inflows
may have gone to exchange-traded funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Emerging bond ETFs have grown to $4.4 billion compared to
$250 million in early 2009, J.P. Morgan said, adding EM bond
ETFs had taken in $2.2 billion year-to-date after receiving
inflows of $1.5 billion in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But this remains tiny compared with inflows of $22 billion
year-to-date in emerging equity ETFs, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total funds benchmarked to JPM's indexes amount to nearly
$420 billion, including the sovereign dollar bond EMBI indices,
the local currency GBI-EM series and the corporate CEMBI index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The strongest growth in percentage terms has been in assets
benchmarked to the local market GBI-EM indices, increasing by
almost 120 percent over the past two years," the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sector has also posted stellar returns this year, with
sovereign hard currency bonds posting gains of 13.3 percent so
far 11EML, and returns for the CEMBI corporate bond index and
GBI-EM local currency debt index also in double digits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All the three indexes are now rated investment grade, as a
number of developing countries including Brazil, Costa Rica,
Peru and Morocco, made it to the ranks of investment grade
sovereigns during or after the crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lowest sovereign investment grade rating is BBB- for
Fitch and Standard  Poor's and Baa3 for Moody's.

&lt;p&gt; * Investors may worry move made during merger integration&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Change could bring divestitures, share buybacks-analysts&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer shares rise 1.4 percent in down market&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lewis Krauskopf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Investors hoped a leadership
shake-up at Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) might bring divestitures, share
buybacks or other moves to kick-start the company's sluggish
stock price, but they were wary of disruption stemming from the
abrupt change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest drugmaker's shares rose 1.4 percent in
early trading on Monday as the broader market edged lower,
after the company announced late on Sunday that Jeffrey Kindler
had retired as CEO and was replaced by Pfizer veteran Ian Read,
the company's global head of pharmaceuticals. [ID:nN05154682]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler said in a statement issued by Pfizer that the job
had been "extremely demanding" and that he wanted to "recharge
my batteries."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Kindler, 55, may also have been under pressure because
of the stock's sluggish performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since July 2006, when Kindler assumed the CEO post,
Pfizer's shares have fallen roughly 27 percent compared with a
10 percent decline for the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index
.DRG of large U.S. and European drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When a company's shares underperform, shareholders express
their frustrations to the board, and the board expresses its
frustrations by making management changes," said Les
Funtleyder, portfolio manager of the Miller Tabak Healthcare
Transformation Fund, which does not hold Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs analyst Jami Rubin applauded the change,
saying she has "long argued that Pfizer should be more
aggressive in achieving greater efficiencies in both its $28.5
billion operating expenses base as well as its massive balance
sheet and portfolio of various businesses, some of which should
be divested."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are delighted to see the board taking action as
Pfizer's share price continues to underperform amid a flurry of
questions about strategic direction," Rubin said in research
note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rubin also said Pfizer should remove its 2012 forecast,
which she said was set "unrealistically high" and has been a
source of anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's 2012 forecast includes the first full year of
impact from losing exclusive U.S. rights to Lipitor, its
mammoth-selling cholesterol drug, and has implied somewhat
stable results despite the Lipitor loss.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler's departure comes more than a year after the
drugmaker completed the signature move of his tenure -- the $67
billion acquisition of rival Wyeth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition of Wyeth, which brought Pfizer more access
to biotech drugs and vaccines as well as cost-cutting
opportunities, was intended to help Pfizer maneuver through
the decline of Lipitor, due to lose U.S. patent protection in
November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the move has so far failed to jump-start the stock.
Pfizer shares have fallen 5.2 percent since the company bought
Wyeth on Oct. 15, 2009. By contrast, shares of Merck  Co
(MRK.N) have jumped 15 percent since it clinched its own
mega-merger, of Schering-Plough Corp, on Nov. 3, 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said the CEO change could
lead to more aggressive actions by Pfizer, including share
repurchases or dividend increases, as well as more business
development or divestitures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While a CEO transition in the midst of a major merger
integration will likely create added uncertainty with the
story, the key question, in our view, remains on the changes
this transition will bring to the Pfizer story," Schott said in
a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barbara Ryan, the long-time pharmaceutical analyst at
Deutsche Bank, said Kindler drove Pfizer to become a leaner
organization, and that the Wyeth acquisition helped diversify
the company's revenue base and decrease its dependence on
Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Despite these accomplishments, Jeff was not able to
develop a sufficient level of support from the investment
community," Ryan said in a research note. She said his
departure likely resulted from a "mutual assessment" on the
part of the board and Kindler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's appointment of Read, who joined the company in
1978, was a "logical one," Ryan said, noting that he is
"well-regarded within the organization."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rubin of Goldman Sachs called Read a "seasoned executive
with over 20 years of experience running many different regions
and businesses in pharma."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Some investors may be concerned that the new CEO may not
shake-up the company to the degree that some would like to see,
but he has the ability to focus the strategy and get the ship
going in the right direction," Rubin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's shares rose 1.43 percent, or 24 cents, to $16.97
in morning New York Stock Exchange trading.

			Goldman to Sell Mortgage Unit?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) 
      is thinking for a sale of Litton Loan Servicing LP, its mortgage 
      servicing division, according to a report in the Financial Times. 
      The sale would result in the closure of Goldman&#8217;s business of home loan 
      collections and foreclosing on delinquent borrowers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report has cited that at least one prospective buyer approached 
      Goldman for this unit. However, the talks collapsed over the price issue 
      and no sale is on the cards right now. According to the report, the 
      Litton business unit is not considered as part of Goldman&#8217;s traditional 
      business activities such as investment banking and trading services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman had paid around $470 million to buy Litton in December 2007. 
      Litton services around 320,000 subprime loans with an unpaid principal 
      balance of $50 billion. Litton was one among the several mortgage 
      servicers facing federal investigations over their foreclosure 
      practices. In line with other servicers, the company had temporarily 
      suspended its foreclosure activities in October.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Besides Goldman, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) 
      and Barclays plc. (NYSE: BCS) 
      have also forayed into this business of home loan collections. But the 
      tough market forced the companies selling these business units as their 
      profit plunged significantly when the borrowers defaulted on the loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman has hit the headlines several times in 2010 over charges and 
      penalties. However, the company could post third quarter 2010 earnings 
      per share of $2.98, significantly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
      of $2.29. Results reflected a strong performance in Investment Banking 
      business and lower operating expenses. Though economic conditions were 
      challenging, the company gained from a solid balance sheet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Nicor Looking for Suitors?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Nicor Inc. (NYSE: GAS), 
      a natural gas utility, has been put up for sale, Bloomberg News has 
      reported. The company is working with JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: 
      JPM) to find a buyer, 
      according to people familiar with the situation, who declined to be 
      identified because a sale has not been announced.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Some utility companies and infrastructure funds have looked at the 
      company and decided the price was too high for a bid, said sources. 
      Naperville, Illinois-based Nicor&#8217;s shares are currently trading at 15 
      times estimated 2011 earnings, compared with about 12 times for the 
      Standard  Poor&#8217;s 500 Utilities Index.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nicor Inc. is a holding company whose principal business is gas 
      distribution. The company&#8217;s largest subsidiary is Nicor Gas, a 
      distributor of natural gas that provided almost 80% of the company&#8217;s 
      2009 sales. Nicor also owns Tropical Shipping, a transporter of 
      containerized freight serving the Bahamas and the Caribbean region.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Founded in 1954 as Northern Illinois Gas, Nicor Gas is one of the 
      biggest gas utilities in the nation with a large customer base (more 
      than 2 million Illinois homes and businesses) and an enviable supply 
      position that includes access to eight interstate pipeline connections 
      and significant underground storage assets. It maintains a low base rate 
      (even after the rate relief received in 2009), compared with the other 
      major gas utilities in Illinois and in the country.

			Setback for Valeant Epilepsy Drug
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Valeant Pharmaceuticals International (NYSE: VRX) 
      and GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE: GSK) 
      recently announced that the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued 
      a complete response letter (CRL) for the new drug application (NDA) for 
      their epilepsy candidate, ezogabine. The regulatory body said that the 
      CRL was for non-clinical reasons. Valeant and Glaxo are currently 
      evaluating the letter and plan to file a response to the FDA in 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The companies are seeking approval for ezogabine both in the US and the 
      EU for the treatment of adults with partial-onset seizures. The NDA was 
      submitted to the FDA on October 30, 2009, while the Marketing 
      Authorization Application was submitted to the European Medicines 
      Evaluation Agency on November 17, 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Ezogabine&#8217;s Regulatory Pathway
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier, in August, Glaxo and Valeant had received a positive 
      recommendation from an FDA advisory panel regarding ezogabine. The FDA&#8217;s 
      Peripheral and Central Nervous System Drugs Advisory Committee had 
      reviewed the safety and efficacy of the drug and voted unanimously in 
      favor of ezogabine&#8217;s efficacy for the treatment of partial-onset 
      seizures in adults where other treatments failed. However, later during 
      the month, the FDA extended the review date for the candidate by three 
      months.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ezogabine has been developed under a worldwide license and collaboration 
      agreement between Glaxo and Valeant and the FDA approval would be a 
      major boost for both companies, particularly for Valeant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Competitive Scenario
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Currently available epilepsy treatments include drugs like Pfizer Inc.&#8217;s 
      (NYSE: PFE) Neurontin 
      and Lyrica, Glaxo&#8217;s Lamictal, UCB Pharma&#8217;s (OTC: UCBJF) 
      Keppra and Johnson  Johnson&#8217;s (NYSE: JNJ) 
      Topamax. We believe that ezogabine, once approved, should be able to 
      carve a niche for itself due to its differentiated mechanism of action.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Neutral on Valeant
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Valeant. The company faces 
      major challenges with its neurology product Diastat and HIV drug 
      ribavirin exposed to generic competition. We believe the company needs 
      to enter into suitable deals in order to compensate for the loss of 
      revenues resulting from the genericization of Diastat and ribavirin.

		&lt;p&gt;
			StorSimple&#8217;s Application Optimized Cloud Storage Appliances Bring SSD 
      Performance and Cloud Elasticity to Microsoft Environments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Availability of three products from award-winning Startup introduces 
      elastic storage capabilities for Microsoft SharePoint, Windows File 
      Server, Exchange and Office
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			StorSimple, 
      recently named &#8220;most promising cloud technology provider,&#8221; announces the 
      immediate availability of the StorSimple 1000, 5000 and 7000 series of 
      application-optimized cloud storage appliances. Deployed on-premise, 
      these devices utilize an innovative &#8220;cloud-as-a-tier&#8221; architecture to 
      dramatically increase the performance and greatly extend the storage 
      capabilities of business-critical Microsoft applications such as 
      Microsoft SharePoint, Microsoft Exchange Server, Microsoft File Servers 
      and Virtual Machine libraries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Tweet this: .@StorSimple 
      introduces cloud-as-a-tier storage with app optimized cloud #storage 
      appliances for #MSFT environments http://bit.ly/xyz
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Enterprise content is exploding at 50 to 60 percent per year driven by 
      use of applications such as Microsoft Office, SharePoint, Exchange, 
      Windows Shared Drives and modern virtual machine libraries. Each time a 
      minor change is made to a file, a completely new version is created, 
      resulting in an explosion of stored content when only a working set of 
      data is required. The working set requires rapid access whereas the 
      other content can be stored on slower disks or the cloud. The cloud is a 
      new architecture and requires new approaches to realize its full 
      benefit. It can&#8217;t be treated as a dumb disk at the end of a wide-area 
      network. To get the security and performance required, enterprises need 
      sophisticated cloud-as-a-tier management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;When it comes to using cloud storage to deal with the explosion of 
      content, companies need to think like Bing and Google search algorithms 
      for storage, meaning that they should not treat all content the same, 
      just as these search engines treat every web page differently to present 
      the most important content on the first page,&#8221; said Ursheet Parikh, CEO 
      of StorSimple. &#8220;We take the same approach to cloud storage through 
      software in StorSimple appliances that automatically deduplicate 
      content, reducing storage requirements by a factor of 10. Every block is 
      then ranked through a unique BlockRankTM algorithm to 
      determine the working set of data that is necessary for every day 
      operations, while automatically moving less used data, which can make up 
      nearly 75 percent of a business&#8217; data, to the cloud. This gives 
      enterprises the best-of-both worlds - SSD performance and the elasticity 
      of the cloud.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By keeping frequently accessed data on premise, application performance 
      remains high and data is kept within company security protocols. 
      Applications using the StorSimple appliance reap the performance and 
      security benefits of keeping applications and working set data on 
      premise, while shifting the burden of less frequently accessed content 
      storage to the cloud. This has a major impact on performance both for 
      regular application workloads and also backup and recovery as only the 
      working set has to be moved to the cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With only 25 percent of content stored on premise and a deduplication 
      ratio of 10, this means instead of backing up a complete dataset over a 
      WAN, StorSimple needs to move a mere 2.5 percent. For recovery, the 
      volume group can be immediately mounted and the working set accessed 
      compared to moving the whole backup over the WAN.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Unique Application-Optimized Cloud Storage
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      StorSimple takes cloud storage one step further with an 
      application-optimization plug-in architecture. This maximizes the 
      performance of each volume of an application knowing whether to store 
      the data on SSD, SAS drive or the cloud with a unique 
      application-specific BlockRank algorithm. For example, with SharePoint, 
      the database is always stored on SSD whereas the content, including 
      large objects like audio, video and CAD drawings, can be spread over 
      SSD, SAS drive or the cloud. This application plug-in extends to 
      Microsoft VSS consistent application backup and restore.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, a redundant disaster recovery center is out of the reach of 
      many organizations. Cloud economics, coupled with StorSimple&#8217;s unique 
      CloudClone architecture mean everyone can now afford a disaster recovery 
      center &#8211; paying for it only when it&#8217;s used.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re using StorSimple for backup and recovery, Microsoft Exchange 
      archiving and migrating file share data to SharePoint 2010,&#8221; said Ryan 
      Dengate, IT manager for Pine Rest Health Services. &#8220;As its name implies, 
      StorSimple takes the first step of BLOB externalization and marries it 
      to backup really easily. It took very little time to get up and running 
      and creating business use cases.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The StorSimple series of appliances support leading cloud storage 
      providers Amazon, ATT, EMC, Iron Mountain and Microsoft Azure. The 
      range of appliances includes embedded security and encryption protocols 
      as well as tools for easy cloud backup and recovery, primary storage 
      deduplication, and application-aware thin provisioning. For more details

			BuyERP Launches an Online Webstore for the Purchase of Microsoft 
      Dynamics GP, Dynamics NAV and Dynamics CRM Software Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BuyERP (www.buyerp.com), 
      an authorized Microsoft Gold Partner, brings you the first ecommerce 
      website dedicated to purchasing ERP software online. This site is a true 
      B2B site, selling top brand names like Microsoft Dynamics GP, Microsoft 
      Dynamics NAV and Microsoft Dynamics CRM 30% lower than competitor&#8217;s 
      prices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This launch will put BuyERP on the map as a pioneering online discount 
      webstore for high end ERP software. This site allows you to complete 
      your software purchase transaction entirely online within minutes and 
      have your software available to download within 24 to 48 hours. BuyERP's 
      CMO, Jenna Harrow, commented, "In today's economic environment, we 
      wanted to provide companies with a platform in which to leverage their 
      purchasing dollars. Many companies are switching to the Microsoft 
      Dynamics line of ERP products to streamline operations and curtail 
      costs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Even as our economy improves, CFOs are aware that fiscal responsibility 
      is more important than ever. We have found customers in remote markets, 
      repeat customers and customers with internal consultants already 
      experienced with the Microsoft Dynamics product lines, all need an 
      expeditious method of purchasing software. For quite a few of these 
      customers, having a traditional software partner is not feasible or 
      necessary. BuyERP fills this void in the marketplace.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;BuyERP is a great website with terrific prices. They are also very 
      responsive to questions either via email or telephone. We will 
      definitely be using them again to expand our Dynamics GP system as our 
      business grows.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      - Cameron, New South Wales, Australia
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;BuyERP sells Microsoft Dynamics at great prices. Their team is 
      extremely knowledgeable and helpful.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  WALTHAM, MA, Dec 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Advanced Visual Systems (www.avs.com) (PINKSHEETS: AVSC), a market leader
in data visualization software and solutions for business, engineering
and research organizations, will soon debut ultra-high performance
editions of its popular AVS/Express software. The company is
collaborating with Microsoft to leverage the Windows HPC Server platform
and significantly improve data visualization processing, application
performance, and ease of configuration using Microsoft's provisioning
interfaces.

    Initial test results have shown that computationally sophisticated
processes running on AVS/Express can now be run on the Windows HPC Server
platform. This represents a great benefit compared to the more difficult
Linux based installations without compromising speed and performance.

    "Microsoft has been working closely with AVS to help them deliver high
value data visualization-based solutions to the supercomputing
marketplace, where speed and performance are essential requirements,"
said Bill Hamilton, director, Technical Computing at Microsoft.
"Companies like AVS are unleashing supercomputing power to scientists,
researchers and engineers through innovative parallel processing and
graphics rendering techniques on Windows that were once reserved for an
elite class of hardware devices."

    According to Anoop Chatterjee, CTO of Advanced Visual Systems, "AVS is
pleased to build on our relationship with Microsoft and take advantage of
the Windows HPC Server platform to ensure that AVS software can easily
manage the large data volumes that define the supercomputing space.
AVS/Express has a long history of serving the scientific and academic
community and our newest initiative with Microsoft will extend our
commitment to delivering fast, versatile and cost-effective data
visualization solutions." 

    AVS/Express enables rapid, object-oriented development of rich and highly
interactive scientific and technical data visualizations. Now in its
sixteenth year of release and worldwide deployment at leading research
facilities, universities and engineering organizations, AVS/Express is
considered one of most prolific data visualization software tools and is
offered in several editions that exploit nearly every contemporary and
legacy data format. For additional information visit www.avs.com/express,

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA Dec 6 (Reuters) - An Islamist terror group on 
Indonesia's Sumatra island planned to attack foreign workers 
at unit of Chevron Corp's as well as ambush tourists, 
a police official told Reuters on Monday.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Indonesia has killed or detained scores of militants since 
the bomb attacks on the resort island of Bali in 2002, though 
police and security experts have warned about potential 
threats to foreign and government targets from newly formed 
groups. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Militant groups have begun to change tactics away from 
bomb attacks to more focused, lower cost operations targeting 
individual foreigners and government officials.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Police said the Chevron unit that was targeted was at 
Pekanbaru, the capital of Riau province, Sumatra's main oil 
producing area. The island's Krakatau volcanic area also 
attracts scores of foreign visitors.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At Chevron, they want to ambush the company's buses and 
shoot the foreigners," said Petrus Golose, a member of 
police's anti-terror task force and the director of 
enforcement of the National Counter-Terrorism Agency.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. oil major is the biggest producer of crude oil in 
Indonesia, a former OPEC member. [ID:nSGE6A20CC].	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In Anak Krakatau, they aim to intercept tourist 
speed-boats, kill them, and leave them there," he said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anak Krakatau, or Child of Krakatoa, is a volcano formed 
on the site of the giant 1883 explosion of the Krakatoa 
volcano off the coast of eastern Sumatra, which draws tourists 
to see the active peak or to dive the coral-rich waters around 
it.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plans were revealed by Fadli Sadama, a man who was 
captured in Malaysia and was taken at the weekend to Indonesia 
for trial, Golose said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sadama was jailed for more than four years in Indonesia 
for involvement in ferrying explosives for a car-bomb at the 
J.W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta in 2003, the police official 
said. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soon after Sadama was released, he re-joined a militant 
group and robbed banks in north Sumatra to raise fund for 
future attacks against foreigners on the island, Golose said. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some of the funds were also sent to a treasurer of Jema'ah 
Ansharut Tauhid, an Islamist group in Java led by firebrand 
cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, Golose said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Police have alleged that Bashir was involved in a 
paramilitary training camp in the jungle in Sumatra's Aceh 
this year and said the new group had planned to assassinate 
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono at an independence day 
ceremony in Jakarta in August.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Golose said in Malaysia, Sadama built links with militant 
groups in that country as well as in southern Thailand, to 
supply weapons for attacks in Indonesia.

&lt;p&gt; * Kindler leaving to 'recharge his batteries'&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Read, 57, has been head of pharmaceuticals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Investors may prefer change at Pfizer - analyst
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to remove duplicate paragraph)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comments, stock performance)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lewis Krauskopf and Ransdell Pierson	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 5 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's chief 
executive stepped down without warning, acknowledging the 
personal toll involved in steering the world's largest 
drugmaker through a multibillion dollar merger.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The departure of Jeffrey Kindler, 55, comes more than a 
year after Pfizer completed the signature move of his tenure 
-- the $67 billion acquisition of rival Wyeth. But he leaves 
before the company confronts the U.S. patent expiration of its 
top-selling Lipitor cholesterol medicine expected in November.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler said he was leaving to "recharge my batteries" 
after nearly five years on the job. He is being replaced by 
the global head of pharmaceuticals, Ian Read, who is 57, 
Pfizer said late on Sunday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The combination of meeting the requirements of our many 
stakeholders around the world and the 24/7 nature of my 
responsibilities, has made this period extremely demanding on 
me personally," Kindler said in a statement issued by Pfizer.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Les Funtleyder, portfolio manager of the Miller Tabak 
Healthcare Transformation Fund, said it was unusual for a CEO 
to resign citing fatigue.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'd have liked a little more notice, and a little more 
orderly process," said Funtleyder, who does not hold Pfizer 
shares. "The suddenness of the announcement will make many 
people think there may be something more here."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Funtleyder said Kindler's resignation may be more 
connected to Pfizer's poor stock price performance, noting 
that investors have shown far more enthusiasm about Merck  
Co's purchase of Schering-Plough.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, Pfizer's abrupt management change comes in stark 
contrast with Merck, which said last week that President Ken 
Frazier would succeed Richard Clark as CEO in a 
long-telegraphed and expected move. [ID:nN30259450]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since July 2006, when Kindler assumed the CEO post, Pfizer 
shares have fallen roughly 27 percent compared with a 10 
percent decline for the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical index 
of large U.S. and European drugmakers.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson said Pfizer shares 
would probably rise on Monday "because investors just want to 
see change at a washed-out story like Pfizer."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The departure is sudden but I doubt there was one event 
per se" that led to his departure, Anderson said. "Highly 
likely that he was pushed."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 	
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOSING LIPITOR	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler, previously the company's general counsel with 
little drug industry experience, was a surprise choice when he 
was named to the drugmaker's top job in 2006.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only months after he became CEO, Pfizer was dealt a 
devastating blow when it halted development of its 
experimental "good cholesterol" drug torcetrapib over safety 
reasons.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That product had been intended to help build on its 
cholesterol franchise from Lipitor, which had $11.4 billion in 
sales last year. Instead, Pfizer will lose the vast majority 
of that revenue when its loses exclusivity on the drug.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its Viagra erectile dysfunction drug is also expected to 
lose patent protection in the next few years.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition of Wyeth, which brought Pfizer more access 
to biotech drugs and vaccines as well as cost-cutting 
opportunities, was intended to help Pfizer maneuver through 
the Lipitor loss.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far, investors remain skeptical. Pfizer shares have 
fallen 5.2 percent since the company bought Wyeth on Oct. 15, 
2009. Merck shares have jumped 15 percent since it bought 
Schering-Plough on Nov. 3, 2009.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Read, who joined Pfizer in 1978, has led Pfizer's 
worldwide pharmaceuticals business since 2006. The business 
includes primary care, specialty care, oncology and emerging 
markets and accounts for about 85 percent of Pfizer's annual 
revenue. He has been responsible for more than 40,000 employees.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said its board will elect a nonexecutive chairman 
from its current membership at its next regularly scheduled 
meeting that will take place within the next two weeks.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler's resignation comes after the surprise departure 
of Pfizer research executive Martin Mackay in May.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mackay had been co-head of research with Mikael Dolsten, 
former head of research for Wyeth, after Pfizer acquired Wyeth.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Mackay unexpectedly jumped ship just seven months 
later, to head research at rival AstraZeneca Plc , 
leaving Dolsten in command of research for the world's largest 
drugmaker.

			Visa genehmigt In2Pay&#8482; microSD von DeviceFidelity f&#252;r den Einsatz bei 
      f&#252;hrenden Smartphone-Modellen
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) und Visa Europe1 haben heute die 
      Verf&#252;gbarkeit von kontaktlosen Zahlungsm&#246;glichkeiten &#252;ber Mobiltelefone 
      durch die L&#246;sung In2Pay microSD von DeviceFidelity angek&#252;ndigt. Erstmals 
      in der Geschichte von Visa enth&#228;lt die Liste der mit Visa kompatiblen 
      Produkte eine L&#246;sung zur kontaktlosen Bezahlung &#252;ber Mobiltelefone, die 
      von Finanzinstituten in den USA und ausgew&#228;hlten M&#228;rkten nun f&#252;r den 
      kommerziellen Einsatz angeboten werden kann.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Im Anschluss an die 18-monatige Technologieentwicklung in Zusammenarbeit 
      mit dem texanischen Unternehmen DeviceFidelity und an Versuchseins&#228;tze 
      mit f&#252;hrenden Finanzinstituten in den USA, Europa und Asien hat Visa die 
      L&#246;sung In2Pay microSD getestet und unterst&#252;tzt deren Markteinf&#252;hrung zur 
      Anwendung auf f&#252;hrenden Smartphones.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Diese bahnbrechende Technologie ist mit Smartphone-Modellen wie 
      BlackBerry&#174; BoldTM 96502, iPhone 4, iPhone 3GS, 
      iPhone 3G und dem auf Android beruhenden Samsung Vibrant Galaxy 5 
      kompatibel, womit drei der weltweit f&#252;hrenden Betriebssysteme f&#252;r 
      Mobiltelefone vertreten sind. Visa geht davon aus, dass diese 
      Technologie demn&#228;chst bei weiteren Modellen eingef&#252;hrt wird, so auch bei 
      Telefonen, die auf den Betriebssystemen Symbian und Windows beruhen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Dies ist ein historischer Meilenstein f&#252;r Visa und unsere Kunden&#8220;, 
      sagte Bill Gajda, Leiter von Visa Mobile. &#8222;Zus&#228;tzlich zur Ausstellung 
      von Zahlungskarten aus Plastik mit Magnetstreifen oder Mikrochip haben 
      Finanzinstitute nun die Wahl, ihren Kontoinhabern eine neue Technologie 
      anzubieten, mit der sie ihr eigenes Telefon in ein voll funktionsf&#228;higes 
      mobiles Zahlungsger&#228;t verwandeln k&#246;nnen.&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Vom ersten Versuch zum kommerziellen Einsatz
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Das von Visa eingerichtete Testverfahren zur Kompatibilit&#228;t von 
      Mobilger&#228;ten umfasst weitreichende Technik-, Sicherheits- und 
      Gebrauchstauglichkeitstests in Bezug auf die mobile Bezahlungsfunktion 
      mit Visa. Dadurch werden verl&#228;ssliche und sichere Visa-Transaktionen 
      garantiert, die mit dem weltweiten Standard f&#252;r Chip-Zahlungen 
      &#252;bereinstimmen und die erforderliche Signalreichweite f&#252;r alle 
      kontaktlosen mobilen Zahlungen festgelegt. Das Testverfahren von Visa 
      garantiert, dass die Kombination aus Telefon, sicherem Chip und mobiler 
      Zahlungsanwendung dem Benutzererlebnis entspricht, das Visa-Kontoinhaber 
      von Visa erwarten d&#252;rfen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Die Zahlungstechnologie mit microSD ist in Zusammenarbeit mit 
      DeviceFidelity entwickelt worden und stand bisher nur Finanzinstituten 
      zur Verf&#252;gung, die zusammen mit Visa an den Versuchseins&#228;tzen f&#252;r diese 
      Art mobiler Bezahlung teilgenommen haben &#8211; darunter einige der gr&#246;&#223;ten 
      US-Finanzinstitute wie JP Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo Bank, US Bancorp und 
      Bank of America. Ab jetzt k&#246;nnen Visa-Aussteller die Technologie gem&#228;&#223; 
      der Standardvertragsbedingungen von Visa erhalten und die Anwendung f&#252;r 
      mobile Visa-Zahlungen auf microSD-Karten laden.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aussteller, die sich f&#252;r die &#220;bernahme der Technologie entscheiden, 
      k&#246;nnen ihren Kontoinhabern eine winzige microSD-Karte zustellen, die in 
      den vorhandenen Speicherkartenschlitz im Telefon eingef&#252;hrt wird, 
      wodurch das Ger&#228;t zahlungsbereit gemacht werden kann. Die Technologie 
      ist kompatibel mit bestehenden kontaktlosen Zahlungsstellen, die bereits 
      auf der ganzen Welt in Einzelhandelsstandorten installiert sind, sodass 
      Kontoinhaber ihr Telefon zur Bezahlung ganz einfach in die N&#228;he einer 
      solchen Zahlungsstelle halten k&#246;nnen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Diese Technologie er&#246;ffnet auch Mobilfunkbetreibern, H&#228;ndlern und 
      anderen Interessengruppen im Zahlungsumfeld neue M&#246;glichkeiten der 
      Zusammenarbeit mit Finanzinstituten, um den Verbrauchern die mobile 
      Zahlungsfunktion mit Visa anzubieten.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Dies ist ein wichtiger Schritt hin zu neuen Zahlungs-, Kundenbindungs- 
      und Bonusmodellen, der den Banken und H&#228;ndlern die M&#246;glichkeit gibt, 
      ganz neue Gesch&#228;ftsmodelle aufzubauen&#8220;, sagte Nick Holland, Senior 
      Analyst bei der Yankee Group. &#8222;Die Ank&#252;ndigung von Visa verdeutlicht, 
      dass die Zukunft bei Zahlungen im Mobilbereich liegt.&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Finanzinstitute haben die M&#246;glichkeit, die mobile Zahlungsl&#246;sung von 
      Visa in ihre bestehenden mobilen Anwendungen zu integrieren und 
      zus&#228;tzliche Dienstleistungen anzubieten &#8211; wie Transaktionswarnungen, 
      durch die Kontoinhaber praktisch in Echtzeit &#252;ber Aktivit&#228;ten auf ihrem 
      Visa-Konto benachrichtigt werden, oder gezielte Angebote von H&#228;ndlern, 
      die auf die Interessen und den Standort der Verbraucher zugeschnitten 
      sind. Zusammen genommen verf&#252;gen diese Dienstleistungen &#252;ber das 
      Potenzial, den Verbrauchern bessere Zahlungserlebnisse zu bieten und 
      Kontoinhabern mehr Kontrolle &#252;ber ihre Zahlungskonten zu geben.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Dies ist eine Win-win-Situation f&#252;r Banken, H&#228;ndler, Mobilfunkanbieter, 
      Handyhersteller, App-Entwickler und Verbraucher, denn geboten wird eine 
      einzigartige Kombination aus Ger&#228;ten, die bei den Verbrauchern beliebt 
      sind, Sicherheitsma&#223;nahmen auf Chip-Basis und Innovationen, die durch 
      ein Anwendungsprogramm erm&#246;glicht werden &#8211; etwas, was das NFC-Umfeld 
      seit l&#228;ngerer Zeit anstrebt&#8220;, sagte Deepak Jain, Pr&#228;sident und CEO von 
      DeviceFidelity, Inc. &#8222;Es ist spannend f&#252;r uns, durch die Zusammenarbeit 
      mit Visa und seinen Partnern in der Finanzindustrie bei diesem wichtigen 
      Meilenstein an vorderster Front dabei zu sein und mitzuhelfen, dass 
      mobile Zahlungen f&#252;r die Verbraucher zur Realit&#228;t werden.&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Knapp f&#252;nf Milliarden Mobiltelefone sind rund um die Welt auf dem Markt, 
      und Verbraucher &#252;berall nutzen ihr Handy tagein und tagaus. Laut IDC3 
      d&#252;rfte der Versand von Smartphones 2011 um 24&#160;Prozent zunehmen und damit 
      das anhaltende Wachstum bei robusteren und leistungsst&#228;rkeren 
      Mobilger&#228;ten, die zur kontaktlosen Bezahlung geeignet sind, weiter 
      ankurbeln.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE Dec 8 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs has initiated 
coverage of Singapore-listed commodity firms Noble Group 
 and Olam International , with a "buy" call 
on Noble and a "neutral" rating on Olam.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also downgraded Singapore's Wilmar 
International , the world's largest listed palm oil 
firm, to "neutral" from "buy" and cut the target price to 
S$6.25 from S$7.00.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has a price target of S$2.60 for Noble and S$3.20 
for Olam.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 	
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; STATEMENT:	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it expects Noble to report earnings growth of 
67 percent in 2011 as recent investments in oil, gas and power 
yield good returns next year.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also said Noble trades at 12.8 times 
earnings per share, making it cheaper than sector peers Olam 
and Wilmar.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Olam's return on equity is expected to fall between 15-17 
percent over the next two years, as its investments in 
upstream and midstream businesses may take time to bear fruit.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman lowered its forecasts for Wilmar due to lower 
consumer products margins and difficulty in raising the price 
of cooking oil sold in China amid measures by Beijing to keep 
a lid on food prices.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While we see strong long-term growth potential from 
Wilmar's flour and rice expansion into China, margins may 
remain thin in the near term as the company focuses on growing 
market share to achieve critical mass," said Goldman.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Noble rose 1.4 percent to S$2.14 at 0230 GMT, 
and have gained 1.8 percent so far this year.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wilmar shares are down 0.7 percent at S$6.00, and have 
fallen 6.7 percent since the start of the year.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Olam fell 0.3 percent to S$3.20 but have surged 20 percent 
so far this year.

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. General Services Administration awarded a five-year, $6.7 million contract last week to Unisys Corp, with Google as a subcontractor -- a relatively small dollar amount but an important initial foothold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the contract, Google and Unisys will transition the GSA, which basically serves as the back office for federal agencies, to a secure cloud-based platform that includes Google's Gmail, Calendar, Docs and Sites applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GSA is the first U.S. federal agency to make an agency-wide move to cloud computing, in which applications are delivered through a web browser to allow any time and anywhere access to information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Consumers typically use cloud computing when online banking or shopping on sites like Amazon.com.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GSA is a big win for Web search engine leader Google because the agency touches so many aspects of the federal government, potentially setting the company up for other federal agency contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a real duel," said Melissa Webster, program vice president for content and digital media technologies at market researcher IDC. "Microsoft is clearly in Google's gun sights and... Google is a huge threat to Microsoft in lots of areas."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest challenge Google poses to Microsoft is on pricing, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft expressed disappointment in the GSA's decision but said it was "gratified that so many federal, state and local governments have chosen Microsoft to meet their business needs." Google hopes the GSA win will help to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This opens up the flood gates to a lot of agencies who really have wanted to move to the cloud and have wanted to see a green light to do so," Dave Girouard, Google's president of enterprise, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Girouard said Google's advantage over Microsoft in cloud computing hinges on the elimination of software installation as Google's cloud is entirely Web-based, keeping prices low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said competition was good for the industry, and it was confident customers would not stray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft offers a "private cloud" option that hosts its products on the customer's own servers. Google's servers must host their suite of cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOVERNMENT ADOPTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Moving all of its 17,000 employees and contractors to cloud-based email and collaboration tools will lower costs by 50 percent, saving the agency $15 million over five years, the GSA said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think other agencies will look closely at that savings as budgetary pressures become more and more significant in the federal government," David Mihalchik, Google strategy and business development executive, said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still Google faces some resistance in the federal market. Last month it sued the U.S. government for excluding its products from being considered for a five-year contract worth about $59 million to upgrade the Interior Department's email system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global IT spending on cloud services are expected to triple by 2013, topping $44 billion, IDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IDC's Webster said that while a cloud vendor offering robust functionality could displace the incumbent, she did not think Google would be able to displace Microsoft in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is still a huge gap in what Microsoft provides in its online suite and what Google provides," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The real threat to Microsoft is to maintain its price and maintain its value in the face of this cheaper, innovative challenger," Webster said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she said Google may make inroads in the government sector, as these deals are driven primarily by email services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jasmin Melvin; Editing by Ted Kerr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp plans to give users of its new Internet browser the ability to stop certain sites from gathering information from users as the company looks to head off federal online privacy legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Leaves Steinhoff, Carlyle in race&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman, Colony bid was reportedly about 1.5 bln euros&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PARIS Dec 7 (Reuters) - A group led by Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) and Colony Capital has pulled out of the bidding process
for PPR's (PRTP.PA) furniture retailer Conforama, French daily
Les Echos reported on its website  on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The remaining bidders include South African furniture
manufacturer Steinhoff International Holdings (SHFJ.J) and
private equity firm Carlyle [CYL.UL], the report said, without
citing sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neither PPR nor Colony Capital would comment on the report.
PPR had earlier confirmed that Steinhoff was one of several
investors with which it was in talks. [ID:nLDE6B60R9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs and Colony intended to save costs by allying
Conforama with their own retail brand, the report said. They
had offered about 1.5 billion euros ($2 billion) for the PPR
division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the complexity of a group bid in the face of
Steinhoff's bid persuaded them to give up, Les Echos said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) are "substantially" undervalued because of investor pessimism about the company's roster of experimental medicines, but a new chief executive with industry experience could brighten the drugmaker's prospects, hedge fund manager David Einhorn said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Einhorn expressed his optimism two days after Jeffrey Kindler resigned as CEO of the world's largest pharmaceuticals company. Kindler, a lawyer who once ran the McDonald's Corp-owned Boston Market restaurant chain, was replaced by Ian Read, a 32-year Pfizer veteran who had overseen the company's core pharmaceuticals business since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a lot of criticism by other market participants about the background of the previous CEO," Einhorn said at Reuters' Investment Outlook Summit in New York. "The stock did not do very much for the last several years, and there's an opportunity perhaps for them to have a new strategy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares, trading Tuesday at $16.84, have lost about 27 percent since Kindler became chief executive in July 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn said Pfizer shares, even excluding the value of the company's drug pipeline, are worth "considerably" more than their current price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if their value is in the "low twenties," he replied: "Oh yes, well above that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Einhorn holds $387 million in Pfizer stock, his third-biggest holding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson; Editing by Padraic Cassidy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney/ABC Television Group President Anne Sweeney earned the top spot on The Hollywood Reporter's list of the 100 most powerful women in entertainment, for the second year in a row.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2009, Sweeney shared the honor, which is widely watched in media circles, with Sony Pictures Entertainment co-chairman Amy Pascal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The top place was determined, among other criteria, by three financial measures: 1. Revenue generated for companies; 2. valuation of assets; 3. number of employees overseen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three key factors put Sweeney solidly in first place: revenue at Disney Media Networks last year was more than $17 billion, up 6 percent, the same media properties are valued at a staggering $61 billion and she oversees 10,000 employees, far more than any other woman in the entertainment industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also didn't hurt that when asked, "Who is the most powerful woman in Hollywood?" almost everyone The Hollywood Reporter contacted -- from high-level agents to producers and even rival executives -- named Sweeney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rounding out the top 10 are:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;2. Amy Pascal, co-chairman, Sony Pictures Entertainment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3. Bonnie Hammer, chairman of NBC Universal Cable Entertainment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;4. Oprah Winfrey, chairman of Harpo Studios&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;5. Abbe Raven, president and CEO of AE Television Networks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;6. Stacey Snider, co-chairman and CEO at Dreamworks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;7. Donna Langley, co-chairman of Universal Pictures&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;8. Nina Tassler, president of CBS Entertainment&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;9. Dana Walden, chairman of 20th Century Fox Television&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;10. Judy McGrath, chairman of MTV networks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actress Angelina Jolie returned to the list at No. 26, while other personalities were honored for the first time.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Prosecutors sought forfeiture on Tuesday of $625 million from accounts at JPMorgan Chase traceable to the fraud of convicted swindler Bernard Madoff, according to court papers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The office of the Manhattan U.S. attorney said the money was paid to Madoff associate Carl Shapiro and certain other people and entities. The filing in U.S. District Court in New York said the government "intends to request that the funds be distributed to victims of the fraud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week in a separate civil action, the court-appointed trustee liquidating the Madoff firm sued JP Morgan for $6.5 billion as part of his efforts to recover money for defrauded customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Madoff, 72, is serving a 150-year prison term after pleading guilty in March 2009 to a decades-long multibillion-dollar fraud that swindled thousands of investors worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool, editing by Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

    Standpoint Research this morning cut its rating on shares of Intel to
Hold from Buy, writing that the stock has hit the $22 price target the
firm set when it initiated coverage back on September 9th. Jeffrey
Kindler resigned as Pfizer Inc.'s chief executive officer after he
refused to name a head of operations as part of a plan agreed to by
senior managers in September, said a person familiar with the
proceedings. Sirius XM Radio is extending its deal with the NFL for
another five seasons, providing play-by-play coverage on Sirius for all
of the league's games through the Super Bowl in February 2016. Sprint
Nextel promised to save up to $11 billion in the next seven years from a
big network restructuring that involves eventually getting rid of the

&lt;p&gt; * Google wins contract to provide email to federal agency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Google poses threat to rival Microsoft's pricing-analyst&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jasmin Melvin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, Dec 7 (Reuters) - Google Inc (GOOG.O) won a
federal government contract last week that the company hopes
will give it a boost over rival Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) as they
race to convert government agencies to cloud computing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) awarded a
five-year, $6.7 million contract to Google and Unisys Corp
(UIS.N) -- a relatively small dollar amount but an important
initial foothold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As part of the contract, Google and Unisys will transition
the GSA, which basically serves as the back office for federal
agencies, to a secure cloud-based platform that includes
Google's Gmail, Calendar, Docs and Sites applications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GSA is the first U.S. federal agency to make a agencywide
"move to the cloud."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cloud computing is computing over the Internet, in which
applications are delivered through a web browser, allowing any
time and anywhere access to information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumers typically use cloud computing when online banking
or shopping on sites like Amazon.com (AMZN.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The GSA is a big win for Web search engine leader Google
because the agency touches so many aspects of the federal
government, potentially setting the company up for other
federal agency contracts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a real duel," said Melissa Webster, program vice
president for content and digital media technologies at market
researcher IDC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Microsoft is clearly in Google's gun sights and... Google
is a huge threat to Microsoft in lots of areas," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She added that the biggest challenge Google poses to
Microsoft is on pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Software giant Microsoft expressed disappointment in the
GSA's decision. However, Microsoft U.S. Public Sector Vice
President Curt Kolcun said in a statement the company remained
"gratified that so many federal, state and local governments
have chosen Microsoft to meet their business needs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Google hopes the GSA win will begin to change that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This opens up the flood gates to a lot of agencies who
really have wanted to move to the cloud and have wanted to see
a green light to do so," Dave Girouard, Google's president of
enterprise, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Girouard said Google's advantage over Microsoft in cloud
computing hinges on the elimination of software installation as
Google's cloud is entirely web-based, keeping prices low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're built from the bottom up for the cloud. That gives
us a significant head start over Microsoft," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said competition was good for the industry, and
it was confident customers would not stray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft offers a "private cloud" option that hosts its
products on the customer's own servers. Google's servers must
host their suite of cloud services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GOVERNMENT ADOPTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moving all of its 17,000 employees and contractors to
cloud-based email and collaboration tools will lower costs by
50 percent, saving the agency $15 million over five years, GSA
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think other agencies will look closely at that savings
as budgetary pressures become more and more significant in the
federal government," David Mihalchik, Google strategy and
business development executive, said in a phone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With Google Apps integrated into government operations in
more than 30 states, in addition to use by more than 3 million
businesses, Mihalchik, who oversaw the GSA contract process,
said he expects to see the same kind of strong adoption in the
federal market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're offering a more powerful technology at a lower cost
with better security," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global IT spending on cloud services are expected to triple
by 2013, topping $44 billion, IDC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IDC's Webster said that although a cloud vendor offering
robust functionality could displace the incumbent, she did not
think Google would be able to displace Microsoft in the private
sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is still a huge gap in what Microsoft provides in
its online suite and what Google provides," she told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The real threat to Microsoft is to maintain its price and
maintain its value in the face of this cheaper, innovative
challenger," Webster said, adding that the heated competition
with keep prices down for consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Google may make inroads in the government sector, she
said, as these deals are driven primarily by email services.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Dec 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Intacct, a leader in cloud financial management and accounting
applications, today announced that AccessTek, a leading Chicago-area
value-added reseller (VAR), has joined the Intacct Business Partner

Intacct a natural extension of its Microsoft portfolio. AccessTek clients
and prospects have also expressed significant interest in moving their
financial applications to the cloud to gain more modern financial systems.

significant consideration that we've forged this partnership. It's clear
from our research that the cloud is the future of financial management,
and Intacct will be a valuable addition to our portfolio -- providing
both significant benefits to our clients and a highly lucrative revenue
stream for AccessTek. Cloud computing and Intacct have tremendous
momentum and we are excited to get on board."

    "Our mission is to help every small and midsized business adopt cloud
computing and Intacct to improve efficiency, increase profitability and
make better financial decisions. Partnerships with leaders like AccessTek
are a huge step forward in our effort to realize this vision," said
Taylor Macdonald, vice president of Channels at Intacct. "AccessTek is
yet another top Microsoft VAR that has seen the light and made the move
to cloud computing with Intacct. We are keenly aware of the significant
contributions that Lindy and AccessTek have made to the industry, and we

			Here are highlights from Monday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Change at Pfizer&#8217;s Helm
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) 
      delivered a surprise over the weekend with the sudden appointment of Ian 
      C. Read as the new President, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Director 
      of the company. The announcement was made following the sudden and 
      unexpected retirement of the erstwhile CEO, Jeffrey B. Kindler.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jeff Kindler was responsible for pulling off the $68 billion 
      Pfizer-Wyeth merger, which led to the creation of a more diversified 
      company. Mr. Kindler also streamlined operations across the world 
      through cost-cutting initiatives and the setting up of more focused and 
      agile business segments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While reasons like fatigue and lack of personal time for family were 
      given for Mr. Kindler&#8217;s sudden retirement, rumors have been doing the 
      rounds that the retirement was more to do with investor and Board 
      dissatisfaction regarding the company&#8217;s stock price and recent 
      late-stage pipeline failures. Moreover, there has been some element of 
      dissatisfaction regarding the company's strategy of boosting revenues 
      through acquisitions and driving the bottom-line through cost cutting 
      initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new CEO has been heading Pfizer&#8217;s global biopharmaceutical business 
      since 2006. The biopharma business has five global business units which 
      together accounted for about 85% of Pfizer&#8217;s revenues. Pfizer&#8217;s Board 
      intends to elect a non-executive Chairman in a couple of weeks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new CEO will have his work cut out with the company facing a major 
      patent cliff in the next few years. Pfizer is entering a challenging 
      operating period with the loss of patent exclusivity on several 
      products. Moreover, the company has faced several pipeline setbacks in 
      the recent past.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer&#8217;s news comes just a few days after Merck (NYSE: MRK) 
      announced the appointment of Kenneth C. Frazier as its CEO and 
      President, effective Jan 1, 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Consumers Continue Shopping Online
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The recession, job cuts and poorer purchasing power notwithstanding, 
      U.S. consumers have retained their appetite for spending. Thus says 
      latest data from ComScore, which has disclosed online spending estimates 
      for the first phase of the 2010 holiday season.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although the heaviest days were Thanksgiving Day through Cyber Monday, 
      online spending in the first 33 days since November 2 jumped 12% from 
      last year. Cyber Monday spending reached new heights, crossing the $1 
      billion mark for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Specifically, Thanksgiving Day sales were up 28% from 2009, Black Friday 
      sales up 9%, Cyber Monday sales up 16% and sales in the following week 
      through December 3 up 9%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We are inclined to think that the data is deceptive, since it was no 
      doubt helped by the continuing shift from offline purchases to online 
      purchases. So it may not be indicative of increased spending on the part 
      of consumers. Moreover, consumers are displaying unprecedented 
      cost-consciousness, which is not evident from the overall growth numbers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      But retailers across the board agree that consumers are more likely to 
      buy any item after reading consumer reviews and in case there was a 
      discount on offer. Customer service is another important area. We 
      attribute this as the main reason for the success the large retailers, 
      such as Amazon.com (Nasdaq: AMZN), 
      eBay.com (Nasdaq: EBAY), 
      Netflix Inc. (Nasdaq: NFLX) 
      and the like are having.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Big companies are naturally in a better position to offer discounts, 
      consumer reviews and better customer service. This is the reason that 
      the top 25 online retailers saw their market share expand to around 68%, 
      while that of the small to medium-sized players shrunk to around 32%.

      Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Highlights: Limited Brands, Universal 
      Technical, Universal Technical, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group
			
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Zacks Equity Research highlights: Limited 
      Brands (NYSE: LTD) 
      as the Bull of the Day and Universal Technical (NYSE: UTI) 
      as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides 
      analysis on Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C), 
      Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS) 
      and Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bull 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Limited Brands (NYSE: LTD) 
      sustained focus on cost containment, inventory management and 
      merchandise initiatives has kept it afloat in a sluggish retail 
      environment, as evident from its healthy third-quarter 2010 results. 
      Consequently, management raised its fiscal 2010 earnings outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company's Bath  Body Works segment is gaining traction, driven by a 
      rise in store transactions, enhancement in the direct channel business 
      and growth in new stores. Victoria's Secret Stores has been performing 
      well, and the company is also revamping its La Senza brand. Limited 
      Brands looks to enhance its retail footprint across the globe by 
      expanding aggressively in Canada and other international markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moreover, the company's strong liquidity poises it to drive growth and 
      enhance return. Consequently, we upgrade our recommendation on the stock 
      to Outperform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bear 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Universal Technical's (NYSE: UTI) 
      fourth-quarter 2010 earnings missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate, and 
      fell 9.4% from the prior-year quarter. The average enrollment of the 
      educational institute rose 15.4%, but new student growth slid 5% during 
      the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management hinted that the regulation proposed by the Department of 
      Education may moderate the growth of new students and average 
      enrollments. The company forecast new and average students growth in the 
      low and mid single-digit rates, respectively, for fiscal 2011 compared 
      with double-digit growth in the prior-year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company had also projected a subdued earnings outlook for the year 
      that had fallen short of the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Consequently, we 
      have an Underperform rating on the stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Citi to Pay Investors $2.43M?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Citigroup Inc. (NYSE: C) 
      has hit the headlines again and this time for a wrong reason. According 
      to a report in the Wall Street Journal, its unit &#8211; Citigroup 
      Global Markets has been ordered to pay $2.43 million to a group of 
      investors who had suffered losses on investing in the company&#8217;s MAT 
      Five, one among a series municipal arbitrage fund. This fines refers to 
      a ruling of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority panel (FINRA).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investors who are five in number and based in Memphis, Tennessee, 
      have accused Citigroup Global Markets for misrepresentation the fund&#8217;s 
      risk and for violation of its fiduciary duty. The claim was filed in 
      2009 asking for damages related to the fund which lost substantially 
      between 2007 and 2008.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The funds were purchased by the investors in February 2007 through Smith 
      Barney, Citi&#8217;s retail brokerage unit at that time. Later in 2009, the 
      brokerage operations of Smith Barney were merged with Morgan Stanley 
      (NYSE: MS).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While FINRA did not provide the details of the case, Citi&#8217;s spokesperson 
      termed the claims as &#8220;meritless,&#8221; as per the report. The fined amount is 
      said to fully compensate for the out-of-pocket losses of the investors 
      and the interest to be earned if the amount had been invested in a 
      municipal-bond portfolio, according to the lawyers involved in the case.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Post the financial crisis the authorities went in for rigorous 
      investigations on all fraudulent practices of the Wall Street companies. 
      Besides Citi, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) 
      have also faced harsh rulings from the authorities. We believe that such 
      rulings somewhat creates a dent in the company&#8217;s reputation and puts its 
      financials at stake as well.

			The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles Selects Cross-Platform 
      Microsoft DPM Solution from i365, A Seagate Company
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EVault for Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager Gives The 
      Jewish Federation Continuous Data Protection for Microsoft Application 
      Servers, Support for VMware
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			i365, 
      Inc., A Seagate Company (NASDAQ:STX), today announced that The Jewish 
      Federation of Greater Los Angeles has selected EVault&#174; 
      for Microsoft&#174; System Center Data Protection Manager (EVault for DPM) 
      for their online 
      backup needs. The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles is 
      a nonprofit committed to caring for Jews in need, ensuring the Jewish 
      future and engaging in the community in Los Angeles, Israel and around 
      the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Jewish Federation has deployed two instances of EVault for DPM, an 
      all-in-one backup and recovery appliance that extends DPM 2010 into all 
      IT environments and offers offsite protection against site disasters. 
      The primary appliance is protecting Microsoft Exchange Server 2010, and 
      a VMware&#174; 
      virtual environment. The second appliance will be housed in another 
      location, allowing the Federation to securely send the backup data 
      offsite for disaster 
      recovery. Previously, The Jewish Federation had used tape-based 
      processes that did not fully support the newest generation of Microsoft 
      applications, such as Exchange 2010, and provide seamless integration 
      with VMware. Now with EVault for DPM, The Jewish Federation has a true 
      disk-to-disk solution that will enable the organization to accelerate 
      their backup windows and the time it takes for them to recover their 
      critical applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      EVault for DPM provides organizations with a single backup 
      and recovery solution that leverages the best of EVault&#8217;s and 
      Microsoft DPM&#8217;s capabilities to protect both Microsoft and non-Microsoft 
      environments. In addition to offering continuous 
      data protection of Windows application and file servers, the 
      solution also provides integrated data protection for UNIX, Linux, 
      Novell Netware, VMware, and IBM i platforms, as well as Oracle 
      databases. EVault for DPM also offers Cloud-Connected capabilities to 
      help IT departments get offsite protection for disaster recovery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;i365&#8217;s EVault for DPM stood out from other options because of its 
      ability to provide best-in-class data protection for Microsoft 
      applications and VMware,&#8221; said David Abowitt, senior systems manager at 
      The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles. &#8220;Our previous solution was 
      not getting the job done as well as we would have liked&#8212;the tape-based 
      processes just weren&#8217;t giving us a reliable way to back up all data 
      across our various platforms. Now, we&#8217;re doing that seamlessly and we 
      will be connecting to the Cloud to take our backup data offsite with one 
      comprehensive solution.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We designed EVault for DPM to be an easy-to-deploy, easy-to-manage 
      solution that will not only offer deep integration with Microsoft 
      applications but also provide efficient and reliable protection for your 
      entire mixed IT environment,&#8221; said David Hallmen, worldwide sales and 
      marketing, i365. &#8220;The Jewish Federation&#8217;s prior backup situation is a 
      great example of how tape-based systems aren&#8217;t able to keep up with the 
      increasing demands on data availability and recovery times. 
      Organizations like The Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles are 
      proving the market need for this disk-based, cloud-connected approach 
      that can eliminate the need for tape and reduce the cost and complexity 
      of their deployment.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;
BURBANK, Calif., Dec. 7, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The Walt Disney Studios,
DreamWorks Studios and IMAX Corporation (Nasdaq:IMAX) (TSX:IMX) announced today
that two of DreamWorks' 2011 Touchstone Pictures releases, I Am Number Four and
Real Steel, will open day-and-date in digital IMAX(R) theatres around the world.
Both films are produced by DreamWorks and will be released under Disney's
Touchstone banner as part of the distribution agreement between the two
companies.

"DreamWorks is pleased to have the incredible team at IMAX on board for these
two exciting films," said Jeff Small, President and COO of DreamWorks Studios.
"Having I Am Number Four and Real Steel exhibited in IMAX theatres gives us a
wonderful opportunity to showcase the fantastic work of the filmmakers and the
people involved in creating these visual tales. Audiences get the benefit of a
fully immersive movie-going experience on two films that are ideally suited for
the visual and sensory IMAX experience."

"Real Steel and I Am Number Four are films that transport the audience right
into the middle of the action," said Chuck Viane, president of global
distribution for Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. "We're very excited to be
able to offer moviegoers The IMAX Experience(R) for these films."

"The inclusion of two live-action DreamWorks titles in our 2011 slate enables us
to expand the range of content available to IMAX theatres and extend our brand
deeper into our growing 18-34 audience segment," said IMAX Chief Executive
Officer Richard L. Gelfond. "Both directors have already demonstrated how their
vision works very well with The IMAX Experience and with such a strong studio
behind them, we're optimistic that even more of their fans will have the
opportunity to experience their latest work in IMAX."

"We are thrilled that IMAX movie-goers will experience the newest films from our
long-standing partnership with DreamWorks Studios and filmmakers D.J. Caruso and
Shawn Levy," said Greg Foster, Chairman and President of IMAX Filmed
Entertainment. "The strong track records of Steven, Stacey, Jeff and the
filmmakers represent the quality and excitement that we look for in our films
and we believe these strong titles are an ideal fit for our audience and our
2011 film slate."

Helmed by D.J. Caruso (Eagle Eye, Disturbia), I Am Number Four is an
action-packed thriller about an extraordinary teen (Alex Pettyfer) hunted by
ruthless enemies. Settling in a small Ohio town, he discovers powerful new
abilities as well as a connection to the others who share his destiny. Timothy
Olyphant (Justified) and Dianna Agron (Glee) also star. The film has a US
release date of February 18, 2011.

Set in a world of next-generation boxing, Real Steel is a gritty action drama
directed by Shawn Levy (A Night at the Museum franchise, Date Night). Hugh
Jackman (Wolverine, X-Men) headlines as washed-up fighter Charlie Kenton, who
lost his chance at a title when 8-foot-tall steel robots took over the ring.
When he reluctantly teams up with his estranged son (Dakota Goyo), Charlie gets
one last shot at a comeback. Real Steel is scheduled for release in the US on
October 7, 2011.

      Research and Markets: Egypt Real Estate Report Q4 2010 Envisages That 
      Capital Values Will Increase Rather More Than Rentals
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/c76dd4/egypt_real_estate) 
      has announced the addition of the "Egypt 
      Real Estate Report Q4 2010" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Egypt Real Estate Report provides industry professionals and 
      strategists, corporate analysts, real estate associations, government 
      departments and regulatory bodies with independent forecasts and 
      competitive intelligence on Egypt's Real Estate industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In mid-2010, BMIs in-country sources confirmed that Egypt is in the 
      early stages of a major real estate boom. Across all five cities from 
      which we have gathered data (Cairo, Alexandria, Sixth of October City, 
      New Cairo and Giza), rents and capital values have risen over the past 
      six months or so in the office and retail sub-sectors, while yields have 
      fallen. Rents and yields appear to have tracked sideways in the less 
      active industrial sub-sector.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The findings from the latest round of interviews are consistent with 
      what we deduced from the previous round, which we conducted at the end 
      of 2009. A very substantial increase in the supply of commercial 
      property thanks in part to the development of new cities to the east and 
      west of Cairo and in part due to projects in the capital itself means 
      that years (perhaps decades) of under-development are finally being 
      addressed. For a long time businesses have had little option but to 
      operate in (typically old) buildings originally constructed for 
      residential purposes. Now they have some choice.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand is also coming from two other quarters. Western multinationals 
      are establishing and/or expanding their presence in Egypt, with the 
      result that they need more office space. At the same time, Middle 
      Eastern companies are relocating to Egypt, often in response to more 
      difficult conditions in Dubai and Lebanon. Significantly, this second 
      group of companies understands and is tolerant of the risks of operating 
      in Egypt. Even if the political noises surrounding the forthcoming 
      elections produces widespread unrest, these regional companies are 
      unlikely to reconsider their plans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The result is that conditions are dynamic. Vacancy rates vary, but are 
      generally low or falling. Looking ahead, we expect that the optimism of 
      protagonists in the office and retail sub-sectors will be justified. 
      There should be a double-digit increase in rentals in these sub-sectors 
      in 2011; further if smaller rises are likely in the following years. 
      Over the forecast period (2011-2014), we envisage that capital values 
      will increase rather more than rentals. As a result, the general 
      downtrend in yields should continue. Egyptian assets are being rerated, 
      and the countrys commercial real estate sector is a clear beneficiary of 
      this.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key Features Of This Report
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This is the latest edition of a new series of industry reports published 
      by BMI that seeks to identify the key dynamics of the real estate 
      sectors of 44 countries around the world, some of which are developed 
      and some of which are, in every sense, emerging markets. The questions 
      that we seek to answer for each country remain as follows: What are the 
      main issues for actors in and around real estate development in the 
      country concerned, over both the long and the short term? What are the 
      main constraints that they face? What are the key insights to be gleaned 
      by comparing the real estate sector of a country with its regional peers?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Q3 we introduced a very substantial improvement to our reports. We 
      incorporated data and qualitative observations provided to us by 
      commercial real estate agents operating in the countries we survey. As a 
      result we have gained a much clearer picture of the balance between 
      demand and supply in each of three main sub-sectors office, retail and 
      industrial. We have also introduced a new approach to the forecasting of 
      rental yields, which is discussed in the methodology section of this 
      report.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Q410 we have incorporated a lot of new data in relation to rents and 
      yields in 2010. We gained this data through a new round of interviews 
      with our in-country sources in mid-2010. In some cases, the latest 
      information from our sources has caused us to make significant revisions 
      to our forecasts for 2011-2014. We asked our sources to indicate what 
      growth in rents is likely for 2011. We explain their answers in the 
      Forecast Scenarios.

      Visa Mobile Contactless Payments Solution Certified for Commercial Use
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Visa approves DeviceFidelity&#8217;s In2Pay&#8482; microSD for use with leading 
      smartphone models
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) and Visa Europe1 today announced the 
      commercial availability of mobile contactless payments enabled by 
      DeviceFidelity&#8217;s In2Pay microSD solution. For the first time in Visa&#8217;s 
      history, a mobile contactless payment solution is now included in the 
      list of Visa compliant products available for potential commercial 
      deployment by financial institutions in the U.S. and select markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following 18 months of technology development in partnership with 
      Texas-based DeviceFidelity, and trials with leading financial 
      institutions in the United States, Europe and Asia, Visa has tested and 
      supports commercialization of In2Pay microSD for use with leading smart 
      phones.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Smartphone models compatible for use with this landmark technology 
      include the BlackBerry&#174; BoldTM 96502, the iPhone 
      4, the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 3G, and the Android based Samsung Vibrant 
      Galaxy 5, representing three of the leading mobile operating systems in 
      the world. Visa expects to add additional phone models for use with this 
      technology, including phones based on the Symbian and Windows operating 
      systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a historic milestone for Visa and its clients,&#8221; said Bill 
      Gajda, head of Visa Mobile. &#8220;In addition to issuing plastic magnetic 
      stripe or chip-enabled payment cards, financial institutions can now 
      consider offering their account holders a new technology that enables 
      them to transform their existing phones into fully functional mobile 
      payment devices.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			From Trials to Commercial Availability
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The compliance testing process for mobile devices established by Visa 
      includes extensive technical, security and usability testing with 
      respect to the Visa mobile payment functionality. It ensures reliable 
      and secure Visa transactions that are compatible with the global 
      standard for chip-enabled payments, and establishes a required signal 
      range for all mobile contactless payments. Visa&#8217;s compliance testing 
      process ensures the combination of the phone; secure chip and mobile 
      payment application will provide the level of user experience Visa 
      accountholders have come to expect from Visa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The microSD payment technology has been developed in partnership with 
      DeviceFidelity and had previously been available only to financial 
      institutions who were participating with Visa in mobile payment trials 
      including some of the largest financial institutions in the U.S. &#8211; JP 
      Morgan Chase, Wells Fargo Bank, US Bancorp and Bank of America. Now, 
      Visa issuers can obtain the technology under Visa&#8217;s standard contract 
      terms and can load the Visa mobile payment application to microSD cards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Issuers who choose to adopt the technology can provide their account 
      holders with a tiny microSD card that can be inserted into the phone&#8217;s 
      existing memory slot to enable the device for payment. The technology is 
      compatible with existing contactless payment terminals already installed 
      at retail outlets worldwide and enables account holders to simply hold 
      the phone in front a payment terminal in order to pay.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This technology also opens the way for mobile operators, retailers and 
      other stakeholders in the payments ecosystem to partner with financial 
      institutions to bring Visa mobile payment functionality to consumers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a significant step towards the next generation of payments, 
      loyalty and rewards, allowing banks and retailers to build entirely new 
      business models,&#8221; said Nick Holland, Senior Analyst with Yankee Group. 
      &#8220;Visa's announcement clearly illustrates that the future of payments 
      will be mobile.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Financial Institutions have the option to integrate Visa&#8217;s mobile 
      payment solution into their existing mobile application, and offer 
      additional services such as Visa transaction alerts that notify account 
      holders in near real-time of account activity, and targeted merchant 
      offers that are tailored to consumer lifestyle and location. Together, 
      these services have the potential to enhance the consumer payment 
      experience and allow account holders to better manage their payment 
      accounts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8221;This is a win-win for banks, merchants, wireless carriers, handset 
      makers, app developers and consumers alike as it delivers a unique 
      combination of consumer preferred devices, smart chip based security and 
      application driven innovation, something that the NFC ecosystem has 
      aspired for a long time,&#8221; said Deepak Jain, President and CEO of 
      DeviceFidelity, Inc. &#8220;Working with Visa and its financial institution 
      partners, we are excited to be at the forefront of this important 
      milestone and helping to make mobile payments a reality for consumers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With nearly 5 billion mobile handsets in market around the globe, 
      consumers everywhere have come to rely on their mobile phone as a part 
      of everyday life. According to IDC3, smart phone shipments 
      globally are expected to increase 24% in 2011, helping drive continued 
      growth in more robust and powerful mobile devices that are capable of 
      supporting contactless payment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Mobile payments are a strategic priority for Visa in Europe where we 
      have played a leadership role in developing the market," 
      commented&#160;Sandra Alzetta, Head of Innovation at Visa Europe.&#160;"We are 
      delighted that the hard work we've invested in market trials has paid 
      off. With this milestone, we can help our customers enter the mobile 
      payment space on a commercial basis, offering valuable and exciting 
      benefits to consumers."

			Piloting innovation to help customers conduct their payments in a 
      quicker and more convenient way
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Continuing its leadership in the mobile banking space,
			Wells 
      Fargo  Company (NYSE:WFC) is rolling out its Visa&#174; (NYSE:V) microSD 
      mobile payment pilot. This San Francisco based pilot will include 200 
      Wells Fargo team members who are also users of specific BlackBerry&#174; 
      smartphones and iPhone&#8482; models.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The pilot features DeviceFidelity&#8217;s In2Pay&#8482; technology. BlackBerry 
      smartphone users will directly insert the In2Pay microSD card into the 
      slot in their device, while iPhone users will receive the protective 
      In2Pay Case for iPhone with the In2Pay microSD card.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To make payments, users simply open the Wells Fargo Mobile Banking 
      application, select pay with phone and wave the phone in front of the 
      contactless reader at the point of purchase. The reader will light up 
      and beep, indicating that the payment has been received.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wells Fargo team members participating in the pilot will be able to use 
      their personal BlackBerry smartphone or iPhone to make payments wherever 
      there are contactless payment readers, including fast food restaurants, 
      taxis, sporting event concession stands and vending machines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Wells Fargo was the first major financial services company to pilot 
      mobile credit and debit payments that could be used anywhere nationwide 
      contactless readers were available,&#8221; said Peter Ho, product manager for 
      Wells Fargo Card Services and Consumer Lending. &#8220;We&#8217;re proud, once 
      again, to lead innovation in helping our customers conduct their 
      financial transactions when, where and how they want.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The secure In2Pay microSD card will host Visa payWave, Visa&#8217;s 
      contactless payment application. Wells Fargo specifically integrated the 
      Visa payWave functionality into its award winning Wells Fargo Mobile 
      Banking application for this pilot. Pilot participants can choose their 
      payment instrument with the option of loading up to one Wells Fargo Visa 
      Credit Card and one Wells Fargo Visa Debit Card.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The In2Pay technology developed by DeviceFidelity consists of a 
      specially designed secure memory card containing a smart card chip, an 
      integrated software controlled antenna and flash memory for storage of 
      user content like photos and music. The smart card chip hosts Visa&#8217;s 
      contactless application, Visa payWave, and is capable of hosting 
      multiple accounts such as credit, debit and prepaid.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are proud to be providing the technology that is powering this 
      unique pilot program at one of the most innovative banks in America,&#8221; 
      says Amitaabh Malhotra, Chief Operating Officer of DeviceFidelity. 
      &#8220;Working with Visa and its financial institution partners, we are at the 
      forefront of making fast progress in bringing this solution to 
      potentially millions of consumers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa mobile payments use multiple layers of security including advanced 
      security technology to uniquely identify each contactless transaction. 
      The technology is designed to protect against counterfeit fraud. All 
      Wells Fargo Visa payWave transactions, including those initiated by a 
      mobile phone, are backed by Wells Fargo&#8217;s Zero Liability protection. 
      This means that a cardholder is not liable for any unauthorized 
      transactions made at merchants, over the phone, on the Internet or at 
      the ATM, when promptly reported.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa will showcase the Wells Fargo mobile payment application at the 
      CARTES  IDentification Conference, Stand 4J022 from Tuesday December 7 
      to December 9, 2010 at the Paris-Nord Villepinte Exhibition Center, in 
      Hall 4. To arrange a media pass, schedule an interview or for product 
      information, please contact Elvira Swanson at 415-932-2564, or globalmedia@visa.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In October 
      2007, Wells Fargo became the first major financial services company 
      in the country to offer consumer and small business customers both 
      mobile web site (WF.com) and text-based (93557) account access via 
      mobile devices. Today, Wells Fargo's mobile banking portfolio provides 
      customers with more choices 
      in how they bank, such as the Wells 
      Fargo Mobile Banking app available on BlackBerry smartphones and the 
      iPhone, available from wf.com.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through Wells Fargo's Mobile Banking applications, customers can access 
      their current available account balances, transaction history, and 
      credit card payment information. Customers can also securely transfer 
      funds to their other accounts or to other Wells Fargo customers and pay 
      bills. In addition, customers can receive alerts on their mobile devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Wells Fargo Mobile Banking App is available for free from the App 
      Store on iPhone or at&#160;www.iTunes.com/AppStore.

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration said water may have been left in the line after a pressure test and that oversight may have led to freeze damage during recent cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Chevron spokesman said he could not comment because he had not yet seen the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 10-inch diameter line, which brings crude from Rangely, Colorado, to Chevron's Salt Lake City refinery, was shut down after the leak was discovered and remains shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron Pipe Line Co has increased the estimate of the spill on the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City from 100 barrels to 500 barrels, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron has said there has been no effect on the operations of the refinery or the Rangely oilfield, which are relying on storage during the shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The June 20 pressure test involved injection of water in the line to check it after repair of a leak that occurred last June about 500 feet from the latest leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PHMSA said in a corrective action order Wednesday that the manufacturer of the valve involved in the leak required that all water be removed and antifreeze be injected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agency ordered Chevron to remove all fluids from line segments involved in the pressure test and to inspect all affected parts to assure no lingering effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The line will not be restarted until the agency is satisfied that Chevron has appropriate monitors and procedures in place to detect leaks, the order said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

procedures last June may have caused a Chevron (CVX.N) oil
pipeline leak in Utah on Dec. 1, the U.S. pipeline safety
agency said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety
Administration said water may have been left in the line after
a pressure test and that oversight may have led to freeze
damage during recent cold weather.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Chevron spokesman said he could not comment because he
had not yet seen the order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 10-inch diameter line, which brings crude from Rangely,
Colorado, to Chevron's Salt Lake City refinery, was shut down
after the leak was discovered and remains shut.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Pipe Line Co has increased the estimate of the
spill on the University of Utah campus in Salt Lake City from
100 barrels to 500 barrels, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has said there has been no effect on the operations
of the refinery or the Rangely oilfield, which are relying on
storage during the shutdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The June 20 pressure test involved injection of water in
the line to check it after repair of a leak that occurred last
June about 500 feet from the latest leak.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PHMSA said in a corrective action order Wednesday that the
manufacturer of the valve involved in the leak required that
all water be removed and antifreeze be injected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency ordered Chevron to remove all fluids from line
segments involved in the pressure test and to inspect all
affected parts to assure no lingering effects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The line will not be restarted until the agency is
satisfied that Chevron has appropriate monitors and procedures
in place to detect leaks, the order said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Editing by Bernard Orr)

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Credit card giants MasterCard and Visa came under intense cyber attack on Wednesday as supporters of WikiLeaks retaliated for moves against Julian Assange after the release of U.S. diplomatic cables that angered and embarrassed Washington.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Swedish prosecution authority, whose arrest order for Assange over accusations of sexual offenses led a British court to remand the 39-year-old WikiLeaks website founder in custody, also said it had reported an online attack to police.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assange's online supporters hit the corporate website of credit card firm MasterCard in apparent retaliation for its blocking of donations to the WikiLeaks website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are glad to tell you that www.mastercard.com/ is down and it's confirmed!" said an entry on the Twitter feed of a group calling itself AnonOps, which says it fights against censorship and "copywrong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visa Inc's site was temporarily unavailable late on Monday in the United States and the same group claimed responsibility for bringing it down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources told Reuters that WikiLeaks' next release may highlight U.S. government reports on suspected militants held at Guantanamo Bay, which some U.S. officials fear could show some detainees were freed despite intelligence assessments they were still dangerous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mark Stephens, Assange's principal lawyer in London, denied the WikiLeaks founder had ordered the cyber strikes, which appeared to target companies seen as cooperating with efforts to rein in Wikileaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assange "did not give instructions to hack" the company websites, Stephens told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MasterCard, calling the attack "a concentrated effort to flood our corporate web site with traffic and slow access," said on Wednesday all of its services had been restored and that card holder account data was not at risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it said the attack, mounted by hackers using simple tools posted on the Web, had extended beyond its website to payment processing technology, leaving some customers unable to make online payments using MasterCard software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assange spent the night in a British jail and will appear for a hearing next Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CARRY ON&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assange, who has lived periodically in Sweden, was accused this year of sexual misconduct by two female Swedish WikiLeaks volunteers. The pair's lawyer said their claims were not a politically motivated plot against Assange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It has nothing to do with WikiLeaks or the CIA," said lawyer Claes Borgstrom, whose website also came under cyber attack, according to officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assange has angered U.S. authorities and triggered headlines worldwide by publishing the secret cables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Australian Foreign Minister Kevin Rudd said the people who originally leaked the documents, not Assange, were legally liable and the leaks raised questions over the "adequacy" of U.S. security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. State Department said that while the U.S. government did have responsibility for the leaks, it was important to highlight that the Wikileaks releases "put real lives and real interests at risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WikiLeaks vowed it would continue making public details of the confidential U.S. cables. Only a fraction of them have been published so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assange has become the public face of WikiLeaks, hailed by supporters including Australian journalist John Pilger and British filmmaker Ken Loach as a defender of free speech, but he is now battling to clear his name.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some supporters appear to want to help him. While most denial of service attacks involve botnets, programs that hijack computers and use them to target individual websites and bring them down, the current cyber attacks seem to be different.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In this case... they seem to be using their own computers," he said. Asked what that said about how many individuals might be involved: "Probably hundreds at the least, could be thousands," said Mikko Hypponen, chief research officer of Finnish software security firm F-Secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Visa and MasterCard, the world's two largest credit and debit card processors, the attack raised questions about the vulnerability of core operations -- and consumers' ability to use credit, debit and online payments instead of cash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, investors in both companies largely reacted with a shrug. Shares of both companies closed up over 1 percent, although Visa slipped slightly in after-hours trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You don't see this being a long-term or terminal situation where they can't find a fix," said Michael Nix, principal at Greenwood Capital Associates, which owns Visa shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Visa did not immediately return calls seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Online payment service PayPal, which was among companies which suspended WikiLeaks' accounts used to collect donations, said it had acted at the behest of the U.S. government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On November 27th, the State Department, the U.S. government basically, wrote a letter saying that the WikiLeaks activities were deemed illegal in the United States and as a result our policy group had to make the decision of suspending the account," Osama Bedier, PayPal's vice president of platform and emerging technology, told a conference in Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swiss Postfinance, the banking arm of state-owned Swiss Post, which also closed a WikiLeaks donation account, said it had taken countermeasures and an earlier wave of cyber attacks appeared to be waning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The community around Julian Assange have said, 'We're leaving it now, we've shown what we can do. The community has decided to go for MasterCard and Visa now,' Postfinance spokesman Alex Josty said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REVELATIONS CONTINUE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Washington continued to assess the impact of Wikileaks' release of thousands of classified embassy cables, which include damagingly candid assessments of foreign leaders, some officials were bracing for their next headache.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. government sources said there was concern Assange's next batch of material could center on suspected militants held at Guantanamo Bay, and include "threat assessments" by U.S. intelligence agencies gauging the likelihood that specific detainees would return to militant activities if set free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those could cause further embarrassment for the Obama administration if they show that detainees deemed likely to return to terrorism were nevertheless released and subsequently involved in anti-U.S. violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The original source of the leaked cables is not known, although a U.S. army private, Bradley Manning, who worked as an intelligence analyst in Iraq, has been charged by military authorities with unauthorized downloading of more than 150,000 State Department cables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. officials have declined to say whether those cables are the same ones being released by WikiLeaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michel Rose and Peter Apps in London, Emma Thomasson in Zurich, and Patrick Lannin in Stockholm; Mark Hosenball in Washington and Maria Aspan in New York; Writing by Andrew Quinn; Editing by Matthew Jones and Eric Beech)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Unipec lures crude traders from Chevron, Statoil&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Beijing-based Unipec trader leaves to join BP in London&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chinese oil trading giant seeks to expand in US-sources&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Dec 8 (Reuters) - Chinese oil trader Unipec has
hired away two crude traders from foreign oil majors Chevron
(CVX.N) and Norway's Statoil (STL.OL), trading sources told
Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China International United Petroleum  Chemical Corp.
(Unipec), China's top oil trader, hired Chevron senior oil
trader Bill Chalker and Statoil crude trader Mark Tattersdill,
the sources said, requesting anonymity.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both traders had been based in London. It was not
immediately clear whether they would remain there or relocate,
potentially to the United States. Unipec has been seeking
traders to expand its U.S. operations. The company has an
office in New York and may look to expand in Houston, one
trader who met with Unipec said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tattersdill has specialized in trading Angolan crude for
Statoil, a source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron, Statoil and Unipec parent Sinopec (0386.HK) did not
immediately respond to requests for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State-controlled Chinese oil trading firms have been
expanding their presence in crude trading hubs around the
world, including Houston, Singapore and London, and are
increasingly tapping talent from major European or U.S. firms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Unipec has also lost a trader to competitors. Mark Li,
who has specialized in deals for West African crude out of the
company's Beijing office, will take up a trading role with
British oil giant BP Plc (BP.L) in London as soon as next
month, a trading source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Joshua Schneyer in New York, Bruce Nichols in

			ExxonMobil 
      Foundation announced today a $520,000 grant to the National Action 
      Council for Minority Engineers, Inc. (NACME), a premier non-profit 
      focused on increasing the number of underrepresented students pursuing 
      careers in engineering. Of the total grant, $270,000 is part of an 
      annual grant for organization support and scholarships, and $250,000 
      will go toward NACME&#8217;s Pre-Engineering Program and Academies of 
      Engineering (AOE) strategy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil Foundation has been the largest corporate sponsor of NACME 
      since the council&#8217;s founding in 1974 and has provided the organization 
      with more than $10 million in support.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to research done by NACME, less than 12% of baccalaureate 
      engineering graduates in the United States are underrepresented 
      minorities, and only 4% of minority students leave high school with the 
      skills necessary to pursue engineering degrees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As the demand for highly trained engineers continues to rise, NACME&#8217;s 
      development programs help prepare growing numbers of talented, young 
      underrepresented minority students with the skills and exposure they 
      need to graduate from high school and pursue a college degree in 
      engineering. NACME anticipates impacting more than 18,000 middle and 
      high school students nationwide by 2012 through its efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The ExxonMobil Foundation is focused on improving science, technology, 
      engineering and math (STEM) education, but we need quality partners such 
      as NACME in order to have a greater impact,&#8221; said Suzanne McCarron, 
      president, ExxonMobil Foundation. &#8220;When you consider how few minorities 
      there are among engineering ranks in America, it&#8217;s imperative that we 
      work together to find solutions to increase the opportunities and 
      exposure for students with diverse backgrounds.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The continued and generous partnership with ExxonMobil is vital to the 
      success of our Academies of Engineering efforts and will help enhance 
      learning and ensure college readiness for thousands of talented 
      underrepresented minority students,&#8221; said Dr. Irving Pressley McPhail, 
      NACME president and CEO. &#8220;ExxonMobil&#8217;s dedication to strengthening the 
      STEM pipeline serves as a model for what other companies can do to 
      cultivate tomorrow&#8217;s domestic STEM workforce.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NACME has provided leadership and support for the national effort to 
      increase the number of successful African American, American Indian and 
      Latino women and men in STEM education and careers. With funding from 
      corporate and individual donors, NACME has supported over 22,000 
      students with more than $114 million in scholarships and other support. 
      Currently, NACME provides scholarship support for approximately 1,250 
      college engineering students through a national network of 50 Partner 
      Universities.

			Government Loosens Grip on Citi
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fifth and final sale of the remaining 2.4 billion shares of Citigroup 
      Inc. (NYSE: C) 
      announced by the U.S. Treasury yesterday will exhaust government&#8217;s stake 
      in the company. The Citi shares were acquired by the government a couple 
      of years back as a part of the company&#8217;s participation in the Troubled 
      Asset Relief Program (TARP).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Treasury expects to receive net proceeds of $10.68 on the basis of 
      the proposed offering price of $4.45 per share for a total of 2.4 
      billion shares. The government had acquired 27% ownership in Citigroup 
      upon its conversion of $25 billion of rescue money into the latter&#8217;s 
      common stock in 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Citi, which had a huge exposure to troubled mortgages in the form of 
      collateralized debt obligation (CDO), received a total of $45 billion in 
      bailout funds in 2008. There was also a loss-sharing agreement with the 
      Treasury for Citi&#8217;s potential losses on $301 billion of its assets, 
      later terminated by the company. However, it had repaid $20 billion of 
      it debt to the Treasury in the following year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Treasury has been selling off its stake in tranches since April 
      2010. In the first phase, the Treasury sold 1.5 billion shares in 
      Citi for gross proceeds of around $6.2 billion in May. In its second 
      phase, the Treasury sold 1.1 billion shares in July, the third 
      phase witnessed sell out of another 1.5 billion shares in September. 
      Altogether these transactions provided the Treasury with gross proceeds 
      of $16.4 billion. The Treasury&#8217;s fourth pre-arranged written 
      trading plan sold 1.5 billion additional shares from October to November.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The role of sales agent for the above stock sale is being performed by Morgan 
      Stanley (NYSE: MS).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bailout of New York based Citi is expected to turn out profitable 
      for taxpayers with 89 cents of profit per share on a total of 7.7 
      billion shares emanating from average selling price of $4.14 and a lower 
      average conversion price of $3.25. Apart from this, the government also 
      realized a net gain of $2.246 billion in the offering of all Citi TRUPS 
      in September. The Government also pocketed $3 billion of dividends on 
      its preferred shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Though, Treasury will do away with its holding in Citi&#8217;s common stock 
      upon the conclusion of this transaction, it will still own the right to 
      exercise warrants on 465.1 million Citigroup shares. Moreover, the 
      Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. holds $800 million of the bank&#8217;s 
      trust-preferred securities on behalf of the Treasury.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Take
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bailout program has received criticisms from the average taxpayer on 
      grounds of helping those companies whose actions have in turn resulted 
      in the economic crisis. Although the economy is now showing signs of 
      gradual recovery with the stabilization of large financial institutions, 
      tumbling home prices and a high unemployment rate continue to prevail. 
      However, the Treasury has received decent returns on many of their 
      financial-sector investments. According to Bloomberg, it has earned a 
      14% return on the $10 billion invested in Goldman Sachs Group Inc., 
      (NYSE: GS), and 13% on 
      the same amount to money lent to Morgan Stanley. Bloomberg also 
      estimated that the government has earned $25.2 billion on its investment 
      of $309 billion in banks and insurance companies, indicating an 8.2% 
      return over two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The shedding of its stake by the Treasury is a positive for Citi as it 
      reduces the government overhang on the stock. Also, the pace of selling 
      the stake is in sync with the original intention to complete sell off by 
      the end of this year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Citi&#8217;s core business is progressing well and the international business 
      is gaining momentum, though the earnings in the coming quarters are 
      expected to remain pressured following the recent reform Act and the 
      shrinking of its revenue base due to the Citi Holdings business 
      reduction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Citi currently retains a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a 
      short-term Hold rating. Also, considering the company&#8217;s business model 
      and fundamentals, we have a long-term &#8220;Neutral&#8221; recommendation on the 
      stock.

			Good News for Bristol-Myers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) delivered a boost to pharma 
      giant Bristol-Myers Squibb Company (NYSE: BMY) 
      by accepting the supplemental Biologics License Application (sBLA) for 
      the subcutaneous formulation of Orencia (abatacept) for treating adults 
      suffering from moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The confirmation of the receipt of the sBLA, filed with the FDA in the 
      third quarter of 2010, was received on October 4, 2010. The application 
      was filed on the basis of data from four multinational late-stage 
      studies conducted for the RA indication. The program evaluated 1,847 
      adults suffering from moderate to severe RA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RA, a systemic, chronic, autoimmune disease characterized by 
      inflammation in the lining of joints, inhibits mobility due to the 
      affected joints losing their shape and alignment. The incidence of RA is 
      on the rise and the market has a huge unmet need.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We note that Orencia is already approved for multiple indications both 
      in adults and children. Orencia's approval for the additional indication 
      would be a further feather in Bristol-Myers&#8217; cap. The drug would target 
      a highly lucrative RA market which is expected to register a 6% annual 
      growth and reach $14.3 billion by 2017 according to GlobalData.

      Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Highlights: TC PipeLines, L.P., Teradyne, 
      General Electric Company, NextEra Energy
			and First Solar
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Zacks Equity Research highlights 
      TC PipeLines, L.P. (Nasdaq: TCLP) 
      as the Bull of the Day and Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE: TER) 
      as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides 
      analysis on General Electric Company (NYSE: GE), 
      NextEra Energy Inc. (NYSE: NEE) 
      and First Solar Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bull 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the recent distribution increase and strong operating results, 
      we are upgrading TC PipeLines, L.P. (Nasdaq: TCLP) 
      units to Outperform from Neutral. We believe future growth prospects for 
      the partnership have improved considerably following the North Baja 
      Pipeline acquisition and the subsequent capping of general partner IDRs 
      at 25%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In particular, the 25% IDR cap (which only a handful of MLPs have 
      adopted until now) allows limited partners to benefit from the 
      partnership's growth. We also like TC PipeLines' steady cash-flow 
      generating pipeline assets, which provide the stability and financial 
      capacity to deliver cash distributions in a disciplined manner.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As such, we believe TC PipeLines is well positioned going forward and 
      view it as an attractive investment. Our target price is $55.00 per 
      shares, which reflects a multiple of 22.7X trailing twelve-month cash 
      flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bear 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Teradyne, Inc. (NYSE: TER) 
      is a leading provider of automated test equipment. The company's third 
      quarter results were dismal, missing the Zacks Consensus on both the top 
      and bottom lines. Forward guidance was also disappointing, as demand for 
      back-end testing equipment has plummeted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Peaking of the semiconductor equipment cycle, relatively lower exposure 
      to the memory segment and a negative mix of business will impact results 
      in the next few quarters. As a result, we think that investors are 
      likely to discount the product lineup, leaner cost structure and strong 
      balance sheet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We are therefore initiating coverage of TER shares with an Underperform 
      rating. The forward P/E based on 2011 earnings is at a 35% discount to 
      the peer group, much lower than the historical range of a 41% to 50% 
      discount. We therefore believe there is significant downside potential.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			GE to Invest in High-Speed Rail
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			General Electric Company (NYSE: GE) 
      announced an agreement with CSR Corporation Limited (CSR) to advance 
      high-speed and other rail technologies in the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investment is of $50 million with the capacity to create 250 jobs by 
      2012, at the end of the first phase of the agreement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The collaboration is aimed at supplying high-speed rail (HSR) passenger 
      trains for the proposed U.S. HSR corridors in Florida and California.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GE is engaging with CSR to make available technologically advanced, 
      fuel-efficient and low-emission diesel-electric, heavy-duty locomotives 
      in China.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GE has one of the best infrastructure franchises worldwide with solid 
      organic growth rates, exposure to favorable secular trends and a large 
      installed base supporting a growing annuity-like service business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Infrastructure businesses from GE are helping build the energy, health, 
      transportation and technology infrastructure of the new century. These 
      businesses provide the products and services that help developing 
      regions participate in the global economy, while also helping developed 
      regions upgrade with cleaner, more efficient and better infrastructure 
      technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			NextEra to Buy Solar Projects
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NextEra Energy Resources LLC, a unit of NextEra Energy Inc. 
      (NYSE: NEE) has 
      agreed to buy four solar photovoltaic (PV) projects in Ontario, Canada 
      from First Solar Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR). 
      Total capacity of these projects, located in Sombra and Moore Townships, 
      Ontario, is estimated to be 40 megawatts (MW), capable of serving nearly 
      6,440 homes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First Solar has agreed to complete construction at its Sombra and Moore 
      Solar Energy Centers before NextEra Energy Resources&#8217; Canadian 
      subsidiary, NextEra Energy Canada, takes over the ownership and 
      operation of all four projects. First Solar will use its advanced thin 
      film technology on a fixed tilt system to develop these sites.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Sombra and Moore Solar Energy Centers will each consist of two 10-MW 
      solar PV projects with more than 172,000 panels at each project. All the 
      power produced from these four solar projects will be sold to the 
      Ontario Power Authority under long-term contracts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through the development of the four solar power projects the companies 
      expect to promote a clean-energy economy in Ontario, Canada's most 
      populous province. The companies estimate these projects to reduce 
      carbon dioxide emissions by nearly 45,000 tons every year. This is 
      equivalent to removing nearly 8,600 cars from the road every year during 
      the entire life of the project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Construction on all four projects is expected to begin in the first 
      quarter of 2011 with commercial operation expected by the end of 2011. 
      The projects still await government approvals.

			Here are highlights from Tuesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Lawsuit Slams Discover Bank
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Discover Bank, a unit of Discover Financial Services (NYSE: DFS) 
      has been accused by the Minnesota attorney general of keeping customers 
      uninformed about their buying decisions pertaining to the company&#8217;s 
      services. The lawsuit was filed in the Hennepin County District Court.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the lawsuit, Discover makes deceptive telemarketing calls 
      to consumers offering them its several optional products, including an 
      identity-theft protection, a credit-score tracker and a payment 
      protection plan, which would free customers from making further monthly 
      credit-card payments in case of job loss or disability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, Discover initially informs consumers about its cash-back 
      rewards program, but then they use misleading and confusing terms, read 
      scripts quickly, and also omit disclosures related to the product, 
      leaving consumers confused and misguided.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The lawsuit urges the court to order Discover to stop such fraud 
      telemarketing practices and reimburse customers who bought services they 
      don't want. However, the amount of civil penalties is not yet specified.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Discover has declined the allegations and stated that it believes in 
      selling a product that enhances its relationship with the card members. 
      Moreover, Discover has members who benefit from its protection products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Discover and other credit-card companies like Visa, Inc. 
      (NYSE: V) and Mastercard 
      Incorporated (NYSE: MA) 
      have been making profits by selling such credit-related products to 
      customers. In 2009, such products generated profits of $295 million for 
      Discover, an 18% increase over the previous year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe that credit-card companies have been selling such products 
      through telemarketing for years. But recently with the imposition of the 
      CARD Act regulation, Discover and other companies are under even more 
      pressure to generate revenue from such services, as the new law 
      restricts certain practices that helped generate substantial profits in 
      the past.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, fundamentally Discover is poised to grow significantly with its 
      well-diversified business model and a more favorable operating 
      environment. Moreover, the company&#8217;s extensive network, sound capital 
      position and cost containment initiatives will help accentuate growth 
      once the markets rebound to its historical highs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Going forward, we expect healthy growth opportunities with limited 
      downside for the stock, which also justifies the recent upgrade in the 
      recommendation to Outperform from Neutral. Hence, we are maintaining a 
      Zacks #2 Rank, which translates to a short-term Buy recommendation. Our 
      long-term recommendation for the stock is upgraded to Outperform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Macy&#8217;s Sales Up, Lifts Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Macy&#8217;s Inc. (MYSE: M) 
      recently posted better-than-expected sales results for the four-week 
      period ended November 27, 2010, driven by robust online and Black Friday 
      sales. Consequently, the company has lifted its outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Macy&#8217;s comparable-store sales for November 2010 rose 6.1%, following an 
      increase of 2.5% registered in October 2010 and reflecting a sharp 
      improvement from a decline of 6.1% witnessed in November 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cincinnati, Ohio-based Macy&#8217;s pointed out that year-to-date 
      comparable-store sales grew by 4.9%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Macy&#8217;s said that total sales for November jumped 7.8% to $2,344 million 
      from $2,174 million in the same month last year. Year-to-date, sales 
      were up 7.1% to $19,078 million from $17,814 million in the comparable 
      year-ago period.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Online sales, which include macys.com and bloomingdales.com, continued 
      their growth momentum in November and soared 31.8% for the month under 
      review, and were up 28.9% year-to-date. Macy&#8217;s is seeking to expand both 
      the Macy's and Bloomingdale's brands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Buoyed by November results, Macy&#8217;s lifted its sales and earnings 
      guidance. The company now expects comparable-store sales for 
      fourth-quarter 2010 between 3.5% and 4.5%, up from 3% to 4% previously 
      anticipated. Management hinted at fourth-quarter earnings in the range 
      of $1.44 to $1.49 per share compared with $1.42 to $1.47 forecasted 
      earlier, which would translate into fiscal 2010 earnings between $1.96 
      and $2.01.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The current Zacks Consensus Estimates for the fourth quarter and fiscal 
      2010 are $1.50 and $2.00, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Macy&#8217;s department stores sell a wide range of merchandise. Macy&#8217;s 
      products include men&#8217;s, women&#8217;s, and children&#8217;s apparel and accessories, 
      cosmetics, home furnishings and other consumer goods.

&lt;p&gt;  PHILADELPHIA, PA, Dec 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
MetaVis Technologies, Inc., a leader in SharePoint migration and metadata
management, today announced that MetaVis Migrator now allows customers to
migrate and classify content from Exchange Public Folders and Outlook
folders to SharePoint or Office 365. MetaVis Migrator customers will have
the option of selecting this new module and eliminating the need for
multiple migration tools. In addition, MetaVis has included the Exchange
Public Folders and Outlook option for MetaVis Classifier, allowing
customers to easily tag and organize Exchange and Outlook folder content
in SharePoint. 

    With the new Exchange Public Folders and Outlook module, MetaVis Migrator

Outlook folders into SharePoint while maintaining the existing Exchange
Public Folder structure or reclassify content. By supporting Outlook,
MetaVis users can copy and share emails, calendar entries or entire
calendars, tasks or contacts to help foster additional collaboration
within SharePoint.

    "MetaVis is unique in that it supports both Microsoft Exchange Public
Folders and Outlook folders and items," said Steven Pogrebivsky, CEO and
Co-founder of MetaVis Technologies. "As more companies migrate to
SharePoint 2010 and Office 365 they are demanding migration products that
include support for previous versions of SharePoint as well as file
systems, public folders and email support. We now offer customers the
option to include this extended support in one seamless SharePoint
migration product. This adds more value and makes migrating easier to
manage while speeding up the process."

    With the Microsoft Exchange Public Folders and Outlook module, MetaVis
Migrator customers will be able to:


--  Easily use the drag and drop feature for Exchange Public Folders or
    Microsoft Outlook to migrate content into SharePoint 2007, 2010, BPOS
    and Office 365;
--  Copy individual items such as files, messages, tasks, events, and
    contacts as well as folders creating corresponding lists or libraries
    in SharePoint;
--  Classify content from your email and Public Folder as you migrate to
    SharePoint;
--  Copy and move Outlook email to SharePoint sites for collaboration or
    e-Discovery; and
--  Perform Bulk SharePoint Migrations and copy entire Public Folders with
    data types and views.

    

The Exchange Public Folders or Outlook module is currently available
as an add-on to the MetaVis Suite, Migrator or Classifier products.

&lt;p&gt;  PHILADELPHIA, PA, Dec 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
MetaVis Technologies, Inc., today announced that its SharePoint
migration, metadata management and classification products support
Microsoft Office 365 migration. MetaVis customers will be able to easily
migrate Microsoft Exchange Public Folders, Microsoft Outlook, file
systems and SharePoint to cloud-based SharePoint environments. Users can
download a free trial of MetaVis products with Office 365 support at
http://www.metavistech.com/try.

    "Office 365 allows companies of all sizes to leverage the combined power
of productivity tools such as SharePoint, Exchange and Office with the
benefits of cloud computing," said Peter Senescu, president and
Co-founder of MetaVis Technologies. "By extending our support of Office
365, we are providing SharePoint users with the migration, design and
management tools they need for either on-premise or online SharePoint
environments." 

    With the MetaVis Suite customers will be able to design a SharePoint
information architecture for Office 356 that leverages metadata
management and taxonomy structures to keep content organized and
searchable. Users can move content in bulk from multiple Microsoft
products -- SharePoint, Exchange, and Outlook -- to Office 365 without
installing services or agents.

    For companies looking to migrate to Office 365, Microsoft is encouraging
the use of SharePoint with its rich environment over Exchange Public
Folders. As a result, companies need to ensure that migration tools
include support for file systems, Exchange, Outlook and earlier versions
of SharePoint. MetaVis supports the migration and classification of
content from various Microsoft technologies making it easy to move
content to Office 365 (See today's press release on migrating Microsoft
Exchange Public Folders and Outlook).

classification and migration software to organize your SharePoint 2010
content. Download a free trial of MetaVis Architect Suite for Office 365

      Donate $3 Million to Help Fight Citrus Disease
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Companies Provide Funding to Assist in the Development of an 
      Environmentally Sustainable Response to Citrus Huanglongbing (HLB)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company and Cutrale Citrus Juices of Brazil announced 
      today at Florida Citrus Mutual&#8217;s monthly board meeting here a donation 
      of $3 million to the University of Florida Foundation in support of 
      long-term research projects, specifically those aimed at preventing a 
      widespread disease that affects citrus crops.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The $1.5 million contribution by each company will be used to fund 
      sustainable research programs managed by The Citrus Research and 
      Development Foundation Inc. (CRDF), a direct support organization of the 
      University of Florida aimed at eliminating the threat of Citrus 
      Huanglongbing (HLB), a disease commonly known as &#8220;greening.&#8221; HLB is one 
      of the most destructive diseases of citrus crops, debilitating the 
      productive capacity of citrus trees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Research to find a sustainable and environmentally conscious way to 
      fight this disease is the best way we can support the entire value chain 
      for the citrus industry,&#8221; said Guy Wollaert, General Manager, Global 
      Juice Center, The Coca-Cola Company. &#8220;Coca-Cola is committed to working 
      with our partners in the citrus industry to help eradicate HLB. 
      Solutions will benefit citrus growers worldwide and ensure that 
      consumers continue to have access to the high quality citrus fruit and 
      juice.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Citrus Research and Development Foundation has collaborated with the 
      National Academy of Sciences since 2009 to advance disease research and 
      innovation to ensure the survival and competitiveness of Florida&#8217;s 
      citrus growers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Among the many diseases that have invaded or could invade Florida, 
      Brazil and other citrus regions globally, greening represents the 
      greatest threat to the industry,&#8221; said Tom Jerkins, President of The 
      Citrus Research and Development Foundation Inc. &#8220;The generous financial 
      contribution made by Coca-Cola and Cutrale allows the CRDF to continue 
      our pursuit to fight and eliminate HLB.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The worldwide citrus industry today faces one of its greatest 
      challenges to control and prevent the rapid spread of citrus greening 
      (HLB),&#8221; added Hugh Thompson, President of Cutrale Citrus Juices, USA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our donation reflects Cutrale&#8217;s continued support of the orange growers 
      around the world and of sustainable research programs that will deliver 
      long-term solutions for the control and prevention of HLB. Long-term 
      solutions for HLB must make the grower more efficient, improve yields 
      and give the grower confidence that they can profitably reinvest in the 
      growing of oranges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Cutrale has confidence that the Citrus Research and Development 
      Foundation&#8217;s long-term strategy to attack this disease will result in 
      long-term solutions. Cutrale is a significant donor to Fundecitrus in 
      support of worldwide HLB research.&#8221;

      Refreshing a tradition of engaging holiday campaigns, Coca-Cola 
      introduced a new, global holiday television commercial which will air in 
      more than 90 countries around the world. The commercial, entitled &#8220;Snow

      well as a new song, &#8220;Shake Up Christmas,&#8221; written and performed by 
      Grammy Award-winning band Train. The spot features vignettes which show 
      people who are separated from friends and family at the holidays. As the 
      ad progresses, it&#8217;s revealed that the people are characters inside a 
      snow globe which sits on Santa&#8217;s desk. While taking a break to enjoy a 
      Coca-Cola, Santa gently tilts the snow globe, creating a chain of events 
      which reunites the lonely individuals with loved ones.

      Coca-Cola Zero&#8482; also showcase festive holiday images of snowflakes or

			The Iconic Coca-Cola Santa
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 1931, Haddon Sundblom was commissioned by Coca-Cola to illustrate the 
      image of Santa Claus for a magazine advertising campaign. His 
      distinctive interpretation of St. Nick depicted a merry gentleman with 
      rosy cheeks, a fluffy white beard and a red outfit with a large black 
      belt. Since that time, the Coca-Cola Santa has become one of the most 
      universal images of the jolly old elf, making Coca-Cola&#8217;s connection to 
      Christmas recognizable around the world.

			Walt Howard Joins Ze-gen As Chief Executive Officer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ze-gen, Inc., a leading developer and integrator of advanced 
      gasification technology to convert waste streams into synthesis gas, 
      welcomes Walter Howard as Chief Executive Officer, replacing Bill Davis 
      who founded Ze-gen in 2004. An industry veteran, with more than 30 years 
      of global power project development experience, Mr. Howard has held CEO, 
      COO, CFO, and SVP executive positions with utility leaders including 
      General Electric, American Water, US Generating (an affiliate of PGE 
      and Bechtel), Noble Power Assets, J.Makowski Co. Inc (partly owned by 
      Duke Power), and Poseidon resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bill Davis, who will remain on Ze-gen&#8217;s Board of Directors and stay 
      actively involved as an advisor to Ze-gen focused on special projects, 
      stated, &#8220;I am pleased to welcome Walt to Ze-gen. He brings extensive 
      experience in business development, project finance, and operations 
      within the electrical and water utility industries, and he will be 
      instrumental to Ze-gen&#8217;s ability to change the way the world views waste 
      and its role in our energy future.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am excited to join the Ze-gen team,&#8221; said Walt Howard. &#8220;Ze-gen&#8217;s 
      advanced gasification technology offers an environmentally sustainable 
      solution to both solid waste management and renewable energy generation. 
      I look forward to leading Ze-gen as we enter the next round of growth 
      with the commercialization of our technology in the coming year.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Walt&#8217;s leadership and expertise in developing new market opportunities 
      enabled by technology innovation will be a valuable asset for Ze-gen&#8217;s 
      strategic growth,&#8221; said Jim Matheson, General Partner of Flagship 
      Ventures and Chairman of the Board at Ze-gen. &#8220;The Board and I look 
      forward to working with Walt to accelerate the commercialization of 
      Ze-gen&#8217;s gasification technology here in the US as well as the numerous 
      international markets where there is a significant need for renewable 
      power coupled with a new model of solid waste remediation.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Most recently, Mr. Howard served as CEO and Director of Noble 
      Environmental Power, where he led Noble to develop and put into 
      operation 484 wind turbines in New York and Texas. His projects have won 
      &#8220;deal of the year&#8221; awards in finance and engineering categories in New 
      York, Florida, Massachusetts, and Algeria. Furthermore, Mr. Howard has 
      served on the Trade Advisory Committees for US Secretaries of Commerce 
      Daley and Mineta.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Howard holds BSCE and M. Eng. degrees from Cornell University and an 
      MBA from Harvard Business School. He is a Licensed Professional Engineer 
      in the State of New York.

			About Ze-gen, Inc.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ze-gen, Inc. is a renewable energy company that is emerging as a leader 
      in the development of advanced gasification technology for converting 
      solid waste streams into a synthesis gas (syngas) mixture of carbon 
      monoxide and hydrogen gas. Syngas is a platform fuel that can then be 
      used in a variety of high-value end-use applications, including: steam 
      production, electricity, industrial hydrogen gas, to form the building 
      blocks for synthetic diesel or ethanol, synthetic natural gas, methanol, 
      or as a chemical feedstock into a variety of industrial processes. By 
      thoughtfully and efficiently disposing of these waste streams, Ze-gen 
      reduces two problems simultaneously: the landfilling of energy-rich 
      waste materials, and continued reliance on fossil fuels for energy 
      needs. For more information visit www.ze-gen.com.

			nFinanSe Launches $3 Visa&#174; and $3 Discover&#174; Reloadable Prepaid Debit 
      Cards at Kwik Trip
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      nFinanSe (OTCBB:NFSE) (www.nFinanSe.com) 
      today announced the launch of its $3 Visa&#174; and $3 Discover&#174; Reloadable 
      Prepaid Debit Cards at Kwik Trip Convenience Stores throughout the 
      Midwest.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As the soft economy continues, millions of hard-working Americans are 
      rapidly embracing Reloadable Prepaid Cards as their new and affordable 
      Financial Payment tool,&#8221; said Jerry R. Welch, Chairman and Chief 
      Executive Officer of nFinanSe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to Mr. Welch, &#8220;Until the last 18 months, the consumer fees 
      associated with Reloadable Prepaid Cards were too high to encourage 
      significant trial and usage among the 100 million unbanked, underbanked 
      and credit challenged Americans in need of an alternative Financial 
      Payment tool. With the new, consumer-friendly pricing model being 
      implemented in the retail marketplace by nFinanSe, customer-centric 
      retailers, like Kwik Trip, will now be able to encourage their customers 
      to sample and experience the terrific benefits of Reloadable Prepaid 
      Cards.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This past September, the Consumers Union, the non-profit publisher of 
      Consumer Reports, singled out the nFinanSe card for its low fees in its 
      2010 report on the industry. Of the 19 prepaid card issuers mentioned in 
      the study, nFinanSe and Walmart were noted for both having a $3 price 
      for cards, the lowest available. The report also singled out nFinanSe 
      for the lowest monthly maintenance fee of $2.95 and lowest ATM 
      withdrawal fee of $0.99.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The very first Kwik Trip store opened its doors in 1965. Today, they 
      have thousands of co-workers serving customers in over 400 Kwik Trip, 
      Kwik Star, Hearty Platter&#174; and Tobacco Outlet Plus stores throughout 
      Wisconsin, Minnesota and Iowa. In addition to its corporate Support 
      Center, which handles the administrative needs of their stores and 
      co-workers, Kwik Trip Inc. has its own Bakery, Commissary, Dairy, 
      Distribution Warehouse and Transportation divisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The nFinanSe Reloadable Prepaid Visa&#174; and Discover&#174; Cards feature what 
      the Company believes to be the best overall pricing in the marketplace 
      at this time. The cards sell for just $3 at retail stores; have a low 
      $2.95 monthly maintenance fee for an unlimited number of purchase 
      transactions; and allow cardholders to load additional funds or &#8220;top up&#8221; 
      for only $2.95. nFinanSe also offers FREE direct deposit of 
      payroll, FREE 24/7/365 live agent customer service in English and 
      Spanish and FREE cell phone text message alerts with purchase and 
      balance information* after each transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      * nFinanSe does not charge additional fees for text message alerts 
      regarding purchase and balance information. However, please be aware of 
      any charges that may apply from your cell phone provider.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Semtech and IBM Join Forces to Develop High-Performance Integrated 
      ADC/DSP Platform Using 3D TSV Technology
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Semtech Corp. (Nasdaq: SMTC), a 
      leading supplier of analog and mixed-signal semiconductors, today 
      announced it is working with IBM Corp. and its innovative 3D 
      through-silicon via (TSV) technology to develop a high-performance 
      ADC/DSP platform that has applications in fiber optic 
      telecommunications, high performance RF sampling and filtering, test 
      equipment and instrumentation, and sub-array processing for phased array 
      radar systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Integration of high-performance data converters with advanced digital 
      signal processing has traditionally been a difficult problem due to 
      mixed IC technology requirements, management of chip-to-chip 
      interconnect with high density, high power and high bandwidth and 
      limited options for high-reliability multi-chip packaging with excellent 
      thermal management. Numerous emerging applications may be significantly 
      cost-reduced, and other new applications enabled, if ultra high 
      performance data converters and/or RF transceivers constructed in the 
      most advanced RF-optimized technologies can be efficiently married into 
      a single package, along with highly-integrated application-specific 
      digital processing constructed in the latest ultra-fine geometry CMOS 
      technologies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our strategic partnership with IBM is enabling Semtech and our 
      leading-edge customers to define and develop a unique and versatile 
      integrated ADC/DSP platform, applicable to multiple highly demanding 
      system applications,&#8221; said David Clark, Vice President of Microwave  
      Millimeter-wave Products at Semtech Corporation. &#8220;Further, this 
      first-generation 3D multi-chip module will validate key building blocks 
      that will enable the accelerated time-to-market of future products with 
      unique DSP content for specialized applications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Semtech is partnering with IBM to develop the end-to-end module solution 
      utilizing IBM&#8217;s 3D interposer technology to interconnect ADC functions 
      in IBM custom logic SOI-based Cu-45HP technology with interleaver ICs in 
      IBM&#8217;s 8HP BiCMOS SiGe technology. These two different technologies are 
      connected through a single wiring layer on an interposer, which supports 
      a bandwidth of greater than 1.3 Tbps in this design.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM&#8217;s 3D technology combines cost effective 90nm BEOL wiring levels for 
      high speed signaling between die as well as providing ultra high 
      capacitance density by integrating deep-trench (DT) capacitors at the 
      top surface of the interposer. As frequency increases, the use of 
      integrated decoupling capacitors is more attractive to counteract power 
      supply noise effects that typically may be second order issues for 
      slower applications. The interposer also connects to a package using 
      copper TSV technology. Figure 1 shows a cross section of the 3D chip 
      with actual SEM cross sections of the interposer chip and DT capacitors.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delighted to be working with Semtech to utilize IBM&#8217;s 300mm 3D 
      technology for its advanced product applications,&#8221; said Dan Berger, IBM 
      Manager of 3D Technology Development at its Semiconductor Research and 
      Development Center (SRDC). &#8220;3D technology provides a path to integrate 
      CMOS and SiGe technology at very high bandwidth and with low power to 
      provide a seamless high-performance module solution. IBM&#8217;s 
      semiconductor, wafer finishing and assembly facilities offer a one-stop 
      module solution for Semtech and its product partners. We also see 
      significant benefits using 3D technology for other applications to 
      address issues such as I/O power, power supply, interconnection 
      bandwidth between components, modularity for re-use of IP or mixing 
      technology nodes effectively, and form factor improvements that can be 
      obtained by integrating components together in a smart cost effective 
      manner.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Clark added: &#8220;Once developed, the 3D TSV packaging platform can easily 
      support future product upgrades by replacing any of the utilized IC 
      technologies, either individually or in combination, to enhance the 
      product performance as the next generation base technologies come 
      on-line. For instance, future product versions could upgrade the 8HP ICs 
      to 9HP, the custom logic Cu-45HP to 32-SOI, active circuitry could be 
      incorporated into the interposer, etc. The modularity of the 3D TSV 
      platform provides the utmost flexibility for product roadmap longevity.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Availability
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Semtech will have first ADC/DSP prototype modules available in 2011 and 
      are working with partners to extend these product offerings utilizing 
      these technology elements. Near-term applications include 100Gbps 
      coherent receiver for fiber optic telecommunications, high performance 
      RF sampling and filtering, test equipment and instrumentation, and 
      sub-array processing for phased array radar systems. Semtech offers 
      comprehensive design assistance, including field- and factory-based 
      support. Data sheets, volume pricing, and delivery quotes, as well as

&lt;p&gt; * Visa Europe to cut debit fees to 0.2 pct for 9 countries

 * Reductions legally binding for 4 years

 
 (Adds Visa Europe comments, detail, background)

 By Foo Yun Chee 

 BRUSSELS, Dec 8 (Reuters) - EU regulators have dropped
antitrust charges against Visa after accepting the company's
pledge to cut its debit card fees to one lower rate for domestic
and cross-border transactions across nine EU countries.

 Visa will apply a 0.2 percent fee to all cross-border
transactions and domestic purchases in Greece, Hungary, Iceland,
Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Malta, and Sweden,
which will be legally binding for four years.

 The European Commission, which charged the credit and debit
card network in 2009 with blocking competition between banks
with its debit fees, tested Visa's proposal to cut its fees to a
standard rate in May.

 The European Union executive said Visa's new rate would mean
a reduction of between 30 and 60 percent in its current fees.

 The so-called interchange fees, which merchants pay to banks
and processing networks like Visa and MasterCard Inc (MA.N)
every time a customer uses a credit or debit card, are a major
revenue earner for the companies.

 Visa Europe, the European licensee of Visa Inc (V.N), gets
more than 70 percent of its payment transactions through debit
cards.

 "Lower inter-bank fees will trigger real benefits for
merchants and consumers whilst more transparent rules will also
improve competition in the cards markets," EU Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.

 The Commission said it would now close its case on the
issue.

 Visa Europe said the changes would make it easier for
European consumers to pay for their purchases abroad.

 "The agreed commitments on immediate debit interchange fees
and methodology are an important step towards the achievement of
the Single Euro Payment Area (SEPA)," Visa Europe Chief
Executive Peter Ayliffe said in a statement.

 Visa Europe is still facing EU regulatory scrutiny over its
charges for consumer credit and deferred debit card
transactions.

 MasterCard cut its transaction fees for its debit and credit
cards last April in return for the Commission scrapping its
investigation, but has gone to court to get a legal ruling on
the issue.

 Visa and MasterCard settled a U.S. Justice Department
antitrust lawsuit over their processing rules in October.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS Dec 8 (Reuters) - EU regulators accepted on
Wednesday Visa Europe's pledge to cut its debit card fees,
dropping antitrust charges that could have brought a fine to the
payments network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The European Commission's decision follows a market test on
Visa Europe's proposals in May, which came after the Commission
charged the credit and debit card network in 2009 for blocking
competition between banks with its debit fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 0.2 percent fee will be legally binding for four years
and ill apply for cross-border transactions and for domestic
purchases in nine EU countries, including Ireland, Italy, Sweden
and the Netherlands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Union executive said the fee cuts would range
from 30-60 percent. Visa Europe, the European licensee of Visa
Inc (V.N), gets more than 70 percent of its payment transactions
through debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Lower inter-bank fees will trigger real benefits for
merchants and consumers whilst more transparent rules will also
improve competition in the cards markets," EU Competition
Commissioner Joaquin Almunia said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission said it would now close its investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Foo Yun Chee, editing by Rex Merrifield)

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer hired investigators to find evidence of corruption against the Nigerian attorney general to convince him to drop legal action against the company over a drug trial involving children, the Guardian newspaper reported, citing U.S. diplomatic cables made public by WikiLeaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria's Kano state sued the world's largest drugmaker in May 2007 for $2 billion in damages over testing of the meningitis drug Trovan, which state authorities said killed 11 children and left dozens disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Kano's state government signed a $75 million settlement on July 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was not able to verify the content of the leaked cables, and Pfizer officials were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian reported on its website on Thursday that a memo leaked by WikiLeaks referenced a meeting between Pfizer's country manager Enrico Liggeri and U.S. officials suggesting that the drug company did not want to pay to settle two cases brought by Nigeria's federal government. The Guardian linked to the cables on its website, www.guardian.co.uk/.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"According to Liggeri, Pfizer had hired investigators to uncover corruption links to federal attorney general Michael Aondoakaa to expose him and put pressure on him to drop the federal cases," according to an April 2009 cable from Economic Counselor Robert Tansey of the U.S. embassy in Abuja, cited in the Guardian report. "He said Pfizer's investigators were passing this information to local media."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aondoakaa was removed from the position of justice minister in February this year by Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A series of damaging articles detailing Aondoakaa's 'alleged' corruption ties were published in February and March," the cable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Liggeri contended that Pfizer had much more damaging information on Aondoakaa and that Aondoakaa's cronies were pressuring him to drop the suit for fear of further negative articles," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Trovan for use by adults only.

&lt;p&gt; (Refiles to remove extraneous word in headline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 9 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N)
hired investigators to find evidence of corruption against the
Nigerian attorney general to convince him to drop legal action
against the company over a drug trial involving children, the
Guardian newspaper reported, citing U.S. diplomatic cables made
public by WikiLeaks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria's Kano state sued the world's largest drugmaker in
May 2007 for $2 billion in damages over testing of the
meningitis drug Trovan, which state authorities said killed 11
children and left dozens disabled. [ID:nN29144086]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer and Kano's state government signed a $75 million
settlement on July 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters was not able to verify the content of the leaked
cables, and Pfizer officials were not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Guardian reported on its website on Thursday that a
memo leaked by WikiLeaks referenced a meeting between Pfizer's
country manager Enrico Liggeri and U.S. officials suggesting
that the drug company did not want to pay to settle two cases
brought by Nigeria's federal government. The Guardian linked to
the cables on its website, www.guardian.co.uk/.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "According to Liggeri, Pfizer had hired investigators to
uncover corruption links to federal attorney general Michael
Aondoakaa to expose him and put pressure on him to drop the
federal cases," according to an April 2009 cable from Economic
Counselor Robert Tansey of the U.S. embassy in Abuja, cited in
the Guardian report. "He said Pfizer's investigators were
passing this information to local media."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aondoakaa was removed from the position of justice minister
in February this year by Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A series of damaging articles detailing Aondoakaa's
'alleged' corruption ties were published in February and
March," the cable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Liggeri contended that Pfizer had much more damaging
information on Aondoakaa and that Aondoakaa's cronies were
pressuring him to drop the suit for fear of further negative
articles," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved
Trovan for use by adults only. After reports of liver failure,
its use in the United States was restricted to adult emergency
care. The European Union banned its use in 1999.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) is hiring 100 corporate bankers outside the United States, in a bet that loan demand in the rest of the world will grow faster than in the bank's home base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank is planning to add to the 200 international bankers it already has over the next two years, with the aim of selling more JPMorgan products to the biggest 3,000 companies worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a pretty aggressive plan to expand in 2011," Greg Guyett, chief executive of the global corporate bank, told Reuters in a recent interview in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guyett was named late last year to head the global corporate bank, which is a joint venture between JPMorgan's investment bank and its treasury and securities services unit, which processes payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're trying to do more things with the same clients -- that's job No. 1," Guyett said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While JPMorgan has always had a global investment banking business, historically it has not been a big lender outside of the United States, unlike other large commercial banks such as Citigroup and HSBC (HSBA.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now it is ramping up that business, and also hoping to sell clients products like trade finance and basic deposit accounts around the globe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Selling more products to customers, an idea known as "cross-selling" in the industry, has become a popular buzzword for U.S. banks seeking to show they can increase revenue even as expectations for U.S. economic growth remain low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is not alone is looking to developing markets to bolster revenues -- Citigroup (C.N) has also said it is focused on expanding its already substantial business outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Latin America will be one area the global corporate bank focuses on in 2011, Guyett said, noting that other areas where JPMorgan is expanding include India, China and Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To support the global corporate bank, the treasury and securities services business rolled out new branches in countries such as Saudi Arabia this year, and it opened a slew of branches in the Nordic countries two years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These are areas where our clients are growing and where our clients want us to grow," said Claudia Slacik, chief executive of treasury and securities services in Europe, Middle East and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's large investment bank is then able to offer a wide range of products to clients in these countries, via the network of corporate bankers, explained Daniel Pinto, co-chair of the investment bank in Europe, the Middle East and Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TURNING AROUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since JPMorgan acquired Bear Stearns Cos in March 2008 and Seattle thrift Washington Mutual later that year, its U.S. business has dwarfed its overseas revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan only posts revenue by region for its investment bank. For the first nine months of the year, its investment banking revenue for the Asia Pacific region has grown 6 percent from a year earlier; but revenue has fallen 29 percent for Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and is down 8 percent for the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its treasury and securities services business posted revenue of $5.5 billion for the first nine months of the year, down about 1 percent from the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan executives, however, are optimistic the bank is starting to turn around its fortunes outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have had a lot of success, we are growing the international part of our revenues," Guyett said. "It's hard to see when you look at the whole JPMorgan picture because of the scale and size of the company ... but quarter over quarter we see more coming from international and emerging markets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pay package pales compared with predecessor McKinnell&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Includes severance payment of $4.51 mln, $3.25 mln bonus
 (Adds background on Pfizer hardships, Wyeth deal)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Jeffrey Kindler, who on Sunday
unexpectedly quit as chief executive of Pfizer Inc (PFE.N),
will receive a compensation package of about $9.6 million and
rights to almost 378,000 shares of the drugmaker's stock he was
previously granted, the company said in a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The package pales in comparison to the approximately $200
million that Kindler's predecessor Hank McKinnell received.
McKinnell was with the company for 35 years, compared with
eight for Kindler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler, 55, said he was relinquishing the post to recharge
his batteries after heavy demands of running the New York-based
drugmaker for 4-1/2 years. He joined Pfizer in 2002 and served
as its general counsel before being promoted to CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company late on Thursday said Kindler would receive a
lump severance payment of $4.51 million, a cash bonus for 2010
of $3.25 million and a $1.8 million short-term incentive award
for 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, Pfizer said he would keep 377,586 previously
granted restrictive stock units, a form of compensation
typically valued in terms of company stock but not issued at
the time of the grant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At Thursday's closing share price of $16.76, the stock
would be worth about $6.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares had fallen roughly 27 percent since Kindler
took the helm in July 2006. That compared with a 10 percent
decline for the NYSE Arca Pharmaceutical Index .DRG  of large
U.S. and European drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler was immediately replaced by 32-year Pfizer veteran
Ian Read, who had been running Pfizer's core biopharmaceuticals
operations since 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler's job became vastly more difficult just months
after he became CEO, when the company's experimental drug to
raise "good" cholesterol -- called torcetrapib -- failed in
clinical trials and was scrapped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company was counting on it to become a huge seller and
offset sales that will be lost when its $11-billion-a-year
cholesterol fighter Lipitor faces U.S. generic competition late
next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler's signature move as CEO was to spearhead the $67
billion acquisition of rival Wyeth. The move was meant to bring
it drugs and revenue to cushion the coming blow from Lipitor
generics, but Pfizer shares have fallen since the acquisition
closed on Oct. 15, 2009.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, will increase spending by a fifth to $26 billion in 2011, with 85 percent going to exploration and production as the industry seeks out new sources of growth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The expanded budget, announced on Thursday, is a big step for Chevron as it enters a period of weak net production growth while it ramps up in natural gas. Massive rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) budgeted 2010 spending of $30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Spending by oil companies is expected to rise across the board now that global crude oil demand has recovered and seems likely to grow to meet the needs of huge emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone's looking at oil, and it's going to go up -- you got China and India. My guess is these guys are going to be doing a lot of drilling," said Mark Coffelt, chief investment officer at Empiric Advisors in Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm not surprised that capital budgets are going up, and maybe the surprise is that they're not going up even more." said Coffelt, who does not currently hold Chevron shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron offers a glimpse of the challenges oil majors face in bringing on new production as existing fields decline. Its annual output growth is expected to be 1 percent through 2014, followed by 4 percent to 5 percent in the three years after that as new liquefied natural gas projects come on line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are moving into a period of higher capital spending as we fund new legacy projects, including sizable investment in our LNG mega projects," George Kirkland, Chevron vice chairman and head of global upstream and gas, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These include the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects off Western Australia and LNG processing facilities to serve them. Those alone will eat up well over $50 billion in the next half decade or so, though half the cost of Gorgon will be shared with partners Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SPENDING UP DOWN UNDER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gorgon, set to cost about $37 billion, is due to start up in 2014, followed by Wheatstone two years later. Their combined peak production, equivalent to 710,000 barrels per day, compares with Chevron's latest worldwide oil and gas output of 2.74 million barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With those two in the mix and new crude oil harder to come by, Chevron has estimated natural gas will make up 41 percent of its output by 2017, compared with 31 percent now. And that estimate came before it agreed to buy U.S. natural gas producer Atlas Energy ATLS.O in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's total 2010 budget of $21.6 billion will be eclipsed by its 2011 exploration and production spending, estimated at $22.6 billion, up 31 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That includes capital spending for Atlas, though the acquisition itself is not included in the budget, a Chevron spokesman said. Exxon's $30 billion-plus 2010 budget includes spending for its own big natural gas acquisition, XTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's refining budget is $2.9 billion, down from $3.4 billion budgeted this year. A slump in the sector led the company to slash downstream costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Included in the 2011 budget is spending on refineries in Mississippi and California aimed at improving returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of San Ramon, California-based Chevron were up 30 cents to $86.44 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Driver in Houston and Braden Reddall in San Francisco; editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - High-tech thief or bogus prosecution? Those were the opposing closing arguments offered on Thursday in the case of a computer programer accused of stealing high-speed trading code from Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, 40, was charged with stealing critical parts of code as he left Wall Street's most influential bank in June 2009 before joining Teza Technologies LLC, a high speed-trading start-up firm in Chicago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial in U.S. District Court in New York over the past two weeks was punctuated by programing terms such as "bash history" and "tarball," testimony by Goldman executives and trading experts and the occasional court closure for evidence deemed sensitive to the bank's operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The evidence is in now and it is clear he chose to become a thief, a high-tech thief but a thief nonetheless," U.S. prosecutor Rebecca Rohr told the jury during a one hour-long summation of the government's case against Aleynikov.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programmer's lawyer, Kevin Marino, said in his closing argument that the government had tried to present the case as a simple one from the day of Aleynikov's July 3, 2009 arrest at Newark International Airport in New Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marino told jurors that his client didn't take the code used to trade stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He argued that the FBI investigation failed to take enough time to consider that when his client downloaded directories from Goldman Sachs he was trying to retrieve "open source code," which no firm has proprietary control over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is bogus, bogus, bogus from day one to today," Marino said. "This is a silly prosecution."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jurors began their deliberations on Thursday afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, an immigrant from Russia who became a U.S. citizen, has been free on bail since his arrest. If convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison on two criminal counts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COMPETITIVE SPEED-TRADING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During the trial, the panel was told that high-frequency trading, or high-speed automated trading, has become an increasingly important and competitive business. The closely-guarded computer codes help firms trade shares in milliseconds and earns millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marino said Aleynikov might have been "foolish" to copy Goldman's proprietary information but he argued it was not a crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many programmers have created and promoted the computer programing language known as "open source code," to be shared on public sites at no cost, but licensing issues are murky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was a longtime adherent of open source code, the court heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman spokesman, Ed Canaday, said he would not comment during the trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors told jurors that Aleynikov put the code on a storage website hosted on servers in Germany and also copied it onto a flash drive and other computers so he could take it to Teza. They said he also consolidated the files into a single file known as a "tarball."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov tried to cover his tracks by deleting what is known as his "bash history" on his last day at Goldman Sachs on June 5, 2009, prosecutors said. The term refers to the most recent set of commands executed by a particular programer or user of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v Aleynikov, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 10-96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool; Editing by Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

on Thursday in the case of a computer programmer accused of
stealing high-speed trading code from Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sergey Aleynikov, 40, was charged with stealing critical

programming language known as "open source code," to be shared
on public sites at no cost, but licensing issues are murky.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov was a longtime adherent of open source code, the
court heard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman spokesman, Ed Canaday, said he would not comment

			Disney&#8217;s Tangled Passes $100 Million in Domestic Box Office 
      Receipts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney&#8217;s 50th animated feature film, Tangled, passed 
      the $100 million mark at the domestic box office today. Tangled, 
      which began its theatrical run over the Thanksgiving holiday weekend, 
      becomes the 68th title in the history of The Walt Disney 
      Studios to reach this milestone.&#160;In addition, Tangled is the 
      only film this year to earn an A+ CinemaScore, the highest rating&#160;to be 
      given by&#160;moviegoing audiences.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With its creative storytelling and lovable characters, Tangled 
      is the sort of cinematic adventure that makes Disney films so appealing 
      to audiences of all ages,&#8221; said Rich Ross, chairman of The Walt Disney 
      Studios. &#8220;We&#8217;re so thrilled that audiences love it as much as we do, and 
      we&#8217;re looking forward to a great run through the holiday season.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Tangled got off to a tremendous start during its opening weekend 
      (Nov. 24-28), grossing $69 million to become the highest opening ever 
      for Walt Disney Animation Studios and the second biggest Thanksgiving 
      weekend opener in history behind Disney&#8226;Pixar&#8217;s own Toy Story 2.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The film has already opened in approximately 35% of the international 
      marketplace and has taken in more than $56M. In Russia, Tangled 
      had the biggest animated opening in Disney&#8217;s history and has become 
      Disney&#8217;s biggest animated film of all time in the region.

&lt;p&gt; * Halfon, emerging markets head, to retire next year&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Yang, head of Asia RD, leaves for Astra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Moves unrelated to CEO retirement -- spokesman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Two executives closely involved
in Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) push into emerging markets are leaving
the world's largest drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jean-Michel Halfon, who has been Pfizer's head of its
emerging markets business, will retire during the first
quarter. David Simmons, who has led the company's established
products business unit, will also take charge of the company's
emerging markets division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, Steve Yang, who headed up research and
development for Pfizer in Asia, will take a similar post at
AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer confirmed the departures on Thursday, only days
after the company announced the surprise retirement of Chief
Executive Officer Jeffrey Kindler. Kindler was replaced by Ian
Read, Pfizer's global head of pharmaceuticals and a longtime
company veteran.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A company spokesman said the latest departures are
unrelated to the CEO change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, like other drugmakers, is seeking growth from
emerging markets in China and other rapidly growing economies,
where pharmaceutical growth is outpacing more traditional
markets in the United States and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As head of established products, Simmons has overseen
Pfizer's more extensive push into generic drugs. Because they
provide a low-cost option, generics are seen as an important
plank to companies gaining in emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before taking up the role as established products head,
Simmons had executive responsibilities in the United Kingdom,
Greece and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Halfon, a 30-year Pfizer veteran, will work with Simmons
through the transition, spokesman Ray Kerins said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang has been appointed to the newly created position of
vice president and head of RD for Asia and emerging markets,
an AstraZeneca spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yang, who will begin his new post in January, will report
to Astra research head Martin Mackay, who himself left Pfizer
for the London-based drugmaker earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf; Editing by Bernard Orr)

&lt;p&gt; * Exploration spending at $22.6 bln, including Aussie LNG&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Refining spending seen at $2.9 bln, down from this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chevron shares slightly higher as crude oil prices rise
 (Adds fund manager, Exxon budget, background, updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Anna Driver and Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON/SAN FRANCISCO, Dec 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp
(CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company, will increase
spending by a fifth to $26 billion in 2011, with 85 percent
going to exploration and production as the industry seeks out
new sources of growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The expanded budget, announced on Thursday, is a big step
for Chevron as it enters a period of weak net production growth
while it ramps up in natural gas. Massive rival Exxon Mobil
Corp (XOM.N) budgeted 2010 spending of $30 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spending by oil companies is expected to rise across the
board now that global crude oil demand has recovered and seems
likely to grow to meet the needs of huge emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Everyone's looking at oil, and it's going to go up -- you
got China and India. My guess is these guys are going to be
doing a lot of drilling," said Mark Coffelt, chief investment
officer at Empiric Advisors in Austin, Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'm not surprised that capital budgets are going up, and
maybe the surprise is that they're not going up even more."
said Coffelt, who does not currently hold Chevron shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron offers a glimpse of the challenges oil majors face
in bringing on new production as existing fields decline. Its
annual output growth is expected to be 1 percent through 2014,
followed by 4 percent to 5 percent in the three years after
that as new liquefied natural gas projects come on line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are moving into a period of higher capital spending as
we fund new legacy projects, including sizable investment in
our LNG mega projects," George Kirkland, Chevron vice chairman
and head of global upstream and gas, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These include the Gorgon and Wheatstone projects off
Western Australia and LNG processing facilities to serve them.
Those alone will eat up well over $50 billion in the next half
decade or so, though half the cost of Gorgon will be shared
with partners Exxon and Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SPENDING UP DOWN UNDER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gorgon, set to cost about $37 billion, is due to start up
in 2014, followed by Wheatstone two years later. Their combined
peak production, equivalent to 710,000 barrels per day,
compares with Chevron's latest worldwide oil and gas output of
2.74 million barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With those two in the mix and new crude oil harder to come
by, Chevron has estimated natural gas will make up 41 percent
of its output by 2017, compared with 31 percent now. And that
estimate came before it agreed to buy U.S. natural gas producer
Atlas Energy ATLS.O in November. [ID:nN1196002]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's total 2010 budget of $21.6 billion will be
eclipsed by its 2011 exploration and production spending,
estimated at $22.6 billion, up 31 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That includes capital spending for Atlas, though the
acquisition itself is not included in the budget, a Chevron
spokesman said. Exxon's $30 billion-plus 2010 budget includes
spending for its own big natural gas acquisition, XTO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's refining budget is $2.9 billion, down from $3.4
billion budgeted this year. A slump in the sector led the
company to slash downstream costs. [ID:nN09227603]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Included in the 2011 budget is spending on refineries in
Mississippi and California aimed at improving returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of San Ramon, California-based Chevron were up 30
cents to $86.44 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock
Exchange.

increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of

			Hoover Institution Press Announces Book Highlighting a Lifetime of 
      Achievement,Up from the Projects: An AutobiographyBy 
      Walter Williams
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hoover Institution Press today released Up from the Projects: An 
      Autobiography by Walter Williams.
			In Up from the Projects, 
      Williams recalls some of the highlights, turning points, and the 
      obstacles he has encountered and overcome during his life.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In this frank and compelling autobiography, Williams describes his 
      humble beginnings, growing up in the 1940s in a lower-middle-class 
      neighborhood in West Philadelphia with a strong and demanding mother who 
      held high academic aspirations for her children. Williams remembers the 
      teachers who demanded his best efforts and made no excuses for him. He 
      also tells how his two years in the US Army became an important part of 
      his maturation process, despite the racism he encountered. He recounts 
      his time moving to and establishing himself in Los Angeles&#8212;struggling 
      happily through the first years of his marriage, getting his bachelor of 
      arts at Cal State, Los Angeles, and his graduate degree at the 
      University of California at Los Angeles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As he describes his teaching career, moving from teaching one class a 
      week at Los Angeles City College to his eventual department chairmanship 
      at George Mason University, he recounts many achievements that would 
      have been unfathomable to his ancestors. Because of his successes, 
      Williams emphasizes that the opportunity and economic mobility found in 
      America make it the most desirable place to live in the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Walter E. Williams is the John M. Olin Distinguished Professor of 
      Economics at George Mason University and a nationally syndicated 
      columnist. He is the author of several books and more than sixty 
      articles, which have appeared in scholarly journals such as Economic 
      Inquiry,
			American Economic Review, and Social Science 
      Quarterly and popular publications such as Reader&#8217;s Digest, 
      Regulation, Policy Review, and Newsweek.

			Here are highlights from Wednesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CAT Gets Bridge Loan for Bucyrus
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: CAT) 
      has entered into a bridge loan agreement of up to $8.6 billion from 
      certain financial institutions led by JPMorgan Chase Bank, the 
      investment bank arm of JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) 
      to fund its previously announced acquisition of Bucyrus International 
      Inc. (Nasdaq: BUCY).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Caterpillar, however, added it might not utilize the whole amount for 
      the acquisition and instead may issue debt and/or equity. The company 
      might use the loan to refinance Bucyrus' debt and pay related fees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the bridge loan agreement, Caterpillar would have to maintain a 
      net worth of at least $9 billion at all times in each fiscal year. Net 
      worth in this case means consolidated stockholders' equity including 
      preferred stock but excluding Pension and other post-retirement benefits 
      that are reflected in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income or loss.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the agreement, the bridge loan would have an increasing 
      interest rate starting at 1.25 percentage points to 2 percentage points 
      more than the London Interbank offered rate (LIBOR). The margin over 
      LIBOR is dependent on the company&#8217;s credit ratings. The spread over the 
      lending benchmark would increase every 90 days, within the range of 1.5 
      percentage points to 3.125 percentage points.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The $8.6 Bucyrus deal, if it gets through, would be the biggest ever in 
      the company&#8217;s history. The acquisition, subject to regulatory and 
      Bucyrus shareholder approvals, is slated to close in mid-2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Caterpillar had earlier announced that it intended to fund the 
      consideration of $8.6 billion through cash, up to $2 billion in equity 
      and included the assumption of $1.0 billion in debt. Bucyrus 
      shareholders will receive $92 per share, which translates to a premium 
      of 32% on Bucyrus' share price as of November 12, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The combined portfolio will broaden Caterpillar's mining equipment 
      product line resulting in the most expansive product offering in the 
      mining equipment industry. Caterpillar expects the deal to be accretive 
      to its profit in the first full year, i.e., 2012, excluding 50 cents per 
      share of one-time charges. Synergy benefits are expected to noticeably 
      add to operating profit in 2013 and exceed $400 million annually in 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Caterpillar has a narrow product line compared to Bucyrus. The 
      acquisition will bring Bucyrus&#8217; broad product portfolio of electric rope 
      shovels, draglines, hydraulic shovels, drills, underground mining 
      equipment, trucks and highwall miners and complement Caterpillar&#8217;s 
      existing mining product line. Further, Caterpillar can leverage Bucyrus&#8217; 
      strong presence in the emerging markets, its successful aftermarket 
      parts business and support services for its equipment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Caterpillar had a sound cash horde of $2.3 billion as of September 30, 
      2010. The debt-to-capital ratio, for Machinery and Engines, improved to 
      39.1% as of September 30, 2010 compared with 49.5% as of June 30, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Take
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Though the loan will increase Caterpillar&#8217;s debt-to-capital ratio and 
      interest burden, we believe these negatives will be offset by the 
      synergies expected form the Bucyrus acquisition. The Bucyrus acquisition 
      is expected to position Caterpillar as the leading global mining 
      original equipment manufacturer and the combined product portfolio will 
      dwarf Joy Global Inc. (Nasdaq: JOYG), 
      the only U.S. based manufacturer of surface and underground mining 
      equipment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe Caterpillar&#8217;s strong brand name, pricing power and global 
      dealer network places it in an advantageous position to exploit the 
      growing need for infrastructure development worldwide. We believe 
      Caterpillar&#8217;s expansion plans of opening new facilities and expanding 
      existing operations, particularly in emerging markets, will boost its 
      long-term potential. We currently have a Zacks #1 Rank (short-term 
      Strong Buy recommendation) on the stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Peoria, Illinois-based Caterpillar Inc. is the manufacturer of 
      construction and mining equipment, diesel and natural gas engines, and 
      industrial gas turbines. The company is one of the few leading U.S. 
      companies in an industry that competes globally from a principally 
      domestic manufacturing base. Caterpillar operates three divisions &#8211; 
      Machines, Engines and Financial Products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Forest Labs Inks Deal for Pain Drugs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Forest Labs (NYSE: FRX) 
      recently entered into an agreement with Gruenenthal GmbH for the 
      development and commercialization of two pain management candidates. The 
      license agreement covers GRT 6005, a novel oral small molecule analgesic 
      and its follow-on compound, GRT 6006.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Terms of the Deal
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Per the terms of the deal, Forest Labs will make an undisclosed upfront 
      license payment to Gruenenthal. Besides this, Forest Labs will make 
      payments on the achievement of development and commercialization 
      milestones. The company will also pay royalties on product sales. The 
      companies will share development costs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While Forest Labs will have exclusive rights in the US and Canada, the 
      company may execute the option to co-promote in Europe. Similarly, 
      Gruenenthal has exclusive rights in Europe and the option to co-promote 
      in the US and Canada.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Neutral on Forest Labs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Forest Labs, which is 
      supported by a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term &#8220;Hold&#8221; recommendation). We are 
      concerned about long-term growth at Forest Labs, especially from 2012 
      when Lexapro is exposed to generic competition. That puts a lot of 
      pressure on the pipeline to come through.

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details
regarding this unique opportunity please visit: www.microcapsdaily.com.

association of tourist bus drivers in the Province of Lazio, Italy.
A.N.C. will be acquiring the units to install on its members fleets of
diesel buses to ensure their compliance with the Province of Lazio's new
Low Emission Zone (LEZ) standards, which will be enforced starting in
2011.

			Chevron Announces $26.0 Billion Capital and Exploratory Budget for 
      2011
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Upstream spending estimated at $22.6 billion, progressing an 
        industry-leading slate of crude oil and natural gas projects
			
			
				Downstream budget of $2.9 billion includes outlays for enhancing 
        refinery reliability and flexibility
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today announced a $26.0 billion capital 
      and exploratory spending program for 2011. Included in the 2011 program 
      are $2.0 billion of expenditures by affiliates, which do not require 
      cash outlays by Chevron. Acquisition costs associated with the recently 
      announced purchase of Atlas Energy, Inc. are not included.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have an unparalleled set of opportunities. Our previous investments 
      have performed well, giving us the cash and financial strength to fund 
      numerous attractive projects in rapid succession. We&#8217;re building legacy 
      asset positions which will reward shareholders for decades to come,&#8221; 
      said Chairman and CEO John Watson. &#8220;At the same time, we are committed 
      and able to reward shareholders with competitive dividend growth and 
      share repurchases.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Approximately 85 percent of the 2011 spending program is for upstream 
      oil and gas exploration and production projects worldwide. Another 10 
      percent is associated with the company&#8217;s downstream businesses that 
      manufacture, transport and sell gasoline, diesel fuel and other refined 
      products, fuel and lubricant additives, and petrochemicals.

      Spending of $22.6 billion is planned for exploration and production 
      activities, including major natural gas-related projects. Major capital 
      investments include development of the vast natural gas resources in 
      Western Australia and development opportunities in the deepwater U.S. 
      Gulf of Mexico, Western Africa and the Gulf of Thailand. Funding is 
      planned for focused exploration and appraisal programs in core 
      hydrocarbon basins. Capital spending will also be directed towards 
      existing assets throughout the world to improve oil and gas recovery, 
      and reduce natural field decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are moving into a period of higher capital spending as we fund new 
      legacy projects, including sizeable investment in our LNG mega 
      projects,&#8221; said George Kirkland, Chevron vice chairman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Upstream spending expected in 2011 includes major projects in the 
      following regions:

			Downstream
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Capital spending of $2.9 billion in 2011 is budgeted for downstream 
      operations. Outlays in 2011 include projects at the company&#8217;s refineries 
      in Mississippi and California which are geared towards improving 
      returns. These expenditures will enhance the company&#8217;s ability to 
      manufacture transportation fuels and base oils from a variety of 
      feedstocks, while increasing product yields and energy efficiency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company&#8217;s 50 percent-owned GS Caltex affiliate is also expected to 
      continue to upgrade the Yeosu refining complex in South Korea. 
      Additional projects associated with the company&#8217;s chemicals operations 
      in Saudi Arabia and Qatar are managed through the 50 percent-owned 
      Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC.

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI Dec 9 (Reuters) - State-run explorer Oil and
Natural Gas Corp (ONGC.BO) has bid for a 25-percent stake that
the U.S. energy major Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) owns in an Angolan
offshore oil block, Junior Oil Minister Jitin Prasada said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; If successful, ONGC would get its share of equity oil from
Block-31, when it commences production in 2012, he told
lawmakers in a written reply on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prasada said the planned peak production from the block,
operated by BP (BP.L) with 26.7 percent stake, was estimated to
be 150,000 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angola's national oil company Sonangol owns 20 percent in
the block while Norway's StatoilHydro holds 13.33 percent, with
Marathon Oil Corp (MRO.N) and France's Total (TOTF.PA) owning
10 percent and 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Nidhi Verma; editing by Malini Menon)

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - A federal judge has issued a tentative ruling shutting down the Walt Disney Co.'s bid to overturn a $319 million jury verdict over profits from "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision is not final, and lawyers for Disney and British "Millionaire" producer Celador Intl. were in the Riverside, Calif., courtroom of Judge Virginia A. Phillips on Monday arguing for more than two-and-a-half hours. But Phillips issued a 43-page tentative ruling saying she will likely deny Disney's request to throw out the July verdict and order a new trial. A final judgment is expected later this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the tentative ruling is upheld, Disney will almost certainly appeal the case to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, setting up another high-profile showdown in the closely-watched 6-year old litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "Millionaire" trial made headlines this summer because it shone a rare public light on complex studio accounting procedures and dealmaking in the early days of the reality TV boom. Celador claimed Disney, ABC and their affiliated entities operated a "shell game" when they brought the show to America in 1999, hiding millions of dollars in revenue owed to Celador under a profit-sharing arrangement. The trial featured testimony from Disney CEO Robert Iger and Celador's Paul Smith, as well as former William Morris agents Greg Lipstone and Ben Silverman, who helped broker deals to bring the show to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After a month-long trial, the jury ruled July 8 that Disney failed to "perform the obligations of the rights agreement" with Celador and ordered the studio to pay $269 million in damages. Phillips later added $50 million to that figure in pre-judgment interest. The damages ordered were the largest ever in a so-called "Hollywood accounting" lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney then moved for either a judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial, claiming that there were numerous errors in the jury's decision and its damages calculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Phillips considered court papers filed on behalf of both sides before arriving at her tentative ruling, copies of which were given to lawyers on Monday. The attorneys then argued their cases, after which Phillips collected the copies of the ruling to keep them private until she issues a final ruling, likely later this week. Courtroom sources who have seen the ruling say it is a full denial of Disney's efforts to overturn the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Disney lead lawyer Marty Katz and Celador attorney Roman Silberfeld declined to comment on the case until the judge issues a final ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After the verdict in July, Disney released a statement saying, "We believe this verdict is fundamentally wrong and will aggressively seek to have it reversed."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A jury on Friday convicted a former Goldman Sachs computer programer on criminal charges of stealing secret high-frequency trading code from Wall Street's most influential bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sergey Aleynikov, 40, was indicted in February under the Economic Espionage Act on accusations he copied and removed computer code from Goldman in June 2009 before taking a new job with Teza Technologies LLC, a high-frequency trading start-up firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jurors reached their verdict after a two week-long trial in U.S. District Court in New York. They deliberated for about six hours over Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's lawyer, Kevin Marino, contended at the trial that his client may have breached Goldman's confidentiality policy but he did not harm and could not harm the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge Denise Cote re-imposed bail conditions on Aleynikov and ordered him confined to his home with electronic monitoring. Aleynikov's sentencing proceeding is scheduled for March 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The trial, which began November 29, was punctuated by programing terms such as "bash history" and "tarball," as well as testimony by Goldman executives and trading experts. Judge Cote closed the court four times for evidence deemed sensitive to the bank's operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov, an immigrant from Russia who became a U.S. citizen, has been free on bail since his arrest. The criminal charges carry a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors told jurors that Aleynikov put the code on a storage website. He encrypted the code and also copied it onto a flash drive and other computers so he could take it to Teza, prosecutors said. They said he also consolidated the files into a single file known as a "tarball."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov tried to cover his tracks by deleting what is known as his "bash history" on his last day at Goldman Sachs on June 5, 2009, prosecutors said. The term refers to the most recent set of commands executed by a particular programer or user of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Teza founder Mikhail "Misha" Malyshev testified at the trial that his firm barred employees from using proprietary code of any other company. Malyshev also testified that he would never have wanted Goldman's high-frequency trading code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov's lawyer told the jury that his client cooperated with the FBI when he was arrested at Newark Liberty International Airport in New Jersey on July 3, 2009. Aleynikov told an FBI agent that the Goldman directories he copied were loaded with "open source code," which no person or firm has proprietary control over, Marino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov was a long-time adherent of open source code, the court heard. Marino said Aleynikov violated a confidentiality agreement he had as a Goldman Sachs employee, but criminal prosecution was unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many programmers have created and promoted the computer programing language known as "open source code" to be shared on public sites at no cost, but licensing issues are murky. There are hundreds of different open source licenses and little case law exists around the licensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is USA v Aleynikov, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 10-96.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool; Editing by Tim Dobbyn and Steve Orlofsky)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/BOSTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc is voluntarily recalling its drug to treat a life-threatening lung condition and will end studies of the pill after it was linked to potentially deadly liver toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The European Medicines Agency on Friday said the modest-selling drug, used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension, was withdrawn due to "new information on two cases of fatal liver injury."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer spokesman Curtis Allen said the drug, called Thelin, which is not sold in the United States, was being recalled in Europe, Canada and Australia after being linked to a new liver problem "that occurs rarely and unpredictably in patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The decision was based on a review of emerging safety information and post-marketing reporting," said Allen, referring to reports by doctors that have prescribed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thelin and similar medicines already carry warnings of elevated liver enzymes, a marker for potential liver damage. But the new liver risk for Thelin now suggests its overall risks outweigh its potential benefit, Allen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, whose chief executive abruptly resigned on Sunday, scrapped U.S. trials of Thelin for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Such patients have elevated blood pressure in lung arteries and veins that cause shortness of breath and other symptoms, which can lead to heart failure and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 1,100 patients have taken Thelin since it was launched in Europe in 2006 and in Australia and Canada the following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer in 2008 paid $195 million for the company that developed the product, Encysive Pharmaceuticals, even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had repeatedly rejected the drug for lack of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer had been counting on the U.S. trials to ultimately prove Thelin's worth. It is the latest in a long string of setbacks for Pfizer, whose labs have not generated any big-selling drugs for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's another ding in their pipeline, though expectations for it (Thelin) had been fairly low," said Damien Conover, an analyst at Morningstar. "Had it been approved in the United States and didn't have the safety side effect, you could have seen it just breaking into blockbuster sales at peak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conover said investors are more focused on Pfizer's so-called JAK inhibitor, an oral treatment for rheumatoid arthritis, and its ALK inhibitor for a subset of patients with lung cancer. Both drugs, if successful in trials, could generate peak annual sales of more than $2 billion, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were up 1.3 percent to $16.98 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen nearly 18 percent from a 52-week high of $20.36 in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thelin garnered sales of $44 million in the first nine months of 2010, making it a small product for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It competes with Tracleer, a drug made by Actelion Ltd that had sales of $1.4 billion in 2009. Thelin also competes with Letairis, made by Gilead Sciences Inc, which produced 2009 sales of $184 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thelin, Tracleer and Letairis all block fragments of endothelin, a protein that causes blood vessels to tighten up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank analyst Richard Parkes said on Friday the new liver problem appears to be specific to Thelin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In contrast, Actelion has generated a large database of safety, showing that liver enzyme elevations with Tracleer can be safely managed," Parkes said in a research report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actelion shares rose 1.3 percent, as the recall of Thelin eliminated a rival to Tracleer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer late last year bought U.S. rival Wyeth in hopes Wyeth's drugs would bolster Pfizer's aging array of medicines, including the $11 billion-a-year cholesterol fighter Lipitor, which faces U.S. generic competition in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Pfizer CEO Jeffrey Kindler surprised Wall Street by announcing he would retire to "recharge his batteries." He handed the company's reins to Ian Read, head of Pfizer's global drug business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Toni Clarke; Editing by Steve Orlofsky.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer hired investigators to find evidence of corruption against Nigeria's attorney general to convince him to drop legal action against the company over a drug trial involving children, the Guardian newspaper reported, citing U.S. diplomatic cables made public by WikiLeaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria's Kano state sued the world's largest drugmaker in May 2007 for $2 billion over testing of the meningitis drug Trovan. State authorities said the tests killed 11 children and left dozens disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Kano's state government signed a $75 million settlement on July 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was not able to verify the content of the leaked cables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Pfizer said it "negotiated the settlement with the federal government of Nigeria in good faith and its conduct in reaching that agreement was proper."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any notion that the company hired investigators in connection to the former Attorney General is simply preposterous," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian reported on its website on Thursday that a memo leaked by WikiLeaks referenced a meeting between Pfizer's country manager, Enrico Liggeri, and U.S. officials suggesting the drug company did not want to pay to settle two cases brought by Nigeria's federal government. The Guardian linked to the cables on its website, www.guardian.co.uk/.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"According to Liggeri, Pfizer had hired investigators to uncover corruption links to federal Attorney General Michael Aondoakaa to expose him and put pressure on him to drop the federal cases," according to an April 2009 cable from Economic Counselor Robert Tansey of the U.S. Embassy in Abuja, cited in the Guardian report. "He said Pfizer's investigators were passing this information to local media."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aondoakaa was removed from the post of justice minister in February this year by Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A series of damaging articles detailing Aondoakaa's 'alleged' corruption ties were published in February and March," the cable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Liggeri contended that Pfizer had much more damaging information on Aondoakaa and that Aondoakaa's cronies were pressuring him to drop the suit for fear of further negative articles," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Trovan for use by adults only. After reports of liver failure, its use in the United States was restricted to adult emergency care. The European Union banned its use in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Jon Hemming and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pulmonary arterial hypertension drug withdrawn&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * European regulators cite two deaths from liver injury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Analyst says danger not seen with rival Actelion drug
 (Adds comment from Morningstar analyst)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ransdell Pierson and Toni Clarke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK/BOSTON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) is
voluntarily recalling its drug to treat a life-threatening lung
condition and will end studies of the pill after it was linked
to potentially deadly liver toxicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Medicines Agency on Friday said the
modest-selling drug, used to treat pulmonary arterial
hypertension, was withdrawn due to "new information on two
cases of fatal liver injury."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer spokesman Curtis Allen said the drug, called Thelin,
which is not sold in the United States, was being recalled in
Europe, Canada and Australia after being linked to a new liver
problem "that occurs rarely and unpredictably in patients."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The decision was based on a review of emerging safety
information and post-marketing reporting," said Allen,
referring to reports by doctors that have prescribed it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thelin and similar medicines already carry warnings of
elevated liver enzymes, a marker for potential liver damage.
But the new liver risk for Thelin now suggests its overall
risks outweigh its potential benefit, Allen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, the world's biggest drugmaker, whose chief
executive abruptly resigned on Sunday, scrapped U.S. trials of
Thelin for pulmonary arterial hypertension. Such patients have
elevated blood pressure in lung arteries and veins that cause
shortness of breath and other symptoms, which can lead to heart
failure and early death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 1,100 patients have taken Thelin since it was
launched in Europe in 2006 and in Australia and Canada the
following year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer in 2008 paid $195 million for the company that
developed the product, Encysive Pharmaceuticals, even though
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had repeatedly rejected
the drug for lack of efficacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer had been counting on the U.S. trials to ultimately
prove Thelin's worth. It is the latest in a long string of
setbacks for Pfizer, whose labs have not generated any
big-selling drugs for more than a decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's another ding in their pipeline, though expectations
for it (Thelin) had been fairly low," said Damien Conover, an
analyst at Morningstar. "Had it been approved in the United
States and didn't have the safety side effect, you could have
seen it just breaking into blockbuster sales at peak."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Conover said investors are more focused on Pfizer's
so-called JAK inhibitor, an oral treatment for rheumatoid
arthritis, and its ALK inhibitor for a subset of patients with
lung cancer. Both drugs, if successful in trials, could
generate peak annual sales of more than $2 billion, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares were up 1.3 percent to $16.98 in afternoon
trade on the New York Stock Exchange. The stock has fallen
nearly 18 percent from a 52-week high of $20.36 in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thelin garnered sales of $44 million in the first nine
months of 2010, making it a small product for Pfizer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It competes with Tracleer, a drug made by Actelion Ltd
(ATLN.VX) that had sales of $1.4 billion in 2009. Thelin also
competes with Letairis, made by Gilead Sciences Inc (GILD.O),
which produced 2009 sales of $184 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thelin, Tracleer and Letairis all block fragments of
endothelin, a protein that causes blood vessels to tighten up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank analyst Richard Parkes said on Friday the new
liver problem appears to be specific to Thelin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In contrast, Actelion has generated a large database of
safety, showing that liver enzyme elevations with Tracleer can
be safely managed," Parkes said in a research report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actelion shares rose 1.3 percent, as the recall of Thelin
eliminated a rival to Tracleer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer late last year bought U.S. rival Wyeth in hopes
Wyeth's drugs would bolster Pfizer's aging array of medicines,
including the $11 billion-a-year cholesterol fighter Lipitor,
which faces U.S. generic competition in November 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Sunday, Pfizer CEO Jeffrey Kindler surprised Wall Street
by announcing he would retire to "recharge his batteries." He
handed the company's reins to Ian Read, head of Pfizer's global
drug business.

&lt;p&gt; * Sergey Aleynikov convicted on two criminal counts&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Charged with stealing part of speed-trading code
 (Adds bail conditions, sentencing date, trial evidence)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Grant McCool&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - A jury on Friday convicted a
former Goldman Sachs (GS.N) computer programmer on criminal
charges of stealing secret high-frequency trading code from
Wall Street's most influential bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sergey Aleynikov, 40, was indicted in February under the
Economic Espionage Act on accusations he copied and removed
computer code from Goldman in June 2009 before taking a new job
with Teza Technologies LLC, a high-frequency trading start-up
firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jurors reached their verdict after a two week-long trial in
U.S. District Court in New York. They deliberated for about six
hours over Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov's lawyer, Kevin Marino, contended at the trial
that his client may have breached Goldman's confidentiality
policy but he did not harm and could not harm the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. District Judge Denise Cote re-imposed bail conditions
on Aleynikov and ordered him confined to his home with
electronic monitoring. Aleynikov's sentencing proceeding is
scheduled for March 18.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trial, which began Nov. 29, was punctuated by
programming terms such as "bash history" and "tarball," as well
as testimony by Goldman executives and trading experts. Judge
Cote closed the court four times for evidence deemed sensitive
to the bank's operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov, an immigrant from Russia who became a U.S.
citizen, has been free on bail since his arrest. The criminal
charges carry a maximum prison sentence of 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prosecutors told jurors that Aleynikov put the code on a
storage website. He encrypted the code and also copied it onto
a flash drive and other computers so he could take it to Teza,
prosecutors said. They said he also consolidated the files into
a single file known as a "tarball."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov tried to cover his tracks by deleting what is
known as his "bash history" on his last day at Goldman Sachs on
June 5, 2009, prosecutors said. The term refers to the most
recent set of commands executed by a particular programmer or
user of the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Teza founder Mikhail "Misha" Malyshev testified at the
trial that his firm barred employees from using proprietary
code of any other company. Malyshev also testified that he
would never have wanted Goldman's high-frequency trading code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov's lawyer told the jury that his client cooperated
with the FBI when he was arrested at Newark Liberty
International Airport in New Jersey on July 3, 2009. Aleynikov
told an FBI agent that the Goldman directories he copied were
loaded with "open source code," which no person or firm has
proprietary control over, Marino said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aleynikov was a long-time adherent of open source code, the
court heard. Marino said Aleynikov violated a confidentiality
agreement he had as a Goldman Sachs employee, but criminal
prosecution was unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many programmers have created and promoted the computer
programming language known as "open source code" to be shared
on public sites at no cost, but licensing issues are murky.
There are hundreds of different open source licenses and little
case law exists around the licensing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is USA v Aleynikov, U.S. District Court for the
Southern District of New York, No. 10-96.

			ExxonMobil Expands World's Largest Carbon Capture Plant in Wyoming
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Plant capable of capturing a volume of carbon dioxide equivalent to 
      taking more than 1.5 million cars off the road
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Increases regional supply of carbon dioxide needed to extend the 
        productivity of aging oil fields
      
			
        50 percent more carbon dioxide available for enhanced oil recovery and 
        other industrial applications
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			ExxonMobil 
      announced today the completion of an expansion to the world&#8217;s largest 
      carbon dioxide capture plant. Located near LaBarge, Wyoming, the 
      expanded plant will help reduce 
      greenhouse gas emissions and enhance 
      oil production in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This expansion will result in lower 
      greenhouse gas emissions and help maximize the recovery of Wyoming&#8217;s 
      oil resources,&#8221; said Randy Broiles, vice president, Americas, ExxonMobil 
      Production Company. &#8220;ExxonMobil is a leader in the research, development 
      and application of carbon 
      capture technologies. These technologies could play a significant 
      role in the future management of greenhouse gas emissions worldwide.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The $86 million expansion includes the installation of compressors to 
      capture 50 percent more carbon dioxide for potential use in enhanced oil 
      recovery and other industrial uses. Enhanced oil recovery involves the 
      injection of carbon dioxide into reservoirs to produce additional oil 
      and gas. The carbon dioxide for this project is captured from the 
      natural gas streams produced from fields in Wyoming. The gas streams 
      contain significant amounts of carbon dioxide and other components that 
      are removed at the LaBarge processing plant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the expansion, the plant has the capacity to capture approximately 
      365 million cubic feet per day of carbon dioxide from the gas streams - 
      equivalent to the amount emitted by more than 1.5 million cars.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The captured carbon dioxide is sold to companies for enhanced oil 
      recovery, helping to extend the productive lives of mature oil fields 
      and producing more energy supplies for America.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Plans and projections in this release are 
      forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including emissions 
      reductions, resource recoveries and the impact of new technologies, 
      could differ materially due to factors including changes in long-term 
      oil or gas prices or other market conditions affecting the oil and gas 
      industries; changes in law or government regulation; technical 
      difficulties; future technological developments by ExxonMobil or others;

Inc., Ford Motor Company, General Electric Company and Microsoft Corp. 

    The electronics rumor supply chain ruptured this morning: CNBC picked up
the latest Apple iPad buzz circulating and broadcasted it a little while
ago: Component suppliers are "gearing up for a new round of production in
the first quarter," writes Reuters in their version, citing anonymous
sources. "Ford F-150" is a hot search topic today after Ford Motor said
on Tuesday that it is delaying the shipment a "small population" of its
2011 F-150 pickup trucks because of a parts shortage. GE in partnership
with Environmental Defense Fund announced today it recently concluded an
ecomagination Treasure Hunt at the Florida Citrus Bowl Stadium in the
city of Orlando. The process identified potential opportunities to reduce
the stadium's energy spending by 50 percent annually. Microsoft Corp.'s
Xbox 360, helped by its Kinect motion-capture controller, was the
best-selling video-game console in the U.S. for the sixth consecutive
month, the company said.

			About Accretive Health
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Accretive Health is a leading provider of services to healthcare 
      providers. Our business purpose is to help U.S. hospitals, physicians 
      and other healthcare providers more efficiently manage their revenue 
      cycle operations and population-based health management initiatives. Our 
      distinctive operating model that includes people, processes and 
      sophisticated integrated technology, which we refer to as our solutions, 
      helps our customers realize sustainable improvements in their operating 
      margins and improve the satisfaction of their patients, physicians and 
      staff. Our customers typically are multi-hospital systems, including 
      faith-based or community healthcare systems, academic medical centers 
      and independent ambulatory clinics, and their affiliated physician 
      practice groups. Our revenue cycle solution spans our customers&#8217; entire 
      revenue cycle, unlike competing services that we believe address only a 
      portion of the revenue cycle or focus solely on cost reductions. Our 
      revenue cycle management customers have historically achieved 
      significant improvements in cash collections measured against the 
      contractual amount due for healthcare services, which we refer to as net 
      revenue yield. Our population health management infrastructure spans the 
      entire healthcare delivery continuum and enables providers to manage the 
      health of their patient populations delivering higher quality care while 
      reducing aggregate cost of care. For more information, please visit www.accretivehealth.com.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Simon Meads and Quentin Webb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Dec 10 (Reuters) - Blackstone Group (BX.N), the U.S.
private equity firm, is nearing a deal to buy Mivisa [MIVIS.UL],
after making the only binding offer for the Spanish maker of
food cans, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Mivisa's current owner, Blackstone's European rival CVC

was closer to 900 million euros ($1.2 billion) than the 1 to 1.2
billion that CVC originally sought.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CVC, which has owned the Murcia-based company since 2005,
kickstarted the auction in September. [ID:nLDE68T1LB]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blackstone declined to comment. CVC and Mivisa did not
immediately respond to requests for comment.

			Here are highlights from Thursday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			EIA Reports Mixed Inventory Data
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a sharp 
      fall in crude stockpiles, while refinery run-rates increased 
      significantly from the previous week. Gasoline and distillate stocks, 
      meanwhile, posted a larger-than-expected build.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Energy Information Administration (&#8220;EIA&#8221;) Petroleum Status Report &#8211; 
      that contains data for the previous week ending on Friday &#8211; outlines 
      information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held 
      and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad. This report provides 
      an overview on the level of reserves and their movements, thereby 
      helping investors to understand the demand/supply dynamics of petroleum 
      products. It is an indicator of current oil prices and volatility that 
      affect businesses of companies engaged in oil and refining industry like ExxonMobil 
      (NYSE: XOM), Chevron 
      Corp. (NYSE: CVX), 
      ConocoPhillips (NYSE: COP), 
      Valero (NYSE:VLO) 
      and Tesoro (NYSE: TSO).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Crude Oil
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The federal government&#8217;s EIA reported that crude inventories fell by 
      3,819 thousand barrels for the week ending December 3, 2010, well above 
      analyst expectations. The decrease in oil stocks, the first time in 
      three weeks, can be attributed to ramped-up refinery operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, at 355.9 million barrels, crude supplies are 5.9% above the 
      year-earlier level and remain above the upper limit of the average for 
      this time of the year. The crude supply cover was down slightly from 
      25.4 days in the previous week to 24.7 days. In the year-ago period, the 
      supply cover was 24.2 days.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Gasoline
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Supplies of gasoline rose for the third consecutive week to 214.0 
      million barrels. The 3,811 thousand barrels jump &#8211; the biggest increase 
      since January and much more than the forecast &#8211; came on the back of a 
      rise in production and imports. At 214.0 million barrels, current 
      stockpiles are 1.1% below the year-earlier levels and are near the upper 
      half of the average range.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Distillate
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Distillate fuel inventories (including diesel and heating oil) were up 
      by 2,154 thousand barrels last week, trumping forecasts for a modest 
      draw down. The increase in distillate fuel supplies came as production 
      levels rose 188 thousand barrels per day, while imports climbed by 144 
      thousand barrels per day. At 160.2 million barrels, distillate supplies 
      were 4.2% less than the year-ago level but just above the upper boundary 
      of the average range for this time of the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Refinery Rates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Refinery utilization was up 4.9% from the prior week to 87.5%, the 
      highest since the week ended September 17. Analysts were looking for the 
      refinery run rate to increase to 83.5%.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CRM to Acquire CloudApp Provider
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Leading on-demand customer relationship management (CRM) and cloud 
      computing company Salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE: CRM) 
      announced that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire 
      cloud-based application solution provider, Heroku.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The deal has already received approval from Heroku&#8217;s board of directors 
      and shareholders and is expected to be wrapped up by end January 2011. 
      The acquisition will cost Salesforce $212.0 million in cash. 
      Additionally, Salesforce will grant restricted shares worth $27.0 
      million and pay $10.0 million for unvested Heroku shares.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Founded in 2007, Heroku is a multi-tenant platform and hosting 
      environment, which is based on the Ruby programming language. Heroku 
      makes deployment and management of next-generation cloud applications 
      easier and more pocket friendly. The latest programming language of 
      Cloud 2, Ruby application, is gaining significant traction in recent 
      days owing to its simplicity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The acquisition will enable Salesforce to advance in the Cloud 2 
      platform. Heroku&#8217;s Ruby-based platform-as-a-service will allow 
      Salesforce&#8217;s customers to easily develop advanced applications. 
      Additionally, the takeover will extend Salesforce&#8217;s offerings, since 
      customers will be able to access numerous cloud-based application 
      programs developed by Heroku.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As per the findings of research firm IDC, revenues from information 
      technology cloud services could reach $55.5 billion in 2014. 
      Salesforce&#8217;s cloud-exposure and Heroku synergy could lead to a large 
      share in this growing opportunity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although the Heroku acquisition will expand the customer base and market 
      share of Salesforce, it may not move the revenue needle much for the 
      upcoming quarters or fiscal 2012. Salesforce will also witness a 
      dilution of approximately 2 cents in its 4Q11 earnings and roughly 12&#8211;13 
      cents in its FY12 earnings. Moreover, the impact of the acquisition will 
      be greater on a GAAP basis, than on a non-GAAP basis.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Salesforce.com reported decent third quarter fiscal 2011 results. It 
      also provided an encouraging guidance for the fourth quarter and raised 
      the full-year fiscal 2011 expectations on improving fundamentals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We, however, caution investors about strong competitors in the CRM 
      application and cloud computing areas. Google Inc. (Nasdaq: GOOG) 
      and Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) 
      have especially been fighting to win government clients at local, state 
      and federal levels to use their online e-mail and other applications 
      that fit in the cloud-computing space.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Currently, Salesforce.com has a short-term Hold recommendation, as is 
      indicated by the Zacks #3 Rank.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Western Union Hikes Dividend
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The world&#8217;s leading money transfer company Western Union Co. 
      (NYSE: WU) announced a 
      hike of 16.67% in its quarterly dividend to 7 cents per share. The 
      increased dividend will be paid on December 31, to shareholders&#8217; of 
      record as of December 20.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Western Union&#8217;s dividend is supported by its generation of strong cash 
      flow from operations of over $1 billion for the past three years. For 
      full-year 2010, management expects GAAP cash flows from operating 
      activities of $900 million to $1 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On the basis of the increased dividend, Western Union&#8217;s dividend yield 
      will be 1.50%, up from the current 1.30%. The company&#8217;s peer Moneygram 
      International Inc. (NYSE: MGI), 
      however, does not pay any dividend.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the fourth quarter of 2009, Western Union increased its dividend to 6 
      cents per quarter, or 24 cents annually, a significant increase from the 
      previous annual dividend of 4 cents per common share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Western Union repurchased 6 million shares in the quarter at an average 
      price of $16.15. About $486 million remains under the current stock 
      repurchase authorization. The company has returned more than $630 
      million year-to-date to shareholders through dividends and share 
      repurchases.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Former U.S. Astronaut Bernard Harris gave students and teachers in 
      Philadelphia a first-hand experience with the wonders of science, 
      technology, engineering and mathematics when &#8220;The Dream Tour, presented 
      by ExxonMobil&#8221; made its final stop of 2010 on December 10 speaking to 
      600 Wagner Middle School students.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The tour is designed to encourage today&#8217;s middle school students to 
      realize their potential and strive to acquire strong math and science 
      skills. The program included an interactive and inspirational program by 
      Dr. Harris, a demonstration on space and engaging dialogue about 
      achieving goals.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It is critical that American students are prepared with the 
      problem-solving skills and tools to tackle challenges they may face in 
      the future. Providing them with a strong foundation in math and science 
      education is imperative, and with The Dream Tour, I hope to inspire 
      students to pursue studies and careers in these fields,&#8221; Dr. Harris said.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      From humble beginnings in Houston, Texas to making history as the first 
      African American to walk in space, Dr. Harris is a living example of 
      achieving high aspirations. His story provides a powerful backdrop to 
      bring his message to students in cities across America. Since 2008, Dr. 
      Harris has encouraged nearly 35,000 middle school students in more than 
      20 cities nationwide. This year, The Dream Tour will visit Anchorage, 
      Baton Rouge, Billings, Cleveland, Denver, Nashville, Philadelphia, 
      Phoenix, San Diego and San Francisco as Dr. Harris continues to motivate 
      and inspire students to pursue math and science.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;ExxonMobil Foundation is proud to partner with Dr. Harris in getting 
      the message out to thousands of young adults about the importance of 
      careers in science, technology, engineering and math,&#8221; said Suzanne 
      McCarron, president, ExxonMobil Foundation. &#8220;The Dream Tour inspires 
      students to investigate the unlimited possibilities available to them 
      when they choose math and science as a means to realize their dreams.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer hired investigators to find evidence of corruption against Nigeria's attorney general to convince him to drop legal action against the company over a drug trial involving children, the Guardian newspaper reported, citing U.S. diplomatic cables made public by WikiLeaks.&lt;/p&gt;

State authorities said the tests killed 11 children and left dozens disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Kano's state government signed a $75 million settlement on July 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was not able to verify the content of the leaked cables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Pfizer said it "negotiated the settlement with the federal government of Nigeria in good faith and its conduct in reaching that agreement was proper."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any notion that the company hired investigators in connection to the former Attorney General is simply preposterous," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian reported on its website on Thursday that a memo leaked by WikiLeaks referenced a meeting between Pfizer's country manager, Enrico Liggeri, and U.S. officials suggesting the drug company did not want to pay to settle two cases brought by Nigeria's federal government. The Guardian linked to the cables on its website, www.guardian.co.uk/.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"According to Liggeri, Pfizer had hired investigators to uncover corruption links to federal Attorney General Michael Aondoakaa to expose him and put pressure on him to drop the federal cases," according to an April 2009 cable from Economic Counselor Robert Tansey of the U.S. Embassy in Abuja, cited in the Guardian report. "He said Pfizer's investigators were passing this information to local media."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aondoakaa was removed from the post of justice minister in February this year by Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A series of damaging articles detailing Aondoakaa's 'alleged' corruption ties were published in February and March," the cable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Liggeri contended that Pfizer had much more damaging information on Aondoakaa and that Aondoakaa's cronies were pressuring him to drop the suit for fear of further negative articles," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Trovan for use by adults only. After reports of liver failure, its use in the United States was restricted to adult emergency care. The European Union banned its use in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Jon Hemming and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds Pfizer statement, changes dateline to NEW YORK)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 10 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N)

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details
regarding this unique opportunity please visit: www.microcapsdaily.com.

its patented dPollution Device. The units are to be delivered to Stem
Italia S.R.L. of Rome, Italy and distributed to the members of A.N.C.
Associazione Nazionale di Categoria Trasporto Persone e Mobilita, the

			The InsurCard Visa&#174; Prepaid Card, Issued by The Bancorp Bank, 
      Recognized Internationally
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Bancorp Bank Payment Solutions Group, a division of The Bancorp Bank 
      (&#8220;Bancorp&#8221;), a wholly owned subsidiary of The Bancorp, Inc. 
      (Nasdaq:TBBK), today announced that the InsurCard Visa Prepaid Card was 
      honored as the winner of the Best International Prepaid category at the 
      prestigious OSCARDS&#174; award ceremony in Paris last night.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The OSCARDS recognize extraordinary innovation in bank card applications 
      and is one of the highest honors a card-related company can receive. 15 
      winners were announced from a shortlist of 64 nominees, handpicked from 
      the 500 new cards listed in the 2010 Innovative Cards Report, published 
      by Publi-News and Alt&#233;nor. Winners were chosen from a panel of 
      international experts in the field of card payments.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Issuing checks has become cumbersome in the world of electronic 
      payments. The InsurCard offers great benefits for insurance companies as 
      the card enables the insurer to control payments and ensure on-time 
      payments to claimants that are in a difficult position. An injured 
      worker or a displaced homeowner can access their funds immediately 
      anywhere that Visa debit cards are accepted.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are thrilled that InsurCard has been recognized as a significant 
      innovator in the insurance industry,&#8221; said John Barbella, Senior Vice 
      President, The Bancorp Bank. "We believe that prepaid cards will 
      revolutionize the way the insurance industry makes payments as insurers 
      seek ways to control payments and drive cost savings while providing 
      enhanced customer care. We are very excited about the InsurCard program 
      and we are anticipating rapid growth in this space."
    &lt;/p&gt;

      InsurCard Visa Prepaid Card is issued by The Bancorp Bank pursuant to a 
      license from Visa U.S.A. Inc. The Bancorp Bank; Member FDIC.

&lt;p&gt;  LAKEWOOD, NJ, Dec 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CharityChoice, the nonprofit pioneer and leader in charity gift cards and
in charitable corporate incentive and rewards, announced that it has
launched prepaid network-branded cards for the Holiday season. They are
now offering both a new CharityChoice Visa card and an American
Express(R)-branded rewards card. Available in popular denominations worth
$25, $50 and others. Recipients can spend 10% towards a donation at
CharityChoice and spend the remainder at their favorite stores to buy
merchandise. These rewards cards will focus on corporate programs while
continuing to serve the needs of small businesses and personal donors.

    "Adding these network-branded prepaid cards to our 100% charity card
offering enables the gifting of a tangible gift item with an added
meaningful charitable dimension," stated Daniel Goodman, President of
CharityChoice. "Together with our recently launched charity Facebook app,
our ecards, physical gift cards, codes and online wizard for customizing
your corporate redemption page; this makes our gift card website one of
the most robust on the Internet."

    Although there are many co-branded charity credit cards offered, the
co-branded CharityChoice prepaid reward card is presently the only of its
kind available. Partnering with InteliSpend Prepaid Solutions(TM) for the
American Express(R)-branded reward card and 1to1 Card for Visa(R) to
create these unique cards has opened a new horizon in charitable gifting.
It is no longer a matter of choosing between merchandise or charity; you
can now have both together in one gift item.

    About CharityChoice Gift Cards
 CharityChoice (www.ccgiftcards.org) is
the nonprofit pioneer and leader in recipient-designated charity gifts.
The charity gift platform is a project of Special Kids Fund
(www.specialkidsfund.org), an umbrella organization for special needs
children. Gifts are 100% tax deductible, benefitting over 500 major
national and local charities on our redemption list and administrative
fees go towards helping our special kids; so it is charitable all around!

&lt;p&gt;  MARTINSRIED, GERMANY and MUNCHEN, GERMANY, Dec 10
(MARKET WIRE) -- 

MorphoSys AG / MorphoSys Signs Long-Term Alliance with Pfizer on Sloning
Technology Platform

    Processed and transmitted by Thomson Reuters. The issuer is solely
responsible for the content of this announcement.

    MorphoSys AG (FSE: MOR; Prime Standard Segment, TecDAX) announced today
the signing of a non-exclusive license and technology transfer agreement
between its subsidiary Sloning BioTechnology GmbH and Pfizer. The
agreement covers the installation, training and use of Sloning's
technology platform Slonomics(R) for fabrication of highly-diverse gene
and protein libraries at Pfizer's subsidiary Rinat Neuroscience Corp. in
South San Francisco. The MorphoSys subsidiary will receive an upfront
payment in 2010, and stands to receive annual license fees over the
patent lifetime of the Slonomics technology platform. Further financial
details of the agreement were not disclosed.

    "This significant alliance around the Slonomics technology, only weeks
after we closed the acquisition of Sloning, clearly illustrates the
potential value of the platform," commented Dr. Simon Moroney, Chief
Executive Officer of MorphoSys AG. "This alliance with Pfizer creates
immediate value for our shareholders and is just the beginning of what we
expect to be a considerable return-on- investment from the combined
technology platforms of MorphoSys and Sloning in the years ahead."

    "Rinat started using Sloning's services in 2009, and we were impressed by
the diversity and quality of the libraries delivered," said Jaume Pons,
PhD, Chief Scientific Officer at Pfizer's Rinat subsidiary. "We therefore
decided to use this innovative technology platform further for our
research and development activities."

    Sloning's state-of-the-art Slonomics technology enables the precise
construction of protein libraries comprising defined mixtures of amino
acids at pre- determined positions with unprecedented speed. The
technology provides a new and flexible approach to generating optimized
proteins. MorphoSys acquired Sloning BioTechnology in October 2010.

&lt;p&gt;KUALA LUMPUR Dec 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sach 
signed a deal on Friday to offer funds in Malaysia as it looks 
to tap the growth in emerging markets.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Under the agreement, Goldman will sell its $1.5 billion 
BRIC fund through RHB Group , Malaysia's 
fifth largest lender by market capitalisation, before 
eventually offering other products next year.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oliver Bolitho, managing director of Goldman Sachs Asset 
Management Asia, said emerging markets were expected to remain 
resilient next year despite the recent run-up in stock prices 
driven by economic growth.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On a price to earnings basis, emerging markets are 
(still) relatively cheap compared to developed markets in the 
world," Bolitho told reporters.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not have a distribution capability of our own (in 
Malaysia). As we look to build our business to retail clients 
around the region, the importance of premier banking 
groups...is highly important for our products."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's BRIC equity fund has gained about seven percent 
year-to-date. RHB Investment Management's managing director 
Sharifatul Hanizah said bookbuilding for the fund would start 
early January. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's something our clients and investors have something 
to look forward to and we shall be rolling it out in the first 
quarter of next year," she said. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sharifatul said RHB's assets under management would grow 
to 15 billion ringgit ($4.77 billion) by the end of next year 
with the Goldman partnership, from about 12.5 billion ringgit 
at present. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman received its fund management and corporate 
advisory license from the Malaysian market regulator in July 
this year.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A big stock buyback or an increased dividend could lift Pfizer Inc shares to $25 over the next year, and the retirement of former CEO Jeff Kindler also gives Pfizer an opportunity to shed assets, Barron's said in its Dec 13 edition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer hired investigators to find evidence of corruption against Nigeria's attorney general to convince him to drop legal action against the company over a drug trial involving children, the Guardian newspaper reported, citing U.S. diplomatic cables made public by WikiLeaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria's Kano state sued the world's largest drugmaker in May 2007 for $2 billion over testing of the meningitis drug Trovan. State authorities said the tests killed 11 children and left dozens disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Kano's state government signed a $75 million settlement on July 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was not able to verify the content of the leaked cables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Pfizer said it "negotiated the settlement with the federal government of Nigeria in good faith and its conduct in reaching that agreement was proper."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any notion that the company hired investigators in connection to the former Attorney General is simply preposterous," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian reported on its website on Thursday that a memo leaked by WikiLeaks referenced a meeting between Pfizer's country manager, Enrico Liggeri, and U.S. officials suggesting the drug company did not want to pay to settle two cases brought by Nigeria's federal government. The Guardian linked to the cables on its website, www.guardian.co.uk/.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"According to Liggeri, Pfizer had hired investigators to uncover corruption links to federal Attorney General Michael Aondoakaa to expose him and put pressure on him to drop the federal cases," according to an April 2009 cable from Economic Counselor Robert Tansey of the U.S. Embassy in Abuja, cited in the Guardian report. "He said Pfizer's investigators were passing this information to local media."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aondoakaa was removed from the post of justice minister in February this year by Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A series of damaging articles detailing Aondoakaa's 'alleged' corruption ties were published in February and March," the cable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Liggeri contended that Pfizer had much more damaging information on Aondoakaa and that Aondoakaa's cronies were pressuring him to drop the suit for fear of further negative articles," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Trovan for use by adults only. After reports of liver failure, its use in the United States was restricted to adult emergency care. The European Union banned its use in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Jon Hemming and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dec 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co.  has 
reduced a large position in silver futures, the Financial 
Times reported on Tuesday, citing a source familiar with the 
matter.    	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company's silver futures positions would be 
"materially smaller" in the future, the FT reported the source 
as saying.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan declined immediate comment when contacted by 
Reuters.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan and HSBC Holdings Plc were hit with two 
lawsuits in late October by investors who accused them of 
conspiring to drive down silver prices, and reaping an 
estimated hundreds of millions of dollars in profit. 
[ID:nN27259071]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then, open interest in U.S. silver futures SIc1 
has declined by about 15 percent, while prices have surged to 
30-year peaks.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The banks, among the world's largest, were accused of 
manipulating the market for COMEX silver futures and options 
contracts from the first half of 2008 by amassing huge short 
positions in silver futures contracts that are designed to 
profit when prices fall.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuits were filed one day after the Commodity 
Futures Trading Commission proposed regulations to give it 
greater power to thwart traders who try to manipulate prices.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CFTC began probing allegations of silver price 
manipulation in September 2008, but the paper said in two 
previous reviews of the silver market, the CFTC has dismissed 
claims of manipulation.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft &#8212; along with a number of other new companies &#8212; has joined an increasingly large bandwagon trying to keep Google from purchasing ITA, a provider of flight information for search engines, for $700 million.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Google is looking to acquire the flight data provider for around $700 million to improve results for Web users making travel plans. The deal seems innocuous enough &#8212; Google said it had no plans to sell plane tickets and would direct Google search users to other sites to purchase tickets. Still, a number of companies including travel search company Expedia and Microsoft, which runs search rival Bing, have launched the Fair Search Coalition to try to stop the acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Keeping Web surfers on search sites for as long as possible has become the new game for search providers like Microsoft and Google. Google&#8217;s added a lot of functions to the search engine that offer direct answers. Searchers can drop in simple mathematical equations and questions about things like sports scores and get direct answers on Google&#8217;s search page. Google also already embeds some flight data in its search engine, as does Bing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition of ITA promises to make Google&#8217;s data more accurate and up to date than it already is. That can prove to be the deciding factor that keeps a search user on the page long enough to leave an impression and generate some ad revenue. Multiply that by the number of people who use Google search on a daily basis, and it adds up to a ton of additional revenue for Google. So it makes sense why Google is paying $700 million for the data, and why Microsoft would love to stop the deal and get a slice of that information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The coalition argues that it would increase prices and drive down competition and business innovation, but it really all boils down to advertising revenue.&#160;Travel is a huge part of e-commerce &#8212; worth around $80 billion a year, according to the Wall Street Journal report. ITA&#8217;s software handles around 65 percent of all e-commerce flight bookings, and travel advertising accounted for about 6 percent of all online advertising revenue, according to the&#160;coalition&#8217;s website, FairSearch.org. Stealing just a small slice of that &#8212; which Google probably already owns a large part of &#8212; represents a significant financial gain.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: Bing, Bing Search, e commerce, flight search, Google Search, travel search&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies: Expedia, Google, Microsoft, Priceline&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) named board member George Lorch as nonexecutive chairman, a week after the abrupt departure of Chairman and Chief Executive Jeffrey Kindler from the world's largest drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The announcement follows several high-profile management changes at Pfizer, although the exodus of executives may not be finished as it faces patent expirations for top-selling drugs such as cholesterol fighter Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer also confirmed on Monday its head of manufacturing, Natale Ricciardi, is retiring after nearly 40 years with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lorch, 68, has served as an independent director since 2000 and had been chairman of the board's compensation committee. Lorch is the former chairman and CEO of flooring manufacturer Armstrong Holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board elected former Gillette CEO James Kilts to head its compensation committee, although some industry observers had tipped Kilts as the front-runner for the chairman post.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lorch is as good as anyone else on the board," said Charles Butler, an analyst at Barclays Capital.

He was immediately replaced by 32-year Pfizer veteran Ian Read, who had been head of global pharmaceuticals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler, who was in the top job for four-and-a-half years, cited a need to recharge his batteries as a reason for his sudden retirement at age 55.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ricciardi's replacement is expected to be named shortly, company spokesman Ray Kerins said, adding he would remain to help with the transition through the first quarter of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares had fallen about 27 percent during his tenure, which was marked by last year's $67 billion acquisition of rival Wyeth.

In December 2008, the quarterly dividend was 32 cents, one of the highest in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts have said raising the dividend was one of the many moves Pfizer could make to help get its shares moving in the right direction.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) hired investigators to find evidence of corruption against Nigeria's attorney general to convince him to drop legal action against the company over a drug trial involving children, the Guardian newspaper reported, citing U.S. diplomatic cables made public by WikiLeaks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nigeria's Kano state sued the world's largest drugmaker in May 2007 for $2 billion over testing of the meningitis drug Trovan. State authorities said the tests killed 11 children and left dozens disabled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Kano's state government signed a $75 million settlement on July 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was not able to verify the content of the leaked cables.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Pfizer said it "negotiated the settlement with the federal government of Nigeria in good faith and its conduct in reaching that agreement was proper."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any notion that the company hired investigators in connection to the former Attorney General is simply preposterous," the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Guardian reported on its website on Thursday that a memo leaked by WikiLeaks referenced a meeting between Pfizer's country manager, Enrico Liggeri, and U.S. officials suggesting the drug company did not want to pay to settle two cases brought by Nigeria's federal government. The Guardian linked to the cables on its website, www.guardian.co.uk/.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"According to Liggeri, Pfizer had hired investigators to uncover corruption links to federal Attorney General Michael Aondoakaa to expose him and put pressure on him to drop the federal cases," according to an April 2009 cable from Economic Counselor Robert Tansey of the U.S. Embassy in Abuja, cited in the Guardian report. "He said Pfizer's investigators were passing this information to local media."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aondoakaa was removed from the post of justice minister in February this year by Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A series of damaging articles detailing Aondoakaa's 'alleged' corruption ties were published in February and March," the cable said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Liggeri contended that Pfizer had much more damaging information on Aondoakaa and that Aondoakaa's cronies were pressuring him to drop the suit for fear of further negative articles," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1998, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Trovan for use by adults only. After reports of liver failure, its use in the United States was restricted to adult emergency care. The European Union banned its use in 1999.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Michel Rose; Editing by Jon Hemming and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

			Demand for Microsoft Migrations Expected to Spike in 2011
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ConverterTechnology&#8217;s Migration Experts Offer Tips To Reduce 
      Risks, Costs  Downtime While Improving Accuracy  Productivity
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the economy recovering and the recent releases of Windows 7 and 
      Microsoft&#174; Office 2010, 2011 is expected to be the biggest technology 
      upgrade since Y2K. Therefore, Microsoft migrations are expected 
      to spike significantly in the coming year. The key to a successful 
      desktop transformation is to properly plan and test throughout the 
      process, to ensure file and application compatibility and to minimize 
      risk, downtime and cost.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Migrating to new Microsoft versions will be instrumental as companies 
      strive to stay competitive, evolve with a changing marketplace and 
      enhance their capabilities using innovative technologies,&#8221; said Shawn 
      Allaway, President of ConverterTechnology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Companies that migrate to the latest Microsoft versions will improve 
      their ROI quickly and significantly. In a study conducted by IDC, the 
      investment for a Windows migration can be realized in as little as 7.2 
      months which, according to the study, resulted in a 375% return on 
      investment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There are significant benefits to a Microsoft migration, but to many, 
      desktop transformations mean increased headaches, so companies may fear 
      &#8211; and postpone &#8211; this undertaking,&#8221; Allaway continued. &#8220;Recent reports 
      are compounding this anxiety. According to a new Symantec study, 
      migrating to Windows 7 is presenting more challenges than any previous 
      operating system migration. It&#8217;s vital that companies fully understand 
      the planning and implementation process to successfully complete an 
      enterprise-wide migration.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Migration experts ConverterTechnolgy offer the following tips to reduce 
      costs, errors and downtime often associated with migration, while 
      increasing productivity, efficiency and accuracy:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Plan properly by discovering all of your Office files and 
        defining the scope of the migration project, which is often a more 
        difficult task than anticipated. IT departments are aware of the disk 
        space used for file storage, but may not know the actual number of 
        files that need to be migrated, or which files are &#8220;business critical&#8221; 
        since they don&#8217;t own or use the files. Even more challenging, many 
        Office files reside on users&#8217; desktops and laptops. Finding and 
        migrating these files can be the difference between a successful 
        deployment and a nightmare for the company&#8217;s IT staff.
      
			
				Scope the size of the file migration. This step will reduce 
        both the time required to migrate files and the overall cost of 
        deployment. A leading entertainment company faced major challenges 
        when they realized they had more than 14 million office files to 
        migrate. They decided to migrate only the most important and riskiest 
        files, the ones that contained VBA, charts or links, which narrowed 
        their target file set to two million. They further narrowed their 
        focus to business critical files that had been modified within the 
        past 18 months and remediated hundreds of thousands of files. The 
        combined effort  cost to do this manually would have been enormous 
        and subject to human error. They were able to limit the overall scope 
        to files that were critical (and far more manageable) for a seamless 
        Office 2010 rollout.
      
			
				Copy business critical files to a migration lab. Although files 
        can be scanned and converted in the live business environment, 
        performing these tasks in a separate lab environment will limit the 
        impact on users and the network during the migration process.
      
			
				Scan the files for compatibility issues. Potential issues will 
        range from chart formatting problems to VBA code that no longer runs 
        correctly. After identifying compatibility issues, immediately correct 
        these problems so employees can continue working without interruption 
        when Office 2010 is deployed.
      
			
				Test the migrated files, a critical step that&#8217;s often 
        overlooked. While many of the VBA changes needed to make a file 
        compatible with Office 2010 can be automatically remediated, some will 
        require manual effort. For instance, Data Access Pages in MS Access 
        will require manual remediation. Beginning with the release of Office 
        2007, Data Access Pages can no longer be created or edited using VBA 
        code in MS Access. Companies moving from Office 2003 must determine 
        the best way to replace this functionality for their business.
      
			
				Consider links between Office files, which is especially 
        relevant and challenging for companies moving from Office 2003 (or 
        earlier) to Office 2010. The new OOXML file format used with Office 
        2010 changes the extension of every Office file (for example, &#8220;.xls&#8221; 
        becomes either &#8220;.xlsx&#8221; or &#8220;.xlsm&#8221;). A seemingly &#8220;minor&#8221; change 
        actually means that every document that links to another document will 
        either fail or point to an outdated set of data.
      
			
				Anticipate non-accessible registry settings. Applications that 
        write registry entries during the installation process to sections of 
        the registry that are not normally accessible to a standard user under 
        Windows 7 can cause unexpected results and/or application failures.
      
			
				Realize that non-supported drivers can cause problems. Windows 
        Vista and Windows 7 introduced a new Windows Driver model, so older 
        drivers &#8211; that were designed for Windows XP &#8211; may not load correctly 
        on the new operating systems.
      
			
				Watch for deprecated API&#8217;s. Applications that make calls to 
        deprecated APIs, such as Memory Management, Windows Network Helper and 
        Networking QOS, could display unexpected behavior or crash.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;There&#8217;s a distinct, systematic process to the desktop transformation, 
      and the Symantec survey found that the migration to Windows 7 from Vista 
      took an average of five hours per machine. That&#8217;s obviously a tremendous 
      time and manpower commitment for mid-and-large-sized enterprises, which 
      is why Symantec recommended that any companies with more than 10 PCs use 
      an automated process,&#8221; Allaway continued.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Outsourcing to a migration expert will streamline the process, 
      significantly reducing cost, downtime, errors and risk, while increasing 
      productivity, accuracy and efficiency,&#8221; he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

    PennyStockAlley.com Alerts Today's Possible Movers and Shakers: Citigroup
Inc., Microsoft Corp., Sirius XM Radio, Inc., Sprint Nextel Corp.

    The government sold its remaining stake of 2.4 billion Citigroup shares
at a price of $4.35 per share, and booked a total profit of $12 billion.
The more important development for the Street take on Citi shares,
though, is that the government exit means it's time for embedded upside
in the bank stock to be realized. Goldman Sachs analyst Sarah Friar
continues to sound the alarm bells for Microsoft as Tech Flash picked up
a research note she issued suggesting the company's revenue growth would
slow from 12% in 2010 to 7% in 2011. Sirius XM began the year as a hot
stock, more than doubling in price in under three months and it appears,
with a rash of good news to end the year, the stock just may go out the
way it came in; on an uptrend that may see higher prices sooner than

    The government sold its remaining stake of 2.4 billion Citigroup shares
at a price of $4.35 per share, and booked a total profit of $12 billion.
The more important development for the Street take on Citi shares,
though, is that the government exit means it's time for embedded upside
in the bank stock to be realized. Goldman Sachs analyst Sarah Friar
continues to sound the alarm bells for Microsoft as Tech Flash picked up
a research note she issued suggesting the company's revenue growth would
slow from 12% in 2010 to 7% in 2011. Sirius XM began the year as a hot
stock, more than doubling in price in under three months and it appears,
with a rash of good news to end the year, the stock just may go out the
way it came in; on an uptrend that may see higher prices sooner than
later according to seekingalpha.com. As of 1:00pm today Sprint Nextel
Corp. rose 4.7 percent to $4.42 with 45,773,300 shares traded.

&lt;p&gt;  WINCHESTER, CA, Dec 13 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Going to work every day is sheer joy for Joan Retelle, as she is a Craft
Care Specialist (CCS) providing therapeutic arts &amp; crafts kits to the
patients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

    "Although I'm a registered nurse, I've been working as a CCS for about
seven months," said Retelle. "I've enjoyed crafting most of my life, so
it's a blessing to be able to use the arts to aid veterans in their
rehabilitation and recovery. I've seen numerous patients regain the
sparkle in their eyes as they work on their kits. They go from sullen and
withdrawn to having almost childlike enthusiasm when anticipating their
next project."

    Retelle makes the rounds on several wards along with the outpatient area.
"The arts &amp; crafts help to decrease boredom, improve fine motor skills
for those with arm and hand injuries, increase ability to concentrate and
deter the mental and physical pain," said Retelle.

    Lieutenant Colonel Sandra Harrison-Weaver, Chief, Integrated Occupational
Therapy Service said, "We are so grateful to have Joan working with us in
delivering HHV's crafts to our veteran patients. Every day, we have
patients who seek us in order to select a craft kit to work on. There are
many who cannot leave the wards, so Joan takes the kits directly to them.
This allows for more productive use of their time and takes their minds
off the pain and boredom. Many will make the kits as gifts for loved
ones. In some instances, the therapists will select a project for a
patient as part of a specific therapy. HHV and its CCS program are
essential in our mission of delivering world-class care." 

    Since 1971, Help Hospitalized Veterans has provided over 28 million
therapeutic arts &amp; crafts and other products to our nation's veterans.
HHV also employs some 60 CCS's stationed at VA and military medical
facilities worldwide. For more information on HHV's products and
services, visit www.hhv.org or call 1-888- 567-VETS.

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details
regarding this unique opportunity please visit: www.microcapsdaily.com

announced that it has received a request for the supply of 3,000 units of
its patented dPollution Device. The units are to be delivered to Stem
Italia S.R.L. of Rome, Italy and distributed to the members of A.N.C.
Associazione Nazionale di Categoria Trasporto Persone e Mobilita, the
association of tourist bus drivers in the Province of Lazio, Italy.
A.N.C. will be acquiring the units to install on its members fleets of
diesel buses to ensure their compliance with the Province of Lazio's new
Low Emission Zone (LEZ) standards, which will be enforced starting in
2011.

vehicles and dPollution (RMGX) owns the exclusive manufacturing and
distribution rights to a patented fuel conditioning technology which
significantly increases mileage and lowers harmful GHG emissions.

fuel to combust more thoroughly and efficiently. This technology works on
every internal combustion engine on the planet. Considering that IC
engines are used in cars, buses, trucks, diesel trains, construction
equipment, farm equipment and a variety of military vehicles the market
for this device is virtually limitless. For more information, please

&lt;p&gt;IBM said today it has been helping to make the Texas city of Corpus Christi into a smarter, more efficient, and environmentally sustainable city.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The deal to help the city of 280,000 residents manage its future is part of IBM&#8217;s Smarter Planet business initiative, which promises to use state-of-the-art technology to transform cities. IBM will supply software to measure, monitor and improve the way the city manages water, roads, airport, parks, and utilities. The aim is to make the city staff smarter about evaluating problems and responding to them quickly. While it makes money for IBM, it could also improve the quality of life for residents and help make the city more environmentally sustainable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software is aimed at automating paper processes and giving city departments and managers a dashboard for viewing the city in real-time, much like people do in simulation games such as SimCity. Steve Klepper, an administrative superintendent for Corpus Christi, said the software automates work orders and provides a real-time view of infrastructure, which includes a busy port, tourism, and higher education.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Using IBM&#8217;s Maximo Asset Management software, the city analyzes the status of tens of thousands of physical assets such as water mains, traffic lights, bridges, park lawns, fire hydrants, garbage trucks and storm water ditches. IBM also supplies call center software, One Call Center, to speed responses to resident calls. During fiscal year 2009, the software, which is already in use, generated more than 45,000 electronic work orders from across the city. The city also uses bird&#8217;s-eye view mapping software from IBM&#8217;s partner Esri to show managers an aerial view of problems, color-coded by urgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previously, citizen calls were routed to departments on paper index cards before being entered into spreadsheets. The staff had no way to view the work history on each call. There was no way to accurately track how long it took to respond to problems. And without mapping, it wasn&#8217;t easy to see if problems were isolated or part of a larger problem. Now the city&#8217;s data is stored in digital form for more city staff to access, including workers who are out in the field and can only access the city&#8217;s networks via Wi-Fi wireless networking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM software also manages six wastewater treatment plants with millions of gallons of capacity. During one audit, the staff found that 33 percent of the department&#8217;s effort was devoted to resolving problems at 1.4 percent of customer sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The city also studied 3,843 water main breaks over three years and found that smaller-thickness water mains represented a disproportionate share of the broken pipes. Now the city is replacing the mains with larger pipes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides Corpus Christi, IBM is also working on projects in 300 cities, including London, Stockholm, Sydney, Dublin and Amsterdam. Yep, sounds like SimCity to me, without the UFO invasions that tear up city blocks. Check out the video below.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Tags: SimCity, Smarter Cities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies: IBM&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext said a deal to support U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs's new European trading system showed the exchange was keeping pace with other large rivals in looking to diversify their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NYSE Euronext, which runs stock and futures exchanges in the United States and Europe, said Monday it was supplying Goldman's London arm with technology to support Sigma X MTF, the share trading system the U.S. bank plans to launch in the second quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Traditionally we are known for operating global markets, but this is the first time that our trading platform and our infrastructure have been chosen by a major broker dealer," said Stanley Young, chief executive of NYSE Euronext's IT arm NYSE Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman already has an internal trading system, or crossing network, called Sigma X but it has opted to launch a more tightly regulated MTF (multi-lateral trading facility) version amid growing pressure on broker crossing networks (BCNs) from regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The European Commission last week outlined plans to force BCNs to be regulated akin to MTFs, a move that could restrict brokers' activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs was the third large broker -- after Nomura&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and UBS - to have committed to launch an MTF but it was the first to have outsourced its technology to an exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There are key advantages to the service that NYSE is supplying to Sigma X MTF -- the service will be subject to monitoring and surveillance conducted by a regulated market and the technology platform gives us time to market benefits," David Shrimpton, incoming chief operating officer of Sigma X MTF at Goldman Sachs, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest stock exchange groups, including NYSE Euronext, Nasdaq OMX, the London Stock Exchange and Deutsche Boerse, have been keen to diversify their businesses away from pure trading revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Supplying technology to fledgling platforms and exchanges has become attractive in recent years because the income is consistent when compared to trading revenue dictated by increasingly volatile markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Young said of the Goldman Sachs deal: "It is a significant development in the diversification of our business and a resounding endorsement of our strategy to build a broad based, diversified technology and markets business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dan Lalor)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * NYSE Euronext heralds first broker win&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Broker crossing systems have been under pressure&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Exchanges want to diversify into IT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Luke Jeffs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - NYSE Euronext NYX.N said a deal
to support U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs's (GS.N) new
European trading system showed the exchange was keeping pace
with other large rivals in looking to diversify their offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NYSE Euronext, which runs stock and futures exchanges in the
United States and Europe, said on Monday it was supplying
Goldman's London arm with technology to support Sigma X MTF, the
share trading system the U.S. bank plans to launch in the second
quarter of next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Traditionally we are known for operating global markets,
but this is the first time that our trading platform and our
infrastructure have been chosen by a major broker dealer," said
Stanley Young, chief executive of NYSE Euronext's IT arm NYSE
Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman already has an internal trading system, or crossing
network, called Sigma X but it has opted to launch a more
tightly regulated MTF (multi-lateral trading facility) version
amid growing pressure on broker crossing networks (BCNs) from
regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European Commission last week outlined plans to force
BCNs to be regulated akin to MTFs, a move that could restrict
brokers' activities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs was the third large broker -- after Nomura
(8604.T) and UBS (UBSN.VX) - to have committed to launch an MTF
but it was the first to have outsourced its technology to an
exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are key advantages to the service that NYSE is
supplying to Sigma X MTF -- the service will be subject to
monitoring and surveillance conducted by a regulated market and
the technology platform gives us time to market benefits," David
Shrimpton, incoming chief operating officer of Sigma X MTF at
Goldman Sachs, told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest stock exchange groups, including NYSE
Euronext, Nasdaq OMX (NDAQ.O), the London Stock Exchange (LSE.L)
and Deutsche Boerse (DB1Gn.DE), have been keen to diversify
their businesses away from pure trading revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Supplying technology to fledgling platforms and exchanges
has become attractive in recent years because the income is
consistent when compared to trading revenue dictated by
increasingly volatile markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Young said of the Goldman Sachs deal: "It is a significant
development in the diversification of our business and a
resounding endorsement of our strategy to build a broad based,
diversified technology and markets business."

&lt;p&gt;RAS LAFFAN, Qatar (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) Chief Executive Rex Tillerson said on Monday global oil markets are well-supplied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Inventory levels are still very healthy in the U.S. and other OECD (Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development) countries," Tillerson told reporters at an event in Qatar's industrial city of Ras Laffan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You still have OPEC (Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries) with spare capacity of something like 6 million barrels per day. I would say there's plenty of supply," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tillerson, head of the world's largest publicly traded oil company, expects a slow return to deepwater drilling in the Gulf of Mexico, where the U.S. government is in the process of hashing out new safety regulations following the BP Plc (BP.N) (BP.L) oil spill disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The process is quite lengthy and involved," Tillerson said. "At this point, there have been no new deepwater permits issued.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - JPMorgan  Chase Co (JPM.N) will see record revenues from China this year, as the second-largest U.S. bank benefits from a surge in equity raising by Chinese companies, the head of the bank's China investment banking business said on Monday at the Reuters China Investment Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's China revenue will rise more that 80 percent over 2009 levels, and up 40 percent over the bank's previous record for China in 2007, said Fang Fang, the bank's CEO of China investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our pipeline is now stronger than ever, with a number of deals landing in January," Fang said at the Summit held at the Reuters office in Beijing. "A lot of clients are coming to talk to us about next year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asia, and China in particular, is a key source of investment banking revenue for global banks. Agricultural Bank of China Ltd's (1288.HK) record $22.1 billion IPO, in which JPMorgan participated, is a case in point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's number of completed deals will also be about 80 percent higher than last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fang, who is also a member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, a largely ceremonial advisory body to parliament, predicted a rise in debt and equity deals in a number of Chinese sectors in 2011, including financial services, health care, transportation, education, food and beverage and luxury goods.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's related to the increase in household disposable income," Fang said, referring to the rising demand for capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan is doing deals -- both equity and debt -- with a much wider range of companies than in the past, he said, which could help shield the bank in the event of any economic turbulence in China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the past, our business was like a 9-inch, black-and-white TV with one channel: state-owned enterprises going public offshore," he said. "Now it's like a 52-inch plasma TV with 30 channels. If one or two channels go blank, we still have others."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Priorities for 2011 include hiring more investment bankers and significantly increasing clients and products and services through a planned joint venture with a Chinese partner, said Fang, a graduate of Tsinghua and Vanderbilt Universities who is also vice-chairman of JPMorgan's Asia investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint venture, with First Capital Securities Co Ltd of Shenzhen, will allow JPMorgan to tap China's lucrative underwriting market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Right now we can only raise money for Chinese clients offshore," Fang said. "With a domestic securities license we will be able to provide clients with renminbi equities and bonds capabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most importantly, we are looking at increasing the number of clients we cover in China and we want to offer more products to them," Fang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting a license to operate in yuan currency securities markets "is very important to us," he said. "Not initially from a revenue point of view, but we want the ability to go to our best clients and say we can do both offshore and domestic business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The joint venture, in which JPMorgan will hold a one-third stake, is awaiting regulatory approval. JP Morgan is behind rivals such as UBS Securities, Goldman Sachs (GS.N) or Credit Suisse, which already have established JVs with Chinese partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it does not break out revenue by country, JPMorgan said in October that its third-quarter global investment banking profit fell by a third to $1.2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking revenue for the Asia-Pacific region grew 6 percent in the first nine months of this year compared with the same period last year, while investment banking revenue for Europe, the Middle East and Africa fell 29 percent, and declined 8 percent for the Americas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Don Durfee and Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (&#8220;JPMorgan Chase&#8221;) announced today the preliminary 
      results of its previously announced cash tender offer for any and all of 
      the 5.875% Capital Securities, Series O, of JPMorgan Chase Capital XV 
      (the &#8220;Securities&#8221;). JPMorgan Chase also announced the results of its 
      solicitation of consents to terminate certain replacement capital 
      covenants which JPMorgan Chase executed in favor of, and for the benefit 
      of, the holders of the Securities in connection with offerings of 
      capital securities by certain affiliated Delaware trusts and two 
      offerings of its non-cumulative preferred stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on December 10, 2010 (the &#8220;Consent 
      Expiration Date&#8221;), $831,047,000 aggregate liquidation amount of the 
      Securities had been validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant 
      to the tender offer, representing approximately 83.1% of the outstanding 
      aggregate liquidation amount of the Securities. Including consents 
      validly delivered by holders of the Securities who have not tendered 
      Securities in the tender offer, valid consents were received in the 
      consent solicitation in respect of approximately 86.7% of the 
      outstanding aggregate liquidation amount of the Securities. Accordingly, 
      holders of the Securities have delivered the required consents to 
      terminate the replacement capital covenants, and the replacement capital 
      covenants have been terminated, effective December 10, 2010.

      27, 2010, unless extended or earlier terminated (the &#8220;Offer Expiration 
      Date&#8221;). Holders validly tendering, and not validly withdrawing, 
      Securities after the Consent Expiration Date and on or before the Offer 
      Expiration Date will be eligible to receive only the tender offer 
      consideration of $950 per $1,000 liquidation amount of Securities, and 
      will not receive the early tender premium offered to holders who 
      tendered their Securities on or before the Consent Expiration Date.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Holders whose Securities are accepted for payment on the Offer 
      Expiration Date (irrespective of whether the Securities were tendered 
      before or after the Consent Expiration Date) will receive accumulated 
      and unpaid distributions in respect of their purchased Securities from 
      the last distribution payment date to, but not including, the payment 
      date for the tender offer.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      conditioned upon certain customary conditions set forth in the Offer to 
      Purchase.

			Clearwell Advances E-Discovery in the Cloud with Support for 
      Microsoft Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS)/Microsoft Office 365
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Clearwell E-Discovery Platform Enables Customers to Quickly and 
      Defensibly Identify and Collect Data From Microsoft Exchange Online and 
      Microsoft SharePoint Online
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Clearwell 
      Systems, Inc., a leader in intelligent 
      e-discovery, today announced that the latest version of the Clearwell 
      E-Discovery Platform now allows customers to defensibly collect data 
      from Microsoft Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS)/Microsoft 
      Office 365. With this new capability, customers can quickly identify and 
      collect data from Microsoft Exchange Online and Microsoft SharePoint 
      Online for e-discovery requests in response to litigation, regulatory 
      inquiries and internal investigations. Once collected, the data from the 
      cloud is immediately available for downstream e-discovery phases such as 
      processing, analysis, review and production. As a result, the Clearwell 
      E-Discovery Platform frees enterprises to reap the benefits of cloud 
      computing while still fulfilling their legal and compliance requirements 
      related to e-discovery.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloud computing adoption continues to grow at a record pace as 
      enterprises look to leverage the scalability and cost savings offered by 
      the cloud. According to The 451 Group, the&#160;cloud computing&#160;marketplace 
      will reach $16.7 billion in revenue by 2013, up from $8.7 billion in 
      2010, resulting in a compound annual growth rate of 24 percent. This 
      surge in cloud computing consumption, combined with the tripled growth 
      in Microsoft BPOS subscriptions in the past year, demonstrates the 
      imperative need for corporations to ensure that data placed in the cloud 
      is discoverable in the event of litigation, regulatory inquiries and 
      internal investigations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As enterprises continue to move data to the cloud, the issue of timely 
      and effective legal discoverability becomes even more critical,&#8221; said 
      Katey Wood, analyst at The 451 Group. &#8220;Clearwell&#8217;s new BPOS support lets 
      users identify and collect this data with a single product, no matter 
      where it resides, streamlining the e-discovery process significantly.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The latest version of the Clearwell E-Discovery Platform provides 
      comprehensive support for Microsoft BPOS/Office 365, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Identification and collection of data from both Microsoft Exchange 
        Online and Microsoft SharePoint Online
      
			
        Integration with Active Directory
      
			
        Auto-detection of both mailboxes and SharePoint sites in the cloud
      
			
        Connection throttling to BPOS in order to maximize network efficiency
      
			
        Managed security and access, along with automatic activity and 
        chain-of-custody reporting
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Cloud computing is dramatically altering the landscape for electronic 
      discovery,&#8221; said Kurt Leafstrand, senior director of product management 
      at Clearwell Systems. &#8220;As enterprises join this strategic movement of 
      corporate data to cloud environments, it is critical that they plan 
      ahead and proactively enable their IT and legal teams to meet their 
      legal and compliance requirements. With Microsoft BPOS/Office 365 
      support now part of the Clearwell E-Discovery Platform, customers can 
      manage their entire case &#8211; whether data is contained on-premise, in the 
      cloud or in a mixed environment &#8211; in a single product for the entire 
      e-discovery lifecycle.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Dec 13 (Reuters) - Metals prices will diverge to
follow their own fundamentals during 2011 as emerging market
economies drive ahead and demand recovers in developed nations,
pushing copper above $11,000, Goldman Sachs forecast on Monday.

 "Metals with tighter cyclical fundamentals (copper, and zinc
in the second half) will outperform those with readily available
capacity (aluminium) or receding tightness (nickel)," Goldman
Sachs said in a research note.

 Robust demand from top consumers such as China and improved
demand from developed nations against a mine supply shortfall
were expected to drive up copper prices and exhaust almost all
exchange stocks next year, Goldman Sachs said.

 "We maintain our 12-mo ahead copper price forecast of
$11,000/mt and believe that prices could spike substantially
above these levels, most likely in late 2011," it said.

 Exchange-based stocks in London and Shanghai sit at some
466,500 tonnes, down by around one third since early April.
MCU-STOCKS CU-STX-SGH

 This supply scarcity is expected to set a premium for near
dated copper prices that triggers demand rationing, Goldman
Sachs said.

 Premiums for cash copper reached their highest in over two
years above $63 a tonne in early December against the benchmark
contract and remain at elevated levels. MCU0-3

 Elsewhere, the market for refined zinc is expected to remain
in surplus near term, but constrained concentrate and scrap
supply against growing emerging market investment demand suggest
inventories will top out next year.

 Against this backdrop, rising demand for higher quality
steel in growth economies -- zinc is used for galvanising steel
-- is expected to improve zinc's fundamental picture in 2012.

 


 DOWNSIDE RISKS

 Aluminium price risk is skewed to the downside for early
2011 due to high stocks and excess capacity although prospects
improve for 2012, according to the Goldman Sachs note.

 "Higher trend aluminum demand and rising energy cost support
could deliver better price performance heading into 2012," it
said.

 Likewise, prospects for nickel see "significant" downside
risks in the year ahead as returning Vale (VALE5.SA) supply, new
project commissioning and ramp up, and slowing emerging market
consumption growth into mid-2011 push the market into a "sizable
surplus," it said.

 A year long strike at Vale Inco's Sudbury and Port Colborne
nickel operations ended in July. ID:nN08128896

 Vale's operations in Sudbury, together with its sister
operations in Voisey's Bay, account for roughly 10 percent of
global nickel supply.

 "However, we believe that the outlook for dramatically
rising consumption demand from emerging markets will keep
long-dated nickel prices well supported," the note said.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			BigLever Software Expands Adoption of Its Industry-Standard Product 
      Line Engineering Lifecycle Framework with Microsoft Integrations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BigLever Software&#8482;, the leading provider of systems and software product 
      line (SPL) engineering framework, tools and services, today announced 
      new integrations for further expanding adoption of the company&#8217;s 
      industry-standard Gears SPL Lifecycle Framework&#8482;. As a Microsoft 
      partner, BigLever is delivering off-the-shelf integration capabilities 
      for Microsoft&#8217;s Visual Studio and Office Suite products. These 
      enhancements will enable product line engineering teams in the Microsoft 
      development community to consolidate systems and software assets and 
      simplify processes across the entire development lifecycle &#8211; from 
      requirements to design, implementation, testing, delivery, maintenance 
      and evolution.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BigLever&#8217;s Gears SPL Engineering Tool and Lifecycle Framework enables 
      companies to manage their product line portfolio as a single, automated 
      production system &#8211; much like a manufacturing factory &#8211; that utilizes 
      product feature profiles to automatically assemble and configure the 
      assets needed to produce an entire product line. The Gears Framework 
      provides a common set of SPL concepts and constructs for all tools and 
      assets, which allows development processes to flow cleanly and 
      efficiently from one stage to another across the full lifecycle. With 
      this framework approach, engineering organizations can transition from 
      conventional product-centric practices to highly efficient product line 
      engineering. As a result, the business side of the organization can 
      leverage dramatic engineering improvements to successfully target and 
      hit new market windows, and ultimately, achieve greater profitability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Due to growing demand across a spectrum of industries, including 
      customers in the aerospace  defense and automotive sectors, BigLever 
      has expanded its integrations into the framework with the Visual 
      Studio/Gears Bridge&#8482;. The new Bridge solution enables Microsoft 
      developers to fully leverage Gears&#8217; innovative feature-based variation 
      management capabilities, directly from Visual Studio, to streamline and 
      automate the production of their product line portfolios. BigLever has 
      also incorporated new capabilities into the framework for supporting 
      Microsoft Word, with additional support planned for the remaining 
      products in the Office Suite.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Software-based product providers are increasingly seeing the powerful 
      capacity for feature variation that software technology brings. For 
      many, software innovation and variation is driving the breadth and reach 
      of their portfolio.&#160;Managing software variations in line with other 
      product variations &#8211; such as hardware, electronics, and so forth &#8211; 
      within the context of the wider product lifecycle management process is 
      vital for true product extensibility and marketability,&#8221; says Bola 
      Rotibi, Research Director, Creative Intellect Consulting Ltd. &#8220;What is 
      required is a platform for automating and managing the feature variation 
      process to allow for faster and more quality controlled delivery. Just 
      as essential is one that supports a framework that provides seamless 
      integration into the broad range of key stakeholder tools, such as those 
      that address the software development and delivery process. The 
      imperative for doing this is the possibility of an end-to-end governance 
      and management framework for the entire product line delivery process. 
      Only then can customers feel confident in gaining the level of 
      traceability and insight needed for controlled product change and 
      release management and future product adaptability and extensibility.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to provide new expanded product line engineering 
      capabilities for the Microsoft development community,&#8221; says Charles 
      Krueger, BigLever CEO. &#8220;As the industry-standard framework, Gears is 
      removing the barriers to SPL adoption. Our goal is to collaborate with 
      partners and third party tool vendors to provide coverage for all 
      development communities &#8211; and to meet the diverse engineering needs of 
      all of our customers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Gears SPL Lifecycle Framework is compatible with many of the 
      industry standards in programming languages and compilers, integrated 
      development environments, requirements management, change and 
      configuration management, build systems, quality management, model 
      driven development, word processors and documentation. BigLever also 
      provides enhanced off-the-shelf Bridge solutions that support seamless 
      product line engineering across each stage of the lifecycle. In addition 
      to the new Microsoft integrations, the company&#8217;s product offering 
      includes a broad range of Bridge solutions for development tools such as 
      IBM&#8217;s Rational toolset and Open Source tools, including Eclipse and 
      Subversion.

      eliminating the burden of costly IT overhead and maintenance. With an On 
      Demand model, we can quickly leverage new ERP features and functionality 
      while maintaining our low cost of ownership.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Access to affordable and scalable ERP solutions, like CDC's e-M-POWER 
      On Demand, is a key contributor to success when it comes to driving to a 
      more efficient business," says Dan Miklovic, Chief of Research for 
      Sustainable Collaborations Group, a Green and Clean Tech market research 
      firm. "On demand access is giving small to mid-sized firms access to ERP 
      capabilities previously only available to the largest enterprises. SaaS 
      also opens the door to better sustainability for any firm in China. 
      Business efficiency is key to small to medium-sized businesses in China 
      as they strive to become greener and operate in a sustainable way.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I am very proud to announce the availability of e-M-POWER On Demand for 
      our China customers,&#8221; said Peter Yip, CEO of CDC Software. &#8220;Just six 
      months ago, I participated at Microsoft&#8217;s press event with Steve Ballmer 
      in Delhi, India where I proclaimed our commitment to developing cloud 
      applications on Windows Azure. Now, we have delivered the first ERP 
      manufacturing SaaS solution utilizing Windows Azure for the China 
      market. Soon, we expect to deliver our cloud-based CDC Respond solution 
      on Windows Azure. These deliverables not only confirm our commitment to 
      Windows Azure, but the strength of our partnership with Microsoft. The 
      e-M-POWER On Demand solution further enhances our already strong SaaS 
      product portfolio, which we believe strengthens our position as a 
      provider of hybrid enterprise solutions offering customers on-premise 
      and cloud deployment options.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We also believe that by developing applications using Windows Azure and 
      leveraging our Agile development methodology, we will be able to launch 
      flexible, reliable and scalable cloud applications quickly to the 
      market, and e-M-POWER illustrates that,&#8221; said Hilton Law, managing 
      director, China for CDC Software. &#8220;By utilizing Azure, CDC Software has 
      the ability to develop SOA-based, multi-tenant architectures with the 
      tools we are already using, and deploy them to a&#160;robust platform with 
      staged production, failure-resilience, elastic scalability and 
      self-service provisioning. Our goal is to continue to provide 
      specialized enterprise solutions that directly address our customers&#8217; 
      unique strategic requirements, and at the same time, offer a full range 
      of deployment options, ranging from on premise to on demand and mixed 
      deployments, to suit their current and future needs.&#8221;

			ExxonMobil Congratulates Qatar for Reaching Milestone of 77 MTA LNG 
      Production Capacity
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil congratulated Qatar on becoming the world&#8217;s largest producer 
      of liquefied natural gas at a ceremony today marking the production 
      capacity milestone of 77 million tones per annum (MTA).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The event was celebrated in Ras Laffan Industrial City at a ceremony 
      under the patronage and in the presence of His Highness Sheikh Hamad Bin 
      Khalifa Al Thani, the Emir of the State of Qatar and His Excellency 
      Abdullah Bin Hamad Al Attiyah the Deputy Premier and Minister of Energy 
      and Industry. Also in attendance were Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and 
      chief executive officer of Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), 
      ministers, senior government officials and delegations from Qatar 
      Petroleum, Qatargas and RasGas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I would personally like to congratulate both His Highness the Emir and 
      His Excellency Minister Al Attiyah for this incredible achievement,&#8221; 
      said Tillerson. &#8220;Qatar&#8217;s visionary leadership and the remarkable story 
      of its natural gas development are truly an inspiration. We are honored 
      to be part of this major accomplishment.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil is a participant in 12 of Qatar&#8217;s 14 LNG projects, including 
      two Qatargas joint ventures (QG1 and QG2) and three RasGas joint 
      ventures (RL1, RL2 and RL3). ExxonMobil also helped develop the newest 
      classes of LNG carriers with the 210,000 cubic meter capacity Q-Flex 
      ships and the 265,000 cubic meter Q-Max vessels which carry LNG to 
      receiving terminals jointly developed by Qatar and ExxonMobil in the 
      United Kingdom, Italy and the United States, and to markets around the 
      globe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Combining the unique strengths of Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil in a 
      model partnership enabled the development of innovative solutions 
      resulting in the extremely successful LNG business Qatar has today.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ExxonMobil delivered advanced technologies, strong project execution and 
      economies of scale to reduce the cost of producing and transporting LNG, 
      thereby extending the ability of Qatar Petroleum, Qatargas and RasGas to 
      help meet energy requirements around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;ExxonMobil has had the privilege to participate in the State of Qatar 
      for decades, and we are very proud of the relationships we have 
      developed with its people,&#8221; said Alexander Dodds, president and general 
      manager of ExxonMobil Qatar Inc. &#8220;We understand that maximizing energy 
      development extends beyond oil and gas production. Developing people and 
      creating and delivering sustainable, long-term benefits for local 
      suppliers and communities are vital to success.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Qatar Petroleum and ExxonMobil have brought teamwork and technology 
      together through large-scale LNG joint venture projects that help 
      support the economic growth and well-being of Qatar while successfully 
      developing the capabilities of Qatari nationals, a key objective of the 
      State of Qatar. ExxonMobil has a proven record of job creation, 
      outstanding training and career development and support for local 
      industry. ExxonMobil does this through investment, employment, 
      assistance with education and training, the transfer of knowledge and 
      skills, and the purchase of goods and services.

&lt;p&gt;Dec 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs is scouting for an 
executive to manage its operations in Asia to succeed the 
region's incumbent Michael Evans, the Financial Times said.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Evans has also been the co-chairman of Goldman's business 
standards committee, which was formed in May when the bank was 
under pressure from U.S. regulators, FT said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evans, who has been the chairman of Goldman Sachs Asia 
since 2004, has been keen to remain in New York in a senior 
position, the paper said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein has not yet named 
Evans as a co-president, the paper said, citing people 
familiar with the matter.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Blankfein might grant Evans' request to stay in 
the United States. Both have discussed creating a job that 
could keep Evans, one of Goldman's three vice-chairmen, 
engaged in the bank's Asia businesses, the people told the 
paper.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman declined to comment on the FT report to Reuters.

 By Frank Tang

 NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan's (JPM.N) commodity
business was uncomfortably in the spotlight on both sides of
the Atlantic on Tuesday after reports that it had amassed a
larger long position in copper and was unwinding a big silver
short.

 The reports placed the bank in the public eye as U.S. and
European regulators are cracking down on commodity market
concentration to prevent volatile price spikes, prompting
debate about whether the positions reflect growing customer
business at a top-tier commodity bank or aggressive trading.

 JP Morgan is reducing a large position in U.S. silver
futures, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday, citing a
source familiar with the matter. Two months ago the bank and
HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) were sued by investors who accused
them of conspiring to drive down silver prices.

 And in Europe, data from the London Metal Exchange showed
that a single entity had increased its control over warehouse
copper stocks and cash contracts to more than 90 percent, up
from a 50-80 percent holding reported for the past several
weeks. [ID:nLDE6BD136]

 A spokesman for JPMorgan, which had been reported as
holding the 50-80 percent position, denied that it held over 90
percent of stock warrants, but declined comment on whether it
had a dominant position of less than that. [ID:nLDE6BD1U5]

 Traders said both holdings could be tied to the bank's
large customer and custodian business rather than traders
building a big position with the bank's own capital, but a
former regulator said the positions could raise eyebrows.

 "I don't know whether JPMorgan has done anything wrong, but
I would say this raises serious questions, and requires further
investigation. It's quite unusual," said Michael Greenberger,
law professor University of Maryland, former head of CFTC's
trading and markets division.

 "I suspect the CFTC's enforcement director may look into
this to determine whether there has been any manipulation, even
if there are no position limits to contend with," he said.

 Others said it was almost unthinkable that any bank would
risk regulators' ire so soon after the financial crisis, adding
that it was probably a combination of many positions, possibly
hedging on behalf of customers or physical inventories.

 "I find it very hard to believe that JPMorgan would run
afoul of authorities which would eventually find out if had
committed any malfeasance," said Dennis Gartman, publisher of
the Gartman Letter.

 JPMorgan stores metal on behalf of the world's largest
physically backed silver fund, the iShares Silver Trust (SLV).

 "It's like asking a grain elevator if it has any short
position in corn, when all it does is hedging against its long
position in its grain storage," Gartman said.

 A JPMorgan spokeswoman in New York declined immediate
comment when contacted by Reuters.

 The company's silver futures positions would be "materially
smaller" in the future, the FT reported the source as saying.

 U.S. silver futures barely moved on the news, with the
benchmark March silver contract SIH1 settled up 0.6 percent
at $29.788 an ounce on the COMEX division of NYMEX on Tuesday.

 TOP TIER

 JP Morgan's commodities business, led by Blythe Masters,
joined the top tier commodity traders Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and
Morgan Stanley (MS.N) this year with the acquisition of the
RBS-Sempra operation, a global commodities powerhouse.

 In October, JPMorgan and HSBC were hit with two lawsuits
accusing them of driving down silver prices from the first half
of 2008 by amassing huge silver shorts that are designed to
profit when prices fall. [ID:nN27259071]

 If they have been selling futures without an offsetting
hedge since 2008, the banks would have missed out on the
biggest silver rally since the Hunt Brothers attempted to
corner the market 30 years ago.

 Open interest in U.S. silver futures SIc1 has declined by
nearly 20 percent since November, while prices have surged to
30-year peaks, trends that market analysts say suggest that
short covering has helped fuel the gains. Prior to November,
however, open interest had risen, suggesting bullish longs.

 But the COMEX futures market is still relatively small
compared to global supply. Exchange data showed total turnover
equivalent to 540 million ounces, while global production is
about 900 million ounces; the oil market, by comparison, trades
8 times more than the global supply.

 "Just because they are all trading through JPMorgan doesn't
mean that the bank is the decision maker and has a controlling
position. It's different than proprietary trading," said
Jeffrey Williams, who wrote a book about the Hunt brothers
silver manipulation lawsuit and was called an expert witness in
that case.

 POSITION CONTROL

 The revelations come just two days before the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission is set to propose position
limits for U.S. swaps and futures contracts, rules that would
prohibit any single company from holding more than a pre-set
share of any given commodity derivative.

 But most commodity exchanges already have so-called
"accountability limits" that they use to prevent any trader
from accumulating an overly large position.

 A spokesman for the CME Group (CME.O), which owns the COMEX
market where U.S. silver futures are traded and sets and
enforces its own position limits, did not return requests for
comment.

 According to CME Group's NYMEX rule book, which also
regulates its COMEX metals division, the exchange set both its
all-month accountability as well as any one-month
accountability levels at 6,000 contracts, with the
expiration-month limit at 3,000 lots.

 Market participants, including commercial banks and trading
houses, rarely exceed exchange position limits because of the
cash margin requirements for large positions. Exchanges do not
reveal customer names when position limits are hit.

 Allegations of malfeasance in the relatively small, niche
silver market predate the latest drive to clamp down on
commodity markets and stem from persistent complaints from
smaller players that prices are under the sway of big banks.

 The CFTC began probing allegations of silver price
manipulation in September 2008, but the paper said in two
previous reviews of the silver market, the CFTC has dismissed
claims of manipulation.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 14 (Reuters) - Theo Lubke, the New York
Federal Reserve official who until September led the central
bank's efforts to reform the derivatives market will now help
Goldman Sachs (GS.N) implement the rules he helped craft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lubke's new title is chief regulatory reform officer in
Goldman's securities division, Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael
DuVally said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He will work closely with other executives to implement
regulatory reform legislation," DuVally said. Lubke started his
new job at the beginning of December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lubke, who had a 15-year career at the central bank, took
on the role of pushing for improved risk management in the OTC
derivatives markets in 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A large part of his job involved speaking regularly with
the largest derivatives dealers -- including Goldman -- and
their primary regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He was also a central figure in the Fed's handling of the
aftermath of Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lubke had moved to an internally focused role at the
central bank in September, as soon as he announced interest in
looking for work in the private sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The Federal Reserve and New York Fed have strict conflict
of interest policies for its staff, including departing
employees," a spokesperson for the New York Fed said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For six months after a senior official leaves the New York
Fed, he or she is prohibited from engaging in any business with
the New York Fed or contacting former colleagues about issues
related to the particular matter on which they worked.

      Fitch Downgrades JPMCC 2006-LDP7; Affirms Classes A-2 Through A-J
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded 10 classes of J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial 
      Mortgage Securities Corp., series 2006-LDP7 commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates, due to further deterioration of performance, 
      most of which involves increased losses on the specially serviced loans. 
      A detailed list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades reflect an increase in Fitch expected losses across the 
      pool. Fitch modeled losses of 7.30% of the remaining pool; expected 
      losses of the original pool are at 7.5%, including losses already 
      incurred to date. Fitch has designated 86 loans (30%) as Fitch Loans of 
      Concern, which includes 25 specially serviced loans (10.4%). Fitch 
      expects classes K through NR may be fully depleted from losses 
      associated with the specially serviced assets and class J will also be 
      affected.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the November 2010 distribution date, the pool's aggregate 
      principal balance has decreased by approximately 3.5% to $3.8 billion 
      from $3.9 billion at issuance. Interest shortfalls totaling $6.4 million 
      are affecting classes J through NR.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to loss is a specially serviced loan (1.3%) 
      secured by a 393,533 square foot (sf) office property located in 
      Atlanta, GA. The collateral consists of three buildings built in 1980 
      and renovated in 1997. The loan transferred to special servicing in June 
      2010 due to imminent default. Two of the top three tenants, Great West 
      occupying 102,693 sf (26% of GLA) and Xerox Corp. occupying 59,476 sf 
      (15% of the GLA) vacated at lease expiration. The property is 40% 
      occupied per the September 2010 rent roll. The special servicer is 
      proceeding with foreclosure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to loss is a specially serviced loan 
      (1.4%) secured by a 552,927 sf office property located in Shoreview, MN, 
      approximately 12 miles north of the Minneapolis CBD. The collateral 
      consists of five buildings built in 1973 and most recently renovated in 
      2005. The loan was transferred to special servicing in October 2009 due 
      to imminent default. The largest tenant, occupying 41% of the net 
      rentable area (NRA), vacated at lease expiration. The property is 58% 
      occupied per the September 2010 rent roll. The special servicer is 
      working towards a deed in lieu of foreclosure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to loss (5%) is a 663,923 sf retail center 
      located in Huntington Beach, CA. The property underwent a major 
      redevelopment in 2004, which transformed the property from an indoor 
      mall to an open-air lifestyle center. Major tenants include Burlington 
      Coat Factory (19.2% of NRA) and Kohl's (12.6% of NRA). There is limited 
      near term roll during 2010-2011. As of the September 2010 rent roll, the 
      property was 86.7% occupied, compared to 93.3% at issuance. The decline 
      in occupancy is a result of tenant vacancies which included the loss of 
      Circuit City which vacated in 2009. The vacant Circuit City space was 
      recently leased in September 2010 to Whole Foods Market with lease 
      expiration in 2030. As of year-end (YE) 2009 the reported debt service 
      coverage ratio (DSCR) was 1.53 times (x).
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch downgrades, revises Outlooks and assigns Recovery ratings as 
      follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;

      -- $170.2 million class A-SB at 'AAA/LS2'; Outlook Stable.

      -- $310.3 million class A-J at 'A/LS4' Outlook Stable;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      -- $14.8 million class D at 'BB/LS5'; Outlook Negative.

      Class A-1 has paid in full. Fitch does not rate classes N, O, P, and NR.

&lt;p&gt;  CINCINNATI, OH, Dec 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Software and services provider Cincom Systems, an IBM Premier Business
Partner, announces that Cincom Synchrony(R), its customer experience
management solution for contact centers, has been recognized with IBM's
Banking Industry Framework validation.

    IBM's Banking Industry Framework is designed to simplify the
modernization, management and monitoring of financial technology systems,
while lowering risk by avoiding the disruptive business consequences that
have characterized these activities in the past. IBM's Banking Industry
Framework gives banks an alternative to the high-risk, rip-and-replace
approach. One of the core areas addressed by the IBM Banking Industry
Framework is customer care and insight to help banks build a foundation
for creating a single view of the customer and enabling more effective
and efficient sales and service.

    Synchrony recently helped Absa Bank in South Africa improve loan
processing efficiency by over 30% and reduced training by 50%. It
provides a single, customer-centric front-end that is supporting the
bank's "ONE Absa" objective where silos are removed and it operates as
one business in the interest of its customer. Synchrony also standardized
workflows and processes to create a paperless environment. The obstacles
that Absa Bank overcame are similar to those in many other financial
institutions.

    "Many banks suffer from 'siloed' or isolated customer offerings, customer
data and communication channels which results in inefficiencies and poor
customer experiences," says Randy Saunders, program director, Cincom
Synchrony Customer Experience Management. "Most banks also do not have
the resources to assist customer-facing employees to resolve issues
quickly and deliver the best offers and recommendations. Cincom Synchrony
provides a single, integrated view of customers, across departments,
business lines and communication channels. It helps guide employees to
the best outcomes. Receiving IBM framework validation further complements
the success financial institutions can attain with Synchrony."

    Some of the nation's biggest banks announced they would raise their
dividends, pending federal approval, while others intend to raise
dividends next year. Many of the major banks slashed or suspended their
dividends in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis and are now eager to
increase payouts. Microsoft could demo a host of new tablets at the
upcoming Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January. Sirius XM
Radio began the year as a hot stock, more than doubling in price in under
three months. It appears, with a rash of good news to end the year, the
stock just may go out the way it came in. Sprint Nextel Corporation
announced that Clearwire Corporation, Sprint and the other parties to the
Clearwire Equityholders' Agreement amended that agreement to permit,
among other things, that Sprint may, at any time, unilaterally surrender
voting securities to reduce its voting security percentage below 50
percent.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JPMorgan said it does not hold more than 90 percent of copper stock warrants in London Metal Exchange warehouses, but declined on Tuesday to comment on whether it had a smaller position.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A single holder, recently controlling 50-80 percent of copper stocks and cash contracts in London Metal Exchange warehouses, appears to have raised the position to above 90 percent, latest data from the world's biggest metals market showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industrial metals markets have since mid-November been watching the dominant position, the holder of which the LME has not identified, and which gives holders access to the metal used in power and construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traders and analysts said the position was unlikely to be sustained and that it was probably a combination of many positions -- including client holdings and positions held by proprietary traders -- within a company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such positions that are built up often disappear just as quickly as they appear, they said. JPMorgan (JPM.N) has been cited as the dominant holder of the copper warrants. JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan is the name that's been bandied around, but there is nothing going on ... to show it's a problem," said one LME floor trader. "It's just a position -- there's nothing sinister about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some say it is one of the reasons why copper hit a record high of $9,267.50 a tone on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for JPMorgan, asked by Reuters to comment on the market talk, said the company did not hold more than 90 percent but declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that JPMorgan had reduced a large position in U.S. silver futures. The company's silver futures positions would be "materially smaller" in the future, the FT reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large holdings of LME stocks can occur unintentionally and are not unusual for large companies with many divisions and clients that delve into metals markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At present one company holds dominant positions of between 50-80 percent in both nickel and zinc cash contracts and stock warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The LME has the power to step in and force such long position holders or "longs" to make metal available to other market players by imposing its lending guidelines, which are aimed at ensuring orderly markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under these guidelines, if an LME member or client holds 50 percent or more of the warrants or cash today/cash positions, it should be prepared to lend at a premium that is no more than half a percent of the cash price for a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the LME futures market, which is one of the few remaining open outcry exchanges, declined to comment on the copper position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I suspect it could all turn out to be a bit of a storm in a tea-cup," said Gayle Berry, analyst at Barclays Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;COPPER TIGHTNESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Falling ore grades, disruptions and project delays also mean that copper supply will, possibly starting this year, fall short of demand estimated at about 19 million tones this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Highlighting such tightness, since February, LME copper stockpiles have dropped by more than one third to 350,900 tones, from six-and-a-half year highs of 555,075 tones in February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you have inventories that continue to be drawn down, then you're going to have a concentration as a function of that," Berry at Barclays said of the copper dominant position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Then throw into the mix the potential for warrant buying for the exchange traded funds, that's what is all adding to this," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, ETF Securities' physically backed copper, tin and nickel exchange-traded products (ETPs) made a tentative debut in London, as investors sought to gauge sentiment ahead of potentially larger offerings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank said in October ETPs backed by copper could hold 300,000 to 400,000 tones of metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns that ETPs will exacerbate tight supplies of copper helped propel prices higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worries over copper supply tightness has also pushed the premium for cash copper over the three-month contract to about $70, the steepest since October 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In August, a tight aluminum market caused the premium for cash material to rise, and the year before, the scale of large long positions in the LME tin market caused market concern.

 By Frank Tang

 NEW YORK, Dec 14 (Reuters) - JPMorgan's (JPM.N) commodity
business was uncomfortably in the spotlight on both sides of
the Atlantic on Tuesday amid reports it had amassed a large
copper long position and was unwinding a big silver short.

 While analysts and traders have said both positions could
be tied to the bank's large customer trading business rather
than any proprietary strategy, the reports have placed the bank
in the public eye at a time when U.S. and European regulators
are cracking down on commodity market concentration.

 The bank, which joined Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan
Stanley (MS.N) at the top tier among commodity traders with the
acquisition of the RBS-Sempra operations earlier this year, is
reducing a large position in U.S. silver futures, the Financial
Times reported on Tuesday, citing a source familiar with the
matter.

 In Europe, data from the London Metal Exchange showed that
a single entity had increased its control over warehouse copper
stocks and cash contracts to more than 90 percent, up from a
50-80 percent holding reported for the past several weeks.

 A spokesman for JP Morgan, which had been reported as
holding the 50-80 percent position, denied that it held over 90
percent of stock warrants, but declined comment on whether it
had a dominant position of less than that. [ID:nLDE6BD1U5]

 A JPMorgan spokeswoman in New York declined immediate
comment when contacted by Reuters.

 The company's silver futures positions would be "materially
smaller" in the future, the FT reported the source as saying.

 In October, JPMorgan and HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L) were
hit with two lawsuits in late October by investors who accused
them of conspiring to drive down silver prices, and reaping an
estimated hundreds of millions of dollars in profit.
[ID:nN27259071]

 Open interest in U.S. silver futures SIc1 has declined by
nearly 20 percent since November, while prices have surged to
30-year peaks, trends that market analysts say suggest that
short covering has helped fuel the gains. Prior to November,
however, open interest had risen, suggesting bullish longs.

 JP Morgan and HSBC were accused in the lawsuit of
manipulating the market for COMEX silver futures and options
contracts from the first half of 2008 by amassing huge short
positions in silver futures contracts that are designed to
profit when prices fall.

 If they have been selling futures without an offsetting
hedge since 2008, the banks would have missed out on the
biggest silver rally since the Hunt Brothers attempted to
corner the market 30 years ago.

 Recently, prices have surged three-fold, topping $30 an
ounce last week, strongly outperforming gold in the past few
months.

 POSITION CONTROL

 On the LME, traders and analysts say the so-called dominant
position -- which is not unusual in LME metals -- was unlikely
to be sustained and that it was probably a combination of many
positions, including client holdings and positions held by
proprietary traders. [ID:nLDE6B51X4]

 The revelations come just two days before the U.S.
Commodity Futures Trading Commission is set to propose position
limits for U.S. swaps and futures contracts, rules that would
prohibit any single company from holding more than a pre-set
share of any given commodity derivative.

 But most commodity exchanges already have so-called
"accountability limits" that they use to prevent any trader
from accumulating an overly large position.

 A spokesman for the CME Group (CME.O), which owns the COMEX
market where U.S. silver futures are traded and sets and
enforces its own position limits, did not immediately return
requests for comment.

 According to CME Group's NYMEX rulebook, which also
regulates its COMEX metals division, the exchange set both its
all-month accountability as well as any one-month
accountability levels at 6,000 contracts, with the
expiration-month limit at 3,000 lots.

 CME NYMEX rulebook:
here#page=61

 Normally, market participants, including commercial banks
and trading houses, rarely exceed exchange position limits
because of the cash margin requirements for large positions.
Exchanges do not reveal customer names when position limits are
hit.

 Allegations of malfeasance in the relatively small, niche
silver market predate the latest drive to clamp down on
commodity markets and stem from persistent complaints from
smaller players that prices are under the sway of big banks.

 The CFTC began probing allegations of silver price
manipulation in September 2008, but the paper said in two
previous reviews of the silver market, the CFTC has dismissed
claims of manipulation.

 U.S. silver futures barely moved on the news, with the
benchmark March silver contract SIH1 off 0.3 percent at
$29.50 an ounce on the COMEX division of NYMEX on Tuesday.

 Federal regulators and aggrieved investors face an uphill
battle to prove allegations that two of the biggest silver
trading firms are manipulating the market, if history is any
guide.

 The lawsuits highlighted the challenges faced by the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which has put fighting
price manipulation and fraud high on its agenda for reforming
financial markets. [ID:nN01210936]

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Updates to add detail/comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Michael Taylor and Pratima Desai&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Dec 14 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank JPMorgan
said it does not hold more than 90 percent of copper stock
warrants in London Metal Exchange warehouses, but declined on
Tuesday to comment on whether it had a smaller position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A single holder, recently controlling 50-80 percent of
copper stocks and cash contracts in London Metal Exchange
warehouses, appears to have raised the position to above 90
percent, latest data from the world's biggest metals market
showed. LME/WC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Industrial metals markets have since mid-November been
watching the dominant position, the holder of which the LME has
not identified, and which gives holders access to the metal used
in power and construction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders and analysts said the position was unlikely to be
sustained and that it was probably a combination of many
positions -- including client holdings and positions held by
proprietary traders -- within a company. [ID:nLDE6B51X4]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such positions that are built up often disappear just as
quickly as they appear, they said. JPMorgan (JPM.N) has been
cited as the dominant holder of the copper warrants.
[ID:nL3E6N601B]. JPMorgan declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan is the name that's been bandied around, but there
is nothing going on ... to show it's a problem," said one LME
floor trader. "It's just a position -- there's nothing sinister
about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, some say it is one of the reasons why copper
CMCU3 hit a record high of $9,267.50 a tonne on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  A spokesman for JPMorgan, asked by Reuters to comment on
the market talk, said the company did not hold more than 90
percent but declined to comment further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Also on Tuesday, the Financial Times reported that JPMorgan
had reduced a large position in U.S. silver futures. The
company's silver futures positions would be "materially smaller"
in the future, the FT reported. [ID:nL3E6NE03P]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Large holdings of LME stocks can occur unintentionally and
are not unusual for large companies with many divisions and
clients that delve into metals markets. [ID:nLDE6B51X4]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At present one company holds dominant positions of between
50-80 percent in both nickel and zinc cash contracts and stock
warrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The LME has the power to step in and force such long
position holders or "longs" to make metal available to other
market players by imposing its lending guidelines, which are
aimed at ensuring orderly markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under these guidelines, if an LME member or client holds 50
percent or more of the warrants or cash today/cash positions, it
should be prepared to lend at a premium that is no more than
half a percent of the cash price for a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for the LME futures market, which is one of the
few remaining open outcry exchanges, declined to comment on the
copper position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I suspect it could all turn out to be a bit of a storm in a
tea-cup," said Gayle Berry, analyst at Barclays Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COPPER TIGHTNESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Falling ore grades, disruptions and project delays also mean
that copper supply will, possibly starting this year, fall short
of demand estimated at about 19 million tonnes this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Highlighting such tightness, since February, LME copper
stockpiles have dropped by more than one third to 350,900
tonnes, from six-and-a-half year highs of 555,075 tonnes in
February. 0#LME-STOCKS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If you have inventories that continue to be drawn down,
then you're going to have a concentration as a function of
that," Berry at Barclays said of the copper dominant position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Then throw into the mix the potential for warrant buying
for the exchange traded funds, that's what is all adding to
this," she added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, ETF Securities' physically backed copper, tin and
nickel exchange-traded products (ETPs) made a tentative debut in
London, as investors sought to gauge sentiment ahead of
potentially larger offerings. [ID:nLDE6B90D6] [ID:nLDE68J0R6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank said in October ETPs backed by copper could
hold 300,000 to 400,000 tonnes of metal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Concerns that ETPs will exacerbate tight supplies of copper
helped propel prices higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Worries over copper supply tightness has also pushed the
premium for cash copper over the three-month contract MCU0-3
to about $70, the steepest since October 2008. [ID:nLDE6AP1YU]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In August, a tight aluminium market caused the premium for
cash material to rise, and the year before, the scale of large
long positions in the LME tin market caused market concern.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON Dec 14 (Reuters) - The Sierra Club and Environment
Texas filed a federal lawsuit against Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N)
for five years of excess pollution at the nation's largest
refinery, the Sierra Club said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit alleges Exxon's refinery and chemical plant in
Baytown, Texas, committed over 2,500 violation of the U.S.
Clean Air Act between 2005 and 2010 and released over 8 million
lbs of pollutants into the atmosphere, said Neil Carman, clean
air director of the Sierra Club's Texas chapter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; If successful, the lawsuit could cost Exxon $81.25 million
in fines, Carman said.

      Location-Based Services During Holiday Shopping Season
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE: V), the world&#8217;s largest retail electronic payments 
      network1, today announced it is making shopping easier and 
      more convenient for budget-conscious consumers by offering the Visa 
      Mobile application for the iPhone. Through a simple tap of the finger 
      Visa account holders now have access to more than 50 unique merchant 
      offers ranging from clothing and dining to entertainment. The Visa 
      Mobile application is now available as a free download from the iTunes 
      app store.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa is working with a select list of popular merchants to deliver 
      exclusive offers to Visa account holders, helping them save money on 
      every-day purchases. More than 50 merchants including some of the most 
      popular retailers in the U.S. such as 24 Hour Fitness, Jos. A. Bank, 
      Meineke, New York  Company, and Zales are providing discounts through 
      the Visa Mobile application, helping them reach more consumers with 
      targeted offers. Offers are automatically delivered and stored in the 
      application, can be tailored to consumers&#8217; life styles and preferences, 
      and can be redeemed either online or at physical retail locations. The 
      application uses location-based technology to provide consumers with a 
      map and directions to a nearby retailer where they can redeem merchant 
      offers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Merchants are looking for new and more efficient ways to reach 
      customers, while budget-conscious consumers expect a more rewarding and 
      convenient shopping experience,&#8221; said Bill Gajda, Head of Mobile at Visa 
      Inc. &#8220;The Visa Mobile application meets the needs of both merchants and 
      consumer and brings one of the most trusted brands in payments to the 
      iPhone.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa is working closely with handset manufacturers, mobile network 
      operators and technology providers around the globe to bring the 
      reliability, scalability and trust of Visa payments to the mobile 
      channel. The Visa Mobile application for the iPhone was developed in 
      partnership with Monitise plc, a UK business which is a global-leading 
      mobile banking and payments platform. Visa signed a global alliance with 
      Monitise in June 2009 to custom-develop mobile services for Visa across 
      a spectrum of handsets to ensure Visa account holders have a consistent, 
      user-friendly, and secure mobile payment experience.

increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details

			Mimecast Makes Breazeale, Sachse  Wilson LLP&#8217;s Email Management 
      System Stronger than a Hurricane
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Cloud-based Unified Email Management Solution Protects Law Firm&#8217;s 
      Gulf Coast Offices from Downtime Caused by Hurricanes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mimecast&#174;, 
      a leading supplier of cloud-based email security, 
      continuity, 
      policy control and archiving, 
      today announced that it partnered with Breazeale, Sachse  Wilson LLP&#8217;s 
      (BSW), a prominent corporate defense law firm, to secure its business 
      email operations and safeguard against downtime. With three offices 
      located deep within a hurricane zone, Baton Rouge, Covington and New 
      Orleans, the law firm needed to ensure it could provide services to its 
      clients at all times &#8211; even in the event of a major storm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The fact of the matter is if your company&#8217;s communications 
      infrastructure is down and you can&#8217;t communicate with your clients for 
      48 hours or longer, there is a good chance you will not come back online 
      ever again,&#8221; said BSW IT Manager Luke Corley. &#8220;Compound the dangers of 
      major hurricanes through the Gulf Coast with the fast-paced nature of a 
      law firm, and it is fair to say that downtime of any sort simply is not 
      an option for us.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hurricanes are a reality and a way of life in Louisiana. Hurricane 
      Gustav most recently ripped through the area and inflicted millions of 
      dollars worth of damage. BSW experienced the damaging effects of a major 
      storm when Hurricane Katrina devastated New Orleans in 2005. The New 
      Orleans office sustained heavy damage and the IT team had to remove the 
      on-premise email solutions to ensure the law firm&#8217;s 160 users were able 
      to get back up and running again. This event was a wake-up call to BSW 
      and served as a motivating factor for the firm&#8217;s inquiry into cloud 
      computing solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Advances in cloud computing have made on-premise appliances a thing of 
      the past,&#8221; said Corley. &#8220;If a hurricane strikes, BSW operations will 
      remain unaltered because they are not tied to on-premise applications. 
      Clients can reach us and employees can log onto Web portals to send 
      email and uphold our high level of client service. Mimecast had 
      everything we needed to keep our corporate email up and running and even 
      provided us with additional functionality we did not have such as 
      enhanced eDiscovery, archiving, anti-spam, anti-virus, litigation hold 
      and message retention.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Before signing with Mimecast, BSW leveraged a host of on-premise 
      solutions that were expensive to maintain and involved time-consuming 
      administrative tasks. After an appliance failure, the law firm sought 
      out Mimecast&#8217;s cost-effective and easy-to-use Software-as-a-Service 
      solution because it guaranteed continuous uptime and housed the 
      functionality needed to enhance user productivity while meeting 
      legislative and regulatory compliance. Mimecast integrates seamlessly 
      with the organization&#8217;s existing Microsoft Exchange systems, is highly 
      scalable and enables quick search and retrieval of information &#8211; a major 
      benefit in the extensively data-driven field of corporate defense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Lost in the hype of cost-cutting is the cloud&#8217;s innate ability to act 
      as a business continuity solution,&#8221; said Mary Kay Roberto, Mimecast&#8217;s 
      Executive Vice President and General Manager. &#8220;Email downtime of any 
      duration can trigger ill effects in today&#8217;s business world. Companies 
      located in regions that experience extreme weather can benefit from not 
      having to rely on on-premise solutions that are susceptible to 
      conditions that put data out of the reach of employees.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

			nFinanSe Launches $3 Visa&#174; Reloadable Prepaid Debit Cards at Dollar 
      General
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      nFinanSe (OTCBB: NFSE)(www.nFinanSe.com), 
      a leading provider of prepaid cards, today announced that it had 
      launched its industry leading Visa&#174; Reloadable Prepaid Debit Cards at 
      approximately 9,000 Dollar General stores nationwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8221;Dollar General is one of the country&#8217;s largest and most recognized 
      retailers and we are very excited to be adding our $3 Visa Reloadable 
      Prepaid Debit Card to their stores,&#8221; stated Jerry R. Welch, Chairman and 
      CEO of nFinanSe. &#8220;Given that our cards were recently highlighted for the 
      lowest fees by the Consumers Union, the non-profit publisher of Consumer 
      Reports, we believe the nFinanSe Prepaid Visa Card will be very 
      attractive to Dollar General customers.&#8221;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Consumers can purchase the nFinanSe Visa Reloadable Prepaid Debit Card 
      for only $3 and conveniently load additional funds at Dollar General 
      locations for only $2.95. Of the 19 card issuers mentioned in the 
      Consumers Union 2010 Report on the prepaid industry, nFinanSe was noted 
      for the lowest card sales price of $3 along with Walmart&#174; and singled 
      out for the lowest monthly maintenance fee of $2.95 and lowest ATM 
      withdrawal fee of $0.99.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The nFinanSe Reloadable Prepaid Visa&#174; Card features what the Company 
      believes to be the best overall pricing in the marketplace at this time. 
      In addition to its consumer-friendly low prices of $3 to purchase a 
      card, $2.95 to reload and a $2.95 monthly maintenance fee for unlimited 
      purchases, nFinanSe also offers FREE direct deposit of payroll, FREE 
      24/7/365 live agent customer service in English and Spanish and FREE 
      cell phone text message alerts with purchase and balance information 
      after each transaction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Visa&#174; Reloadable Prepaid Debit Card is issued by Palm Desert 
      National Bank pursuant to a license from Visa U.S.A., Inc. nFinanSe is a 
      registered ISO of Palm Desert National Bank. All cards funds are insured 
      by the FDIC in accordance with the FDIC's applicable terms and

			CDC Software&#8217;s CDC Factory Solution Improves Plant Productivity at 
      the Second Largest Coca-Cola Bottler in North America
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Newly Implemented CDC Factory Helps Coca-Cola Bottling Co. 
      Consolidated Initially Raise Total OEE by Two Percent at One of the 
      Company&#8217;s Five Plants
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CDC Software Corporation (NASDAQ: CDCS), a hybrid enterprise software 
      provider of on-premise and cloud deployments, announced today, that 
      Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated, the second largest Coca-Cola 
      bottler in the U.S., has already seen an initial two percent improvement 
      in Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) within five months of 
      implementing CDC Factory, a manufacturing operations management (MOM) 
      solution, at their facility in Roanoke, VA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Headquartered in Charlotte, N.C., Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated is 
      a leader in manufacturing, selling, and distributing carbonated and 
      noncarbonated beverages, including soft drinks, water, teas, juices, and 
      energy drinks. With the completion of the implementation in Roanoke, 
      Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated now plans to implement CDC Factory 
      at its four other production facilities located in Charlotte, N.C., 
      Nashville, Tenn., Mobile, Ala., and Bishopville, S.C.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The implementation of CDC Factory in the Roanoke plant utilized CDC 
      Software&#8217;s change management methodology, which has helped Coca-Cola 
      Bottling Co. Consolidated raise OEE levels. As Coca-Cola continues to 
      offer a widening product portfolio, Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated 
      is faced with increasingly complex manufacturing challenges, such as 
      maintaining numerous stock keeping units (SKUs) and the related 
      changeovers. CDC factory has helped to address these challenges and 
      improve operating efficiencies across all their production lines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated Supply Chain team had previous 
      experiences with lengthy design-and- build projects, so they 
      particularly liked CDC Factory&#8217;s packaged software functionality and its 
      rapid implementation capabilities. The CDC Software consultants 
      initially performed the Factory Profit Audit, a CDC Factory benchmark 
      study, which provided the Coca-Cola Consolidated team with a clear and 
      focused project scope that was cost-effective, pragmatic and identified 
      actionable recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We especially liked how CDC Factory drives action on the manufacturing 
      floor where our employees take ownership of performance and 
      improvement,&#8221; said Steve Westphal, executive vice president, Operations 
      and Systems of Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated. &#8220;With CDC Factory&#8217;s 
      capabilities of real-time plant intelligence, coupled with a change 
      program embedded in the deployment activities, I&#8217;m delighted we have 
      delivered a 2 percent efficiency improvement in 5 months.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delighted that the second largest Coca-Cola bottler has 
      delivered such strong results with CDC Factory,&#8221; said Mark Sutcliffe, 
      president of CDC Factory product line, CDC Software. &#8220;A two percent 
      improvement at the Coca-Cola bottler&#8217;s plant represents significant 
      productivity gains. We believe CDC Factory will continue to help address 
      the key challenges for Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated by helping 
      them deliver rapid performance improvements throughout their plants.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CDC Factory is a packaged manufacturing operations management system 
      that transforms manufacturing performance by empowering people to make 
      real-time actionable decisions. It combines shop floor data capture, 
      paperless quality management, packaged metrics like Overall Equipment 
      Effectiveness (OEE), manufacturing analytics and executive scorecards. 
      Pre-built continuous Improvement capabilities combined with an 
      implementation model focused on business transformation means 
      organizations can be delivering improvement results rapidly from project 
      commencement.

		&lt;p&gt;
      CDC Factory is a packaged manufacturing operations management system 
      that transforms manufacturing performance by empowering people to make 
      real-time actionable decisions. CDC Factory is a platform that is used 
      to standardize improved daily work control practices and formalize the 
      continuous improvement initiatives already in place. CDC Factory 
      integrates the functionality of shop floor data capture, packaged 
      metrics like Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE), analytics and 
      scorecards, continuous improvement capabilities and paperless quality 
      management. The technology is combined with a proven change method that 
      focuses on developing a structure of daily performance reviews to drive 
      better performance every run, every shift, every day. The process 
      develops operator skills so they are able to drive their own 
      improvements and is deployed typically in less than six weeks per 
      factory. For more information, visit: www.cdcfactory.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK Dec 15 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) Group Inc
Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein and his top executives
will get about $111.3 million in stock next month in a delayed
payoff from 2009 and their record-setting 2007 bonuses,
Bloomberg reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; While many on Wall Street prepare for lower bonuses,
Blankfein is set to get about $24.3 million in January, based
on the Dec. 14 closing share price, and President Gary D. Cohn
will get about $24 million, the news agency said, citing
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These payouts, a portion of the $67.9 million bonus awarded
to Blankfein for 2007 and the $66.9 million paid to Cohn,
reflect a 24 percent drop in the stock's value since it was
granted at $218.86.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators have encouraged banks to pay senior employees
with deferred stock and recoup payouts if trading strategies
backfire. Blankfein and Cohn, who got $27 million and $26.6
million, respectively, in cash for 2007, didn't get any bonuses
for 2008 and only restricted stock for 2009, Bloomberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has so far paid $13.1 billion in compensation
through the first nine months of 2010, compared with $16.1
million in the same period last year, according to the
company's third-quarter report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of the $111.3 million in restricted stock awards to be
doled out in January, $94.9 million was from 2007 grants,
Bloomberg said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A company spokesman declined to comment to Reuters about
the report.

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Dec 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Canadian Independent Petroleum Marketing Association (CIPMA) applauds
the significant announcement this morning by Canada's Competition Bureau. 

    http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/eic/site/cb-bc.nsf/eng/03325.html 

    The Bureau has filed an application with the Competition Tribunal to
strike down restrictive and anti-competitive rules imposed on merchants
who accept Visa and MasterCard credit cards. 

    The Bureau argues that anti-competitive restraints on merchants increase
consumer prices. Canada has some of the highest merchant acceptance fees
in the world.

    CIPMA has taken an active role with the Competition Bureau in bringing
evidence of anti-competitive behavior forward. CIPMA has been working
with other retail trade associations to bring the issue of increasing and
unfair credit card merchant fees to the attention of Ottawa policy
makers. 

    Independent fuel marketers and independently operated gasoline stations
are particularly vulnerable to increasing credit card fees due to the
high variability in fuel prices. Independent fuel marketers' profits drop
when gas prices rise- because of higher credit card costs.

&lt;p&gt; * Will try to knock down "anti-competitive rules"&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Visa, MasterCard run largest credit card networks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Canadians pay C$5 bln/year in hidden fees-bureau&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds response from the companies, details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Cameron French&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TORONTO, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Canada's Competition Bureau
wants to force Visa and MasterCard to change "restrictive and
anti-competitive" credit-card rules that raise costs for both
merchants and consumers, the agency said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The credit-card providers effectively eliminate competition
between themselves by imposing rules that prohibit merchants
from encouraging consumers to consider lower-cost payment
options such as cash or debit, or prevent retailers from
applying surcharges to purchases on a high-cost card, the
bureau said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa and MasterCard have disputed the bureau's criticism,
saying that their policies promote choice and protect consumers
from being victimized by retailers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bureau said it has filed an application with Canada's
Competition Tribunal, an adjudicative body separate from the
federal government, to strike down the rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move follows a similar crackdown by the U.S. government
in October and a Canadian investigation last year that was
spurred by complaints from merchants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Without changes to the rules, merchants will continue to
face high costs for credit card acceptance, while consumers,
even those who use lower-cost methods of payment like debit or
cash, will continue to pay higher prices," Melanie Aitken,
commissioner of competition, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canadians pay an estimated C$5 billion ($5 billion)
annually in hidden credit card fees and made over C$240 billion
in credit card purchases in 2009 using Visa and MasterCard
cards, the bureau said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merchants must pay a fee ranging from 1.5 to 3 percent on
card purchases, compared with the processing fee of about 12
Canadian cents for an Interac debit transaction, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By preventing merchants from adding the fee to the cost of
an item, they are forced to embed it in the base cost, and thus
penalize cash and Interac buyers, the bureau alleges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa Inc (V.N) and MasterCard Inc (MA.N) operate the two
biggest credit card networks in Canada. Their cards are
distributed mainly through banks and credit unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In separate statements, they defended their surcharge
policy, saying it protected consumers from extra fees imposed
by retailers. They also said their policies do not preclude
retails from offering incentive to customers to use other
payment options.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If the bureau is successful, consumers will be harmed, the
flow of commerce will be slowed and an unlevel playing field
created," Visa said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two merchant groups -- the Canadian Federation of
Independent Business and the Canadian Restaurant and
Foodservices Association -- both issued statements supporting
the Competition Bureau's move.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a consumer group, the Consumers Association of Canada,
said the move would expose consumers to "potentially predatory
practices by merchants."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In October, the U.S. Justice Department sued American
Express Co (AXP.N), Visa and MasterCard, accusing them of
violating antitrust laws. Visa and MasterCard settled agreeing
to allow merchants to offer discounts to Consumers who use less
expensive types of credit or debit cards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=$1.00 Canadian)

&lt;p&gt;Google has launched an installer for companies that automatically loads the Chrome web browser on all of a server&#8217;s managed users and includes a suite of security and privacy options for administrators &#8212; an area long dominated by Microsoft&#8217;s Internet Explorer.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The enterprise deployment package is yet another salvo in the quasi-rivalry that has emerged between Google and Microsoft. Lots of enterprises already use Internet Explorer, the primary web browser included with Microsoft&#8217;s Windows operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The show has been quite fun to watch. Microsoft took its chance to jump in bed with Facebook by adding office document support after Google and Facebook began sparring over contact uploads. Microsoft also recently jumped on the bandwagon that is condemning Google for its acquisition of flight-data provider ITA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also shouldn&#8217;t come as much of a surprise that this launch comes hot on the heels of the official launch of Google&#8217;s portable operating system, Chrome OS. It seems Google is hoping the new installer might spur adoption of the Chrome operating system in the enterprise &#8212; the search giant said part of the reasoning behind the launch was to help businesses test &#8220;mission-critical web applications.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Along with allowing companies to to install the browser on multiple accounts, Google is including a set of tools that let administrators manage privacy settings and security. Google also has a plug-in for Internet Explorer that essentially turns it into a Chrome browser but reverts back to Internet Explorer rendering for applications that are too old and aren&#8217;t supported by Chrome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google&#8217;s Chrome Internet browser is already pretty popular with the consumer sector. It has around 120 million users, up 200 percent from a year ago when it had only 40 million users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Tags: chrome, enterprise, internet browsing, Internet Explorer, web browsing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Companies: Google, Microsoft&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, ONTARIO, Dec 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Competition Bureau announced today that it has filed an application
with the Competition Tribunal, to strike down restrictive and
anti-competitive rules that Visa and MasterCard impose on merchants who
accept their credit cards.

    The Commissioner of Competition alleges that these rules have effectively
eliminated competition between Visa and MasterCard for merchants'
acceptance of their credit cards, resulting in increased costs to
businesses and, ultimately, consumers. Merchants in Canada pay an
estimated $5 billion annually in hidden credit card fees. 

    The anti-competitive restraints on merchants result in higher prices for
all consumers, whether they pay by cash, cheque, debit or credit, because
merchants pass along some or all of the high costs they are forced to pay
as a result of Visa's and MasterCard's anti-competitive rules. 

    "Visa and MasterCard's anti-competitive behaviour hurts businesses and
consumers alike," said Melanie Aitken, Commissioner of Competition. "It
is particularly harmful for small and medium sized businesses, key
engines for economic growth in Canada. Without changes to the rules,
merchants will continue to face high costs for credit card acceptance,
while consumers, even those who use lower-cost methods of payment like
debit or cash, will continue to pay higher prices."

    Visa and MasterCard operate the two largest credit card networks in
Canada. Together they processed more than 90 percent of all credit card
transactions by Canadian consumers in 2009, representing over $240
billion in purchases. 

    The rules challenged by the Bureau prohibit merchants from encouraging
consumers to consider lower cost payment options like cash or debit, and
prohibit merchants from applying a surcharge to a purchase on a high cost
card. Further, once a merchant agrees to accept one of Visa or
MasterCard's credit cards, that merchant must accept all credit cards
offered by that company, including cards that impose significant costs on
merchants, such as premium cards. 

    Canada has among the highest credit card fees in the world. Many
countries have taken steps to reduce the fees paid by merchants. Canadian
merchants that accept Visa and MasterCard credit cards must pay a fee
ranging between 1.5 and 3 percent or more of each purchase, nearly twice
as much as their counterparts pay in Europe, New Zealand and Australia,
but slightly less than in the United States. By contrast, the card
acceptance and processing fee paid by merchants in the case of an Interac
debit transaction is a flat fee of approximately 12 cents, regardless of
the value of the purchase. To provide a practical example, a 3 percent
hidden credit card fee on a $400 set of snow tires is $12, but if a debit
card is used for the same purchase, the fee is 12 cents. 

    The Bureau is challenging Visa and MasterCard's rules under the price
maintenance provisions of the Competition Act. The Bureau launched its
investigation in response to complaints by merchants and their
associations and initiated a formal inquiry in April 2009. 

    A copy of the Bureau's application will be available shortly on the
Competition Tribunal Web site.

    The Competition Bureau, as an independent law enforcement agency, ensures
that Canadian businesses and consumers prosper in a competitive and
innovative marketplace.

    Enquiry / Complaint Form

    Fact Sheet: Visa and MasterCard's Anti-competitive Rules

    The Players

    Credit Card Networks 


--  Visa and MasterCard operate the two largest credit card networks in
    Canada. 
--  Through their networks, Visa and MasterCard provide infrastructure and
    services such as authorization and settlement of transactions for
    customers who pay using their respective network's brand of credit
    cards. 


    Credit Card Issuers


--  Financial institutions, such as banks, credit unions and caisses
    populaires, issue credit cards in Canada. 
--  The issuers set annual credit card fees and interest rates charged to
    card holders and determine reward levels for programs like air miles and
    cash back. 


    Acquirers


--  Acquirers are the companies that supply credit card network services to
    merchants. 
--  This includes authorization and processing of credit card transactions,
    as well as point-of-sale services, such as credit card terminals. 


    The Fees and How They are Collected and Shared 

    Card Acceptance Fee


--  Card acceptance fees are paid by merchants each time a customer pays for
    a good or service with a credit card. 
--  The fees are a percentage of the purchase price paid to the merchant by
    the customer. 
--  Fees range from 1.5 per cent to 3 percent or more, and are higher on
    premium credit cards. 
--  Fees are distributed in different proportions to the credit card
    network, the issuer and the acquirer. 
--  The card acceptance fee has three components: the network fee, the
    interchange fee and the service fee. 


    Interchange Fee


--  The interchange fee is the amount retained by issuers, such as banks and
    financial institutions. 
--  The interchange fee is the largest fee, representing 80 percent or more
    of the total card acceptance fee. 
--  Increases in interchange fees have consistently resulted in increases in
    card acceptance fees. 


    Network Fee


--  The network fee is the amount retained by Visa or MasterCard. 


    Service Fee


--  The service fee is the amount retained by acquirers who process the
    transactions for merchants. 


    Merchant Restraints

    Visa and MasterCard rules contain numerous anti-competitive restraints
including: 

    The No Discrimination Rule


--  The no discrimination rule prevents merchants from treating a customer
    who presents a certain credit card less favourably than a customer who
    presents a different credit card. 


    The Honour All Cards Rule


--  The honour all cards rule requires merchants to accept all credit cards
    from a specific network, including premium reward cards with higher Card
    Acceptance Fees. 


    The No Surcharge Rule


--  The no surcharge rule prevents merchants from charging a fee on
    transactions made with Visa or MasterCard credit cards. 
--  This forces merchants to embed credit card transaction fees in retail
    prices. 
--  The no surcharge rule prohibits merchants from setting prices that
    reflect the actual cost of the payment method chosen by the customer. 


    Price Maintenance


--  Section 76 of the Competition Act allows the Competition Tribunal, in
    certain cases, to prohibit an agreement or contract that influences
    prices upwards or discourages the reduction of prices.


    International Comparison


--  Canada has among the highest Card Acceptance Fees in the world. 
--  Many countries have taken steps to reduce the Card Acceptance Fees paid
    by merchants. 
--  Canadian Merchants that accept Visa and MasterCard credit cards pay a
    Card Acceptance Fee ranging between 1.5 and 3 per cent or higher of each
    purchase. Meanwhile, processing fees in most other countries are
    significantly lower.

countries have taken steps to reduce the fees paid by merchants. Canadian
merchants that accept Visa and MasterCard credit cards must pay a fee
ranging between 1.5 and 3 percent or more of each purchase, nearly twice
as much as their counterparts pay in Europe, New Zealand and Australia,
but slightly less than in the United States. By contrast, the card
acceptance and processing fee paid by merchants in the case of an Interac
debit transaction is a flat fee of approximately 12 cents, regardless of
the value of the purchase. To provide a practical example, a 3 percent
hidden credit card fee on a $400 set of snow tires is $12, but if a debit
card is used for the same purchase, the fee is 12 cents. 

    The Bureau is challenging Visa and MasterCard's rules under the price
maintenance provisions of the Competition Act. The Bureau launched its
investigation in response to complaints by merchants and their
associations and initiated a formal inquiry in April 2009. 

    A copy of the Bureau's application will be available shortly on the
Competition Tribunal Web site.

    The Competition Bureau, as an independent law enforcement agency, ensures
that Canadian businesses and consumers prosper in a competitive and
innovative marketplace.

    Enquiry / Complaint Form

    Fact Sheet: Visa and MasterCard's Anti-competitive Rules

    The Players

    Credit Card Networks 


--  Visa and MasterCard operate the two largest credit card networks in
    Canada. 
--  Through their networks, Visa and MasterCard provide infrastructure and
    services such as authorization and settlement of transactions for
    customers who pay using their respective network's brand of credit
    cards. 


    Credit Card Issuers


--  Financial institutions, such as banks, credit unions and caisses
    populaires, issue credit cards in Canada. 
--  The issuers set annual credit card fees and interest rates charged to
    card holders and determine reward levels for programs like air miles and
    cash back. 


    Acquirers


--  Acquirers are the companies that supply credit card network services to
    merchants. 
--  This includes authorization and processing of credit card transactions,
    as well as point-of-sale services, such as credit card terminals. 


    The Fees and How They are Collected and Shared 

    Card Acceptance Fee


--  Card acceptance fees are paid by merchants each time a customer pays for
    a good or service with a credit card. 
--  The fees are a percentage of the purchase price paid to the merchant by
    the customer. 
--  Fees range from 1.5 per cent to 3 percent or more, and are higher on
    premium credit cards. 
--  Fees are distributed in different proportions to the credit card
    network, the issuer and the acquirer. 
--  The card acceptance fee has three components: the network fee, the
    interchange fee and the service fee. 


    Interchange Fee


--  The interchange fee is the amount retained by issuers, such as banks and
    financial institutions. 
--  The interchange fee is the largest fee, representing 80 percent or more
    of the total card acceptance fee. 
--  Increases in interchange fees have consistently resulted in increases in
    card acceptance fees. 


    Network Fee


--  The network fee is the amount retained by Visa or MasterCard. 


    Service Fee


--  The service fee is the amount retained by acquirers who process the
    transactions for merchants. 


    Merchant Restraints

    Visa and MasterCard rules contain numerous anti-competitive restraints
including: 

    The No Discrimination Rule


--  The no discrimination rule prevents merchants from treating a customer
    who presents a certain credit card less favourably than a customer who
    presents a different credit card. 


    The Honour All Cards Rule


--  The honour all cards rule requires merchants to accept all credit cards
    from a specific network, including premium reward cards with higher Card
    Acceptance Fees. 


    The No Surcharge Rule


--  The no surcharge rule prevents merchants from charging a fee on
    transactions made with Visa or MasterCard credit cards. 
--  This forces merchants to embed credit card transaction fees in retail
    prices. 
--  The no surcharge rule prohibits merchants from setting prices that
    reflect the actual cost of the payment method chosen by the customer. 


    Price Maintenance


--  Section 76 of the Competition Act allows the Competition Tribunal, in
    certain cases, to prohibit an agreement or contract that influences
    prices upwards or discourages the reduction of prices.


    International Comparison


--  Canada has among the highest Card Acceptance Fees in the world. 
--  Many countries have taken steps to reduce the Card Acceptance Fees paid
    by merchants. 
--  Canadian Merchants that accept Visa and MasterCard credit cards pay a
    Card Acceptance Fee ranging between 1.5 and 3 per cent or higher of each
    purchase. Meanwhile, processing fees in most other countries are
    significantly lower.

      Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Highlights: CACI International, 
      Manitowoc, Best Buy Company, GlaxoSmithKline and Pfizer
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Zacks Equity Research highlights: 
      CACI International (NYSE: CACI), 
      Manitowoc Inc. (NYSE: MTW), 
      Best Buy Company, Inc. (NYSE: BBY), 
      GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE: GSK) 
      and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bull 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CACI International (NYSE: CACI) 
      provides critical IT infrastructure for the Department of Defense and 
      the Department of Homeland Security. Earnings estimates for fiscal 2011 
      have surged by $0.22 in the last sixty days as the company reported 
      strong results for the fiscal first quarter and upgraded its guidance 
      for fiscal 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      First quarter earnings easily beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 
      $0.04. The company now expects revenues around $3,450-$3,600 million, up 
      from the previous range of $3,250-$3,400 million. EPS is forecasted 
      between $3.90 and $4.10, compared to the earlier forecast of $3.70 to 
      $3.90.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although margins remain a bit of a concern, we are positive about the 
      company's contract wins and recent acquisitions. Therefore, we have 
      upgraded our recommendation to Outperform from Neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bear 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Manitowoc Inc.'s (NYSE: MTW) 
      crane segment, which forms the backbone of its entire business, has been 
      delivering poor results since 2009, due to lower demands in the U.S. and 
      European markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This offset the strong results in the foodservice segment during the 
      third quarter, which is expected to continue into the fourth quarter. 
      The company's debt position is stagnant at $2 billion. Furthermore, it 
      failed to generate sufficient cash flow during the quarter, in order to 
      pay off the debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moreover, due to weaker-than expected order trends, the company's 
      chances of a swift recovery are very bleak. Based on the above reasons, 
      we have downgraded Manitowoc from Neutral to Underperform with a target 
      price of $12.00.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst 
      Blog:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Best Buy Misses, Lowers Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Best Buy Company, Inc. (NYSE: BBY) 
      posted lower-than-expected third-quarter 2011 results and lowered its 
      full year outlook, sending shares down $6.05 or 14.5% to $35.65 in 
      pre-market trading.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The quarterly earnings of 54 cents a share missed the Zacks Consensus 
      Estimate of 60 cents, but rose marginally by 1.9% from 53 cents 
      delivered in the prior-year quarter, due to tight cost control. The 
      Zacks Consensus Estimate had remained stable prior to the earnings 
      announcement, despite 2 out of 26 analysts raising their estimates and 1 
      analyst lowering the projection in the last 7 days.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management now expects fiscal 2011 earnings in the range of $3.20 to 
      $3.40 down from $3.55 to $3.70 anticipated earlier. The current Zacks 
      Consensus Estimate for fiscal year is $3.59. Following a 
      lower-than-expected results and a truncated guidance, a negative 
      sentiment may be palpable among the analysts covering the stock, and we 
      could witness a fall in the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the coming days.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company witnessed that the fall in the top-line and a 1.2% increase 
      in selling, general and administrative expenses were offset by 1.9% drop 
      in cost of goods sold leading to an increase in margins.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Glaxo on Acquisition Spree
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			GlaxoSmithKline plc (NYSE: GSK) 
      recently announced its plans to acquire UK-based Maxinutrition Group 
      Holdings Ltd. for a cash payment of about &#163;162 million. The deal 
      includes the repayment of outstanding debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As per the terms of the agreement, Glaxo will acquire Maxinutrition&#8217;s 
      brands thereby extending its reach in the UK and European sports 
      nutrition market.&#160;Maxinutrition will become a part of Glaxo&#8217;s 
      Nutritional Healthcare business. The company plans to leverage its 
      marketing excellence and RD innovation capability to foster growth of 
      Maxinutrition in the UK, Europe and international markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Maxinutrition, which recorded sales of about &#163;36 million for the fiscal 
      year ended April 2010, is one of Europe&#8217;s leading sports nutrition 
      company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier in the month, Glaxo announced its intention to acquire a Chinese 
      pharmaceutical company Nanjing MeiRui Pharma Co. Ltd. for about $70 
      million in cash. Glaxo will purchase 90% of MeiRui&#8217;s share capital from 
      Pagoda Pharmaceuticals Ltd. and the remaining from Allergon AB.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The acquisition of MeiRui will help expand Glaxo&#8217;s portfolio of urology 
      and allergy products, with the inclusion of Prostat for benign&#160;prostatic 
      hyperplasia and Sheniting for overactive bladder syndrome. Glaxo expects 
      to complete the transaction by the end of 2010, subject to regulatory 
      approval.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Neutral on Glaxo
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We currently have a Neutral recommendation on Glaxo, which is supported 
      by a Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating). We expect these 
      acquisitions and partnership arrangements to drive future growth for 
      Glaxo, as several of its products are scheduled to go off patent in the 
      next few years. The company&#8217;s HIV partnership with Pfizer Inc. 
      (NYSE: PFE) and the 
      Steifel acquisition marked the beginning of the acquisition/partnership 
      trend.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its view on U.S. asset managers to "attractive" from "neutral" on favorable cyclical trends for equity markets in the country and higher returns from dividends and buybacks next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The brokerage upgraded T. Rowe Price Group (TROW.O) to "buy" from "neutral" and added the company to its "conviction buy" list, citing the firm's equity mix -- which makes up for 73 percent of its assets under management, strong performance and reliable flow trends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note to clients, Goldman said it expected a cyclical shift in 2011 of retail flows moving from bonds toward higher fee equities-oriented funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We prefer gaining exposure to equities through alternative managers and institutional-focused firms, including Affiliated Managers Group, Blackstone, KKR  Co, and Fortress Investment Group," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The brokerage also said it saw Franklin Resources (BEN.N), T. Rowe, and Waddell  Reed Financial (WDR.N) among the best positioned with the ability and willingness to redeploy cash flow in buybacks and dividends.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, J.P. Morgan Securities said it saw the outlook for equity sales improving and raised its price target on several asset managers, including Federated Investors (FII.N), Pzena Investment Management (PZN.N), Janus Capital and T. Rowe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JP Morgan said Invesco (IVZ.N) remained its top pick, gaining from better sales and benefits from the firm's Van Kampen merger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Brenton Cordeiro in Bangalore; Editing by Joyjeet Das)&lt;/p&gt;

			The Coca-Cola Company Announces Expiration of 
      Maximum Tender Offer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Coca-Cola Company ("TCCC" or the "Company") today announced the

		&lt;p&gt;
			LexisNexis Launches InterAction 6.0 for Microsoft Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Enhanced Integration with Microsoft Outlook Enables Users to Access 
      Firm-Wide CRM Data without Need to Launch and Learn Separate Application
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LexisNexis, a leading global provider of content-enabled workflow 
      solutions, today announced the launch of InterAction&#174; 6.0 
      with enhanced Microsoft Outlook integration. LexisNexis&#174; 
      InterAction 6.0 software embeds features and functions of InterAction&#174;, 
      a leading Customer Relationship Management (CRM) application for 
      professional services, directly within Microsoft Outlook. This 
      integration enables users to view, access and leverage firm-wide CRM 
      data all from within one&#8217;s individual Outlook application &#8211; making it 
      easier for lawyers and other professional services firms to build 
      stronger client relationships and drive business development efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;At Blank Rome we have 1,150 InterAction users, and CRM drives 
      marketing, business development and more throughout the firm. We&#8217;re 
      always pushing for newer, improved functionality to keep adoption high 
      while simplifying usability,&#8221; said Brad Miller, director of marketing 
      technology with Blank Rome, LLP. &#8220;Being invited to preview InterAction 
      6.0 and contribute our firm&#8217;s needs in advance of its release fits our 
      definition of a technology partner. We&#8217;re eager to upgrade and reap the 
      benefits firm-wide of a simplified InterAction interface within 
      Microsoft Outlook.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;InterAction 6.0 is the result of exhaustive customer research and 
      feedback indicating the need for a CRM system that is easier to use and 
      doesn&#8217;t interrupt the normal workflow of executives,&#8221; said Brad Sidwell, 
      vice president and general manager, LexisNexis. &#8220;InterAction 6.0 
      accomplishes this by delivering the tools and benefits of the world&#8217;s 
      most powerful CRM system directly into a popular desktop application 
      that professionals already know and use daily.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to collecting customer feedback, LexisNexis also conducted a 
      survey of 80 senior IT professionals at the 2010 International Legal 
      Technology Association (ILTA) conference earlier this year. A full 94 
      percent of those surveyed said that integrating specialized CRM 
      capabilities directly within e-mail and contact management applications 
      would enable efficient information capture and increase usage of CRM 
      data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Benefits of InterAction 6.0
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Users will have easier access to their firm&#8217;s InterAction CRM data 
      directly within the e-mail, calendar and contact functions of Microsoft 
      Outlook. Key benefits include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				More complete understanding of client interactions. The &#8220;Add 
        Activities&#8221;
				feature allows users to log contact &#8220;events&#8221; 
        (emails, notes, calendar items etc.) directly from within Outlook to 
        the InterAction database where that information can be seen and 
        accessed by colleagues via their own Microsoft Outlook account. This 
        feature gives others in the firm a more complete and up-to-date 
        understanding of firm-wide interactions with a given contact to ensure 
        coordination of efforts and help avoid potentially embarrassing 
        situations.
      
			
				Time savings. An InterAction toolbar will appear inside a new 
        panel displayed within Outlook that enables users to hover their mouse 
        over a toolbar to surface contact information, identify mutual 
        relationships, see upcoming meetings or activities, view organization 
        or information changes and browse notes summarizing previous 
        interactions with any recipients of the e-mail. Because each of these 
        functions is performed within Outlook, users avoid the time consuming 
        need to go back and forth between Outlook and InterAction.
      
			
				Valuable insights. When researching a contact, the &#8220;Mutual 
        Connections&#8221; feature enables users to see who among their firm already 
        knows and has interacted with that contact before &#8212; all from within 
        Outlook. This gives the user valuable insight into who might be able 
        to make an introduction or provide additional background information 
        on the contact.
      
			
				Easy searching. The search field function enables users to 
        quickly search for contact details about clients and prospects shared 
        by others across the firm without leaving one&#8217;s e-mail inbox.

			PC Helps Business Boosted by Microsoft Version Upgrades and 
      &#8220;Consumerization&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Sales and Service Expansions for Onshore IT Business Services 
      Provider
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			PC 
      Helps, the premier provider of 24/7, expert, on-demand end-user 
      support for office 
      desktop software applications and mobile devices, has signed more 
      than 80 new clients in 2010 and expanded or renewed service agreements 
      with numerous current clients. Two key trends are driving the company&#8217;s 
      momentum this year: Microsoft upgrades (Office 2007/2010 or Windows 7 or 
      both), and the &#8220;consumerization 
      of IT&#8221; which is resulting in increasingly mixed mobile environments 
      within the corporate enterprise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      These new contracts and expansions are with leading firms across a range 
      of vertical markets, including: Belk, Bowdoin College, Chico&#8217;s, Dunkin 
      Brands, Samsonite, Southern Illinois Healthcare and Virgin America. A 
      majority of these clients have engaged PC Helps this year for end-user 
      migration support with Microsoft upgrades, mobile support or both. PC 
      Helps complements the IT help desk within a corporate environment, 
      providing specialized, on-demand &#8220;how to&#8221; support for both novice and 
      advanced users of desktop software applications and all types of mobile 
      devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The momentum we&#8217;re experiencing at PC Helps is directly linked to the 
      changing landscape of enterprise IT support in 2010. The 
      &#8216;consumerization&#8217; trend is creating complexity for support 
      organizations. While empowering a company&#8217;s employees, suddenly 
      servicing a wide variety of devices and applications can be a daunting 
      task for an IT department,&#8221; said Brian Madocks, CEO of PC Helps. &#8220;PC 
      Helps enables IT organizations to respond more readily to employee 
      support needs in this new era by expanding support capacity with the 
      right level of expertise and specialization.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bowdoin College engaged PC Helps to support its migration to Microsoft 
      Office 2010 as well as a range of mobile devices including iPads and 
      iPhones. &#8220;An important goal for Bowdoin IT Services is to ensure that 
      our help desk meets or exceeds the needs of the students, faculty and 
      staff,&#8221; said Mitchel Davis, CIO for Bowdoin College. &#8220;It is challenging 
      for Bowdoin&#8217;s help desk to meet all the demand for specialized software 
      support. PC Helps allows the help desk to expand capacity into many 
      areas by offering 24/7 on demand support. PC Helps client services are 
      exceptional and the help desk partnership has been an overwhelming 
      success.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			A Full Spectrum of Application-Level Support
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An onshore service provider, PC Helps delivers a full spectrum of 
      &#8220;just-in-time&#8221; training and support, ensuring that knowledge workers 
      stay on task and that core office applications and devices increase 
      their productivity. In addition to providing ongoing assistance with 
      questions on Microsoft applications and all types of mobile devices, PC 
      Helps works with corporate IT and help desk departments to manage the 
      user experience during upgrades to Windows 7 and Microsoft Office 2007 
      or 2010. &#8220;The changes associated with software conversions are dramatic 
      and can often cause significant challenges 
      for end-users, driving up calls to the service desk for support,&#8221; 
      said Brian Madocks. &#8220;Our on-demand service helps the IT department when 
      the pressure is on. We work as an extension to their IT service desk, 
      and bring the capacity required to respond quickly and keep employees 
      productive.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chico&#8217;s, a new PC Helps client, anticipated the need for increased 
      end-user support with their upcoming migration. &#8220;For our upgrade on the 
      Microsoft Suite, we have partnered with PC Helps to ensure that our 
      employees have the right depth of Microsoft application support and 
      expertise when they need it,&#8221; said Dale Evans, Senior Operations Manager 
      of Chico&#8217;s. &#8220;PC Helps guarantees that our employees have the knowledge 
      they need to succeed quickly on the new software.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Built on Long-Term Customer Relationships
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to new clients in 2010, many longstanding PC Helps clients 
      are also undergoing Microsoft version upgrades or deploying new mobile 
      devices such as iPhones and iPads this year and leveraging PC Helps for 
      support. These clients, who have maintained ongoing service contracts 
      for five to ten years or longer, rely upon PC Helps to support their 
      employees through application changes and upgrades, as well as with 
      their day-to-day questions about the desktop and mobile applications 
      they use. PC Helps fills a critical gap in service desk support within 
      these organizations and allows them to readily flex capacity to 
      accommodate high-demand periods, as well as provide specialized ongoing 
      application support for employees.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, Dec 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Cubic Transportation Systems, Inc., a business unit of Cubic Corporation
(NYSE: CUB), has been selected by TransLink as the preferred bidder to
design and build the smart card and faregate project for Greater
Vancouver's transportation system by 2013. The project's scope also
includes an operations and maintenance services contract from 2013 for
the following 10 years.

    During the design and build phase, Cubic will act as the overall systems
integrator and will also be responsible for customer and maintenance
services as the smart card and faregate project enters operation. Cubic
has selected IBM's British Columbia-based call center to supply key
customer support services. 

    The project originally attracted 10 companies for prequalification and
was down-selected to three competitors. 

    Under the project, faregates will be added to SkyTrain's Expo and
Millennium lines and the new Canada Line to bring gated station entry
that will increase security and decrease fare evasion. In addition to
traditional closed loop smart cards, account-based and open payment
technology will be added to Sky Train, Canada Line, West Coast Express,
Coast Mountain Bus, SeaBus and HandyDart. 

    "We are pleased to be working with partners who understand that
TransLink's technology path to the future is one that leverages, first
and foremost, proven technology as well as more flexible payment methods
using both traditional smart cards and open -- or account-based --
options. The solution will also position us to take advantage of newer
technologies as they become available," said TransLink's CEO Ian Jarvis.
Cubic is the transit industry's leading provider of revenue management
and business information systems and services, with major systems
including London's Oyster(R), Washington, D.C.'s SmarTrip(R), San
Francisco's Clipper(R), Atlanta's Breeze(R), Miami's EASY(R), Los
Angeles's TAP(R), New York's MetroCard(SM), Brisbane's go card, New York
and New Jersey Port Authority's SmartLink, and Chicago's ChicagoCard.
Cubic provided Vancouver's current revenue management system, which is
based on magnetic ticketing technology.

    IBM is a service provider with global experience in diverse areas of
intelligent transportation systems including smart cards and fare
collection systems, city congestion charging systems, transit asset
management, transit information management solutions, and customer
service and relationship management.

    "Cubic is extremely pleased to have been selected as the preferred
bidder, and we look forward to continuing our long and mutually
beneficial relationship with TransLink, which began in 1997," said
Richard Wunderle, senior vice president and general manager of Cubic
Transportation Systems, Inc.

    Ian Jarvis stated in the authority's press release of December 9, "We are
pleased to have Cubic/IBM on board to ensure this project is a success,
not only during the implementation phase but also through the 10 years
they will operate and maintain the system.

    "With the skills and knowledge of a strong proponent who knows our
business, matched with the support of our provincial and federal
partners, we are confident we will continue to add value to the
world-class transportation system we operate today."

    Cubic expects to execute the contract in February 2011, after final
discussions with the TransLink client.

business segments: Defense Systems, Mission Support Services and

			Chevron and Other Shareholders Sanction Caspian Pipeline Expansion
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Project doubles capacity of important export line
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that the shareholders and 
      governing bodies of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium (CPC) have 
      unanimously approved the $5.4 billion expansion of the Caspian pipeline. 
      The capacity of the 900-mile (1500 km) pipeline, which carries crude oil 
      from Western Kazakhstan to a dedicated terminal in the Black Sea, will 
      increase to 1.4 million barrels per day from its current capacity of 
      730,000 barrels per day.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This important achievement was made possible by the leadership and 
      support of the governments of Russia and Kazakhstan,&#8221; said Chevron 
      Chairman and CEO John Watson. &#8220;Chevron appreciates the valuable 
      contributions of our partners, Transneft and KazMunaiGaz, toward 
      sanctioning of the CPC expansion project.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The expansion of the CPC pipeline is a critical step forward to enabling 
      the Tengiz expansion, one of the world&#8217;s largest oil fields with 
      estimated recoverable reserves of 6 billion to 9 billion barrels. CPC 
      will carry Tengiz crude oil and also transport oil from other Kazakh and 
      Russian fields.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The project will be implemented in three phases with capacity increasing 
      progressively from 2012 to 2015. The project will consist of the 
      refurbishment of the existing five pump stations, the addition of 10 new 
      pumping stations, the replacement of a 55-mile (88 km) section of the 
      line, six new storage tanks and the addition of a third offshore mooring 
      point at the Black Sea terminal, six miles (10 km) north of the Port of 
      Novorossiysk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The three largest CPC shareholders, Transneft, KazMunaiGaz (KMG) and 
      Chevron, will provide project management services to the project. The 
      project is in the final stages of construction contract negotiations 
      with awards expected in the first quarter 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

			Some of the items discussed in this press release are forward-looking 
      statements about Chevron&#8217;s operations in Kazakhstan. Words such as

      expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. 
      The statements are based upon management&#8217;s current expectations, 
      estimates and projections; are not guarantees of future performance; and 
      are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of 
      which are beyond the company&#8217;s control and are difficult to predict. 
      Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially 
      are changes in prices of, demand for and supply of crude oil and natural 
      gas; actions of competitors; the inability or failure of the company&#8217;s 
      joint-venture partners to fund their share of operations and development 
      activities; the potential failure to achieve expected net production 
      from existing and future crude oil and natural gas development projects; 
      potential delays in the development, construction or start-up of planned 
      projects; the potential disruption or interruption of production and 
      development activities due to war, accidents, political events, civil 
      unrest, or severe weather; government-mandated sales, divestitures, 
      recapitalizations and changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on scope 
      of company operations; and general economic and political conditions. 
      You should not place undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, 
      which speak only as of the date of this press release. Unless legally 
      required, Chevron undertakes no obligation to update publicly any 
      forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, 
      future events or otherwise.

			Visa Inc. Statement Regarding the Federal Reserve&#8217;s Recommendations 
      on the Dodd-Frank Act
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Visa has received the initial recommendations of the Federal Reserve 
      related to the debit card regulation provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act. 
      At this time, Visa is still reviewing the specific elements of the 
      recommendations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We cannot comment in detail on the proposed regulations until we have 
      had a chance to fully consider its proposal. It is clear, however, that 
      the Federal Reserve has left a significant number of issues open for 
      additional comment and deliberation in the coming months. Visa also has 
      concerns that the Federal Reserve&#8217;s proposal includes artificial caps on 
      debit interchange that do not realistically reflect the value of card 
      acceptance and do not reflect the actual costs of running a secure, 
      reliable and efficient debit network. Further, the proposed routing and 
      exclusivity alternatives put retailer profits ahead of consumer 
      protection, choice and convenience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We urge the Federal Reserve to give appropriate consideration to the 
      important issues raised in letters recently sent to Chairman Bernanke by 
      members of Congress, regarding the potential harmful impact the 
      recommendations will have on consumer choice, privacy and data security 
      protections as well as its impact on the ability of small financial 
      institutions to compete effectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Given the importance and complexity of this undertaking, we believe the 
      Federal Reserve must be given additional time to fulfill its 
      responsibilities and to analyze the unintended consequences of the 
      proposals on the industry and consumers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We remain confident in Visa&#8217;s ability to compete, win and grow in the 
      payments marketplace through a resilient business model in the U.S., 
      aggressive growth strategies globally and as a leader in product 
      innovation in our industry.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We will provide the Federal Reserve feedback on its initial 
      recommendations and the serious questions they have raised as soon as 
      possible.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Barely two weeks on the job, Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) new chief executive is already hearing calls to take dramatic action, including potentially breaking up the world's largest drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some investors want CEO Ian Read to make more measured moves to get Pfizer's house in order first to help its long-floundering stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fund managers -- including those who own Pfizer shares and those looking for a reason to -- want Read, a 32-year Pfizer veteran, to cut costs, raise the company's dividend and make smarter acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investment banks may want to break the company up, but I don't see that as a solution right now," said Tom Villalta, lead portfolio manager for Jones Villalta Opportunity Fund, 2 percent of which is invested in Pfizer shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before starting to eliminate parts of the company, I'd like to see Pfizer on a firmer path, so it's not acting from a position of weakness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read took over last week after the abrupt resignation of Jeffrey Kindler, a lawyer who said he was worn out after nearly five years as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer on Thursday disclosed that it raised Read's base salary to $1.7 million from $1.21 million and boosted his target annual incentive to about $2.6 million from about $1.2 million. Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amilio also got a raise to a base salary of $1.2 million, up from $1.1 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares had lost more than a third of their value since Kindler took over in July 2006 and have the lowest forward price-to-earnings valuation of all large drugmakers except Sanofi-Aventis. (SASY.PA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Pfizer's biggest challenge is still to come. Next November, the company faces U.S. generic competition to its Lipitor cholesterol treatment, the biggest selling drug in the world at $11 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have argued that selling some of Pfizer's businesses would allow it to better capture the value of those assets and make the drugmaker easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts said in a September research report that Pfizer's individual businesses add up to a valuation of $24 per share, about 40 percent above current trading levels. They argued that the market is not recognizing the value of some of Pfizer's non-pharmaceutical divisions, namely animal health, consumer health and nutrition products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs estimated a boost of up to 16.5 percent in 2010 earnings per share if those non-pharma divisions were split off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHEN BIGGER ISN'T BETTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer became the world's biggest drugmaker by sales after buying U.S. rival Warner-Lambert for $114 billion in 2000. It bulked up further with the $60 billion purchase of Pharmacia in 2003 and the $67 billion merger with Wyeth in October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer has been an acquirer and has put together the largest drug company in the world," said Jordan Schreiber, senior investment officer for Princeton Capital Management Inc, which does not hold Pfizer. "But the base is now too large for them to show any accretion and growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read, formerly global drugs chief and a consummate Pfizer insider, might seem an unlikely choice to tear apart his employer of the past three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think he is going to be causing evolutionary change ... Read's job is: Get the company's credibility back in the marketplace for the long-term holder," said Scott Richter, who oversees the Fifth Third Disciplined Large Cap Value Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richter is encouraged by Read's experience in international markets, which could be key to future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's got the potential to earn this credibility back," Richter said. "I haven't owned it (Pfizer) in a long time and I'm looking at it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many rivals facing major patent losses, Pfizer has been unable to develop enough new medicines to replace Lipitor and other drugs. In Pfizer's case, investors are particularly irked by that shortcoming, given that the company spends nearly $9 billion annually on research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest issue ... is we have poured billions upon billions of dollars down into an RD pipeline that just hasn't produced much of anything," said David Heupel, portfolio manager of the $2 billion Thrivent Large Cap Growth Fund. "So let's figure out a better way of doing this ... Something has to change here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Kindler, Pfizer's most significant strategic move was buying Wyeth, but the stock has not budged since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are optimistic Read may exceed Pfizer's cost-cutting goal from the Wyeth deal, largely through sales force layoffs, and that his extensive experience may allow him to find savings in many other corners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Smead, portfolio manager of the Smead Value Fund, said Pfizer might need to take a scalpel to its RD budget, the largest in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My guess is they could have more success with a smaller research budget" and by also selling off assets outside Pfizer's core pharmaceuticals focus. "They shouldn't choose rabbit trails that aren't beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of OakBrook Investments, has considered buying Pfizer shares but remains concerned about the company's "lack of a drug pipeline" and believes it needs more acquisitions to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heupel said he would "like to see them make some bigger splashes" in buying products in new development areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have bought things that are like $1 billion or so that were early stage," Heupel said. "I'm not saying that's not a wise use of cash, but it's not going to incite any new shareholder base."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's deal-making track record is not without blemishes, notes Schreiber, who cites the company's licensing deal with Medivation Inc (MDVN.O) involving an antihistamine that failed to prove an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer's drug output has been awful and they've had a lot of bad deals," Schreiber said. "Investors would also react favorably to a series of dividend increases, share buybacks and acquisitions that are not seriously dilutive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer took a step in that direction this week when it raised its dividend by 11 percent. Read has also started to make his mark, reorganizing his executive team to eliminate a layer of management under the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's too early to answer the question whether they will turn around," Schreiber said. "I don't see it happening quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   * Company moving ahead with Big Foot project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Third major Gulf of Mexico project in less than 3 months&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chevron shares rise to 2-year high, outperforming sector
 (Adds partners, shallow-water activity, closing share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has
approved $4 billion for its Big Foot project, in its second
major Gulf of Mexico development in two months, even as tougher
rules and higher costs loom for U.S. deepwater operators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) gave the go-ahead in late
September for a second deepwater production hub at its prolific
Mars field in the Gulf, indicating the major oil companies will
shoulder extra costs to maintain production growth near one of
the world's biggest oil markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Sanctioning Big Foot underscores our commitment to the
Gulf of Mexico and will contribute to future U.S. energy
supply," George Kirkland, vice chairman of Chevron, said in a
statement on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, Big Foot's operator, controls 60 percent of the
project, while Norway's Statoil (STL.OL) has 27.5 percent and
Japan's Marubeni Corp (8002.T) holds the remainder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon
Mobil Corp (XOM.N), has continued to invest in the Gulf despite
lingering uncertainty over U.S. regulations following BP Plc's
(BP.L) oil spill, with drilling permits still hard to secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said in October it planned to spend $7.5 billion at
its Jack/St Malo project in the Gulf. [ID:nN21259958]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron also extended contracts for two shallow-water rigs
in the Gulf by six months, at higher rates, rig owner Ensco Plc
(ESV.N) said late on Wednesday. Marubeni, meanwhile, sublet
deepwater rig Ensco 8502 for 35 days as the existing client
awaits a permit, possibly to drill in one of the four fields
Marubeni just bought from BP. [ID:nTOE69O060]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Big Foot, located about 225 miles (360 km) south of New
Orleans in water depths of 5,200 feet (1,600 m), is expected to
have production capacity of 75,000 barrels of oil and 25
million cubic feet of natural gas per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; First oil is anticipated in 2014, which will be a big year
for Chevron. The company is expecting overall annual production
growth of only 1 percent through 2014, when its first massive
natural gas development off Australia will start up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The San Ramon, California-based company said last week it
planned to increase spending by 20 percent next year, with most
of its $26 billion budget earmarked for exploration and
production. [ID:nN09222898].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares rose 1.2 percent on Thursday to $89.06,
their best close since September 2008, compared with a 0.56
percent rise in the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of oil
companies. .OIX

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman sees boosting wealth unit advisers to 800&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Expansion focused on Brazil, China, Middle East and U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joseph A. Giannone&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
on Thursday said it is expanding its wealth management business
worldwide and intends to boost its ranks of advisers by a third
over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private wealth management is a tiny part of the giant
securities trading company, and Goldman typically reveals
almost nothing about the business. Spokeswoman Melissa Daly
confirmed the expansion plan but declined to elaborate on the
actual number of advisers employed by the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; People familiar with the business, though, said Goldman has
about 600 advisers worldwide. Expansion plans already under way
would take that number to 800.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's expansion priorities include Brazil, China and
the Middle East, as well as more cities across the United
States. New advisers will be recruited from rival banks,
sourced from other parts of Goldman and from business schools.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is one of several U.S. and European banks --
including Barclays Plc (BARC.L), Credit Suisse Group (CSGN.VX)
and Citigroup (C.N) -- that are busy ramping up their private
wealth arms, as regulators want banks to hold more capital and
take less risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein regularly lauds the
private wealth business as a major growth opportunity, both as
a source of referrals and also as a way for the bank to hold
onto the wealth realized by its investment banking customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clients generally are expected to have at least $10 million
of money to invest. Goldman had roughly 400 advisers in the
United States and managed $200 billion in U.S. assets at the
end of 2009, according to Barron's.

&lt;p&gt; * Crude found in BM-S-22 block in Santos Basin

 * Exxon operates block with Petrobras, Hess
  (Refiles to change reporting credit)

 RIO DE JANEIRO, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) has
discovered oil in a deep-water block off Brazil's coast, the
nation's energy regulator ANP said on Thursday, following a dry
well in the same block over a year earlier.

 The company found oil in the 3-ESSO5-SPS well drilled in
the BM-S-22 block, which is located in the vast offshore region
known as the subsalt believed to hold more than 50 billion
barrels of crude.

 Exxon in 2009 reported a dry well in that block that
sparked market concerns the subsalt region was riskier than
originally believed, though recent drilling by Petrobras in the
vast Tupi area has helped limit those concerns.

 The BM-S-22 block is located in the Santos basin and has
water depth of 2,272 meters (7,454 feet). It is operated by
Exxon with Hess (HES.N) and Brazilian state oil company
Petrobras (PETR4.SA) as partners.

&lt;p&gt;Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Staite also cut his fourth-quarter earnings estimates for Goldman and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) to reflect continued weakness in fixed income trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He cut his fourth-quarter earnings per share estimate on Goldman to $3.25 from $3.75 and lowered his estimate on Morgan Stanley to 32 cents from 52 cents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, he said both banks were expected to grow their investment banking fees due to a robust environment for mergers and acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of New York-based Goldman Sachs, which have risen 7 percent this month, were down about 1 percent at $164.31 in afternoon trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Morgan Stanley were down 1 percent at $25.99 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jochelle Mendonca in Bangalore; Editing by Jarshad Kakkrakandy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  CHELMSFORD, MA, Dec 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Aspect, a global provider of unified communications and collaboration
services and software, today announced it will be delivering a
software-based product for small- to mid-size contact center applications
using Microsoft Lync as its media server. The new product will be a
value-priced, turnkey option for IT Help Desks, virtual sales teams,
corporate departments, branch offices and small- to mid-size contact
centers looking to leverage their unified communications strategies. The
product will include core contact center capabilities, as well as key
unified communication functionality, including delivering voice over IP. 

    "This announcement reinforces the value the Aspect/Microsoft
relationship, in place since March 2008, brings to existing and potential
Lync users," said Sheila McGee-Smith, president and principal analyst at
McGee-Smith Analytics. "The Aspect product will not 'work' or 'integrate'
with Lync, but actually uses Lync as its media server. It also offers SMB
customers a product built on Aspect's long-standing expertise in the
contact center space."

    The product, scheduled to be delivered in Q1 2011, will support from 20
to 100 agents and supervisors. Among the contact center capabilities it
will provide include voice, inbound voice and email routing, instant
messaging (IM), real-time and historical reporting, a unified agent
desktop, manual dialing and voice self service capabilities on a single
server. The product will also include out-of-the-box workflows. Lync will
deliver the media server and PBX functionality. The solution can be
installed by Microsoft-savvy IT professionals, with minimal remote
support from Aspect(R) Professional Services.

    "We believe there are significant opportunities to bring contact center
functionality to deliver key business benefits. Aspect is helping to
address this target market by bringing its expertise with both contact
center and unified communication capabilities to bear," said Gurdeep
Singh Pall, corporate vice president of the Microsoft Lync and Speech
Group at Microsoft Corp. "Our customers have been asking for an easy to
implement and manage solution for smaller contact centers and help desks
that will enable them to use the same telephony infrastructure that is
being used in the enterprise." 

    "We believe this product will deliver significant benefits to
organizations by providing proven technology that is derived from
Aspect's best-of-breed solutions and years of customer contact
leadership, delivered as a turnkey offering," said Gary Barnett, chief
technology officer at Aspect. "The product will provide an optimal blend
of unified communications capabilities and key contact center features
for low cost, in a small footprint. Importantly, it provides a natural
first step for integrating either the internal or external contact center
to the organization's unified communications infrastructure, allowing the
business to capitalize on the enterprise-wide benefits that UC can bring
to the customer and the company." 

    The product will also provide a seamless integration to Aspect(R)
Workforce Management to enable forecasting, scheduling, and tracking
capabilities and Aspect Performance Management for scorecards and
analysis that can automatically initiate alerts and actions.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JAMF Software Announces Integration between Microsoft System 
      Center Configuration Manager (SCCM) and Casper Suite 8.0
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Casper Suite 8.0 integrates with Microsoft SCCM for cross-platform 
      lifecycle management
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JAMF Software, developers of the Casper Suite, a collection of 
      client management applications for Mac OS X computers and iOS mobile 
      devices such as iPads and iPhones, today announced an open API and 
      dynamic inventory integration with Microsoft System Center Configuration 
      Manager (SCCM).
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Casper Suite uses the open JAMF Software Server (JSS) API and 
      a custom plug-in to integrate with the SCCM console, allowing IT 
      administrators to view comprehensive software and hardware information 
      about the Macs and iOS mobile devices managed by the Casper Suite. This 
      tight integration allows IT administrators to leverage the Casper 
      Suite&#8217;s best of breed client management and inventory capabilities for 
      Macs and iOS devices, while using SCCM tools for their Windows 
      management and compliance reporting.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Integration with Microsoft SCCM
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft&#8217;s SCCM lifecycle management solution allows IT 
      administrators to automate deployment and management of their Windows 
      resources. When combined with the Casper Suite using the SCCM Plugin, 
      administrators can view and report on inventory data for all of their 
      Windows machines, Macs, and iOS devices in a single console. This 
      approach allows administrators to use the Casper Suite&#8217;s robust tools to 
      manage the growing numbers of Macs, iPads and iPhones in their 
      organization, while facilitating centralized reporting in the familiar 
      SCCM console.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;We have long been committed to helping enterprise organizations 
      succeed with the Apple platform,&#8221; said Chip Pearson, Managing Partner at 
      JAMF Software. &#8220;We have created best of breed tools to optimize the 
      experience of managing for the Apple platform, while maintaining our 
      commitment to ensuring that the Casper Suite works with all the diverse 
      tools in a network environment. A large number of our customers use 
      Microsoft SCCM to manage their Windows deployments, so we&#8217;re happy to 
      provide a tool to further integrate these powerful systems. We 
      anticipate that this is the first of many integrations with PC lifecycle 
      management solutions.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JSS API and developer resources
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The SCCM Plugin is among a growing number of applications made 
      possible by the JSS API, which enables unification and extensibility 
      between the JSS and other systems. Based on RESTful architecture, the 
      JSS API provides an intuitive and secure method for developers and 
      customers to interact with objects in the JSS. Using the JSS API, 
      developers can access the information gathered by the Casper Suite, 
      re-purposing and utilizing the data for a broad range of custom 
      applications.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;We have opened the JSS API using well-documented methods for 
      increased simplicity,&#8221; said Nick Amundsen, Special Projects Manager at 
      JAMF Software. &#8220;Our goal is to enable customers and third-party 
      developer partners to easily build upon the solid framework of the 
      Casper Suite, while using the familiar tools and standards they are 
      using in their environment. While the Casper Suite is quite powerful on 
      its own, we recognize that combining it with tools such as SCCM will 
      serve to make it even more powerful for our users.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Strike against YPF is affecting crude storage, loading&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon unit says refinery's crude supplies disrupted&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Exxon's Campana refinery is fourth largest in country&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUENOS AIRES, Dec 16 (Reuters) - A labor dispute causing
crude shortages in Argentina has forced Esso, the local unit of
U.S. energy company Exxon Mobil, to reduce refining activity, a
company spokesman said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Patagonian energy workers' union has been in conflict
with Argentina's biggest energy firm YPF (YPFD.BA) for two
weeks. Protesting workers have blocked a crude storage and
loading facility used by other energy companies, including
Esso. [ID:N14293594]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; YPF, a unit of Spain's Repsol (REP.MC), has halted
operations at several sites in the southern Patagonian region,
citing unrest linked to the conflict over wages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About a third of Argentina's crude oil is produced in the
area affected by the dispute, and the Esso spokesman said the
conflict could soon start causing shortages at service stations
unless normal crude supplies to refineries resume.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're really at the point where we need to lower ...
processing in the refinery as a way to deal with a critical
situation that is going to get more and more critical if this
conflict isn't resolved," Esso spokesman Tomas Hess told local
radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're receiving hardly any crude," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Esso has a processing capacity of 88,000 barrels per day at
its Campana refinery in Buenos Aires province. Campana is the
fourth largest refinery in the South American country.

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar

leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details

Associazione Nazionale di Categoria Trasporto Persone e Mobilita, the
association of tourist bus drivers in the Province of Lazio, Italy.

dPollution's revolutionary device improves engine performance by causing
fuel to combust more thoroughly and efficiently. This technology works on
every internal combustion engine on the planet. Considering that IC

for this device is virtually limitless. For more information, please

&lt;p&gt;TIRANA/SARAJEVO (Reuters) - Albanians raced to claim the honour of making the first visa-free visit to the European Union on Wednesday after the bloc eased entry rules, while Bosnians took a less euphoric approach despite travel discounts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EU lifted visa requirements for Albanian and Bosnian holders of biometric passports at midnight on December 15, leaving Kosovans as the only Balkan citizens still needing visas for all trips to EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Firecrackers greeted the first cars arriving at Albania's land crossings with Greece and to board ferries to Italy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am very happy, very proud. I have driven through snow to be the first," said one 54-year-old Albanian, celebrating a milestone on the country's long journey to EU membership.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He left without giving his name, and discovering that a 74-year-old woman had crossed an hour earlier as she knew what he had forgotten -- that due to the time difference Greek clocks had ticked to midnight an hour before Albania's.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bosnians could once travel widely without visas when they were citizens of the now-defunct Yugoslavia, but lost the right when the country disintegrated in the 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Low temperatures and a chronic lack of money were the main reasons for an absence of euphoria among Bosnians, despite 50 percent discounts offered by a travel agency on "Schengen Day", named after the EU's free travel area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, they were happy to see the visa requirement lifted. "I am glad, now I'll be able to finally visit my cousin in France," said Dzenana, a hairdresser, who has never gone abroad because she loathed waiting for long hours for a visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast to Bosnia, where around only 420,000 citizens have obtained biometric passports out of a 3.8 million population, more than one million Albanians have paid 50 euros for such a document.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU decided last month to lift the visa requirements for travellers from the two countries, aiming to encourage democratic reforms in the Balkans, but warned that restrictions will be re-imposed if travel rules are abused.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some EU governments doubt the two membership hopefuls can cope with problems such as illegal immigration and trafficking along drug routes from Asia to Europe, because of weak institutions and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such concerns rose after relaxed visa requirements for citizens of Serbia, Montenegro and Macedonia last year led to a jump -- in some cases a fourfold increase -- in applications for asylum in the EU from the three Balkan countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many impoverished Bosnians and Albanians see the relaxation as a chance to make money illegally in difficult times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As soon as I get a passport, I'll go to Austria, where my cousin lives," said a young man in Sarajevo who did not want to be named. "I'll try to find a job on the black market there, I can earn more in three months there than here for a year." (Editing by Maja Zuvela and David Stamp)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said it would spend $4 billion to develop its Big Foot project in the Gulf of Mexico, even as tougher rules and higher costs loom for deepwater operators.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company behind Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), has continued to invest in the Gulf of Mexico even as uncertainty over costs and the U.S. government's new safety regulations linger following the BP Plc (BP.L) oil spill disaster.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sanctioning Big Foot underscores our commitment to the Gulf of Mexico and will contribute to future U.S. energy supply," George Kirkland, vice chairman of Chevron, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In October Chevron said it planned to spend $7.5 billion at its Jack/St Malo project in the Gulf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Foot, located about 225 miles south of New Orleans in water depths of 5,200 feet, is expected to have production capacity of 75,000 barrels of oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;First oil is anticipated in 2014, the San Ramon, California, company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Chevron said it planned to increase spending 20 percent next year, with the bulk of its $26 billion budget earmarked for exploration and production projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Chevron rose 20 cents to $88.21 in morning trading on the New York Stock Exchange, compared with a small decline in the Chicago Board Options Exchange index of oil companies .OIX.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Driver, editing by Gerald E.

			Disney Mobile Releases New Visually Stunning TRON: Legacy Premium 
      Mobile Game for the iPhone, iPod touch and iPad
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Announces TRON Mobile GRID Championship on December 25
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Disney Mobile announced today its new TRON: Legacy mobile game for the 
      iPhone, iPod touch and iPad on the App Store. Available for 99 cents, 
      the new app brings the world of TRON to life in a series of competitions 
      through 24 rounds with visually stunning graphics developed to maximize 
      the Retina Display on iPhone 4 and iPod touch as well as the large 
      high-resolution display of iPad. The launch&#160;coincides with 
      the&#160;Disney&#160;motion&#160;picture release of "TRON: Legacy" on December 17.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The game also features a TRON Mobile GRID Championship which will debut 
      on Dec. 25 allowing players to compete for prizes, including the 3D HDTV 
      Entertainment System, TRON Audio Dock from Monster and TRON: 
      Evolution&#8212;The Video Game.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Since launching the free TRON app at Comic-Con back in July, we have 
      been building up to this week and keeping fans engaged with all things 
      TRON, every step of the way,&#8221; said Stephen Saiz, director of marketing, 
      Disney Mobile. &#8220;We&#8217;re extremely proud of the new, premium app, TRON: 
      Legacy, and think it builds on all of the excitement around the film as 
      it hits theaters.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the TRON: Legacy mobile game, players race the latest generation of 
      3D Light Cycles and fire cannons from the cockpit of massive Recognizers 
      as they earn points and qualify for new contests and unlock new arenas. 
      With a choice of 16 different courses, players have the option to 
      compete in standard races or timed trials as well as the ability to 
      compete head-to-head in high velocity 3D Light Cycle races. Inspired by 
      the film, game controls allow racers to steer, block opponents, fire 
      cannons from the cockpit of massive Recognizers and deploy power ups 
      like Shield Breaker, Arc and Cloak&#8212;all in the quest to become the 
      ultimate Grid Game Champion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Also timed with the release of Walt Disney Pictures' film "TRON: Legacy" 
      on December 17, Disney Mobile has updated its free TRON app with an 
      Apple iPod/iPhone Visualizer and Alarm Clock application that works 
      exclusively with Disney Consumer Product&#8217;s new TRON Audio Dock from 
      Monster. The app is a totally immersive iPod/iPhone music player with 
      Visualizer Graphics effects that engages the alarm clock with the dock&#8217;s 
      &#8220;Identity Disc&#8221; lighting rings for an attractive &#8220;wake-up&#8221; effect.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Here are highlights from Wednesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CPI: Inflation Still Tame
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The&#160;Consumer Price Index (CPI)&#160;rose by just 0.1% in 
      November, down from 0.2% October. Even with the 0.1% increase in 
      September, year over year it is up just 1.1%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Energy prices, were surprisingly well behaved in the month, rising just 
      0.2% after having surged 2.6% in October on top of a 0.7% increase in 
      September. Year over year, energy prices are up 3.9%. Actually, the 
      increase is even narrower than that, as energy commodities such as 
      gasoline were up 0.8% after increases of 4.4% in October and a 1.8% 
      increase in September. That is much higher than inflation in the rest of 
      the economy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The relative pricing strength in energy commodities suggests that it 
      would be a good idea to be over weighted in the energy sector. Energy 
      service prices, like electricity and piped gas service, actually fell by 
      0.7% after rising by 0.2% in October. In September, energy service 
      prices fell by 0.8%. Year over year, energy services prices are down 
      1.0%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Food prices were also relatively well behaved, rising just 0.2% after 
      being up 0.1% in October and 0.3% in September. Year over year, food 
      prices are up 1.7%. Due to poor harvests in several important areas of 
      the world -- most notably due to droughts in Russia, and floods in 
      Pakistan, agricultural commodity prices had been rising sharply -- 
      although they have recently backed off. So far they have had relatively 
      little impact on consumers shopping at&#160;Kroger&#8217;s&#160;(NYSE: KR).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The actual cost of raw wheat is a very small fraction of the actual cost 
      of a loaf of bread, so one would not want to exaggerate the likely 
      impact of higher prices in the commodity pits on prices at the checkout 
      counter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Core Inflation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Thus, if one strips out the volatile food and energy prices to get to 
      core inflation, prices were up 0.1%, after three straight months of 
      being unchanged. Year over year, core prices are up 0.8%. Over the last 
      three months, the increase annualizes to 0.4%. While everyone consumes 
      food and energy, their prices tend to be extremely volatile, and can be 
      influenced by external events. As such, the Fed tends to focus more on 
      core prices when setting monetary policy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      So what areas are showing price increases? Health Care costs always seem 
      to run faster than overall inflation, but even they seem relatively well 
      behaved. Medical commodity prices (i.e. drugs) were up just 0.2% after 
      rising 0.1% in October after a 0.3% rise in September. Year over year 
      they were up 2.7%. Part of the reason for that is probably the 
      increasing substitution of generic drugs for name brand prescriptions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Where drugs are still on patent, firms like&#160;Pfizer&#160;(NYSE: PFE) 
      and&#160;Merck&#160;(NYSE: MRK) 
      are still aggressively raising prices, but they are now losing share to 
      their slightly older drugs that are no longer state-enforced monopolies 
      and have to face the free market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Medical Services prices (i.e. a visit to the hospital) rose 0.1% after a 
      0.2% increase in October but that is after they jumped 0.8% in 
      September. Year over year, medical service prices are up 3.4%. That is 
      still higher than the inflation rate elsewhere in the economy, but is 
      far below the average rate of medical inflation in recent years 
      (decades).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The taming of medical inflation is vitally important, as rapidly rising 
      health care costs are the primary factor in the long-term structural 
      budget deficit. It is the long-term structural deficit that we have to 
      be worried about, not the current big deficit that is mostly due to 
      cyclical factors (reduction in tax revenues and higher automatic 
      stabilizer costs due to high unemployment).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The other noteworthy area of inflation -- on a year-over-year basis, at 
      least -- is in car prices, particularly used car prices. That finally 
      changed for the better in September, as they fell 0.7%. That continued 
      October with a 0.9% decline, and the downward trend continued in 
      November with a 0.5% decline. Still we are talking about a 6.0% rise 
      over the last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The price of new cars fell 0.4% in November, after a decline of 0.2% in 
      October and rising just 0.1% in September. Year over year, new car 
      prices are down 0.4%. In other words, the remarkable resurgence in the 
      auto industry was not simply due to car companies being able to jack up 
      prices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The differential between new and used car prices was obviously 
      unsustainable. If it were to continue for a few more years, a 1999&#160;Ford&#160;(NYSE: 
      F) Escort would cost 
      more than a new Ford Focus. Somehow I don&#8217;t see that happening.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The narrowing of the difference is probably bad news for the big used 
      car dealers like&#160;CarMax&#160;(NYSE: KMX). 
      What we were probably seeing is a large &#8220;inferior good&#8221; effect. In other 
      words, in tough times, people gravitate to buying the cheaper product, 
      even if is of inferior quality. Used cars relative to new cars meet that 
      description.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Releads, adds detail, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Laurence Fletcher and Kevin Lim &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON/SINGAPORE, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
star trader Morgan Sze's plans to raise over $1 billion for an
Asia hedge fund could be a sign of things to come as traders who
run own-account trading desks prepare for a Wall Street
regulatory clampdown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hong Kong-based Sze, head of Goldman's Principal Strategies
group, is to quit to form Azentus Capital, likely one of the
biggest hedge fund launches since the onset of the credit crisis
and which will have a team of close to 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move comes as Goldman and other Wall Street banks wind
down their proprietary trading desks in light of the "Volcker
rule", named after the former Federal Reserve Chairman who
authored the regulation to limit the extent to which banks can
bet with their own capital. [ID:nN04118596]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks are considering options such as spinning out desks as
separate hedge funds or moving them into their asset management
units. Morgan Stanley (MS.N) is spinning out FrontPoint Capital
while JPMorgan (JPM.N) is reassigning its proprietary traders to
its asset management unit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other traders, like Sze, are taking matters into their own
hands and setting up brand new investment ventures. Sources said
Sze is Goldman's highest-paid trader having in 2006 received a
bonus of almost $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's difficult to think about a proprietary trading desk at
a significant investment house that we've not had a conversation
with (about spinning out). They're a fully-functioning business
from day one," said one prime broker who asked not to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's prop desk has seen a number of departures this
year. Earlier this year, Pierre-Henri Flamand, who ran Goldman's
Principal Strategies division before Sze, set up Edoma Partners
having raised more than $1 billion, according to media reports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In October KKR hired nine members of Goldman's prop trading
team, while a Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) commodity trader departed
with a team of proprietary traders in September to set up a
hedge fund. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) has also cut staff who
traded for the bank's account. [ID:nN21290478] [ID:nN04118596] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ASIA NOT LONDON &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The multi-strategy Azentus fund, which would be one of the
biggest in Asia, is expected to take office space in Hong Kong's
ICBC Tower and would start operating in the first quarter of
2011, two people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sze considered London -- the major centre for hedge fund
firms outside of the United States -- as a base but was
discouraged by the level of tax and regulation he would face,
said a third source, who had knowledge of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sze has now begun talking to investors, the third source
said. "There will certainly be real interest ... There's a lot
of demand for Asia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Azentus's team would comprise about 12 analysts and the
entire trading desk would come from Goldman, three sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund may start trading with $1 billion to $1.5 billion
and employ a number of strategies, including equity long-short,
risk arbitrage and special situation investing, the Financial
Times said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Sze needs at least $1 billion just to justify the size of
operation," a source familiar with the plan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investor confidence is returning after the financial crisis
with some $42 billion of net inflows into the hedge fund
industry this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Assets in Asian hedge funds surpassed $125 billion for the
first time since December 2008, according to consultancy
Eurekahedge, boosted by portfolio gains and inflows as the
region's stronger growth prospects attract investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Eurekahedge Asia ex-Japan Index recorded a return of
38.19 percent in 2009 and remains among the best performing
hedge fund indexes in 2010, with year-to-date gains of 9.36
percent.

MOSAID's current expectations regarding future events. These

uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or
achievements to differ materially from those in such forward-looking
statements. Assumptions made in preparing forward-looking statements and
financial guidance include, but are not limited to, the following:
MOSAID's continued expansion of its patent portfolio and of its
opportunities for future patent licensing revenue as a result of MOSAID's
acquisition of patents from third parties and from development of new
inventions; semiconductor and telecommunications product vendors
continuing to infringe MOSAID's patents; the timing and amount of
MOSAID's litigation expenses; MOSAID's ability to sign new patent
licensees; current assumptions as to the identification of products that
are unlicensed to MOSAID's wireless patents; and the timing and amount of
MOSAID's Research &amp; Development expenses.

    Factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from
expected results include, but are not limited to, the following: MOSAID's
ability to negotiate settlements with licensees; legal rulings and/or
regulatory investigations, audits or complaints having an adverse impact
on the validity, enforceability, royalty rates, potential royalty rates,
and strength or breadth of coverage of MOSAID's essential and/or
nonessential patents (including, but not limited to, adverse results from
litigation or proceedings in patent offices and government regulatory
agencies in various countries around the world); judicial, legislative or
regulatory changes that impair the ability of patent holders to earn
licensing revenues; worldwide economic conditions and demand for
technology products; economic, social, and political conditions both
globally and in the countries in which MOSAID or patent licensees
operate, including conflict, war and, other security risks, health
conditions, possible disruptions in transportation networks and
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; non-payment or delays in
payment by or insolvency of licensees or other debtors; variability in
patent licensees' sales of licensed products; failure to maintain and
enforce MOSAID's existing patent portfolio, or failure to obtain valuable
patents as a result of R activities, or failure to acquire valuable
patents from third parties; MOSAID's ability to recruit and retain
skilled personnel; change in MOSAID's financial position; consolidation
of MOSAID's licensees; natural events, such as severe weather and
earthquakes in the locations in which MOSAID or patent licensees operate;
and changes in the tax rate applicable to MOSAID as the result of changes
in the tax law in the jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be
earned and taxed, the outcome of tax audits and the ability to realize
deferred tax assets. 

    Except as may be required by applicable law or stock exchange regulation,
we undertake no obligation to update publicly or release any revisions to
these forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after
the date of this document or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated
events. Accordingly, readers should not place undue reliance on

			Chevron Sanctions Big Foot Project in the Deepwater Gulf of Mexico
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Development in prolific Miocene trend continues the company&#8217;s 
      progression of attractive projects contributing to U.S. energy supply
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced it has sanctioned 
      development of its $4 billion Big Foot project in the deepwater U.S. 
      Gulf of Mexico.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Sanctioning Big Foot underscores our commitment to the Gulf of Mexico 
      and will contribute to future U.S. energy supply,&#8221; said George Kirkland, 
      vice chairman, Chevron Corporation. &#8220;This project is another example of 
      Chevron&#8217;s disciplined approach to advancing our enviable queue of major 
      capital projects.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Big Foot will be Chevron&#8217;s sixth operated facility in the deepwater Gulf 
      of Mexico and located approximately 225 miles (360 km) south of New 
      Orleans, Louisiana, in water depths of 5,200 feet (1,600 m). The 
      development will utilize a dry tree Extended Tension Leg Platform with 
      an on-board drilling rig and have production capacity of 75,000 barrels 
      of oil and 25 million cubic feet of natural gas per day. First oil is 
      anticipated in 2014.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have industry leading expertise in developing deepwater projects of 
      this type and have repeatedly proven that we can do so safely,&#8221; said 
      Gary Luquette, president, Chevron North America Exploration and 
      Production Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Discovered in 2006, the Big Foot field lies in the Walker Ridge Area and 
      is estimated to contain total recoverable resources in excess of 200 
      million oil-equivalent barrels. Primary pay sands are Middle to Upper 
      Miocene ranging from 19,000 to 24,000 feet (5,800 to 7,300 m) and lie 
      below a salt canopy ranging from 8,000 to 15,000 feet (2,400 to 4,500 m) 
      thick. Three exploration and appraisal wells with multiple sidetracks 
      have been drilled safely and successfully in the field to define the Big 
      Foot structure. Chevron, through its subsidiary Chevron U.S.A. Inc., has 
      a 60 percent working interest in the Big Foot project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is one of the top leaseholders in the Gulf of Mexico, averaging 
      net daily production of 149,000 barrels of crude oil, 484 million cubic 
      feet of natural gas and 14,000 barrels of natural gas liquids during 
      2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron is one of the world&#8217;s leading integrated energy companies, with 
      subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company&#8217;s success is 
      driven by the ingenuity and commitment of its employees and their 
      application of the most innovative technologies in the world. Chevron is 
      involved in virtually every facet of the energy industry. The company 
      explores for, produces and transports crude oil and natural gas; 
      refines, markets and distributes transportation fuels and other energy 
      products; manufactures and sells petrochemical products; generates power 
      and produces geothermal energy; provides energy efficiency solutions; 
      and develops the energy resources of the future, including bio-fuels. 
      Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif. More information about Chevron is

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Dec 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
ToolsGroup, a global provider of supply chain planning (SCP) and
inventory optimization solutions, today announced that the Dynamics AX
integration for SO99AX has reached an important milestone towards
achieving the Certified for Microsoft Dynamics (CfMD) accreditation. The

passed the Software Solution Test for Microsoft Dynamics, which is a
major requirement for Certified for Microsoft Dynamics(R) status. 

    SO99AX is a demand planning and inventory optimization solution for
Microsoft Dynamics AX first introduced at Convergence Atlanta 2010.

planning and collaboration, inventory optimization and replenishment
planning. These modules can be purchased separately, or rolled out over
time, depending on a firm's needs. 

    SO99AX automatically senses the demand signal and demand variability,
understands its statistical nature, and propagates it across the
multi-echelon supply chain in a precise and reliable way. It helps
Microsoft Dynamics customers generate reliable forecasts, accurately and
robustly model inventory behavior at each node in the network, and
eliminate excessive noise in the supply chain.

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG/SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) proprietary trading desk head Morgan Sze is setting up a 20-30 member team to start a Hong Kong-based hedge fund that's expected to raise more than $1 billion, people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The multi-strategy fund, which would be one of the biggest in Asia, is expected to take office space in Hong Kong's ICBC Tower and would start operating in the first quarter of 2011, two people familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team would comprise about 12 analysts and the entire trading desk would come from Goldman, three sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sze needs at least $1 billion just to justify the size of operation," a source familiar with the plan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Financial Times reported earlier on Thursday that Sze, one of Goldman's top paid employees, had started raising money for a new hedge fund to be named Azentus Capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fund may start trading with $1 billion to $1.5 billion and employ a number of strategies, including equity long-short, risk arbitrage and special situation investing, the newspaper said, citing unnamed sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources said Sze is Goldman's highest paid trader, and in 2006 received a bonus of almost $100 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investor confidence is returning after the financial crisis with some $42 billion of net inflows into the hedge fund industry this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Assets in Asian hedge funds crossed $125 billion for the first time since Dec 2008, according to consultancy Eurekahedge, boosted by portfolio gains and inflows as the region's stronger growth prospects attract investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Eurekahedge Asia ex-Japan Index recorded returns of 38.19 percent in 2009 and remains among the best performing hedge fund indices in 2010, with year-to-date gains of 9.36 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VOLCKER RULE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sze's departure, while among the most high profile in the industry, may not be the last, one of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall street banks are in the process of scaling back their proprietary trading desks to comply with the "Volcker rule" and letting some of their traders go, which limits the extent to which they can bet with their own capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is winding down its Principal Strategies Group, a unit of about 70 proprietary traders, while JPMorgan (JPM.N) is reassigning its proprietary traders to its asset management unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) commodity trader departed with a team of proprietary traders in September to set up their own hedge fund. Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) has also cut staff who traded for the bank's account.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The loosely regulated and highly secretive $1.8 trillion hedge fund industry is estimated to employ around 300,000 people worldwide, according to research from industry body the Alternative Investment Management Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Nishant Kumar; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds details of plan, background, quote)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Stephen Aldred and Kevin Lim	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG/SINGAPORE, Dec 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs 
Group Inc proprietary trading desk head Morgan Sze is 
setting up a 20-30 member team to start a Hong Kong-based 
hedge fund that's expected to raise more than $1 billion, 
people familiar with the matter said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The multi-strategy fund, which would be one of the biggest 
in Asia, is expected to take office space in Hong Kong's ICBC 
Tower and would start operating in the first quarter of 2011, 
two people familiar with the matter said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The team would comprise about 12 analysts and the entire 
trading desk would come from Goldman, three sources said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Sze needs at least $1 billion just to justify the size of 
operation," a source familiar with the plan said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs declined to comment.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Financial Times reported earlier on Thursday that Sze, 
one of Goldman's top paid employees, had started raising money 
for a new hedge fund to be named Azentus Capital.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund may start trading with $1 billion to $1.5 billion 
and employ a number of strategies, including equity 
long-short, risk arbitrage and special situation investing, 
the newspaper said, citing unnamed sources.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sources said Sze is Goldman's highest paid trader, and in 
2006 received a bonus of almost $100 million.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investor confidence is returning after the financial 
crisis with some $42 billion of net inflows into the hedge 
fund industry this year.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Assets in Asian hedge funds crossed $125 billion for the 
first time since Dec 2008, according to consultancy 
Eurekahedge, boosted by portfolio gains and inflows as the 
region's stronger growth prospects attract investors.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Eurekahedge Asia ex-Japan Index recorded returns of 
38.19 percent in 2009 and remains among the best performing 
hedge fund indices in 2010, with year-to-date gains of 9.36 
percent.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     	
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; VOLCKER RULE	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sze's departure, while among the most high profile in the 
industry, may not be the last, one of the sources said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wall street banks are in the process of scaling back their 
proprietary trading desks to comply with the "Volcker rule" 
and letting some of their traders go, which limits the extent 
to which they can bet with their own capital.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is winding down its Principal Strategies Group, a 
unit of about 70 proprietary traders, while JPMorgan 
is reassigning its proprietary traders to its asset management 
unit.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Credit Suisse commodity trader departed with a 
team of proprietary traders in September to set up their own 
hedge fund. Bank of America Corp has also cut staff 
who traded for the bank's account. [ID:nN04118596]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The loosely regulated and highly secretive $1.8 trillion 
hedge fund industry is estimated to employ around 300,000 
people worldwide, according to research from industry body the 
Alternative Investment Management Association.

      Metrix&#8482;, the authority in television advertising effectiveness, 
      today announced the Ad-of-the-Week for the week ending December 14, 
      2010. The &#8220;Man Takes Avatar With Him&#8221; ad for Windows Phone 7 from 
      Microsoft, registered the top overall weekly Ace Score&#8482; with a score of 
      623, out of a possible 950. The ad features a man's avatar alter ego 
      playing games on a Windows Phone 7 smartphone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Ad-of-the-Week designates the highest scoring new ad of the week by 
      Ace Score, a patent-pending measure of advertising creative 
      effectiveness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Windows Phone 7 is a new entrant in a fast-changing and fiercely 
      competitive market dominated by Android, Apple, and RIM. Effective 
      creative is critical to brands attempting to establish themselves, as 
      well as brands that are attempting to defend their positions,&#8221; commented

      Using a mix of humor, real people and an Xbox avatar that joins the real 
      world, Microsoft has created an ad high in &#8220;Likeability&#8221;, &#8220;Attention&#8221; 
      and &#8220;Change&#8221;, all Ace Score components, that appeals equally to men and 
      women.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Younger respondents rated the ad higher than older respondents, Ace 
      Score 651 vs. 608, and caught on right away that the boyfriend/avatar 
      was associated with Xbox.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to Daboll, &#8220;We have proven that high Ace Scores drive sales 
      and this is evident in the mobile category. Android and iPhone Ace 
      Scores have dominated the category for the past several months, and 
      their share changes reflect that. It is interesting that Microsoft, 
      being the new entrant in the category with Windows Phone 7, has launched 
      with competitive Ace Scores.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As respondents put it, "It made me laugh with a great dovetailing of 
      Microsoft products" and "Since the Windows phone is a new product and 
      has a lot of competition, it was smart to make the ad appealing."

&lt;p&gt; *Options are being used to position for MA&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; *MA potential is far from "priced-in" to candidates&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; *GS: buy calls, sell longer-dated options on six stocks&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHICAGO, Dec 17 (Reuters) - Investors seem more comfortable
using options to position for potential mergers and takeovers
this year with the U.S. economic backdrop that is supportive of
deals, Goldman Sachs strategists said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We see an increased focus on MA in the options market,"
GS equity derivative strategists wrote in a research report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The increase in MA options speculation has been signaled
in particular by short-dated options trading at a premium to
longer-dated ones on companies that were acquired last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That pattern, known as term structure, is still relatively
modest as positioning ahead of potential deals is not rampant,
the strategists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman strategists said the trend is also highlighted
by a lower skew, meaning call options are well bid compared to
put options among companies considered to be takeover targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After an announcement, the skew tends to move higher as
investors are generally long stock and look to puts to hedge
their downside risk in case the deal does not close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An equity call option grants the right to buy shares at a
fixed price any time until expiration while a put conveys the
right to sell the shares at a fixed price up to a certain
date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While investors appear more comfortable trading MA
expectations with options, it is our view that MA is far from
'priced in' across the board," the strategists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exceptions where MA seems more priced into options are:
Low-cost wireless carrier Leap Wireless International LEAP.O
Inc, baby formula maker Mead Johnson Nutrition Co  (MJN.N),
network equipment maker Brocade Communications Systems Inc
(BRCD.O) and data storage equipment maker NetApp Inc (NTAP.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After MA announcements, volatility tends to fall sharply,
especially for longer-dated options," the strategists said.
This makes selling long-dated options attractive, while large
average stock moves of 30 percent following a deal announcement
supports owning calls, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategists recommend trade ideas on Internet content
delivery company Akamai Technologies Inc (AKAM.O), mining
equipment maker Joy Global Inc JOYG.O, drugmaker Allergan Inc
(AGN.N), U.S. energy exploration company EOG Resources Inc
(EOG.N), satellite television provider DirecTV Group DTV.N,
and EMC Corp (EMC.N) a maker of corporate data storage
equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman sees 15 percent or greater probability of MA
activity in all of these stocks and has positive stock views
outside of MA expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategists recommend buying short-dated calls, while
selling longer-dated options such as so-called strangles to
trade MA potential that is not being adequately reflected in
the options market. The strangles best help investors capture
volatility and stock patterns around MA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A strangle is a strategy consisting of calls and puts with
different strike prices but with the same expiration date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If MA does not materialize, these trades are designed to
perform well if the bullish fundamental views from our analysts
materialize," the strategists said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But embarking on such trades have risks in that the
acquisition does not play out. For example, call buyers risk
the premium paid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Doris Frankel, Editing by Chizu Nomiyama)

&lt;p&gt;
HOUSTON, Dec. 17, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Energy XXI (Nasdaq:EXXI) (LSE:EXXI)
today announced it has completed the previously announced purchase of certain
shallow-water Gulf of Mexico shelf oil and natural gas interests from ExxonMobil
and its affiliates.

The acquisition nearly doubles the company's reserves and production profile,
adding approximately 20,000 net barrels of oil equivalent (BOE) per day of
production, about 53 percent of which is oil, and an estimated 66 million BOE of
net proved and probable reserves, 61 percent of which is oil. Offshore leases
included in the purchase total 130,853 net acres.

"The acquired properties fit our existing assets well, adding nine fields right
in the heart of our producing properties," Energy XXI Chairman and CEO John
Schiller said. "In addition to oil-weighted reserves and production, supported
by an extensive pipeline system, this acquisition includes acreage, seismic data
and field studies that will help us develop a portfolio of attractive drilling
and recompletion opportunities."

Pro forma for the acquisition, estimated proved plus probable reserves increase
72 percent to 158.1 million BOE from 92.1 million BOE at the company's June 30,
2010 fiscal year end. Production increases to approximately 46,000 BOE per day,
up more than 77 percent from the 25,900 BOE per day average in the most recent
fiscal quarter ended Sept. 30, 2010.

The transaction was funded through a combination of cash on hand, borrowings
against the company's $700 million corporate revolver, as amended, and proceeds
from the previously disclosed private placement by the company's operating
subsidiary, Energy XXI Gulf Coast, Inc., of $750 million of 9.25% senior
unsecured notes due 2017, which closed earlier today. Actual funding
requirements at closing totaled $1.01 billion, including the 10 percent deposit
that had been placed in escrow. The purchase remains subject to post-closing
adjustments to reflect actual operating results since the effective date of Dec.
1, 2010.

Glossary

Reserves:

Proved Oil and Gas Reserves -- Those quantities of crude oil and gas, which, by
analysis of geoscience and engineering data, can be estimated with reasonable
certainty to be economically producible -- from a given date forward, from known
reservoirs, and under existing economic conditions, operating methods and
government regulations -- prior to the time at which contracts providing the
right to operate expire, unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably
certain, regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used
for the estimation. The project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced
or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project
within a reasonable time. This definition has been abbreviated from the
definition of "Proved oil and gas reserves" contained in Rule 4-10(a)(22) of SEC
Regulation S-X.

Probable Reserves -- Those additional reserves that are less certain to be
recovered than proved reserves but which, together with proved reserves, are as
likely as not to be recovered. This definition has been abbreviated from the
applicable definition contained in Rule 4-10(a)(18) of SEC Regulation S-X.

Possible Reserves -- Those additional reserves that are less certain to be
recovered than probable reserves. This definition has been abbreviated from the
applicable definition contained in Rule 4-10(a)(17) of Regulation S-X.

Other terms:

Barrel -- unit of measure for oil and petroleum products, equivalent to 42 U.S.
gallons.

BOE -- barrels of oil equivalent, used to equate natural gas volumes to liquid
barrels at a general conversion rate of 6,000 cubic feet of gas per barrel.

BOE/d -- barrels of oil equivalent per day.

Field -- an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all
grouped on, or related to, the same individual geological structural feature or
stratigraphic condition. The field name refers to the surface area, although it
may refer to both the surface and the underground productive formations.

MMBOE -- million barrels of oil equivalent.

&lt;p&gt; * Sellers were Tishman Speyer fund and UBS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * JPMAM spokeswoman says sale price confidential&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Dec 17 (Reuters) - The fund management unit of JP
Morgan (JPM.N) said it had joined a sovereign wealth fund from
Singapore to acquire a 42-storey office tower in Frankfurt's
central business district for an undisclosed sum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of its funds partnered with the real estate arm of the
Government of Singapore Investment Corporation (GIC) to buy the
property from a Tishman Speyer fund and Swiss bank UBS AG
(UBSN.VX), JP Morgan Asset Management (JPMAM) said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMAM spokeswoman declined to disclose the value of the
purchase, which she said was confidential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Capital growth and confidence are returning to the
continental European commercial property sectors, an industry
group had said on Thursday, giving real estate funds their first
positive quarterly value growth since 2007. [ID:nLDE6BF1DS]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 67,200 square metre OpernTurm office tower was built
by U.S. developer Tishman Speyer at the end of 2009, and let to
international tenants including UBS, which occupies about half
the building, and law firm Allen  Overy.

      Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Highlights: Manpower, Vulcan Materials, 
      JPMorgan Chase  Co., U.S. Bancorp&#160;and&#160;BBT
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Zacks Equity Research highlights: 
      Manpower Inc.&#160;(NYSE: MAN) 
      as the Bull of the Day and Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC) 
      as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides 
      analysis on JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM), 
      U.S. Bancorp&#160;(NYSE: USB) 
      and&#160;BBT Corporation&#160;(NYSE: BBT).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bull 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Manpower Inc.'s&#160;(NYSE: MAN) 
      third-quarter 2010 earnings beats the Zacks Consensus Estimate on the 
      heels of revenue growth across all major markets due to increase in 
      demand for temporary labor globally. The company registered revenue 
      growth of 18.7% during the quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Riding on the back of robust results, management now expects 
      fourth-quarter 2010 earnings in the range of $0.54 to $0.62 per share. 
      We believe that Manpower's brand value, comprehensive range of services 
      and a strong global network provides a competitive advantage and 
      reinforces its dominant position in the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Moreover, Manpower stands to benefit from growth prospects in 
      under-penetrated staffing markets. Given the strong fundamentals, we 
      have an Outperform recommendation on the stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bear 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite being the largest producer of construction aggregates and a 
      leading producer of other construction materials,&#160;Vulcan 
      Materials(NYSE: VMC) 
      faces intense competition and a challenging environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The nearly stalled construction business has yet to show positive signs 
      of recovery, jeopardizing the prospects of the building materials and 
      other related products markets. In the most recent quarter, Vulcan 
      failed to live up to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.19 per share by 
      posting a profit of only $0.08.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, its cash position has also deteriorated. Based on the above 
      conditions, we continue with our Underperform recommendation on the 
      stock and set a target price of $36.00.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst 
      Blog:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Tax-Cut Deal: Enough to Boost Jobs?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Is sustaining the Bush-era tax cuts adequate to address unemployment? 
      President Barack Obama&#8217;s tone at a White House event last week gives us 
      confidence, but questions on the efficacy of the tax-cut still lingers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Though the tax-cut deal -- better to say Obama&#8217;s compromise with 
      Republicans to break the deadlock over taxes -- gives Americans 
      increased take-home money, it might significantly increase the nation's 
      federal budget deficit over the next two years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As the pay rise will help increase money supply into the economy, it 
      will create significant jobs. As a result, issues related to 
      unemployment will be addressed considerably, but at the cost of mounting 
      national debt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Imprudent Job Creation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to&#160;Center for American Progress, the deal is 
      expected to create about 3.1 million new jobs in total after adding up 
      different provisions. The estimate is based on the Congressional Budget 
      Office's estimate of one million new jobs for each 1% of GDP growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, based on the same assumption, the Obama administration had 
      previously claimed that the $787 billion American Recovery and 
      Reinvestment Act would create 3.5 million jobs. But the unemployment 
      rate stood at 9.8%. The basic reason for this is that the government is 
      a bit reluctant to create jobs in the private sector directly by 
      implementing rules or laws.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Though the government stimulus packages are able to increase GDP, most 
      of the private sector firms are in the verge of recovering their 
      financial conditions with cost savings via limiting recruitments. We 
      don&#8217;t think the new tax-cut deal will be able to address the 
      unemployment problem to a great extent as many of the companies are 
      still struggling with weak financials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The recession continues to take its toll on banks. There have been 151 
      bank failures so far this year. With loan losses on commercial real 
      estate on the rise, hundreds of more banks are likely to crash in the 
      next few years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bank failures have resulted in a wave of consolidation in the 
      industry. When Washington Mutual was in the red in 2008 and was deemed 
      as the largest bank failure in the U.S. history, it was acquired by&#160;JPMorgan 
      Chase  Co.&#160;(NYSE: JPM). 
      The other major acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include&#160;U.S. 
      Bancorp&#160;(NYSE: USB) 
      and&#160;BBT Corporation&#160;(NYSE: BBT).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If the current pace of consolidation continues, we will see the 
      emergence of a handful of large banks. As a result, the overall economy 
      will not remain unscathed and job creation will become vulnerable.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FedEx Disappoints, But Up on Guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			FedEx Corporation&#160;(NYSE: FDX) 
      reported second quarter of fiscal 2011 financial results that fell below 
      the Zacks Consensus Estimates. Quarterly adjusted EPS of $1.16 was below 
      the Zacks Consensus Estimates of $1.31. Management cited higher fuel 
      costs and the reinstatement of employee compensation and benefit 
      expenditures as the primary reasons for the poor performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Second quarter total revenue was $9,632 million. This was an improvement 
      of 12% year over year, but well below the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 
      $9,749 million. We believe this was mainly due to slower-than-expected 
      growth in international express deliveries. International air-shipment 
      in some of the European countries reduced as a result of ongoing 
      economic turmoil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GAAP net income in the reported quarter was $283 million or 89 cents per 
      share compared to a net income of $345 million or $1.10 per share in the 
      year-ago quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Operating income was $469 million, down 18% year over year from $571 
      million, resulting in operating margin of 4.9% compared with 6.6% in the 
      year-ago quarter. Operating expenses was $9.16 billion, up 14% from the 
      year-ago quarter.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Financial Outlook
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      FedEx has projected earnings in the range of $0.95 to $1.15 per share 
      for the third quarter of 2011. FedEx raised its fiscal 2011 earnings 
      estimate to $5.00 to $5.30 per share from its previous outlook of $4.80 
      to $5.25.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Take
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe FedEx will benefit from moderate economic growth followed by 
      volume growth and strong yield across all the revenue segments will 
      facilitate FedEx to generate strong revenue and earnings growth. 
      Management announced that the company delivered 16 million packages on 
      December 13, 2010 &#8211; the busiest day of the year for FedEx.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Discover Beats Zacks Estimates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Discover Financial Services&#160;(NYSE: DFS) 
      reported a fiscal fourth quarter earnings of $346.5 million or 64 cents 
      per share, well ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 42 cents.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The prior-year quarter posted a net loss of $77.9 million or 14 cents 
      per share, excluding an after-tax gain of approximately $285 million 
      related to the settlement of an antitrust litigation with&#160;Visa 
      Inc.&#160;(NYSE: V) 
      and&#160;MasterCard Inc.&#160;(NYSE: MA).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Discover also posted net income of $765 million in the fiscal 2010, as 
      against the $1.3 billion in the prior year, which included an after-tax 
      gain of $1.2 billion related to the Visa/MasterCard antitrust litigation 
      settlement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The surge in profits was due to significant improvements in the credit 
      quality, as well as gains from the payments business driven by strong 
      volumes. However, these were partially offset by higher-than-expected 
      expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Discover&#8217;s deposit balances originating from direct-to-consumer and 
      affinity relationships increased $1.5 billion from the year-ago quarter 
      to $20.6 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			General Mills Misses Consensus
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			General Mills&#160;(NYSE: GIS) 
      reported results for the second quarter of fiscal 2011. For the quarter, 
      adjusted earnings decreased 1.3% to 76 cents a share compared with 77 
      cents in the year-ago period. The quarterly EPS was also below the Zacks 
      Consensus Estimate of 78 cents by 2.6%. Profits were impacted by higher 
      commodity costs and higher levels of price promotion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Management reiterated its fiscal 2011 earnings in the range of $2.46 - 
      $2.48 a share. Excluding mark-to-market effects and the tax charge 
      related to health care legislation, the fiscal 2011 earnings guidance 
      reflects an annual growth of 7% &#8211; 8%.

</body></entry><entry author="None" date="2010-12-17T13:01:12+0000" url="http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/17/idUS114027+17-Dec-2010+GNW20101217"><headline>IBM and Telvent to Create Smarter Traffic Solutions for Smaller Cities</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;
ROCKVILLE, Md., Dec. 17, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Telvent (Nasdaq:TLVT) and IBM
(NYSE:IBM) announced today that together they will develop smarter traffic
solutions that are affordable and customized for small cities, university and
government campuses and business districts.

While large urban areas like New York, Los Angeles and Houston have well-known
traffic issues, congestion is also common in smaller cities and college campuses
when populations and traffic on the road can spike during rush hour or weekend
football games. It is estimated that even in areas with populations of less than
500,000 people, people spend up to 20 hours a week wasted on delays and it can
cost cities millions of dollars each year.

Today, transportation agencies are largely reactive to traffic issues and focus
on isolated incidents and single areas of congestion. Taking advantage of
predictive analytics and real-time information from road sensors allows agencies
to be more proactive in dealing with traffic and mobility issues. The solution
will apply IBM's advanced analytics and Telvent's traffic management expertise
to give small urban areas visibility for better traffic control and improving
congestion -- at a price point for their budgets.

The solution can integrate and analyze data traffic control, road sensors, bus
schedules, real-time GPS location and IBM's advanced analytics. For example,
small cities could tap data from GPS devices in sensors embedded in the roadway.
They can analyze the information with sophisticated algorithms to predict
traffic jams around a special event or large construction project before they
happen. By predicting where a traffic jams will be in, say, an hour, drivers
could be automatically notified ahead of ahead of time, multiple alternate
routes could be suggested and public transportation schedules could be shifted
to better handle demand. A large university would be able to anticipate and plan
around local constraints on their traffic network like traffic incidents, a
football game or unexpected loss of capacity by adjusting bus scheduling,
parking information, readjusting traffic signals or rerouting traffic flow.
Also, cities can use a wireless system that monitors the availability of parking
spaces.

Transportation networks, no matter the size, are grappling with how to manage
traffic, get more capacity out of existing infrastructure and create more
sustainable transportation solutions. Congestion costs Americans more than $78
billion a year. The U.S. Department of Transportation estimates that combining
the best practices in operational strategies, such as incident management and
optimization of traffic signal control, can reduce total urban travel delay by
500 million hours per yeari.

The new transportation management and analytics system from IBM and Telvent is
an affordable solution that provides real-time visibility across the entire
transportation network and the ability to manage their operations and assets in
a more integrated way. Operators can make quick decisions and adjustments to
solve common traffic management issues and unanticipated congestion. They will
also be able to implement proactive strategies to meet the demands of growing
populations.

"Real-time visibility across an entire transportation network is key to better
traffic management regardless of the size of the area or population," said
Ignacio Gonzalez, Telvent Chief Executive Officer. "We will be combining our
expertise to give small urban areas transportation operators a cost-effective
way to manage the unique mobility issues that they face, helping them improve
operational performance, get more capacity out of their existing transportation
networks and improving travelers' experience."

"Whether it is suburban sprawl, corridors with a number of businesses located
close together or the limited routes across a university campus, existing
infrastructure was not designed to handle the reality of traffic today," said
Rich Varos, Director, Intelligent Transportation Solutions, IBM. "By combining
predictive analytics with the realities of system constraints, transportation
operators of any size can implement more sustainable traffic planning, improved
passenger services and increased efficiencies."

Based on IBM's Government Industry Framework and Telvent's SmartMobility
management suite, solution components include IBM Cognos, IBM Traffic Prediction
Tool, DB2, and Telvent products such as MIST, SmartNET, Telvent SmartMobility
Tolling, Telvent SmartMobility Parking and Integrated Corridor Management (ICM).

			Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc. Provides Business 
      Update and 2011 Guidance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				2010 to produce solid growth; company affirms comparable and pro 
        forma full-year 2010 earnings per diluted common share in a range of 
        $1.74 to $1.78.
			
			
				Share repurchase program is underway and on track for $200 million 
        in purchases during the fourth quarter 2010, with a continued goal of 
        approximately $1 billion in purchases by the end of first quarter 2012.
			
			
				2011 performance expected to generate 10 percent to 12 percent 
        currency neutral, comparable diluted earnings per common share growth.
			
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE: CCE) said today it expects to achieve 2011 
      comparable and currency neutral earnings per diluted common share growth 
      in a range of 10 percent to 12 percent. The company also affirmed its 
      guidance for full-year 2010 in a range of $1.74 to $1.78, reflecting 
      solid business performance and outlook.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, the company said it has initiated a previously disclosed 
      share repurchase plan and expects to repurchase approximately $200 
      million in shares by the close of the fourth quarter 2010. This action 
      is in keeping with the company&#8217;s goal of repurchasing approximately $1 
      billion of its shares by the end of the first quarter 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This guidance reflects performance for all territories of new CCE, a 
      recently registered public company consisting of legacy CCE&#8217;s European 
      bottling operations in Belgium, France, Great Britain, Luxembourg, and 
      the Netherlands, as well as bottling operations in Norway and Sweden 
      acquired from The Coca-Cola Company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our business continues to deliver strong results and create a positive 
      environment for growth in 2011 and beyond,&#8221; said John F. Brock, chairman 
      and chief executive officer. &#8220;We operate in markets with proven growth 
      profiles and excellent potential for the short and long term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our operating expectations for both 2010 and 2011 meet or exceed our 
      long-term growth targets, with our 2011 earnings per share outlook ahead 
      of target as a result of share repurchase,&#8221; Mr. Brock said. &#8220;Though we 
      are a new company, we have a proven record of growth in Europe, and we 
      intend to build on that record in the years ahead.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have solid marketing and operating plans in place going forward, and 
      our commitment to continuous improvement in brand value, effectiveness, 
      and overall customer service will enable us to seize growth 
      opportunities,&#8221; Mr. Brock said. &#8220;We are focused on increasing value for 
      each shareowner and stakeholder by achieving sustained operating growth.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2010 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For full-year 2010, comparable and pro forma earnings per diluted common 
      share is expected in a range of $1.74 to $1.78. Pro forma revenue is 
      expected to be approximately $7.4 billion with operating income just 
      over $900 million. This outlook includes an expected negative currency 
      impact of approximately 10 cents per share based on year-to-date 
      currency translation at actual rates and expected December currency 
      translation at recent rates. It also includes expectations for recurring 
      items, capital structure, tax rate, and results for Norway and Sweden.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On a comparable and currency neutral basis, the company continues to 
      expect legacy Europe to achieve mid single-digit revenue growth and low 
      double-digit operating income growth. The company also expects the 
      combined results of Norway and Sweden to perform in-line with previous 
      expectations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      2010 capital expenditures will total approximately $375 million. The 
      2010 pro forma effective tax rate is expected to be approximately 27 
      percent. Attached are revised 2010 nine-month pro forma results 
      reflecting this tax rate change and the impact of purchase accounting in 
      Norway and Sweden.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			SHARE REPURCHASE
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CCE began repurchasing shares in the fourth quarter, and will spend 
      approximately $200 million in this program by the end of 2010. This 
      program calls for purchases of approximately $1 billion in CCE stock by 
      the end of first quarter 2012. Share repurchase plans may be adjusted 
      depending on economic, operating, or other factors, including 
      acquisition opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			2011 OUTLOOK
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Looking ahead to 2011, the company expects diluted earnings per share to 
      grow in a range of 10 percent to 12 percent, with mid single-digit 
      revenue growth. Comparable operating income growth is expected in a mid 
      single-digit to high single-digit range. This outlook is comparable, 
      currency neutral, and represents growth from 2010, including relevant 
      pro forma financials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The company also expects free cash flow of approximately $425 million, 
      with capital expenditures of approximately $400 million. Weighted 
      average cost of debt is expected to be approximately three percent, and 
      the effective tax rate for 2011 is expected to be in a range of 26 
      percent to 28 percent. Guidance excludes items affecting comparability 
      and is currency neutral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have excellent operating plans in place for 2011, built around our 
      core sparkling Red, Black, and Silver brands and our successful still 
      portfolio expansion,&#8221; said Mr. Brock. &#8220;In addition, we are moving 
      forward with key operating initiatives, including continued route to 
      market improvements and the full integration of our Norway and Sweden 
      territories.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			CONFERENCE CALL
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mr. Brock and Bill Douglas, executive vice president and chief financial 
      officer, will host a conference call with investors and analysts to 
      discuss this guidance today at 10 a.m. ET. The call can be accessed 
      through the company Web site at www.cokecce.com.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Barely two weeks on the job, Pfizer Inc's (PFE.N) new chief executive is already hearing calls to take dramatic action, including potentially breaking up the world's largest drugmaker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But some investors want CEO Ian Read to make more measured moves to get Pfizer's house in order first to help its long-floundering stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fund managers -- including those who own Pfizer shares and those looking for a reason to -- want Read, a 32-year Pfizer veteran, to cut costs, raise the company's dividend and make smarter acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Investment banks may want to break the company up, but I don't see that as a solution right now," said Tom Villalta, lead portfolio manager for Jones Villalta Opportunity Fund, 2 percent of which is invested in Pfizer shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before starting to eliminate parts of the company, I'd like to see Pfizer on a firmer path, so it's not acting from a position of weakness."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read took over last week after the abrupt resignation of Jeffrey Kindler, a lawyer who said he was worn out after nearly five years as CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer on Thursday disclosed that it raised Read's base salary to $1.7 million from $1.21 million and boosted his target annual incentive to about $2.6 million from about $1.2 million. Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amilio also got a raise to a base salary of $1.2 million, up from $1.1 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares had lost more than a third of their value since Kindler took over in July 2006 and have the lowest forward price-to-earnings valuation of all large drugmakers except Sanofi-Aventis. (SASY.PA)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Pfizer's biggest challenge is still to come. Next November, the company faces U.S. generic competition to its Lipitor cholesterol treatment, the biggest selling drug in the world at $11 billion a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts have argued that selling some of Pfizer's businesses would allow it to better capture the value of those assets and make the drugmaker easier to manage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analysts said in a September research report that Pfizer's individual businesses add up to a valuation of $24 per share, about 40 percent above current trading levels. They argued that the market is not recognizing the value of some of Pfizer's non-pharmaceutical divisions, namely animal health, consumer health and nutrition products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs estimated a boost of up to 16.5 percent in 2010 earnings per share if those non-pharma divisions were split off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHEN BIGGER ISN'T BETTER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer became the world's biggest drugmaker by sales after buying U.S. rival Warner-Lambert for $114 billion in 2000. It bulked up further with the $60 billion purchase of Pharmacia in 2003 and the $67 billion merger with Wyeth in October 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer has been an acquirer and has put together the largest drug company in the world," said Jordan Schreiber, senior investment officer for Princeton Capital Management Inc, which does not hold Pfizer. "But the base is now too large for them to show any accretion and growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read, formerly global drugs chief and a consummate Pfizer insider, might seem an unlikely choice to tear apart his employer of the past three decades.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think he is going to be causing evolutionary change ... Read's job is: Get the company's credibility back in the marketplace for the long-term holder," said Scott Richter, who oversees the Fifth Third Disciplined Large Cap Value Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Richter is encouraged by Read's experience in international markets, which could be key to future growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's got the potential to earn this credibility back," Richter said. "I haven't owned it (Pfizer) in a long time and I'm looking at it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many rivals facing major patent losses, Pfizer has been unable to develop enough new medicines to replace Lipitor and other drugs. In Pfizer's case, investors are particularly irked by that shortcoming, given that the company spends nearly $9 billion annually on research and development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest issue ... is we have poured billions upon billions of dollars down into an RD pipeline that just hasn't produced much of anything," said David Heupel, portfolio manager of the $2 billion Thrivent Large Cap Growth Fund. "So let's figure out a better way of doing this ... Something has to change here."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Kindler, Pfizer's most significant strategic move was buying Wyeth, but the stock has not budged since.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors are optimistic Read may exceed Pfizer's cost-cutting goal from the Wyeth deal, largely through sales force layoffs, and that his extensive experience may allow him to find savings in many other corners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bill Smead, portfolio manager of the Smead Value Fund, said Pfizer might need to take a scalpel to its RD budget, the largest in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"My guess is they could have more success with a smaller research budget" and by also selling off assets outside Pfizer's core pharmaceuticals focus. "They shouldn't choose rabbit trails that aren't beneficial."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peter Jankovskis, co-chief investment officer of OakBrook Investments, has considered buying Pfizer shares but remains concerned about the company's "lack of a drug pipeline" and believes it needs more acquisitions to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Heupel said he would "like to see them make some bigger splashes" in buying products in new development areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have bought things that are like $1 billion or so that were early stage," Heupel said. "I'm not saying that's not a wise use of cash, but it's not going to incite any new shareholder base."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's deal-making track record is not without blemishes, notes Schreiber, who cites the company's licensing deal with Medivation Inc (MDVN.O) involving an antihistamine that failed to prove an effective treatment for Alzheimer's disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer's drug output has been awful and they've had a lot of bad deals," Schreiber said. "Investors would also react favorably to a series of dividend increases, share buybacks and acquisitions that are not seriously dilutive."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer took a step in that direction this week when it raised its dividend by 11 percent. Read has also started to make his mark, reorganizing his executive team to eliminate a layer of management under the CEO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's too early to answer the question whether they will turn around," Schreiber said. "I don't see it happening quickly."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Michele Gershberg and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

 (adds detail on expansion plan, RBS statement)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Saeed Azhar	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SINGAPORE, Dec 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan's corporate 
bank has hired a senior banker from Royal Bank of Scotland 
 as its new Asia chief executive, as it seeks more 
business growth from emerging economies.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Muhammad Aurangzeb, who was last head of global banking 
and markets for RBS in Southeast Asia as well as country 
executive for Singapore, will join the U.S. bank in February, 
a JPMorgan spokeswoman confirmed in an email to Reuters.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's global corporate bank manages the firm's

looking to expand in developing markets such as Latin America, 
India, China and Southeast Asia.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guyett told Reuters earlier this month JPMorgan is hiring

 replaces Michael S. Brown who relocated to London this month 
to take on a new role as head of multinational subsidiary

Gaby Abdelnour, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Asia-Pacific.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An RBS spokeswoman confirmed Aurangzeb's departure and

executive, which will be announced after regulatory approval 
is received.

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details
regarding this unique opportunity please visit: www.microcapsdaily.com.

    On Wednesday 12/8/10 dPollution International Inc. (PINK SHEETS - RMGX)
announced that it has received a request for the supply of 3,000 units of
its patented dPollution Device. The units are to be delivered to Stem
Italia S.R.L. of Rome, Italy and distributed to the members of A.N.C.
Associazione Nazionale di Categoria Trasporto Persone e Mobilita, the
association of tourist bus drivers in the Province of Lazio, Italy.
A.N.C. will be acquiring the units to install on its members fleets of
diesel buses to ensure their compliance with the Province of Lazio's new
Low Emission Zone (LEZ) standards, which will be enforced starting in
2011.

    In the United States alone, there are 250 million registered passenger
vehicles and dPollution (RMGX) owns the exclusive manufacturing and
distribution rights to a patented fuel conditioning technology which
significantly increases mileage and lowers harmful GHG emissions.
dPollution's revolutionary device improves engine performance by causing
fuel to combust more thoroughly and efficiently. This technology works on
every internal combustion engine on the planet. Considering that IC
engines are used in cars, buses, trucks, diesel trains, construction
equipment, farm equipment and a variety of military vehicles the market
for this device is virtually limitless. For more information, please

Board focused Wall Street investment advisor. Here at MicroCapsDaily we

      increasingly irrelevant source for finding local telephone numbers. 
      Although the poll found seniors among the most likely to use the phone 
      book, its future looks bleak as its obsolescence increases among younger 
      Americans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The phone book is on life support and local businesses should expect 
      its death to officially occur some time in the next few years,&#8221; said Ron 
      Sachs, President of Ron Sachs Communications. &#8220;Americans are finding the 
      Internet and their cell phones as a more convenient and reliable source 
      for phone numbers over the phone book at a staggering rate, and as a 
      result, phone book advertising is nearly akin to advertising over the 
      telegraph.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to estimates, American businesses spent $13 billion on phone 
      book advertising in 2009 &#8211; more than all of the combined ad sales in the 
      magazine industry. The poll found more than 51 percent of respondents 
      report the phone book has no influence on their purchasing decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      From December 8 through December 14, 1,100 adults were surveyed as part 
      of the Ron Sachs Communications/Mason Dixon Polling  Research, Inc. 
      poll. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Among the polls key findings:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        3 out of every 4 Americans rely on internet and cell phones for 
        finding telephone numbers over the phone book.
      
			
        Only 3 percent of Americans report they have used the phone book in 
        the last week.
      
			
        Nearly 8 out of 10 people 18-29 years old have no use for the phone 
        book.
      
			
        Nearly one quarter of Americans discard their phone books immediately 
        with one third of Americans under the age of 45 reporting they 
        immediately throw away their phone books when delivered to their door.
      
			
        Nearly half of all respondents expect to use their phone book either 
        much less or not at all in 5 years.

			Chevron Corporation: Forensic Expert Discovers Elaborate Forgery 
      of Plaintiffs&#8217; Signatures Authorizing 2003 Complaint Against Chevron in 
      Ecuador
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Forgery and fraud have tainted Ecuadorian lawsuit from inception;
				company 
      seeks nullification and dismissal of Lago Agrio lawsuit
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX)
			today submitted expert analysis 
      from a leading forensic specialist demonstrating that many of the 
      signatures on the document purporting to authorize the lawsuit against 
      Chevron in Lago Agrio, Ecuador, were forged. According to Chevron&#8217;s 
      filing, this newly uncovered evidence of forgery and fraud makes clear 
      that the lawsuit has been tainted with corruption from the very 
      beginning and must be terminated.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Internationally renowned forensic document examiner Gus R. Lesnevich has 
      determined that at least 20 of the 48 signatures on the document that 
      purported to ratify the 2003 complaint and appoint Ecuadorian lawyer 
      Alberto Wray as plaintiffs&#8217; counsel were faked. Lesnevich, who is in the 
      process of analyzing other key documents in the case, discovered the 
      forgeries by comparing the signatures on the document with known copies 
      of the plaintiffs&#8217; signatures from their national identification cards. 
      He also conducted an indentation analysis of the court document using an 
      electrostatic detection device, which revealed the paper bore 
      indentations &#8220;consistent with someone practicing the writing of a 
      signature before actually simulating the signature.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The forensic analysis was filed today in the Provincial Court of 
      Sucumbios along with a motion calling on Judge Nicolas Zambrano to 
      declare the lawsuit &#8220;null and void&#8221; as required by Ecuadorian law. The 
      company also asked the judge to forward the matter to Ecuador&#8217;s 
      Prosecutor General&#8217;s Office for criminal investigation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Ecuadorian authorities cannot continue to ignore the mounting 
      evidence of fraud in the Lago Agrio litigation without violating their 
      duties under the Ecuadorian constitution and international law,&#8221; stated 
      R. Hewitt Pate, Chevron vice president and general counsel. &#8220;We intend 
      to seek full redress against the harm that has been done in the name of 
      the Ecuadorian plaintiffs and to hold accountable all of those who have 
      knowingly participated in this unlawful scheme.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Ecuadorian lawsuit can be accessed at http://scr.bi/faTsoS.

		&lt;p&gt;
      The forgery of the plaintiffs&#8217; signatures is only the most recently 
      discovered fraud on the part of plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers and their cohorts in 
      both the United States and Ecuador. Through a series of discovery 
      actions filed in U.S. federal courts, Chevron in recent months has 
      uncovered overwhelming evidence, including video &#8220;outtakes&#8221; from the 
      film Crude, of blatant misconduct on the part of plaintiffs&#8217; counsel, 
      including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        The submission of fraudulent expert reports purportedly written and 
        signed by Charles W. Calmbacher, Ph.D, a U.S. biologist and industrial 
        hygienist, who later testified in a court-ordered deposition that the 
        reports submitted by plaintiffs&#8217; counsel to the Lago Agrio court in 
        his name were done so without his knowledge or consent, and 
        contradicted his scientific conclusions that he had seen no evidence 
        of any risk to human health at any site remediated by Texaco Petroleum 
        Company;
      
			
        Improper, secret collusion between plaintiffs&#8217; counsel and paid 
        consultants and the Lago Agrio court&#8217;s supposedly neutral &#8220;Global 
        Expert,&#8221; Richard Stalin Cabrera Vega, to create the $27.3 billion 
        damages report that Cabrera fraudulently presented to the Lago Agrio 
        court as his own;
      
			
        Fabrication of scientific evidence of supposed environmental 
        contamination by plaintiffs&#8217; paid consultants and experts; and
      
			
        Intimidation, threats and political pressure directed at Ecuadorian 
        judicial officers and government officials designed to secure a 
        judgment in favor of plaintiffs despite a lack of any legitimate 
        scientific evidence supporting their claims.

&lt;p&gt;The Walt Disney Pictures' TRON: Legacy Generates Approximately $13 Million
Globally in IMAX Box Office Over Opening Weekend

LOS ANGELES, Dec. 20, 2010 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- IMAX Corporation (Nasdaq:IMAX)
(TSX:IMX) and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) announced today the strong
performance of the IMAX release of Walt Disney Pictures' TRON: Legacy, a 3D
high-tech adventure, which opened number one at the box office this weekend.
Domestically, TRON: Legacy generated a total of $44 million in box office, of

Germany and Austria.

"The unique use of IMAX's format has created a special motion picture event that

global distribution for Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. "We're looking
forward to offering TRON fans this special IMAX release through the holidays and

along with director Joe Kosinski, have taken TRON: Legacy and capitalized on the
draw that the IMAX brand has amongst our core fan base, and the results from our
global network of theatres are groundbreaking," said Greg Foster, Chairman and
President, IMAX Filmed Entertainment.  "The combination of TRON: Legacy and IMAX
is a powerful one-two punch that is clearly resonating with audiences. We are
pleased to be a part of this event film, and look forward to its successful run

About TRON: Legacy:

Walt Disney Pictures' TRON: Legacy is a 3D high-tech adventure set in a digital
world that's unlike anything ever captured on the big screen. Sam Flynn (Garrett
Hedlund), a rebellious 27-year-old, is haunted by the mysterious disappearance
of his father Kevin Flynn (Oscar(R)- and Golden Globe(R)-winner Jeff Bridges), a
man once known as the world's leading video-game developer. When Sam
investigates a strange signal sent from the old Flynn's Arcade--a signal that
could only come from his father--he finds himself pulled into a digital world
where Kevin has been trapped for 20 years. With the help of the fearless warrior
Quorra (Olivia Wilde), father and son embark on a life-and-death journey across
a visually stunning cyber universe--a universe created by Kevin himself that has
become far more advanced with never-before-imagined vehicles, weapons,
landscapes and a ruthless villain who will stop at nothing to prevent their
escape. Presented in Disney Digital 3DTM and scored by Grammy(R) Award-winning
electronic music duo Daft Punk, TRON: Legacy hits U.S. theaters on Dec. 17,
2010, in Disney Digital 3DTM, Real D 3D and IMAX(R) 3D.

TRON: Legacy stars Jeff Bridges, Garrett Hedlund, Olivia Wilde, Bruce
Boxleitner, James Frain, Beau Garrett and Michael Sheen.

The film is directed by Joseph Kosinski and produced by Sean Bailey, Jeffrey
Silver and Steven Lisberger with Donald Kushner serving as executive producer.
Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz wrote the screenplay. The story is by Edward
Kitsis &amp; Adam Horowitz and Brian Klugman &amp; Lee Sternthal, based on characters
created by Steven Lisberger and Bonnie MacBird.

TRON: Legacy is being distributed worldwide by Walt Disney Studios Motion
Pictures. This film has been rated PG for sequences of sci-fi action violence
and brief mild language.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. bank JPMorgan has bought two major office properties in London, including the former Lehman Brothers building, holding off on plans to build a skyscraper as its main European headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan bought the Lehman building in the Canary Wharf financial district for 495 million pounds ($773 million) from the Canary Wharf Group (CWG), to group together all of its investment bank in London.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also said on Monday it was still reviewing its use of a skyscraper complex with an estimated cost of 1.5 billion pounds nearby -- a site it bought in late 2008 as part of a long-term ambition to consolidate its London properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That will be a project that continues ... and George (Iacobescu, CWG chief executive) and I will talk about the best utilization for that," JPMorgan chief administrative officer Frank Bisignano told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank was committed to having offices in both the City of London financial district -- where it bought the 60 Victoria Embankment site it has been leasing -- as well as in Canary Wharf, a second financial district in London's former Docklands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Under one roof has never been the sole objective because when you think about the workforce and all the things we do, we will always have a presence in the center of London and out here (Canary Wharf)," Bisignano said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Work stopped on the Riverside South site earlier this year, triggering talk JPMorgan, feeling the heat from negative sentiment against banks after the crisis, would axe the conspicuous project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That work will now continue, with foundations having already been laid for a 2.4 million square foot development, more than twice the size of the 1 million sq ft Lehman building, while JPMorgan reviews its use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Short term, we will be building it up to street level and then we will obviously also be reviewing what is best to go on that site," John Garwood, a spokesman for CWG, majority owned by Songbird Estates, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Songbird, whose top shareholders include Qatar's sovereign wealth fund and China Investment Corp, were up 3.1 percent at 139.8 pence by 1350 GMT (8:50 a.m.), ahead of a British property stocks index up 0.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONDON CALLING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said it bought the 420,000 square feet property on 60 Victoria Embankment from private equity firm the Carlyle Group for an undisclosed price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It had been leasing the property, near the Bank of England and within the City of London, since 1991 for its Treasury and Securities Services division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These properties are long-term investments and represent our continued commitment to London as one of the world's most important financial centers," JPMorgan chairman and chief executive Jamie Dimon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bisignano denied the investments were a risky bet on the direction of a commercial real estate market still recovering from its worst downturn in decades. "We do business here. We are a buyer of space and we are occupying the space," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's relationship with bankers has remained uneasy, with business secretary Vince Cable saying on Sunday banks should not underestimate the government's determination to act on pay and bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;London mayor Boris Johnson, present at the news conference, said: "What they (JPMorgan) really wanted to hear from us was that London was receptive, that the political environment was not hostile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's investment bank will move into 25 Bank Street, previously occupied by failed Wall Street rival Lehman, by 2012, turning it into the unit's European headquarters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its head, Jes Staley, signaled JPMorgan had no imminent plans to change the size of its 11,000-plus London workforce: "There is no plan to grow, no plan to shrink, probably where we are is pretty good for right now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Quentin Webb; Editing by Douwe Miedema; Editing by Dan Lalor)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1 = 0.6400 pound)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(See www.reutersrealestate.com for the global service for real estate professionals from Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

			Coca-Cola Hellenic Greece Wins European Excellence Awards for Water 
      Preservation Campaign
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Hellenic Greece has won the top prize for its "Mission Water" 
      initiative in the European Excellence Awards 20101.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The annual awards, which took place at the Zofin Palace in Prague, 
      honour the most outstanding achievements in communications from across 
      Europe. The Mission Water2 campaign took the top spot in the 
      &#8216;Greece and Cyprus national  regional campaigns&#8217; category.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The winning programme, which was created to address acute water scarcity 
      in the Mediterranean region and the Greek islands in particular, 
      highlighted the urgent need to manage water in the country and engaged 
      citizens in effectively protecting and preserving water resources.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Its primary focus was the reintroduction of rainwater harvesting systems 
      in eight Cycladic islands including Santorini, Naxos and Syros, 
      supporting the freshwater needs of 5,500 residents by providing 
      facilities capable of collecting and storing 650,000 litres per year. 
      Training seminars were conducted to help local technicians to build and 
      maintain the harvesting systems. Together with the Hellenic Ministry of 
      Education, Coca-Cola Hellenic introduced an educational kit to instruct 
      teachers and students about effective water management &#8211; encouraging 
      young residents to play an active role in water preservation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, a major clean-up of Kerkini Lake, was also organised, in 
      partnership with UNESCO and local authorities, in which some 1,500 
      volunteers helped restore the area by collecting 2,800 tonnes of litter. 
      Kerkini Lake, a Special Protection Area declared a Ramsar site, is a 
      very important area to breeding, passage and wintering birds under EU 
      law and is one of the 10 wetlands of International Importance in Greece.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Commenting on the success of the campaign, the Public Affairs and 
      Communication Director of Coca-Cola Hellenic Greece, Mr. Vassilios 
      Lolas, said: &#8220;The Mission Water campaign has been a huge success and has 
      had a positive impact on many parts of the community who have helped to 
      preserve this valuable resource. It is terrific that the campaign has 
      won this award, but the real winners are the local residents of the 
      islands, who have taken our message to heart and learned to effectively 
      protect their water resources.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This year, more than 1,400 entries were submitted for the European 
      Excellence Awards in 58 categories. Coca-Cola Hellenic was also 
      shortlisted for its Romanian HR programme 'Talents on Board', where an 
      innovative communications campaign targeted high-performing graduates to 
      join the company&#8217;s summer internship programme. A "career website" was 
      set up online, along with a dedicated Facebook page, a video on YouTube, 
      and an internship newsletter. A "Career Aspiration Quiz" attracted more 
      than 400 entrants. Overall, the project attracted 5,700 applications for 
      employment positions. The company selected 12 to become interns. In an 
      independently conducted survey, Coca-Cola Hellenic Romania was judged 
      the "Employer of Choice" among all the top businesses in the country.

      The &#8220;Mission Water&#8221; Campaign used a variety of communications tools to 
      convey the water protection message as widely as possible, including 
      campaigns on the internet, radio, and print. A video was produced, 
      letters were sent to stakeholders, leaflets distributed, and large-scale 
      presentations given at retail outlets.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Avnet 
      Technology Solutions, the IT solutions distribution leader and 
      operating group of Avnet, 
      Inc. (NYSE: AVT),

      strong backgrounds in channel sales and services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brown joins Avnet with extensive IBM experience, which she will draw 
      from to accelerate the sale of services through Avnet&#8217;s IBM partner 
      channel. Brown will work with Avnet&#8217;s IBM team and partners to provide 
      the skills and expertise needed to sell and deliver services, including

      Services, IBM maintenance services, after-market services and 
      emerging service offerings such as cloud-based IT data solutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Most recently, Brown served as the vice president of business partner 
      sales, general business at IBM. Her responsibilities focused on 
      increasing the success and penetration of channel sales in the small to 
      mid-sized business (SMB) market. In this position, she provided 
      customer-facing resellers, systems integrators and distributors with 
      targeted incentives, solutions, enablement, demand generation support,

      Her IBM career spanned numerous positions of leadership, including vice 
      president of channel sales west region, global client executive for 
      Avnet, director of operations channel management North America, and 
      other sales management positions in software and services. Brown&#8217;s 
      achievements at IBM were recognized by CRN magazine in 2009, when 
      she was named to their list of the 100 
      Most Powerful Women of the Channel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As the vice president of field sales for Avnet&#8217;s HP Solutions group, 
      McCullagh will use her years of experience in the technology industry to 
      support Avnet&#8217;s HP partner channel in the U.S. She will manage Avnet&#8217;s 
      HP field sales teams across the region and work closely with partners to 
      help them profitably grow by leveraging Avnet&#8217;s SolutionsPath&#174; 
      methodology and practices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In her technology industry career, McCullagh was a senior executive with 
      Compaq in both channel sales and marketing roles. She also spent two 
      years at CompTIA, the Computer Technology Industry Association, creating 
      membership programs and services for channel partner members. Most 
      recently, she served as vice president of distribution and sales 
      operations at D-Link Systems, Inc. Prior to D-Link Systems, she was the 
      president, North America, for GN Netcom, Inc., a leading manufacturer of

      According to&#160;Center for American Progress, the deal is

      occur; the unemployment rate stands at 9.8%. And the government had not 
      created jobs in the private sector directly by implementing rules or 
      laws.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Though the government stimulus packages are able to increase GDP, most 
      of the private sector firms are on the verge of recovering their 
      financial conditions with cost savings by limiting recruitments. We 
      don&#8217;t think the new tax-cut deal will be able to address the 
      unemployment problem to a great extent as many of the companies are 
      still struggling with weak financials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The recession continues to take its toll on banks. There have been 151 
      bank failures so far this year. With loan losses on commercial real 
      estate on the rise, hundreds of more banks are likely to crash in the 
      next few years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bank failures have resulted in a wave of consolidation in the 
      industry. When Washington Mutual was in the red in 2008 it was deemed as 
      the largest bank failure in the U.S. history, and was acquired by&#160;JPMorgan 
      Chase  Co.&#160;(NYSE: JPM). 
      The other major acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include&#160;U.S. 
      Bancorp&#160;(NYSE: USB) 
      and&#160;BBT Corporation&#160;(NYSE: BBT).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If the current pace of consolidation continues, we will see the 
      emergence of a handful of large banks. As a result, the overall economy 
      will not remain unscathed and job creation will again become difficult.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Xilinx Downgraded to Neutral
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We recently downgraded our recommendation on&#160;Xilinx Inc.&#160;(Nasdaq: 
      XLNX) to Neutral 
      from Outperform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe Xilinx lost market share to&#160;Altera Corporation&#160;(Nasdaq: 
      ALTR) in 2010. 
      Altera&#8217;s lead at the 40 nm technology node can bring about a market loss 
      for Xilinx in the coming years as well.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Capital spending by carriers in China is also expected to slow down in 
      2011, leading to an inventory correction across the semiconductor space, 
      which should impact Xilinx as communications is the largest end-market 
      the&#160;company serves.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Earlier, Xilinx reported lackluster results for the second quarter and 
      provided a disappointing guidance for the third quarter. The outlook for 
      the next quarter was below expectations. Xilinx projects sales to be 
      flat to down 4% sequentially in the third quarter of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This implies a revenue guidance of $594.9 &#8211; $619.7 million. Sales from 
      communications are expected to be approximately flat as increases in 
      wired communication are offset by decreases from wireless communications.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Industrial and other sales are expected to be approximately flat as 
      increases in defense sales are offset by decreases in industrial 
      scientific and medical as well as test and measurement. Consumer and 
      automotive sales are expected to be up, driven by increases in 
      automotive and audio video broadcast. Data processing sales are expected 
      to decrease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Xilinx forecasts a gross margin of 65%, +/- a percentage point. 
      Operating expenses in the December quarter are estimated to be 
      approximately $190 million, an increase of 3.4% sequentially primarily 
      due to a restructuring charge of $4 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While XLNX had the lead at 65nm (Virtex 5), prime competitor Altera has 
      the lead at 40nm. Altera started shipping its 40nm products in late 2008 
      while Xilinx began shipping its next generation Virtex 6 (40nm) products 
      in 2009 only. Xilinx has lost market share to Altera in 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Altera seemed to have an edge at the 28nm node. It shipped 
      its first samples in July 2010 while Xilinx will ship its samples in the 
      first quarter of 2011.

&lt;p&gt;  EDEN PRAIRIE, MN, Dec 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Xiotech Corporation, the ISE Company, today announced that a single ISE
storage blade delivered unparalleled performance in a test simulating a
27,000-user Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 environment.

    Within the framework of Microsoft Exchange 2010 Solution Reviewed Program
(ESRP) -- Storage v3.0, Xiotech conducted tests of its Emprise(TM) 5000
storage blade. One Emprise 5000 sustained 27,000 mailboxes (400 MB in
size) on three Exchange 2010 Mailbox Servers with an I/O profile of 0.05
IOPS/mailbox, or -- based on Microsoft Corp.'s estimated IOPS per mailbox
-- the equivalent of sending and receiving 50 messages per day. Notably,
the results were achieved in 3U (5.25 inches) of rack space, and at
capacity utilization rates of more than 94 percent -- a performance
density unequalled by traditional storage solutions whose performance
suffers at maximum capacity.

    "ISE is designed to meet the performance, linear scalability and
reliability demands of enterprise Exchange 2010 deployments, regardless
of size," said Steve Sicola, Chief Technology Officer at Xiotech. "This
balance is particularly beneficial when non-transactional loads are
placed on organizations' Exchange databases during a normal workday. With
tremendous performance density, ISE is an extremely compelling,
cost-effective alternative to more expensive SAN solutions."

    ISE storage blades are optimized for performance. Using patented groups
of drives working together, adaptive caching and active-active
controllers in just 3U, or 5.25 inches of vertical rack space, ISE
storage blades deliver the equivalent of 2x the IOPS per disk drive
versus standard storage solutions. This patented design results in
exceptional performance in high I/O environments, without the bottlenecks
found in other storage architectures.

    ESRP -- Storage is a Microsoft Exchange Server program designed to
facilitate third-party storage testing and solution publishing for
Exchange Server. Customers can use the solutions published here to help
plan/design their own Exchange storage architectures. For complete
details on Xiotech's most recent published ESRP test, please see the
white paper titled, "Xiotech Emprise 5000 - 27,000 Mailbox Resiliency
Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 Solution."

    About ISE
 Representing a new way to acquire and scale storage, ISE is a
revolutionary, high-performance 3U storage blade that can be deployed
anywhere in the physical or virtual datacenter. Based on Xiotech's
patented storage innovations, ISE sets new standards for data storage
performance, reliability, scalability and value. Featuring a "zero-touch"
design, ISE is backed by an unprecedented 5-year, 24x7 hardware warranty.

    About Xiotech, The ISE Company

leading provider of high-performance storage blades, purpose built for

			Grupo Televisa and Univision Complete Transaction, Expanding and 
      Extending Their Strategic Relationship in the U.S.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The world's leading Spanish-language media companies &#8211; Univision 
      Communications Inc. (&#8220;Univision&#8221;) and Grupo Televisa, S.A.B. 
      (&#8220;Televisa&#8221;, NYSE: TV; BMV: TLEVISA CPO) &#8211; today announced the 
      completion of Televisa&#8217;s previously-announced investment in Univision 
      and the significant expansion and extension of the Program License 
      Agreement (the &#8220;PLA&#8221;) between the two companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This transaction further strengthens the largest content and 
      multi-distribution media platform for the growing U.S. Hispanic 
      community, and enables both companies to enhance their respective 
      business potential and value creation opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a result of the successful refinancing of the majority of Univision&#8217;s 
      debt, upon completion of the Televisa investment and application of the 
      net proceeds to repay a portion of the Univision 2015 senior notes, the 
      term of the PLA will be extended to at least 2025 or seven and one-half 
      years after Televisa has sold most of its initial investment in 
      Univision. The companies also noted that in addition to the U.S. PLA, 
      which now includes Televisa programming for Univision&#8217;s traditional and 
      digital media platforms, the two companies have also signed a program 
      license agreement for the territory of Mexico (the &#8220;Mexico License 
      Agreement&#8221;) under which Televisa has received the right to broadcast 
      Univision&#180;s content in Mexico .
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In connection with the investment, three Televisa representatives joined 
      the Univision Board of Directors, which increased to 20 members. Emilio 
      Azc&#225;rraga Jean, Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of 
      Grupo Televisa, Alfonso de Angoitia, Executive Vice President of Grupo 
      Televisa, and Enrique F. Senior Hern&#225;ndez, Managing Director of Allen  
      Company LLC., were named to the Board of Univision. Additionally, Jos&#233; 
      Bast&#243;n Pati&#241;o, President of Television and Contents and Member of the 
      Executive Committee of Grupo Televisa, was named alternate member to the 
      Board of Directors of Univision.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Emilio Azc&#225;rraga Jean said, &#8220;We are very pleased that we have moved 
      rapidly from our initial announcement to the completion of this 
      transaction. Our content has reached U.S. Hispanic audiences through 
      Univision for many years. With a rapidly growing Hispanic population and 
      increasing success of our content in the United States, this is a very 
      appropriate moment in time to expand our content offerings and extend 
      our agreement with Univision.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Haim Saban, Chairman of Univision Communications, on behalf of Univision 
      owner Broadcasting Media Partners, Inc., which includes Madison Dearborn 
      Partners, Providence Equity Partners, TPG Capital, Thomas H. Lee 
      Partners and Saban Capital Group said, &#8220;With the expansion and extension 
      of the PLA, Univision can now better serve our audience. This further 
      strengthens our unique relationship with the dynamic U.S. Hispanic 
      community. The transaction brings together teams from both companies 
      working in close partnership to identify initiatives aimed at further 
      driving Univision&#8217;s success as one of the leading media companies in the 
      U.S.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have been working with Univision since the initial announcement to 
      better explore the opportunities that can be created. We are excited 
      about our findings and ready to start their implementation now that we 
      have completed this transaction,&#8221; commented Alfonso de Angoitia. &#8220;We are 
      very enthusiastic about the opportunity to create additional value to 
      shareholders of both companies through these initiatives.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are very pleased to have completed this value-creating transaction, 
      which will significantly enhance Univision&#8217;s world-class multi-platform 
      offerings for viewers and clients while considerably strengthening the 
      Company&#8217;s balance sheet. The refinancing of Univision&#8217;s debt was 
      completed on terms that exceeded our expectations, reflecting the 
      financial community&#8217;s confidence in our business and its future. We look 
      forward to leveraging the full potential of this strategic partnership 
      going forward to better serve our audience and build on our strong 
      foundation to achieve additional growth,&#8221; said Joe Uva, Chief Executive 
      Officer of Univision Communications Inc.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Dec 20 (Reuters) - Ben Stiller's underdog comedy
"Dodgeball" and a Tom Cruise film famed for its shouts of "show
me the money" were pressed into service as London's mayor sought
to ensure JPMorgan (JPM.N) committed to a new European base.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; On Monday the U.S. bank said it would buy the former
European headquarters of Lehman Brothers in Canary Wharf, east
London, after months of deliberations. [ID:nLDE6BJ0G9]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; London Mayor Boris Johnson said he swapped favourite films
with JPMorgan's (JPM.N) Chief Administrative Officer Frank
Bisignano as part of the discussions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Johnson said he gave Bisignano the "truly brilliant"
"Dodgeball", about a small-time gym owner who fends off a bigger
rival, in return for "Jerry Maguire", Cruise's 1996 comedy about
a sports agent struck by a crisis of conscience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The key point about Dodgeball is a wonderful old fashioned
institution called Average Joe's overcomes the challenge of
Globo Gym, and I've absolutely no doubt that with the kind of
investment that we've seen on the scale today that London will
overcome global competition," Johnson told a news conference.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN DIEGO, CA, Dec 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Lpath, Inc. (OTCBB: LPTN) has entered into an agreement providing Pfizer
(NYSE: PFE) with an exclusive option for a worldwide license to develop
and commercialize iSONEP(TM), Lpath's lead monoclonal antibody product
candidate, which is being evaluated for the treatment of wet age-related
macular degeneration (wet AMD) and other ophthalmology disorders. 

    iSONEP is scheduled to begin a Phase 1b clinical trial in wet AMD
patients with Pigment Epithelial Detachment (PED), a complication of wet
AMD, in the first quarter of 2011 and a Phase 2a clinical trial in wet
AMD patients in the second quarter of 2011.

    Generated via Lpath's proprietary ImmuneY2(TM) drug-discovery platform,
iSONEP is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes the
bioactive lipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Targeting S1P is a novel
approach to address serious unmet medical needs in wet AMD, a condition
that affects millions worldwide. In iSONEP's completed phase I trial in
wet AMD patients, several subjects showed signs of biological activity,
including lesion regression and complete resolution of PED.

    Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will provide Lpath with an
upfront option payment of $14 million in addition to sharing the cost of
the planned Phase 1b and Phase 2a trials. Following completion of the two
studies, Pfizer has the right to exercise its option for worldwide rights
to iSONEP for an undisclosed option fee and, if Pfizer exercises its
option, Lpath will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and
commercial milestone payments that could total up to $497.5 million; in
addition, Lpath will be entitled to receive tiered double-digit royalties
based on sales of iSONEP. As part of the agreement, Lpath has granted to
Pfizer a time-limited right of first refusal for ASONEP(TM), Lpath's
product candidate that is being evaluated for the treatment of cancer.
Two Phase 2a trials are currently planned to further assess ASONEP's
efficacy and safety in cancer patients.

    "We have been impressed by Lpath's innovative approach in targeting
bioactive lipids with iSONEP and the potential opportunity to
significantly add to current standards of treatment in retinal disease,"
said Mikael Dolsten, president of Pfizer Worldwide Research and
Development. 

    "This risk sharing collaboration is led by our External Research Unit,
whose mission is to develop high-impact medicines leveraging a virtual
R model. We look forward to building the External Research Unit's
portfolio through additional innovative deals with prospective future
partners," added Uwe Schoenbeck, Pfizer's VP and CSO of External R
Innovation. 

    "We are thrilled to partner with Pfizer, a company that has demonstrated
a commitment to innovative solutions and partnerships for the development
of treatments across a wide spectrum of disease," said Scott Pancoast,
chief executive officer of Lpath. "As we work with the Pfizer team to
advance iSONEP through the next stage of clinical development, we expect
to further demonstrate the important role that bioactive lipids play in
disease processes. Lpath's unique ability to generate monoclonal
antibodies to these targets presents a wealth of potential opportunity
for new and innovative medicines over time."

    About iSONEP
 iSONEP is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and
inhibits the function of the S1P ligand (sphingosine-1-phosphate).
Growing evidence suggests that the bioactive lipid S1P may contribute to
both the early and the late stages of maladaptive retinal remodeling
associated with wet AMD. S1P has demonstrated a non-VEGF-dependent
pro-angiogenic effect and several other effects not exhibited by VEGF in
nonclinical models. Therefore, inhibiting the action of S1P may be a
novel and effective therapeutic treatment for wet AMD that may offer
significant advantages over exclusively anti-VEGF approaches (or act
synergistically with them) to address the complex processes and multiple
steps that ultimately lead to vision loss. 

    About Lpath
 San Diego-based Lpath, a therapeutic antibody company, is
the category leader in lipidomics-based therapeutics, an emerging field
of medicine that targets bioactive signaling lipids for treating a wide
range of human disease. Lpath's ImmuneY2(TM) drug-discovery engine has
the unique ability to generate therapeutic antibodies that bind to and
inhibit bioactive lipids that contribute to disease. The company is
advancing three drug candidates, two of which -- iSONEP for wet AMD and
ASONEP for cancer -- have completed Phase 1 clinical trials. For more
information, visit www.Lpath.com. 

    About Forward-Looking Statements
 Except for statements of historical
fact, the matters discussed in this press release are forward looking and
reflect numerous assumptions and involve a variety of risks and
uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and may cause actual
results to differ materially from stated expectations. For example, there
can be no assurance that the agreement between Lpath and Pfizer will
continue for any length of time or that the milestones stated in such
agreement will be met. In addition, there is no assurance that results
will be timely, necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained, the
proposed treatments will prove to be safe or effective, or required
clinical trials will be ultimately successful. Actual results may also
differ substantially from those described in or contemplated by this
press release due to risks and uncertainties that exist in our operations
and business environment, including, without limitation, our limited
experience in the development of therapeutic drugs, our dependence upon
proprietary technology, our history of operating losses and accumulated
deficits, our reliance on research grants, current and future
competition, and other risks described from time to time in our filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation
to release publicly the results of any revisions to these forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date
hereof.

(NYSE: PFE) with an exclusive option for a worldwide license to develop
and commercialize iSONEP(TM), Lpath's lead monoclonal antibody product
candidate, which is being evaluated for the treatment of wet age-related
macular degeneration (wet AMD) and other ophthalmology disorders. 

    iSONEP is scheduled to begin a Phase 1b clinical trial in wet AMD
patients with Pigment Epithelial Detachment (PED), a complication of wet
AMD, in the first quarter of 2011 and a Phase 2a clinical trial in wet
AMD patients in the second quarter of 2011.

    Generated via Lpath's proprietary ImmuneY2(TM) drug-discovery platform,
iSONEP is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds and neutralizes the
bioactive lipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). Targeting S1P is a novel
approach to address serious unmet medical needs in wet AMD, a condition
that affects millions worldwide. In iSONEP's completed phase I trial in
wet AMD patients, several subjects showed signs of biological activity,
including lesion regression and complete resolution of PED.

    Under the terms of the agreement, Pfizer will provide Lpath with an
upfront option payment of $14 million in addition to sharing the cost of
the planned Phase 1b and Phase 2a trials. Following completion of the two
studies, Pfizer has the right to exercise its option for worldwide rights
to iSONEP for an undisclosed option fee and, if Pfizer exercises its
option, Lpath will be eligible to receive development, regulatory and
commercial milestone payments that could total up to $497.5 million; in
addition, Lpath will be entitled to receive tiered double-digit royalties
based on sales of iSONEP. As part of the agreement, Lpath has granted to
Pfizer a time-limited right of first refusal for ASONEP(TM), Lpath's
product candidate that is being evaluated for the treatment of cancer.
Two Phase 2a trials are currently planned to further assess ASONEP's
efficacy and safety in cancer patients.

    "We have been impressed by Lpath's innovative approach in targeting
bioactive lipids with iSONEP and the potential opportunity to
significantly add to current standards of treatment in retinal disease,"
said Mikael Dolsten, president of Pfizer Worldwide Research and
Development. 

    "This risk sharing collaboration is led by our External Research Unit,
whose mission is to develop high-impact medicines leveraging a virtual
R model. We look forward to building the External Research Unit's
portfolio through additional innovative deals with prospective future
partners," added Uwe Schoenbeck, Pfizer's VP and CSO of External R
Innovation. 

    "We are thrilled to partner with Pfizer, a company that has demonstrated
a commitment to innovative solutions and partnerships for the development
of treatments across a wide spectrum of disease," said Scott Pancoast,
chief executive officer of Lpath. "As we work with the Pfizer team to
advance iSONEP through the next stage of clinical development, we expect
to further demonstrate the important role that bioactive lipids play in
disease processes. Lpath's unique ability to generate monoclonal
antibodies to these targets presents a wealth of potential opportunity
for new and innovative medicines over time."

    About iSONEP
 iSONEP is a humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to and
inhibits the function of the S1P ligand (sphingosine-1-phosphate).
Growing evidence suggests that the bioactive lipid S1P may contribute to
both the early and the late stages of maladaptive retinal remodeling
associated with wet AMD. S1P has demonstrated a non-VEGF-dependent
pro-angiogenic effect and several other effects not exhibited by VEGF in
nonclinical models. Therefore, inhibiting the action of S1P may be a
novel and effective therapeutic treatment for wet AMD that may offer
significant advantages over exclusively anti-VEGF approaches (or act
synergistically with them) to address the complex processes and multiple
steps that ultimately lead to vision loss. 

    About Lpath
 San Diego-based Lpath, a therapeutic antibody company, is
the category leader in lipidomics-based therapeutics, an emerging field
of medicine that targets bioactive signaling lipids for treating a wide
range of human disease. Lpath's ImmuneY2(TM) drug-discovery engine has
the unique ability to generate therapeutic antibodies that bind to and
inhibit bioactive lipids that contribute to disease. The company is
advancing three drug candidates, two of which -- iSONEP for wet AMD and
ASONEP for cancer -- have completed Phase 1 clinical trials. For more

    About Forward-Looking Statements
 Except for statements of historical
fact, the matters discussed in this press release are forward looking and
reflect numerous assumptions and involve a variety of risks and
uncertainties, many of which are beyond our control and may cause actual
results to differ materially from stated expectations. For example, there
can be no assurance that the agreement between Lpath and Pfizer will
continue for any length of time or that the milestones stated in such
agreement will be met. In addition, there is no assurance that results
will be timely, necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained, the
proposed treatments will prove to be safe or effective, or required
clinical trials will be ultimately successful. Actual results may also
differ substantially from those described in or contemplated by this
press release due to risks and uncertainties that exist in our operations
and business environment, including, without limitation, our limited
experience in the development of therapeutic drugs, our dependence upon
proprietary technology, our history of operating losses and accumulated
deficits, our reliance on research grants, current and future
competition, and other risks described from time to time in our filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. We undertake no obligation
to release publicly the results of any revisions to these forward-looking
statements to reflect events or circumstances arising after the date
hereof.

			Customer Solutions Group to Use Microsoft&#8217;s Cloud for New 
      Multi-Channel Real-Time Shopping Platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Location-Agnostic Consumer Platform Uses Windows Azure To Give 
      Cyber-Shoppers Instant Price Incentives
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cloud-based consumer applications are becoming more and more familiar 
      and now Customer 
      Solutions Group, LLC (CSG), a Colorado-based start-up focused on 
      consumer-facing retail solutions, has announced it will be launching a 
      cloud-based shopping platform powered by Microsoft&#8217;s 
      Windows Azure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The platform will allow retailers to offer features that organize 
      shopping so consumers can find the best product at the best price easily 
      and efficiently and retailers can motivate and influence buying 
      decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Retailers are continually seeking ways to reach and grow loyalty 
      amongst consumers who are immersed in their digital lives, social 
      networking and rich online interactions,&#8221; said David Gruehn, director, 
      U.S. retail industry solutions, Microsoft Corp. &#8220;Cloud-based 
      applications help bridge the gap between online and brick-and-mortar 
      stores, providing a differentiated and connected shopping experience. 
      For example, CSG&#8217;s platform powered by Windows Azure will provide 
      real-time comparative pricing, giving retailers the ability to match or 
      beat a competitor&#8217;s price instantly.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This technology will provide an &#8220;always with you&#8221; resource to compare 
      products, prices and receive retailer incentives, for the first time, 
      all in real-time and based on shopping behavior. By utilizing the 
      real-time &#8220;power of the crowd&#8221; across the Web and the power of the 
      Windows Azure platform, this will provide customers with complete price 
      surveys on products and allow retailers to promote and/or adjust their 
      own prices in real-time to remain competitive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Comparison shopping can be overwhelming and existing on-line shopping 
      tools require far too much effort and shopping &#8216;side trips&#8217; to sites 
      across the Web,&#8221; said Patrick Carter, founder and president, CSG. &#8220;We 
      believe comparison shopping should be engaging, fun and economically 
      rewarding. Our platform makes the entire Web your store, provides 
      real-time re-pricing capabilities for retailers, and makes social 
      shopping real-time. We make it visually rewarding and accessible at 
      home, on your mobile phone, or in the store.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;That kind of dynamic experience and access can only really work using a 
      cloud-based platform like Windows Azure.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Chevron (CVX.N) said on Monday it had suspended production from an oil pipeline in Nigeria's Delta state, which was breached on Friday. Chevron said it was investigating the damage to the Dibi-Abiteye pipeline, which feeds the Escravos oil stream, but did not comment on how much production would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Escravos crude exports were due to be around 123,000 barrels per day in December, according to loading programmes. It was not clear how much this would be reduced by the pipeline damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have suspended production to minimize environmental impact and have informed relevant government agencies and other stakeholders," Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The breach is being investigated and we are reviewing our operations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Niger Delta Liberation Force (NDLF), a militant faction in Nigeria's oil-producing wetlands region, said on Saturday it was behind the attacks on oil facilities operated by Chevron and Italian oil company Eni (ENI.MI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sabotage attacks followed raids earlier this month by a military task force comprising the army, navy and air force on camps believed to belong to John Togo, the suspected leader of the NDLF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MILITANTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;President Goodluck Jonathan brokered an amnesty with militants last August, leading to more than a year without major unrest but there has been a resurgence in violence in the last two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite a series of recent successful operations by the military task force, it remains difficult to guard against pipeline sabotage attacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Onshore oil infrastructure in the Niger Delta, a network of shallow creeks opening into the Gulf of Guinea, is extremely exposed, with thousands of kilometers (miles) of pipeline passing through remote and thickly forested terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Africa's largest energy industry has been held back for years by strikes on pipelines and infrastructure by military groups who say they are fighting for a more even distribution of the oil wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the line between militancy and crime is blurred with some gang leaders growing rich on the spoils of kidnapping for ransom and the theft of industrial quantities of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Previous militant campaigns have knocked out a significant chunk of the OPEC-member's oil output, currently averaging around 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd), and cost it as much as $1 billion a month in lost revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Alex Lawler in London; editing by William Hardy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron says Dibi-Abiteye pipeline in Delta state breached&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Pipeline feeds the Escravos oil stream&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Militants claimed attacks on Chevron facilities&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Joe Brock&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LAGOS, Dec 20 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Chevron (CVX.N)
said on Monday it had suspended production from an oil pipeline
in Nigeria's Delta state, which was breached on Friday.
Chevron said it was investigating the damage to the
Dibi-Abiteye pipeline, which feeds the Escravos oil stream, but
did not comment on how much production would be lost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Escravos crude exports were due to be around 123,000 barrels
per day in December, according to loading programmes. It was not
clear how much this would be reduced by the pipeline damage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have suspended production to minimize environmental
impact and have informed relevant government agencies and other
stakeholders," Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The breach is being investigated and we are reviewing our
operations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Niger Delta Liberation Force (NDLF), a militant faction
in Nigeria's oil-producing wetlands region, said on Saturday it
was behind the attacks on oil facilities operated by Chevron and
Italian oil company Eni (ENI.MI). [ID:nLDE6BH09Y] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sabotage attacks followed raids earlier this month by a
military task force comprising the army, navy and air force on
camps believed to belong to John Togo, the suspected leader of
the NDLF. [ID:nLDE6B21NB] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MILITANTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Goodluck Jonathan brokered an amnesty with
militants last August, leading to more than a year without major
unrest but there has been a resurgence in violence in the last
two months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite a series of recent successful operations by the
military task force, it remains difficult to guard against
pipeline sabotage attacks. [ID:nLDE6BC0P5] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Onshore oil infrastructure in the Niger Delta, a network of
shallow creeks opening into the Gulf of Guinea, is extremely
exposed, with thousands of kilometres (miles) of pipeline
passing through remote and thickly forested terrain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Africa's largest energy industry has been held back for
years by strikes on pipelines and infrastructure by military
groups who say they are fighting for a more even distribution of
the oil wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the line between militancy and crime is blurred with
some gang leaders growing rich on the spoils of kidnapping for
ransom and the theft of industrial quantities of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Previous militant campaigns have knocked out a significant
chunk of the OPEC-member's oil output, currently averaging
around 2.2 million barrels per day (bpd), and cost it as much as
$1 billion a month in lost revenues.

 (Adds detail, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Dec 20 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) has acquired the
former Lehman Brothers building in London for 495 million pounds
($773.4 million) for the European headquarters of its investment
bank from 2012, the bank said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, the bank will continue to develop its
Riverside South site where it had planned a conspicuous new
headquarters, said the Canary Wharf Group which owns the
majority of the Canary Wharf district's property.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan and the Canary Wharf Group had stopped building a
new headquarters on the site this year, triggering speculation
JPMorgan would axe the costly project, under pressure from
negative sentiment against banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Canary Wharf Group -- which is majority owned by
Songbird Estates (SBDE.L) -- said construction work would
recommence immediately to bring the development to the street
level and that it had extended its development agreement with
JPM until October 2016.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This acquisition is a long-term investment and represents
part of our continued commitment to London as one of the world's
most important financial centres," JPMorgan Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer Jamie Dimon said in a statement.

			J.P. Morgan Acquires New European Investment Bank Headquarters in 
      London

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan today announced major real estate investments in London, 
      including the acquisition of 25 Bank Street in Canary Wharf, which will 
      become the new European headquarters of its Investment Bank in 2012. The 
      firm has also agreed to purchase 60 Victoria Embankment, a London 
      building that the firm has been leasing since 1991 and that currently 
      accommodates the firm&#8217;s Treasury and Securities Services division.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Even during the recession, we have continued to invest and grow our 
      businesses internationally,&#8221; said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO. &#8220;These 
      properties are long-term investments and represent our continued 
      commitment to London as one of the world&#8217;s most important financial 
      centres.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Completed in 2003, 25 Bank Street&#8217;s technology and infrastructure are 
      specifically designed for a global financial institution. With more than 
      one million square feet of space, the building will house J.P. Morgan&#8217;s 
      entire Investment Bank, allowing for increased efficiencies, 
      productivity and communication among employees who will sit together in 
      one location. Currently, the Investment Bank is spread across four 
      London properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The opportunity for our Investment Bank to be located in one 
      state-of-the-art building allows us to upgrade our operational 
      capabilities and maintain our strong position in the region,&#8221; said Jes 
      Staley, CEO of the Investment Bank.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J. Pierpont Morgan, a founder of the company, started his career in 
      London and the firm has had a presence in the U.K. for more than a 
      century. Today, J.P. Morgan has more than 11,000 employees based in 
      London and a total of nearly 18,000 across the region who help provide 
      capital, liquidity and advice to companies, institutions and 
      governments. Since the start of 2009, J.P. Morgan has helped U.K.-based 
      clients raise more than $340 billion in stocks and bonds and 
      approximately $120 billion in loans, according to Dealogic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These properties are among the most attractive pieces of real estate in 
      London,&#8221; said Frank Bisignano, Chief Administrative Officer. &#8220;These 
      buildings ensure that our employees will have the necessary technology, 
      infrastructure and amenities to take our businesses forward.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan will also continue to work with the Canary Wharf Group in 
      order to develop the Riverside South site at Canary Wharf for future use.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is very good news for London and for Canary Wharf,&#8221; said George 
      Iacobescu, Chief Executive of Canary Wharf Group PLC. &#8220;J.P. Morgan is 
      one of the largest and most prestigious banks in the world. This 
      decision secures London as the European headquarters for J.P. Morgan and 
      is a huge boost for the U.K. as the economic recovery starts."

&lt;p&gt;ABUJA Dec 20 (Reuters) - U.S. energy firm Chevron (CVX.N)
said on Monday it had suspended production from a pipeline in
Nigeria's Delta state which had been breached in an attack on
Friday.
Chevron said it was investigating the damage to its
Dibi-Abiteye pipeline but did not say how much production would
be lost from shutting down the stream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; A militant group claimed responsibility on Saturday for
attacks on Chevron-operated oil facilities in Delta state.

 (Updates with reports Microsoft plans new OS with ARM
processors)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) is
working on a version of its core Windows operating system for
devices such as tablets, according to media reports on Tuesday,
and the company said its Windows Phone 7 software is making
headway in the booming smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft plans to unveil a version of its operating
software that runs for the first time on processors designed by
UK-based ARM Holdings PLC (ARM.L), the Wall Street Journal and
Bloomberg reported. ARM's processors dominate the tablet and
handheld device market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft intends to announce a version of its operating
system to run on ARM chip architecture, which competes with the
"x86" designs favored by Intel (INTC.O), the Wall Street
Journal cited people familiar with the plans as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was unclear when such an operating system might come to
market, but the U.S. software maker could claim lost ground in
tablets and other battery-powered mobile devices by forging a
new partnership with ARM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft and ARM declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said on Tuesday that more than 1.5 million
cellphones carrying Windows Phone 7 operating software have
sold in the first six weeks of launch, meeting what the company
called "realistic" expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Windows Phone 7 may be Microsoft's last chance to establish
a major presence in a hot cellphone market now dominated by
Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Google Inc (GOOG.O), analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sales numbers were disclosed for the first time by
Achim Berg, vice president of business and marketing for
Windows phones, in an internally conducted interview posted on
Microsoft's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a decent number. The mobile market is going to be a
battle for Microsoft," said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC
Partners who has a "buy" rating on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's disappearance from the phone market and its
delayed response to tablet devices like Apple's iPad has been
seen as a drag on shares this year. Its shares closed up 26
cents on Tuesday at $28.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DECENT SHOWING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Gillis noted that the shipment of 1.5 million phones
was sales into the distribution channel, rather than directly
into consumers' hands, which tempers the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taiwan's HTC (2498.TW), Dell Inc DELL.O, Samsung
Electronics (005930.KS) and LG Electronics (066570.KS) are
among the vendors who have launched or plan to begin selling
Phone 7-based devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The industry is closely watching the early days of what
could be a longer-term driver of growth. Gillis forecasts about
25 million Phone 7 sales in 2011. In contrast, analysts expect
Apple to sell more than 60 million iPhones next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We all know that the competition is extreme in this
industry, and we have to compete on multiple fronts," Berg said
in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are on a path to begin releasing the first of several
updates in the next couple of months, and several more mobile
operators around the world will introduce Windows Phone 7 on
their network in 2011."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gillis noted that Microsoft is spending $500 million to
market the Windows 7 smartphone, and suggested the company
could see market gains by using some of that cash to subsidize
the devices so consumers get them for free.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Google Inc's (GOOG.O) Internet search algorithm is the technology world's equivalent of the Coca-Cola formula: a top-secret corporate crown jewel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But pressure is growing on Google to lift the veil on some of its inner workings, as European regulators investigate complaints that Google's search engine unfairly discriminates against certain websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case underscores the increased scrutiny over Google's influence in the Internet industry and could set the stage for the kind of long-running regulatory battle fought in the past by technology giants like Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odds are that the world's No. 1 search engine will seek to keep prying eyes, even those of the European Commission -- known in many circles globally as the toughest watchdog -- away from the ranking algorithms that are the core of its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is difficult to see how this won't come to an impasse in terms of how far can Google go, in terms of opening up access to their secret sauce as it were, which is the basis for their existence," said Martin Olausson at research firm Strategy Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the EU determines that Google abused its position in the search market, the Commission could order Google to alter its search practices, such as providing more transparency into its algorithm, or face a fine of up to 10 percent of annual global revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has faced criticism in the past that its technology for determining which websites get top billing in search results is too much of a black box. As Google has grown in clout, and as it begins providing its own Web content such as video within results, calls for greater transparency into its search algorithm have swelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission ratcheted up pressure on Google this month when it opened a formal probe into allegations the company had abused its dominant position in the search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the charge that Google rigged its algorithms to lower rivals' rankings, complainants said it unfairly promoted its own services, forced advertisers to accept exclusivity deals, and blocked companies from transferring advertising data to other online ad platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The complaint is often that there's too much at stake. The claim is Google is now too powerful and it's really tantamount to a utility that everybody uses," said Greg Sterling, an Internet consultant and a contributing editor for the online blog Search Engine Land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG IN EUROPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation is particularly acute in Europe, where Google controls roughly 77 percent of the market share of search queries, according to industry analytics firm ComScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, the EU confirmed that it had also taken over two complaints about Google's search practices from German competition authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has said it intends to cooperate with the EU's investigation. But the company has a history of keeping its search algorithm close to the vest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Google provides certain guidelines about its algorithms to help Web publishers ensure that their sites are accurately ranked, the hundreds of specific "ranking factors" that it uses to rank websites, and the weight it attaches to each of those factors, remain a much-speculated-upon mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We provide more guidance for websites than any other search engine, and we're constantly exploring new ways to be even more transparent with webmasters about our ranking principles," Google spokesman Adam Kovacevich said in an email. "But disclosing the exact details would only help spammers, make search engines less useful, and hurt our users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foundem, one of the complainants in the EU case, has said it is not seeking to get Google to publish details of its algorithm. Instead, it said on the website searchneutrality.org, the company wants Google to be more transparent about the rationale for the various "exclusionary penalties" that can keep certain sites out of search results, and for Google to provide an appeals process for websites that feel such penalties have been mistakenly applied to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EASY FIX?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google joins other technology giants, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Microsoft, whose business practices have triggered scrutiny from European regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which was fined 1.68 billion euros over the course of its decade-plus battle with the Commission, agreed to give European consumers better access to rival Internet browsers in Windows, and to improve interoperability with its products last December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key challenge for the Commission now is to show that Google conscientiously abused its power in the search market to harm certain websites, said Brett Gordon, a professor at Columbia Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission would have to show that Google unfairly tampered with their algorithm to disadvantage other search services," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, France's antitrust watchdog warned the company not to abuse its dominant position in online advertising, citing a list of possible anticompetitive practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google had settled with the French regulator two months earlier when it pledged to make its AdWords advertising policy in that country more clear and transparent following a complaint it had unfairly scrapped a company's contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar tactic could work with the European Commission, said Christopher Thomas, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The issue is not the algorithms, the issue is whether they can be changed in a way to sufficiently reassure the Commission without undermining what Google feels is the core of its business. If easy changes can be made, Google may be inclined to do that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing's for sure: The pressure on Google can only grow, said Thomas Vinje, a partner at Clifford Chance, who had led a coalition that took on Microsoft, which then led to the European Commission imposing a total fine of 1.68 billion euros for antitrust infringements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The launch of formal probes tends to generate more voices, to cause more people to jump into the fray, and make it more likely that other complainants will come forward with other allegations of abusive conduct," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So this case might well go on for quite some time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwin Chan)&lt;/p&gt;

(WLT.N) bought a shipping terminal in Alabama in a move to bulk
up on coveted port capacity and lower costs, as it digests a
recent deal that makes it a major player in the coal market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Walter Energy, which has three coal projects in Alabama,

McDuffie Terminal where Walter Energy currently ships all of
its coal to customers in South America and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently, Mobile River Terminal handles 3.2 million tons
of iron ore, 1 million tons of furnace coke, and 0.5 million
tons of other products annually, according to its website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition comes three weeks after Walter signed a
deal to buy Canada's Western Coal WTN.TO for $3.3 billion
putting it on track to become the world's No. 3 producer of
steel-making met coal at a time of booming demand.
[ID:nLDE6B20EU] Since then Walter's shares have gained 10
percent. They closed at $120.77 on Tuesday on the New York
Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms JP Morgan Prime Money Market Fund at 'AAAmmf'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to the JP Morgan 
      Prime Money Market Fund managed by JP Morgan Investment Management, Inc. 
      (JPMIM).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The main drivers of the rating affirmation are the credit quality, 
      diversification, and liquidity of the portfolio assets, and the 
      capabilities and resources of JPMIM as investment advisor. The 'AAAmmf' 
      rating reflects the fund's extremely strong capacity to achieve its 
      investment objectives of preserving principal and providing shareholder 
      liquidity through limiting credit, market and liquidity risk.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund pursues its investment objectives by investing in a 
      diversified, high-credit quality portfolio of short-term debt securities 
      including U.S. government and government agency securities, commercial 
      paper, asset-back commercial paper and other debt obligations of U.S. 
      and foreign corporations, certificates of deposits, time deposits and 
      repurchase agreements. As of Nov. 30, 2010, the fund had approximately 
      $132.9 billion in assets under management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consistent with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating criteria, the fund maintains a 
      high credit quality by investing exclusively in securities rated at 
      least 'A/F1' or equivalent. The fund seeks to mitigate potential 
      counterparty risk arising from investments in repurchase agreements by 
      transacting with counterparties rated at least 'A/F1' or equivalent. The 
      fund has the ability to enter into overnight and term repurchase 
      agreements backed by a variety of collateral. In line with the fund's 
      investment policy, the value of collateral exceeds the value of the 
      repurchase agreement by a specified overcollateralization rate that is 
      consistent with the assigned rating.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund seeks to limit interest rate exposure and spread risk by 
      limiting its weighted average maturity to reset date (WAMr) and weighted 
      average final maturity (WAMf) to 60 days and 120 days, respectively, 
      consistent with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating criteria. As of Nov. 30, 2010 
      the fund had a WAMr of 54 days and a WAMf of 87 days.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The fund's additional investment restrictions are aimed at maintaining 
      sufficient levels of daily and weekly liquidity to meet investors' 
      redemption requests. In line with amended Rule 2a-7 under the Investment 
      Company Act of 1940, which governs the investment activities and 
      operations of the U.S. money market funds, the fund must invest at least 
      10% of total assets in daily liquid assets and at least 30% of total 
      assets in weekly liquid assets. As of Nov. 30, 2010, the fund met the 
      liquidity requirements mandated by Rule 2a-7 and was also in line with 
      the liquidity guidelines layout in Fitch's rating criteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality or 
      market risk profiles of the fund. A material adverse deviation from 
      Fitch guidelines for any key rating driver could cause the rating to be 
      lowered by Fitch. For additional information about Fitch's money market 
      fund ratings guidelines, please review the criteria referenced below,

      manages assets on behalf of institutions and individuals worldwide

      alternative investment products. Fitch views JP Morgan Chase  Co.'s and 
      JPMIM's investment advisory capabilities, financial and resource 
      commitments, operational controls, corporate governance, and compliance 
      procedures as consistent with 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to the fund. As 
      of June 30, 2010, JPMIM, together with other asset management divisions

&lt;p&gt;  TAMPA, FL, Dec 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT), a leading U.S. producer and exporter of
premium hard coking coal for the global steel industry, announced today
that it has acquired the assets of Mobile River Terminal Co. in Mobile,
Ala. from a subsidiary of U. S. Steel. Terms of the acquisition were not
disclosed.

    "The Mobile River Terminal is of significant strategic importance to
Walter Energy," said Interim Chief Executive Officer Joe Leonard. "This
acquisition will help ensure that we will have unconstrained shipping
capacity to support our long-term coking coal production plans in

    The facility is located at the Port of Mobile, less than four miles from
the McDuffie Terminal where Walter Energy currently ships all of its
export coal to customers in South America and Europe. The Company's mines
are strategically located, allowing Walter Energy to transport coal to
Mobile by either rail or barge.

			Walton Big Lake Development L.P. Completes Private Placement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Asset Management L.P. (&#8220;Walton&#8221;) and Walton Big Lake Development 
      L.P. (&#8220;Big Lake Partnership&#8221;) are pleased to announce the closing of the 
      private placement which commenced on November 19, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      An aggregate of $4,644,060 was raised, resulting in the issuance of 
      464,406 limited partnership units, the maximum offered in the placement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The private placement consisted of a non-brokered private offering of up 
      to 464,406 units at a subscription price of $10.00 per unit, and was 
      conducted on similar terms to the initial public offering that the Big 
      Lake Partnership completed on November 17, 2010 under its prospectus 
      dated October 27.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The proceeds raised under both the private placement and the Big Lake 
      Partnership&#8217;s initial public offering total $22,500,000. As outlined in 
      the prospectus, the majority of the net proceeds of both offerings will 
      be used to purchase, manage and develop the 136.5 acre Big Lake property 
      located in Edmonton, Alberta.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Big Lake Partnership was established to provide unitholders with the 
      opportunity to participate in the development of the Big Lake property. 
      Walton believes that the property is strategically located and that 
      investors can benefit from this development opportunity. The Big Lake 
      Partnership&#8217;s investment objectives are to preserve capital and to 
      provide annual cash distributions beginning in 2011 until the completion 
      of the project, which is anticipated to be in December of 2015. Such 
      distributions would represent a net internal rate of return of 13.5% 
      based on the $10.00 unit purchase price.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Big Lake Partnership intends to meet its investment objectives 
      through a four-step strategy: (i) acquire the Big Lake property without 
      the use of leverage, (ii) obtain contractual commitments from 
      homebuilders to purchase lots to be serviced in each of the three 
      planned phases of the development of the property before construction 
      commences on that phase, (iii) construct municipal services 
      infrastructure on the property in phases to provide a controlled supply 
      of serviced lots to the marketplace, and (iv) use the revenue from the 
      sale of the serviced lots to repay construction loans and other 
      obligations of the Big Lake Partnership and then make distributions to 
      the Limited Partners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Big Lake Partnership is managed by Walton Asset Management L.P., 
      which is part of the Walton Group of Companies. Development of the Big 
      Lake property will be managed by Walton Development and Management Inc., 
      whose team is comprised of 33 real estate development professionals 
      bringing over 350 years of combined experience in engineering, land 
      development, land planning, project management, finance, marketing and 
      municipal affairs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      Companies is one of North America&#8217;s leading land-based real estate 
      investment and development groups. The Walton Group currently manages

      The Committee to Support U.S. Trade Laws (&#8220;CSUSTL&#8221;) commends Rep. Linda 
      Sanchez and Rep. Walter Jones for introducing legislation last Friday to 
      combat the evasion of U.S. trade remedy laws through custom fraud. A 
      similar version of the bill was introduced in the Senate by Senators 
      Wyden and Snowe in August.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CSUSTL President Gilbert B. Kaplan said, &#8220;We applaud the efforts of 
      Reps. Sanchez and Jones to introduce this bill before the end of the 
      legislative session. The legislation will provide specific remedies for 
      the evasion of antidumping and countervailing duties. Such evasion robs 
      the U.S. Treasury of revenues it is due, and diminishes the 
      effectiveness of our trade remedy laws which are critical to U.S. 
      manufacturers who have been injured by unfair trade practices. This 
      legislation is all the more important as key U.S industries struggle to 
      emerge from the global economic downturn.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Roger B. Schagrin, Chairman of CSUSTL&#8217;s Government Affairs Committee 
      added, &#8220;the enforcement of trade remedy laws has broad bipartisan 
      support in both the House and Senate. This is a question of enforcing 
      the laws that are already on the books and achieving the objectives our 
      trade laws were intended to fulfill. We look forward to reintroduction 
      and passage of this legislation as early as possible next year.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Enforcing Orders and Reducing Customs Evasion (ENFORCE) Act of 2010 
      (H.R. 6549) gives U.S. Customs and Border Protection the authority to 
      investigate allegations of circumvention of antidumping (&#8220;AD&#8221;) and 
      countervailing duty (&#8220;CVD&#8221;) orders, and to assess duties when evasion is 
      found to have occurred. It also establishes, for the first time, a 
      procedure whereby U.S. industry can petition the U.S. government to 
      investigate specific allegations of AD/CVD evasion. The ENFORCE Act 
      enhances the safety of U.S consumers by allowing information to be 
      shared by the appropriate U.S. government agencies when imports subject 
      to AD/CVD orders are mislabeled in order to avoid payment of AD/CVD 
      duties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      James C. Hecht, Chairman of CSUSTL&#8217;s Lawyer&#8217;s Committee, noted &#8220;the bill 
      will build upon existing authorities to ensure that government agencies 
      have the tools they need to effectively combat circumvention and 
      evasion, protecting the revenue of the United States and the integrity 
      of our trade laws.&#8221;

increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make

screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details

&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, Dec 21 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) had an
unplanned shutdown of two units at its 149,500-barrels-per-day
refinery in Torrance, California, a company spokeswoman said on
Tuesday.

 "There was impact to production," spokeswoman Aarti
Ramachandran said. She declined to identify the units, and said
preparations were under way to restart them while officials
investigated the shutdowns.

 She said it was undetermined whether heavy rain in southern
California since last weekend contributed to the shutdowns.

Inc., a leading marketing communications company. Brandon Matthews, of
SeekingAlpha.com, claims that had Sirius XM not been the victim of an
illegal naked short selling scheme three years ago, its stock today would

			I.B.I.S., Inc. and Partner Power Join Forces to Provide Microsoft 
      Dynamics AX to International Companies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      I.B.I.S., Inc. is an experienced Microsoft Dynamics partner that has 
      successfully been delivering ERP and CRM to businesses in the United 
      States for the past 21 years. I.B.I.S. is now extending its success to 
      the international market by joining the world&#8217;s largest international 
      Microsoft Dynamics organization, Partner Power.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      By joining Partner Power I.B.I.S. is still working nationally, but when 
      it comes to international Microsoft Dynamics AX customers, they are now 
      working as Partner Power in the U.S.A.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Faced with an increasing number of international customers, I.B.I.S. has 
      been looking for the best way to provide them with services. &#8220;The world 
      is becoming a smaller place every day,&#8221; explains Andy Vabulas, CEO at 
      I.B.I.S. &#8220;Our Microsoft Dynamics AX clients are in many locations and 
      are doing business across the globe. We have learned that being 
      everywhere for our clients is impossible. I.B.I.S. needs to work with 
      other Partners that are like I.B.I.S. &#8211; world class organizations in 
      order to deliver quality solutions wherever clients need us.&#8221; Partner 
      Power&#8217;s extended global coverage and outstanding reputation in the 
      Microsoft Dynamics world made the group the most relevant potential 
      partner for I.B.I.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At Partner Power, choosing a new member is not a decision that is taken 
      lightly. Partner Power is not a loose network of Microsoft Dynamics 
      partners. Each Partner Power Member has been selected carefully 
      according to the values of committed partnership &#8211; one that is based on 
      trust and fairness. Poul Kjaer, CEO at Partner Power underlines the 
      importance of finding partners that match the group&#8217;s values: &#8220;At 
      Partner Power we strive to work with the strongest Microsoft Dynamics 
      partners in their region. But this is not enough. One of the key 
      requirements for a partner to join us is how they can contribute to the 
      group&#8217;s synergies and how much they are willing to actively embrace the 
      values of our partnership. I.B.I.S. is a good match for us not only 
      because both their product specialization and their geographical 
      coverage complement ours, but also because they fully understand what we 
      mean with committed partnership.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Andy Vabulas confirms his alignments with Partner Power on this matter 
      and sees great potential in this new partnership: &#8220;A partnership means a 
      two-way street, not a one way. We want a truly trusted relationship with 
      all parties involved. Success to us means that we must give more than we 
      get. We would of course like to see our business grow and thrive through 
      the Partner Power partnership. But in the end the success of our clients 
      is our top priority. Being a member of a world class organization that 
      delivers the best in solutions is a good way to achieve that.&#8221;

      "Small businesses are putting these loans to use every day in cities and 
      towns all across the country, creating jobs and helping our economy get 
      back on its feet," said Michael Cleary,&#160;CEO of Business Banking in 
      Retail Financial Services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Lending is the heart of our business and what drives the economy," said 
      Todd Maclin, CEO of the Commercial Bank. &#8220;Without credit, our clients 
      don&#8217;t grow and we don&#8217;t grow."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Credit Cards are a crucial foundation for small businesses, and we are 
      proud to offer a suite of business credit cards devoted to one 
      thing:&#160;helping small businesses grow,&#8221; said Richard Quigley, President 
      of Ink from Chase.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the financial crisis, Chase has developed a number of programs 
      to help increase the volume of loans to small businesses. These included:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Hiring 500 Business Bankers in the last 14 months.
      
			
        Developing a Second Look credit review process for businesses 
        that have been turned down for a loan and seek further review. The 
        Second Look program has approved more than $250 million in additional 
        loans since late 2009.
      
			
        Creating a Loan for Hire program to reward small businesses for 
        hiring new employees. Chase reduces the interest rate on a company&#8217;s 
        line of credit by 0.5% for each employee they hire, up to three.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase also helps its communities in many other ways, including 
      branch banking, community development lending and mortgage 
      modifications. In addition, the JPMorgan Chase Foundation increased its 
      giving by 50% in 2010, extending $150 million in grants to programs that 
      support Community Development, Education and Arts  Culture.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Here are highlights from Monday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Progressive Beats in November
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Progressive Corp.'s (NYSE: PGR) 
      earnings per share for November 2010 were 17 cents, up 42% from 12 cents 
      in November 2009. Results of the reported month also increased 42% over 
      October 2010. Net income for the month improved 37% to $109.9 million 
      from $80.0 million in the year-ago period. On a sequential basis, net 
      income improved 44% from $81.9 million in the previous month.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Progressive reports its results every month. The company recorded net 
      premiums of $1.01 billion, up 7% from $942 million in November 2009 but 
      down 24% from $1.34 billion in October 2010. Net premiums earned were 
      $1.11 billion, up 5% from $1.06 billion in the year-ago period but down 
      20% from $1.39 billion in the prior month.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Progressive reported net realized gain on securities of $29.4 million, 
      compared with $6.1 million in November 2009 and $25.6 million in the 
      preceding month. The combined ratio &#8722; the percentage of premiums paid 
      out as claims and expenses &#8722; at 90.7% improved 150 basis points from 
      92.2% recorded in the year-ago period and 520 basis points from 95.9% in 
      the preceding month.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Allstate Corporation (NYSE: ALL), 
      which competes with Progressive, registered third quarter operating 
      earnings of 83 cents per share, way behind the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
      of 97 cents and 99 cents recorded in the year-ago quarter. Results for 
      the quarter deteriorated primarily due to lower-than-expected premiums 
      coupled with higher expenses in the Property-Liability insurance 
      segment, along with relatively higher tax expenses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We maintain our Neutral recommendation on Progressive. The quantitative 
      Zacks #3 Rank (short-term Hold rating) for the company indicates no 
      clear directional pressure on the shares over the near term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Citrix to Expand Globally
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Citrix Systems Inc. (Nasdaq: CTXS) 
      is focusing on international expansion to augment its global market 
      share in the virtualization, collaboration and cloud computing segments. 
      Recently, the company entered into a definite agreement to acquire 
      Netviewer AG of Germany.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Netviewer is a privately held Software-as-a-Service solutions provider. 
      This deal is expected to be closed by early 2011 although the financial 
      terms are still undisclosed.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Netviewer has more than 18,000 customers across several European 
      countries such as the UK, France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, 
      Benelux, Italy, Spain and various Nordic countries. The acquisition of 
      Netviewer will allow Citrix to significantly expand its presence in 
      Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Citrix will integrate Netviewer in its Online Services division. Citrix 
      Online Services segment consists primarily of fees related to online 
      service agreements and are recognized ratably over the contract term and 
      generates approximately 20% of the company&#8217;s total revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Citrix is reaping the benefits of globalization as well as the growing 
      popularity of the virtual office concept. To maximize profit, business 
      enterprises continue to enter markets all over the world. Virtualization 
      and cloud computing has become one of the most effective tools to slash 
      costs as enterprises expand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe Netviewer acquisition will help Citrix to compensate some of 
      its losses in the server virtualization market. The server 
      virtualization market is intensely challenging and is increasingly 
      becoming commoditized. Citrix entered server virtualization market two 
      years ago with the acquisition of XenSource. However, the company could 
      hardly establish a foothold in this segment and is gradually losing 
      market share to both VMWare Inc. (NYSE: VMW) 
      and Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We maintain our long-term Neutral recommendation for Citrix. Currently, 
      it is a Zacks #3 (Hold) Rank stock.

&lt;p&gt;   * Trials don't support further development of drugs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Deal termination effective March 2011&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Adolor shares down 9 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dec 21 (Reuters) - Adolor Corp ADLR.O said its partner
Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) has decided to end the development of two of
Adolor's experimental pain drugs as clinical evaluation of the
compounds did not support further development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two companies were developing the compounds -- ADL5859
and ADL5747 -- under a collaboration agreement of Dec. 4, 2007.
The drugs failed to meet the main goals of a mid-stage trial
earlier this year. [ID:nSGE65G0I4]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer has already delivered a notice of termination of the
agreement to Adolor, effective March 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Adolor, which has two other drugs in early-stage trials and
one drug in the market in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline
(GSK.L), said in July it would cut 30 percent jobs to reduce
cash burn. [ID:nSGE66E0LG]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's shares, which gained 7 percent since the news
of the job cut, were down 9 percent to $1.06 in premarket trade
on Tuesday. They closed at $1.16 Monday on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;  CHELMSFORD, MA, Dec 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Aspect, a global provider of unified communications and collaboration
services and software, today announced it will be delivering a
software-based product for small- to mid-size contact center applications
using Microsoft Lync as its media server. The new product will be a
value-priced, turnkey option for IT Help Desks, virtual sales teams,
corporate departments, branch offices and small- to mid-size contact
centers looking to leverage their unified communications strategies. The
product will include core contact center capabilities, as well as key
unified communication functionality, including delivering voice over IP. 

    "This announcement reinforces the value the Aspect/Microsoft
relationship, in place since March 2008, brings to existing and potential
Lync users," said Sheila McGee-Smith, president and principal analyst at
McGee-Smith Analytics. "The Aspect product will not just 'work' or
'integrate' with Lync, but actually uses Lync as its media server. It
also offers SMB customers a product built on Aspect's long-standing
expertise in the contact center space."

    The product, scheduled to be delivered in Q1 2011, will support from 20
to 100 agents and supervisors. Among the contact center capabilities it
will provide include inbound voice, email and instant messaging (IM)
routing, real-time and historical reporting, a unified agent desktop,
dialing and voice self service capabilities on a single server. The
product will also include out-of-the-box workflows. Lync will deliver the
media server and PBX functionality. The solution can be installed by
Microsoft-savvy IT professionals, with minimal remote support from
Aspect(R) Professional Services.

    "We believe there are significant opportunities to bring contact center
functionality to deliver key business benefits. Aspect is helping to
address this target market by bringing its expertise with both contact
center and unified communication capabilities to bear," said Gurdeep
Singh Pall, corporate vice president of the Microsoft Lync and Speech
Group at Microsoft Corp. "Our customers have been asking for an
easy-to-implement and manage solution for smaller contact centers and
help desks that will enable them to use the same telephony infrastructure
that is being used in the enterprise." 

    "Aspect is focused on providing innovative solutions for Lync that
leverage our core strengths," said Jim Foy, president and CEO of Aspect.
"Working closely with Microsoft, we've identified a market need for a
simple, all-in-one solution for small contact center applications. By
providing essential contact center capabilities on Lync, we will offer
organizations a flexible and value-based solution to help them address
key business objectives." 

    "We believe this product will deliver significant benefits to
organizations by providing proven technology that is derived from
Aspect's best-of-breed solutions and years of customer contact
leadership, delivered as a turnkey offering," said Gary Barnett, chief
technology officer at Aspect. "The product will provide an optimal blend
of unified communications capabilities and key contact center features
for low cost, in a small footprint. Importantly, it provides a natural
first step for integrating either the internal or external contact center
to the organization's unified communications infrastructure, allowing the
business to capitalize on the enterprise-wide benefits that UC can bring
to the customer and the company." 

    The product will also provide a seamless integration to Aspect(R)
Workforce Management to enable forecasting, scheduling, and tracking
capabilities and Aspect Performance Management for scorecards and
analysis that can automatically initiate alerts and actions.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) took a hit in its equity capital markets business in 2010 even though its dominance in debt markets allowed it to cling on to the global top spot for investment banking fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, whose investment bank has been run by Jes Staley since last year, withstood the poorest period for advisory income in Europe for eight years to maintain a slim lead on its rivals, Thomson Reuters data showed on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But its investment banking income in Europe almost halved compared to last year as the debt crisis stunted issuance and hit profits at most banks, according to the data which was co-produced with research firm Freeman Consulting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fee erosion at JPMorgan was particularly apparent in equity capital markets (ECM) in Europe. The bank was down by more than $500 million in equity fees compared with last year, dropping to second place behind Goldman Sachs (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also slipped down the ECM fee rankings in Asia, 2010's biggest income battleground after a rush of first time listings there helped global initial public offerings (IPOS) double globally compared to last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank dropped from second to fourth place, overtaken by Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) as Switzerland's UBS (UBSN.VX) held on to the top spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan missed out on the lion's share of the commission on some of the biggest Asian IPOs this year, featuring as one of the lower-ranking banks handling deals such as AIA Group's listing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank relinquished the top ECM fee spot on a global basis to Morgan Stanley (MS.N), which managed to increase its market share in Asia this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But JPMorgan once again pocketed the biggest share of global debt capital markets (DCM) fees, even as bond issuance by companies, sovereigns and other borrowers also fell 6 percent worldwide compared to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a shrinking market, JPMorgan gained on its rivals, raking in $1.582bn in global DCM fees -- marginally more than it made during a record 2009 for most banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This helped JPMorgan clinch the top spot in the worldwide investment banking fee rankings, with overall fees brought in by all banks actually growing to their highest level since 2007, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The overall growth came despite a tough year in Europe, where billions of dollars worth of initial public offerings (IPOs) being pulled or postponed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Debt issuance in euros so far this year fell by 23 percent compared to the corresponding period in 2009, a drop mirrored by the investment banking fees up for grabs dwindling to $13.5 billion, marking an eight year low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's fee income in Europe almost halved compared to 2009, coming in at $994 million, less than $100 million higher than what closest rival Deutsche Bank pocketed. Last year, JPMorgan took home $1.72bn in European investment banking fees. (Additional reporting by Kylie MacLellan; Editing by Greg Mahlich)&lt;/p&gt;

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details
regarding this unique opportunity please visit: www.microcapsdaily.com.

    On Wednesday 12/8/10 dPollution International Inc. (PINK SHEETS - RMGX)

its patented dPollution Device. The units are to be delivered to Stem
Italia S.R.L. of Rome, Italy and distributed to the members of A.N.C.
Associazione Nazionale di Categoria Trasporto Persone e Mobilita, the
association of tourist bus drivers in the Province of Lazio, Italy.
A.N.C. will be acquiring the units to install on its members fleets of
diesel buses to ensure their compliance with the Province of Lazio's new
Low Emission Zone (LEZ) standards, which will be enforced starting in
2011.

    In the U.S. market alone, there are 250 million registered passenger
vehicles and dPollution (RMGX) owns the exclusive manufacturing and
distribution rights to a patented fuel conditioning technology which
significantly increases mileage and lowers harmful GHG emissions.
dPollution's revolutionary device improves engine performance by causing
fuel to combust more thoroughly and efficiently. This technology works on
every internal combustion engine in the world. Considering that IC
engines are used in cars, buses, trucks, diesel trains, construction
equipment, farm equipment and a variety of military vehicles the market
for this device is virtually limitless. For more information, please

      Thanks to the gift of an anonymous donor, the Disabled Veterans National 
      Foundation (DVNF) distributed holiday gifts including $100 gift cards to 
      disabled veterans at the Walter Reed Army Hospital on December 21, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It was touching to visit these brave young warriors who are 
      recuperating at Walter Reed and give them a meaningful gift for this 
      Holiday Season,&#8221; said DVNF Chief Administrative Officer, Raegan Rivers. 
      &#8220;Many of the veterans we met are young people whose lives have been 
      changed forever as a result of the injuries they received fighting the 
      wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. As a nation we must be thankful to the 
      sacrifices made by our armed forces; and, as an foundation dedicated to 
      improving the lives of disabled veterans, we are thankful to our 
      anonymous donor for his generosity.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since its inception in 2007, DVNF has provided goods and services to 
      over 40,000 veterans through donations to local shelters, veterans&#8217; 
      programs and other agencies. Earlier this week, the Foundation&#8217;s Board 
      of Directors committed to providing $10 million on support efforts in 
      2011.

worldwide compared to 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a shrinking market, JPMorgan gained on its rivals, raking
in $1.582bn in global DCM fees -- marginally more than it made
during a record 2009 for most banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This helped JPMorgan clinch the top spot in the worldwide
investment banking fee rankings, with overall fees brought in by
all banks actually growing to their highest level since 2007,
the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The overall growth came despite a tough year in Europe,
where billions of dollars worth of initial public offerings
(IPOs) being pulled or postponed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Debt issuance in euros so far this year fell by 23 percent
compared to the corresponding period in 2009, a drop mirrored by
the investment banking fees up for grabs dwindling to $13.5
billion, marking an eight year low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's fee income in Europe almost halved compared to
2009, coming in at $994 million, less than $100 million higher
than what closest rival Deutsche Bank pocketed. Last year,
JPMorgan took home $1.72bn in European investment banking fees.

			Debit Card Fee Cut to Hit MC, Visa
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Dodd-Frank Act that was enacted in July this year has targeted 
      credit card companies by slashing the interchange fees on debit card 
      transactions. Particularly, card giants&#160;MasterCard Inc.&#160;(NYSE: 
      MA) and&#160;Visa 
      Inc.&#160;(NYSE: V) 
      are reported to be the wary victims of the interchange fee cuts, since 
      being one of the key revenue drivers, this regulation is expected to 
      adversely impact future revenue of the card companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The furor has been caused with the proposal passed by the Federal 
      Reserve last week that elucidated the urgent requirement of making 
      modifications to the debit-card interchange fees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Basically, each time a consumer makes a payment with a card, the 
      merchant pays a fee to the bank or credit union that issued the card. 
      This interchange fee is typically in the range of 1%&#8211;2% of the purchase 
      amount. Card companies such as MasterCard and Visa earn through a part 
      of this fee by collaborating with the 16,000 or so US banks and credit 
      unions that issue cards. Hence, the cycle of actions put an uncertainty 
      on Visa and MasterCard&#8217;s future revenue performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Accordingly, last week the Federal Reserve recommended that the 
      interchange fee on debit transactions, charged by banks on the 
      merchants, should be restricted to about 7&#8211;12 cents, against the average 
      debit card interchange fee of 44 cents or 1.14% of the purchase price 
      charged in 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This profound slashing will hamper revenues of the banks, which in turn 
      will affect the card companies as banks would now try to trim the fee 
      that they pay to use the respective card networks. A final decision is, 
      however, not expected before April 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Besides, MasterCard and Visa, being the two dominant players in the card 
      industry, are expected to bear the maximum brunt from the implementation 
      of the new regulation. On the other hand, to make matters worse for the 
      card giants, merchants will now have the choice of processing 
      transactions through unrelated networks. This may also hamper the number 
      of transactions processed along with the cost of such transactions, 
      which is again a key growth component for the card companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, the Consumer Protection Act signed in July 2010 (also known as 
      the Dodd-Frank Act) would not only compel the trimming of debit/credit 
      processing fees but is also expected to contract credit offerings from 
      financial institutions, including banks and card companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, the Act has come to the rescue of the merchants and consumers 
      in one way or the other. The recent proposal is a victory for merchants 
      who have for years protested against high interchange fees on debit card 
      transactions. The financial overhaul, post the global credit crisis, is 
      now expected to encourage consumers to use credit cards effectively and 
      also ease the pressure on the merchants, while creating healthy 
      competitive environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Conversely though, the legislation is expected to slice out revenues for 
      the card companies, although the full impact will not be felt before 
      mid-2011. While Visa has already estimated that about 16% or less of its 
      revenues will be affected from the adverse impact of these regulations, 
      its net income is projected to be reduced by about 6% in 2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Meanwhile, prime peerMasterCard has yet to assess its share of loss, yet 
      it is expected to have a neutralizing effect on its income at least 
      through 2012. This is due to the fact that MasterCard has limited 
      exposure in the debit card market compared with Visa, which is intensely 
      penetrated and holds a vast market share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The situation is expected to get grimmer, should other countries follow 
      suit and cap the interchange fee charged internationally by the card 
      companies. This US regulation could raise global anti-bank sentiment, 
      which could be devastating for the card companies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Based on an anti-trust action, Visa and MasterCard have already agreed 
      to cut the fees by 0.2% in Europe. The US banks, including&#160;Bank 
      of America Corp.&#160;(NYSE: BAC),&#160;JPMorgan 
      Chase  Co.&#160;(NYSE: JPM) 
      and&#160;Wells Fargo  Co.&#160;(NYSE: WFC) 
      are also estimated to incur an annual revenue loss of $12 billion from 
      the proposed fee cut.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Going ahead with the financial overhaul reforms, the US Senate Democrats 
      are also reported to have proposed to cap the fee charged on prepaid 
      cards, a market which MasterCard and Bank of America has been exploring 
      progressively. MasterCard has been pursuing acquisitions such as that of 
      Travelex&#8217;s prepaid card division in order to shift from the 
      higher-charged card markets where regulations have been hindering future 
      growth.

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details
regarding this unique opportunity please visit: www.microcapsdaily.com.

Italia S.R.L. of Rome, Italy and distributed to the members of A.N.C.
Associazione Nazionale di Categoria Trasporto Persone e Mobilita, the
association of tourist bus drivers in the Province of Lazio, Italy.
A.N.C. will be acquiring the units to install on its members fleets of
diesel buses to ensure their compliance with the Province of Lazio's new
Low Emission Zone (LEZ) standards, which will be enforced starting in
2011.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Ligand Earns $1 Million Upfront Payment from Pfizer on Sublicensing 
      of Tanaproget
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Ligand Pharmaceuticals Incorporated (NASDAQ:LGND) announced today 
      that its partner Pfizer, Inc. (NYSE:PFE) has granted a sublicense to a 
      multi-national pharmaceutical company for Tanaproget, also known as 
      NSP-989. As a result, Ligand will receive an upfront payment of $1 
      million from Pfizer. Ligand is entitled to clinical and regulatory 
      milestone payments from Pfizer as Tanaproget advances through the 
      development process, as well as tiered royalties on net sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Tanaproget is a tissue-selective, non-steroidal contraceptive 
      progesterone receptor agonist that has the potential for an improved 
      side effect profile over current steroid-containing contraceptives. The 
      sublicensee is now responsible for the worldwide development, 
      registration and commercialization of Tanaproget.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased with Pfizer&#8217;s decision to enable further progression of 
      Tanaproget through this sublicense agreement. Tanaproget is an example 
      of the significant progress made in the field of women&#8217;s health, 
      providing an additional oral contraceptive option for women using both 
      prescription and non-prescription methods of contraception,&#8221; said John 
      L. Higgins, President and Chief Executive Officer of Ligand 
      Pharmaceuticals. &#8220;Our collaborative relationship with Pfizer continues 
      to be very productive and this sublicense adds another promising program 
      to Ligand's large portfolio of assets.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO/BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Google Inc's (GOOG.O) Internet search algorithm is the technology world's equivalent of the Coca-Cola formula: a top-secret corporate crown jewel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But pressure is growing on Google to lift the veil on some of its inner workings as European regulators investigate complaints that Google's search engine unfairly discriminates against certain websites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case underscores the increased scrutiny over Google's influence in the Internet industry and could set the stage for the kind of long-running regulatory battle fought in the past by technology giants like Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Odds are that the world's No. 1 search engine will seek to keep prying eyes -- even those of the European Commission, known in many circles globally as the toughest watchdog -- away from the ranking algorithms that are the core of its business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is difficult to see how this won't come to an impasse in terms of how far can Google go, in terms of opening up access to their secret sauce as it were, which is the basis for their existence," said Martin Olausson at research firm Strategy Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the EU determines that Google abused its position in the search market, the Commission could order Google to alter its search practices, such as providing more transparency into its algorithm, or face a fine of up to 10 percent of annual global revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has faced criticism in the past that its technology for determining which websites get top billing in search results is too much of a black box. As Google has grown in clout, and as it begins providing its own Web content such as video within results, calls for greater transparency into its search algorithm have swelled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission ratcheted up pressure on Google this month when it opened a formal probe into allegations the company had abused its dominant position in the search market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the charge that Google rigged its algorithms to lower rivals' rankings, complainants said it unfairly promoted its own services, forced advertisers to accept exclusivity deals, and blocked companies from transferring advertising data to other online ad platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The complaint is often that there's too much at stake. The claim is Google is now too powerful and it's really tantamount to a utility that everybody uses," said Greg Sterling, an Internet consultant and a contributing editor for the online blog Search Engine Land.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG IN EUROPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The situation is particularly acute in Europe, where Google controls roughly 77 percent of the market share of search queries, according to industry analytics firm ComScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This month, the EU confirmed that it had also taken over two complaints about Google's search practices from German competition authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has said it intends to cooperate with the EU's investigation. But the company has a history of keeping its search algorithm close to the vest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Google provides certain guidelines about its algorithms to help Web publishers ensure that their sites are accurately ranked, the hundreds of specific "ranking factors" that it uses to rank websites, and the weight it attaches to each of those factors, remain a much-speculated-upon mystery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We provide more guidance for websites than any other search engine, and we're constantly exploring new ways to be even more transparent with webmasters about our ranking principles," Google spokesman Adam Kovacevich said in an email. "But disclosing the exact details would only help spammers, make search engines less useful, and hurt our users."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foundem, one of the complainants in the EU case, has said it is not seeking to get Google to publish details of its algorithm. Instead, it said on the website searchneutrality.org, the company wants Google to be more transparent about the rationale for the various "exclusionary penalties" that can keep certain sites out of search results, and for Google to provide an appeals process for websites that feel such penalties have been mistakenly applied to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foundem is a member of ICOMP, an online trade group that has received funding from Microsoft. One of the other complainants in the EU case, German price comparison site Ciao, is owned by Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EASY FIX?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google joins other technology giants, including Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Microsoft, whose business practices have triggered scrutiny from European regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which was fined 1.68 billion euros over the course of its decade-plus battle with the Commission, agreed to give European consumers better access to rival Internet browsers in Windows and to improve interoperability with its products last December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The key challenge for the Commission now is to show that Google conscientiously abused its power in the search market to harm certain websites, said Brett Gordon, a professor at Columbia Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Commission would have to show that Google unfairly tampered with their algorithm to disadvantage other search services," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, France's antitrust watchdog warned the company not to abuse its dominant position in online advertising, citing a list of possible anti-competitive practices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google had settled with the French regulator two months earlier when it pledged to make its AdWords advertising policy in that country more clear and transparent following a complaint it had unfairly scrapped a company's contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar tactic could work with the European Commission, said Christopher Thomas, a partner at law firm Hogan Lovells.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The issue is not the algorithms, the issue is whether they can be changed in a way to sufficiently reassure the Commission without undermining what Google feels is the core of its business. If easy changes can be made, Google may be inclined to do that," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One thing's for sure: The pressure on Google can only grow, said Thomas Vinje, a partner at Clifford Chance, who had led a coalition that took on Microsoft. That then led to the European Commission imposing a total fine of 1.68 billion euros for antitrust infringements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The launch of formal probes tends to generate more voices, to cause more people to jump into the fray, and make it more likely that other complainants will come forward with other allegations of abusive conduct," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So this case might well go on for quite some time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Edwin Chan, Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is working on a version of its core Windows operating system for devices such as tablets, according to media reports on Tuesday, and the company said its Windows Phone 7 software is making headway in the booming smartphone market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to unveil a version of its operating software that runs for the first time on processors designed by UK-based ARM Holdings PLC, the Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg reported. ARM's processors dominate the tablet and handheld device market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft intends to announce a version of its operating system to run on ARM chip architecture, which competes with the "x86" designs favored by Intel, the Wall Street Journal cited people familiar with the plans as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear when such an operating system might come to market, but the U.S. software maker could claim lost ground in tablets and other battery-powered mobile devices by forging a new partnership with ARM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and ARM declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said on Tuesday that more than 1.5 million cellphones carrying Windows Phone 7 operating software have sold in the first six weeks of launch, meeting what the company called "realistic" expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows Phone 7 may be Microsoft's last chance to establish a major presence in a hot cellphone market now dominated by Apple Inc and Google Inc, analysts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The sales numbers were disclosed for the first time by Achim Berg, vice president of business and marketing for Windows phones, in an internally conducted interview posted on Microsoft's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a decent number. The mobile market is going to be a battle for Microsoft," said Colin Gillis, an analyst with BGC Partners who has a "buy" rating on Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's disappearance from the phone market and its delayed response to tablet devices like Apple's iPad has been seen as a drag on shares this year. Its shares closed up 26 cents on Tuesday at $28.07.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DECENT SHOWING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Gillis noted that the shipment of 1.5 million phones was sales into the distribution channel, rather than directly into consumers' hands, which tempers the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan's HTC, Dell Inc, Samsung Electronics and LG Electronics are among the vendors who have launched or plan to begin selling Phone 7-based devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The industry is closely watching the early days of what could be a longer-term driver of growth. Gillis forecasts about 25 million Phone 7 sales in 2011. In contrast, analysts expect Apple to sell more than 60 million iPhones next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We all know that the competition is extreme in this industry, and we have to compete on multiple fronts," Berg said in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are on a path to begin releasing the first of several updates in the next couple of months, and several more mobile operators around the world will introduce Windows Phone 7 on their network in 2011."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gillis noted that Microsoft is spending $500 million to market the Windows 7 smartphone, and suggested the company could see market gains by using some of that cash to subsidize the devices so consumers get them for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's state-run health service will get a partial rebate from GlaxoSmithKline if the company's new kidney cancer drug Votrient does not match up to a rival medicine in a head-to-head clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The unusual deal, the first of its kind, hints at the type of complex arrangements that could become commonplace as Britain moves to a system of value-based drug pricing from the end of 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Draft guidance from cost-effectiveness watchdog the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on Friday recommends Votrient for use on the National Health Service (NHS), as long as GSK offers the special price scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal provides for a straight 12.5 percent discount to bring the cost of Votrient to the NHS into line with that of Pfizer's Sutent, and also guarantees a financial rebate if Votrient proves inferior to Sutent in the clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results of the study will not be known until mid-2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we fail to confirm that they are comparable in efficacy -- which we do not expect -- then we provide a rebate back to the NHS as a result," GSK's head of British operations, Simon Jose, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are moving in the direction where price is driven by value and value is driven by evidence, and therefore we can start to construct different sorts of arrangements where we can balance this off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The exact scale of the potential rebate has not been disclosed. The monthly cost of Votrient and Sutent -- both of which are tablets -- is just under 2,000 pounds ($3,085) per patient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carole Longson, NICE's health technology evaluation center director, said the rebate scheme made Votrient a cost-effective proposition. The drug offers patients an additional option and, for some, a more favourable side effect profile, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NICE expects to issue final guidance on Votrient in February 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MODEST SELLER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Votrient, also known by its chemical name pazopanib, is seen as a modest seller for GSK in the next few years, with global sales expected to reach $314 million in 2014, according to consensus forecasts from Thomson Reuters Pharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Votrient and Sutent are so-called protein kinase inhibitors, a relatively new class of targeted cancer treatment. Other new drugs for kidney cancer have been rejected by NICE and GSK has previously failed to persuade NICE to endorse its Tyverb drug for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jose said it was often difficult to demonstrate the full value of new cancer medicines initially and the idea of linking prices to longer-term scientific evidence could be a model for future negotiations between government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The British government outlined plans last week for a radical shake-up of medicines policy from the end of 2013, after which it will introduce a system of "value-based" pricing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new scheme would allow companies to make drugs available at a "contingent" price that could be revised later in the light of further evidence about a drug's effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ben Hirschler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Dec 24 (Reuters) - Britain's state-run health
service will get a partial rebate from GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L)
if the company's new kidney cancer drug Votrient does not match
up to a rival medicine in a head-to-head clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The unusual deal, the first of its kind, hints at the type
of complex arrangements that could become commonplace as Britain
moves to a system of value-based drug pricing from the end of
2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Draft guidance from cost-effectiveness watchdog the National
Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) on Friday
recommends Votrient for use on the National Health Service
(NHS), as long as GSK offers the special price scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal provides for a straight 12.5 percent discount to
bring the cost of Votrient to the NHS into line with that of
Pfizer's (PFE.N) Sutent, and also guarantees a financial rebate
if Votrient proves inferior to Sutent in the clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The results of the study will not be known until mid-2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we fail to confirm that they are comparable in efficacy
-- which we do not expect -- then we provide a rebate back to
the NHS as a result," GSK's head of British operations, Simon
Jose, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are moving in the direction where price is driven by
value and value is driven by evidence, and therefore we can
start to construct different sorts of arrangements where we can
balance this off."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The exact scale of the potential rebate has not been
disclosed. The monthly cost of Votrient and Sutent -- both of
which are tablets -- is just under 2,000 pounds ($3,085) per

for some, a more favourable side effect profile, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NICE expects to issue final guidance on Votrient in February

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MODEST SELLER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Votrient, also known by its chemical name pazopanib, is seen
as a modest seller for GSK in the next few years, with global
sales expected to reach $314 million in 2014, according to
consensus forecasts from Thomson Reuters Pharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Votrient and Sutent are so-called protein kinase
inhibitors, a relatively new class of targeted cancer treatment.
Other new drugs for kidney cancer have been rejected by NICE and
GSK has previously failed to persuade NICE to endorse its Tyverb
drug for breast cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jose said it was often difficult to demonstrate the full
value of new cancer medicines initially and the idea of linking
prices to longer-term scientific evidence could be a model for
future negotiations between government and industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The British government outlined plans last week for a
radical shake-up of medicines policy from the end of 2013, after
which it will introduce a system of "value-based" pricing. 
[ID:nLDE6BF15G]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new scheme would allow companies to make drugs available
at a "contingent" price that could be revised later in the light
of further evidence about a drug's effectiveness.

			Chevron Corporation: Lago Agrio Plaintiffs&#8217; Consultants Concede 
      that $113 Billion Damages Claim Lacks Scientific Basis
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Chevron calls for scientifically illegitimate reports to be rejected 
      by Court
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Admissions during court-ordered depositions of the plaintiffs&#8217; own 
      consultants confirm there is no scientific basis for the $113 billion 
      damages claim in litigation pending in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. Over the 
      last two weeks, attorneys for Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) questioned 
      the six consultants credited with the latest damage assessment. The 
      sixth consultant was deposed yesterday.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In filings this week in Lago Agrio, Chevron submitted deposition 
      transcripts to the Court and called for the damages assessment to be 
      rejected in its entirety. Among the most obvious flaws with the 
      assessment is the consultants&#8217; overwhelming reliance on the discredited 
      &#8220;Cabrera Report,&#8221; a court-ordered &#8220;independent&#8221; assessment of 
      environmental conditions of the Oriente region of Ecuador. The 
      report was allegedly authored by Richard Stalin Cabrera, a mining 
      engineer. In recent months, however, &#8220;Cabrera&#8217;s&#8221; report has been shown 
      to be a fraud principally ghostwritten by Stratus Consulting, a 
      Colorado-based environmental firm working directly for the plaintiffs&#8217; 
      lawyers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These new assessments are an attempt to bring the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers&#8217; 
      false evidence back into the Lago Agrio Court under the cover of new 
      names and indefensible numbers,&#8221; stated R. Hewitt Pate, Chevron vice 
      president and general counsel. &#8220;At this point, the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers 
      have no legitimate evidence to advance their claims, so they&#8217;ve resorted 
      to a shell game.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under direct questioning from Chevron attorneys, the five plaintiffs&#8217; 
      consultants conceded that their work is factually baseless and does not 
      support the plaintiffs&#8217; absurd financial claims. More specifically:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        When asked what the scientific basis was for assuming that an excess 
        risk of cancer existed in Lago Agrio from 1967 to 1987, Dr. Daniel 
        Rourke, who wrote the plaintiffs&#8217; $69 billion submission about excess 
        cancer risk, testified, &#8220;It&#8217;s an assumption of the calculations. There 
        is no scientific basis.&#8221; Dr. Rourke said that he was &#8220;not offering the 
        opinion that Chevron took any action that actually caused anybody to 
        get cancer.&#8221; Rourke explained that he was never even asked to try and 
        estimate any number of excess cancers allegedly caused by Texaco oil 
        operations.
      
			
        Consultant Jonathan Shefftz testified under oath that he was &#8220;not 
        making any sort of analysis&#8221; of alleged &#8220;unjust enrichment&#8221; in the 
        case, despite the fact that the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers claimed his report 
        assessed up to US$37.86 billion in unjust enrichment. Rather, Shefftz 
        used &#8220;random&#8221; numbers for his mathematical calculations because he did 
        not have &#8220;any opinion on&#8212;on what the true underlying values are.&#8221;
      
			
        Douglas Allen, another of plaintiffs&#8217; consultants, refused to say that 
        the alleged $1.86 billion remediation costs in his report reflected 
        actual costs: &#8220;I am not telling you these are actual costs, I&#8217;m 
        telling you that this is the conceptual and potential range of costs 
        for cleaning up soil in the concession area &#8230; based upon the 
        assumptions and the uncertainties and limitations of my valuation.&#8221; 
        Mr. Allen repeatedly described his report as merely &#8220;conceptual.&#8221;
      
			
        Dr. Lawrence Barnthouse, testified that he reviewed the Cabrera Report 
        but performed no damages assessment of his own. He admitted that the 
        methodology Cabrera used was &#8220;an unreliable indicator,&#8221; 
        &#8220;[s]uboptimal[, and] inadequate,&#8221; and he &#8220;did not conclude anything 
        about the validity&#8221; of the Cabrera Report&#8217;s claim of $1.7 billion in 
        ecosystem damages, other than that the numbers in the Cabrera Report 
        &#8220;were uncertain.&#8221;
      
			
        Dr. Emilio Picone admitted that the methodology used in his report, 
        which the plaintiffs lawyers use to claim $1.4 billion in health care 
        costs, was &#8220;rudimentary at best,&#8221; and &#8220;doesn&#8217;t provide you any 
        estimate of the amount of health care costs associated with petroleum 
        exposure.&#8221; In fact, Dr. Picone &#8220;didn&#8217;t reach the conclusion that 
        health care needs of the population in the Oriente can be tied to 
        Texaco&#8217;s operations.&#8221; He further conceded, when confronted by the lack 
        of evidence for his opinion, that &#8220;for American courts, you truly need 
        to have more data to support whatever you&#8217;re indicating.&#8221;
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Deposition testimony further revealed that the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers&#8217; $113 
      billion assessment relies extensively on the Cabrera Report. Allen, for 
      example, testified that the plaintiffs&#8217; representatives said that he 
      should use the Cabrera Report as a &#8220;starting point.&#8221; Shefftz&#8217;s report 
      likewise depends upon &#8220;data and cost figures from the Cabrera report.&#8221; 
      Dr. Barnthouse also conceded that much of the information he used was 
      &#8220;only available from the Cabrera Report,&#8221; And, like other consultants, 
      Dr. Barnthouse did nothing to assess the validity of any of the 
      assumptions made in the Cabrera Report, he simply &#8220;assume[d] that 
      [Cabrera] was correctly characterizing&#8221; relevant environmental 
      standards. Shefftz admitted that he &#8220;was not engaging in any exercise to 
      verify [Cabrera&#8217;s] data series or his cost figures. I was just using 
      them in my report.&#8221; In fact, he confessed that he did not &#8220;know one way 
      or the other whether they&#8217;re correct or not,&#8221; conceding that his 
      &#8220;results depend, in part, on the accuracy of [Cabrera&#8217;s] data series and 
      [Cabrera&#8217;s] cost figures.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is now indisputable that the plaintiffs&#8217; lawyers&#8217; September 16, 2010 
      filing with the Lago Agrio Court is an attempt to whitewash their prior, 
      unlawful collusion with the court-appointed &#8220;independent&#8221; expert. The 
      new, $113 billion &#8220;assessments&#8221; are even more extreme and scientifically 
      unreliable than the fraudulent $27.3 billion Cabrera report from which 
      they admittedly are derived. By ignoring the role of Petroecuador as the 
      majority owner of the consortium during Texaco&#8217;s time in Ecuador and as 
      the sole owner and operator of the oil fields for the last 20 years, the 
      new reports continue the joint efforts of the plaintiffs and the 
      government of Ecuador to deflect attention from the state-owned oil 
      company that bears sole responsibility for all remaining environmental 
      impacts outside the scope of Texaco&#8217;s remediation in the 1990&#8217;s. The 
      plaintiffs&#8217; consultants conceded under oath that Petroecuador&#8217;s role in 
      oil production should not have been overlooked and that, had it been 
      considered, it would have affected their reports.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Independent energy company Petrohawk Energy Corp (HK.N) sold its natural gas assets in Fayetteville shale, Arkansas, to Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) unit XTO Energy for $650 million, in a deal that analysts said undervalued the assets.&lt;/p&gt;

Petrohawk Energy Corp (HK.N) sold its natural gas assets in
Fayetteville shale, Arkansas, to Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) unit
XTO Energy for $650 million, in a deal that analysts said
undervalued the assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petrohawk shares were down 2 percent at $18.26 in midday

Houston-based Petrohawk had planned for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company had sold its stake in its Haynesville midstream
operations to Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (KMP.N) for $875
million in April and said it would reduce its rig count in the
"gassy" Haynesville and double it in the liquid-focused Eagle
Ford shale in Texas. [ID:nSGE63C0E7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And in March it had sold assets in Louisiana and Oklahoma
for combined proceeds of about $475 million. [ID:nSGE6200DR]
[ID:nSGE62E0R7]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices CLc1 are up over 23 percent year-to-date but
gas prices NGc1 are down about 30 percent, pushing U.S.
exploration and production firms to shift dollars to acreage
with crude oil or natural gas with a high liquids content.
[ID:nSGE6BF0A1]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it will sell its Fayetteville upstream
assets for $575 million and midstream assets for $75 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jefferies and Co analyst Subash Chandra said in a note that
the Fayetteville sale was below his expectations, adding he
expected $650 million for the upstream assets and $300 million
for midstream.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chandra, however, said the company will not face problems
with funding its capital needs till the end of 2011. In
November, Petrohawk set its 2011 capital budget at about $2.3
billion. [ID:nSGE6A10FP]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wells Fargo Securities analyst Michael Hall said the deal
value was below his expectations, but viewed it as a positive
in terms of funding.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The sale values the assets' proved reserves at $1.92 per
thousand cubic feet equivalent, according to brokerage firms
Global Hunter Securities and Tudor Pickering Holt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This is about 32 percent lower than what Exxon Mobil was
estimated to have paid for XTO, which it acquired in December
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Petrohawk estimates Fayetteville upstream proved reserves
of about 299 billion cubic feet equivalent as of Dec. 31, 2009,
and current production of 98 million cubic feet equivalent per
day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Merrill Lynch acted as financial adviser to
Petrohawk for both transactions.

			Here are highlights from Wednesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Microsoft ARMs Its Way Into Mobile
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While it is still mostly speculation, there has been a flood of news 
      reports about an agreement between&#160;Microsoft Corp&#160;(Nasdaq: MSFT) 
      and&#160;ARM Holdings&#160;(Nasdaq: ARMH) 
      that would effectively end the exclusivity of Windows on the x86 
      architecture used by&#160;Intel Corp&#160;(Nasdaq: INTC) 
      and&#160;Advanced Micro Devices&#160;(NYSE: AMD).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It has been rumored that the Microsoft-ARM plans will be discussed at 
      the CES 2011 to be held next month. But Microsoft&#8217;s exact plans remain 
      shrouded in mystery, since the company could be building either the 
      Windows Phone 7 OS or the Windows 7 OS to support ARM chips.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For Microsoft, it makes more sense to build on the former, since ARM is 
      basically dominant in portable devices (mainly smartphones and tablets), 
      where Microsoft would like a stronger share. On the other hand, its 
      software is well-entrenched and growing in the more traditional 
      computing devices, so it does not need ARM here. Additionally, the ARM 
      architecture probably does not have sufficient computing power to run 
      Windows 7.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      So what could be in it for ARM? The architecture developed and licensed 
      by the company is by far the dominant one used in portable devices. It 
      would therefore like a share of the more traditional computing market 
      and an alliance with Microsoft could just give it a toe-hold here.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is apparent that Intel/AMD and ARM have the same goal -- the 
      development of technology that could put computing power and low energy 
      consumption in the same package. While Intel and AMD are working from 
      the high computing power/high energy consumption side of the fence, ARM 
      is working from the low computing power/low energy consumption side.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      So whatever they do, there may be some reason to cheer down the road, 
      but we don&#8217;t really see anything significant happening very soon. Let us 
      also not forget the new technology from MIPS Technologies (the recently 
      announced MIPS32 1074K family of application processors) that are 
      intended to challenge both ARM and x86 architectures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Which brings us to another mega OS --&#160;Google Inc&#8217;s (Nasdaq: GOOG) 
      Android. While built on ARM architecture, the OS does not work on chip 
      architectures and it is for this reason that the MIPS technology could 
      gain ground. However, the company is a very tiny David compared to very 
      big Intel/ARM Goliaths.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft&#8217;s decision to build a Windows platform supporting ARM could 
      also be a first step toward a more neutral -- and therefore more 
      universal -- OS, such as the Android.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We have been watching these stocks performances today, and ARM Holdings 
      has responded the most, rising sharply at first and then tracking to 
      around a 3.5% increase. It therefore looks as if investors perceive 
      ARM&#8217;s advantage to be the most significant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Google and Intel shares currently have a Zacks #2 Rank, implying a 
      short-term Buy recommendation. Microsoft and AMD shares are ranked #3 
      (short-term Hold recommendation) and ARMH #4 (short-term Sell 
      recommendation).

      This morning&#160;Bank of America Corp.&#160;(NYSE: BAC) 
      is surging to the upside by 0.35 cents to $13.34. The stock has now 
      rallied higher by 20.0 percent since November 30th, 2010 when it was 
      rumored that a Wikileak cable was going to report negative news for the 
      stock. Ever since the Wikileak founder Julian Assange has been arrested 
      all of the large bank stocks have jumped higher.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			J.P. Morgan Chase  Co.&#160;(NYSE: JPM) 
      has traded higher by nearly 12.0 percent since November 30th, 2010.&#160;Wells 
      Fargo  Co.&#160;(NYSE: WFC) 
      has climbed higher by 17.0 percent from the same time. Today the large 
      banks are the strongest sector in the market continuing to trade higher 
      all morning.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The highly popular&#160;Financial Select Sector SPDR ETF&#160;(NYSE: XLF) 
      has recently broke out on the daily chart. The XLF is now approaching 
      the $16.00 level which is a 10.0 percent increase from its November 
      30th, 2010 low. The XLF will have some daily chart resistance around the

      Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Highlights: Family Dollar Stores, Big 
      Lots, JPMorgan
			Chase  Co., Bank of America and Wells 
      Fargo  Company
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Zacks Equity Research highlights: 
      Family Dollar Stores&#160;(NYSE: FDO) 
      as the Bull of the Day and Big Lots Inc.&#160;(NYSE: BIG) 
      as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides 
      analysis on JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#160;(NYSE: JPM), 
      Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC) 
      and Wells Fargo  Company&#160;(NYSE: WFC).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bull 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Family Dollar Stores'&#160;(NYSE: FDO) 
      strategic initiatives to improve merchandising and store operations have 
      helped grow the top and bottom lines. The company's point-of-sale 
      technology and store realignment initiatives are helping to drive 
      traffic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is tremendous opportunity to increase gross margin by renewed 
      effort on its store brand portfolio. These initiatives helped the 
      company to post healthy fourth-quarter 2010 results. Management now 
      expects growth of 8% to 10% in net sales and an increase of 13% to 20% 
      in earnings per share in fiscal 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In spite of intense competition from other established players and 
      erratic consumer spending pattern, we remain bullish on the stock.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bear 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Big Lots Inc.'s&#160;(NYSE: BIG) 
      third-quarter 2010 earnings missed both the Zacks Consensus Estimate and 
      its own outlook. The company also delivered disappointing comparable 
      store sales results, rising marginally by 0.7% as against growth of 2% 
      to 4% forecast by management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The lower-than-expected third-quarter 2010 results prompted management 
      to lower its earnings outlook. Big Lots now expects fiscal 2010 earnings 
      in the range of $2.75 to $2.81 per share, down from its previous 
      guidance range of $2.82 to $2.90. Following this, a negative sentiment 
      is palpable among the analysts covering the stock, and we are witnessing 
      a fall in the Zacks Consensus Estimates.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Big Lots, which operates in a highly competitive discount retail 
      business, faces stiff competition from other general merchandise, 
      discount, food, arts and crafts, and dollar store retailers. This may 
      result in loss of market share, fall in sales and operating margins.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			JPMorgan Finds Small Biz Beautiful
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#160;(NYSE: JPM) 
      continues to make contributions to the economic recovery by lending out 
      to small businesses. In 2010, the banking arm of JPMorgan extended loans 
      of more than $10 billion to U.S. small businesses, the company said on 
      Tuesday. This represents more than a 40% increase in small business 
      loans year to date.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Small business lending has been a topic of intense discussion since the 
      financial crisis. Many of the U.S. banks, which had taken government 
      funding to avert a collapse faced public pressure to help reduce 
      unemployment by providing loans to small businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Rate Cut: A Further Motivation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is probably not enough to just extend loans. Since small businesses 
      are required to create jobs, JPMorgan initiated a new plan in June. Per 
      this plan, JPMorgan slashed loan rates on small businesses that hire new 
      employees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan lowered the rate by 0.5 percentage points for every new 
      employee appointed in a small business, with a maximum of three 
      employees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Apart from lowering loan rates, JPMorgan also provided discounts to 
      small businesses for opening checking accounts. The company expects 
      these small businesses to take full advantage of the lower interest 
      rates and thereby help reduce unemployment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The new program initiated by JPMorgan is applicable to new lines of 
      credit of up to $250,000. However, its previous customers can avail this 
      facility by increasing their line of credit by $10,000 or more.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Other Lenders in the Arena
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Besides JPMorgan, many other companies are also continuing various 
      programs to support small businesses.&#160;Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: 
      BAC) has continued to 
      increase its spending on small and medium-sized and diverse businesses. 
      The company pledged to buy $10 billion of products and services from the 
      small companies over the next half decade, with a 5% increase in 
      spending every year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Wells Fargo  Company&#160;(NYSE: WFC) 
      has also remained one of the largest providers of small business credit 
      in the U.S. economy in 2010 and continued to lend to credit-worthy 
      customers.

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details
regarding this unique opportunity please visit: www.microcapsdaily.com.

    On Wednesday 12/8/10 dPollution International Inc. (PINK SHEETS - RMGX)
announced that it has received a request for the supply of 3,000 units of
its patented dPollution Device. The units are to be delivered to Stem
Italia S.R.L. of Rome, Italy and distributed to the members of A.N.C.
Associazione Nazionale di Categoria Trasporto Persone e Mobilita, the
association of tourist bus drivers in the Province of Lazio, Italy.
A.N.C. will be acquiring the units to install on its members fleets of
diesel buses to ensure their compliance with the Province of Lazio's new
Low Emission Zone (LEZ) standards, which will be enforced starting in
2011. 

    In the U.S. market alone, there are 250 million registered passenger
vehicles and dPollution (RMGX) owns the exclusive manufacturing and
distribution rights to a patented fuel conditioning technology which
significantly increases mileage and lowers harmful GHG emissions.
dPollution's revolutionary device improves engine performance by causing
fuel to combust more thoroughly and efficiently. This technology works on
every internal combustion engine in the world. Considering that IC
engines are used in cars, buses, trucks, diesel trains, construction
equipment, farm equipment and a variety of military vehicles the market
for this device is virtually limitless. For more information, please

Board focused Wall Street investment advisor. Here at MicroCapsDaily we

			IBM: Putting IP at the Forefront
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Riyon Harding, a speaker at the marcus evans IP Law Summit Spring 2011, 
      discusses IP protection strategies
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			IP Law Summit Spring 2011
			HOLLYWOOD, Florida, March 24-26
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interview with: Riyon Harding, Executive IP Strategist, IBM
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Think always,&#8221; is the message that Riyon Harding, Executive IP 
      Strategist at IBM would like to convey to Intellectual 
      Property (IP) Counsel. IP is the new gold. An organization's IP 
      strategy should be thoughtfully shaped and developed from the beginning, 
      and never an afterthought. A speaker at the marcus evans IP 
      Law Summit Spring 2011 in Hollywood, Florida, March 24-26, 
      Harding discusses IBM&#8217;s approach to IP 
      protection, and how to make the most of your organization&#8217;s jewels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			What are the most prominent issues challenging IP Counsel in the US 
      at the moment?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Riyon Harding: &#8220;The lack of data available to make reasonable decisions 
      with some certainty in a timely manner is an issue for IP 
      Counsel today. When working with suppliers, contractors and 
      partners, it is unknown if and how your IP is protected. A submarine 
      patent could suddenly surface and wreak havoc on unsuspecting suppliers 
      or your sole product line.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is a lot of guesswork that goes into valuing patents 
      or an IP portfolio. IP Counsel have to be proactive, use all existing 
      resources in their IP research, and make predictions and decisions based 
      on that data. It is important to direct RD and business teams to 
      develop and protect IP that are known to be critical for risk mitigation 
      and future negotiation leverage. IP Counsel need to have a good 
      understanding of the portfolio, protect assets in the regions or 
      countries where they do business, and make sure the patents they are 
      maintaining are or might be of need in the future.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			What has worked best at safeguarding IP, copyrights and trademarks at 
      IBM? How do you capitalize on your innovations?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Riyon Harding: &#8220;IBM has a policy of being transparent. We are proud of 
      our innovation and do not take conscious measures to hide it. We do 
      note, however, that some strategies we have seen include creating a new 
      holding company for IP with a very different name. As far as 
      capitalizing on our innovations - our IP teams are just as creative as 
      our engineers and researchers. They see new business opportunities and 
      strategies for IP at every turn.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			With such a global presence, how does this work?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Riyon Harding: &#8220;We staff all of our worldwide IP offices with the best 
      and brightest. Each IP team member knows not only the laws of their 
      country, but also the cultural and human aspects. We communicate 
      effectively and have a special &#8220;IBM Family&#8221; type of camaraderie. Our 
      portfolio managers know all of the other IBM portfolio managers around 
      the globe. Communicating and bringing our knowledge together helps us 
      overcome the challenge of managing a global portfolio.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Do you have a final message to IP Counsel?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Riyon Harding: &#8220;Think always. The world is moving to a knowledge-based 
      economy. IP is the new intangible gold. We are also finding that 
      collaboration and open innovation (not proprietary) is the wave of the 
      future - it is how real invention happens. Innovation is a cultural 
      being. The more you know the more powerful you are and the more 
      capabilities and tools you have to expand your business, grow market 
      share and increase profits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      My message to IP Counsel would be that IP should never be an 
      afterthought. It should be thoughtfully shaped and developed from the 
      beginning, part of the culture, and always at the forefront.&#8221;

Disney movies into people's homes is a great way for our customers to

bring through VOD to our customers - our new Disney 3D lineup is a
wonderful evolution to those."

			Cafferty Faucher LLP Files Class Action Lawsuit against JPMorgan and 
      HSBC Alleging Manipulation of Silver Bar Financial Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Cafferty Faucher LLP (www.caffertyfaucher.com) 
      filed a lawsuit on behalf of a class that includes purchasers and 
      sellers of the iShares Silver Trust (NYSE-Arca &#8220;SLV&#8221;) and the ETF 
      Securities Ltd. Silver Trust (NYSE-Arca &#8220;SIVR&#8221;) during the period March 
      1, 2008 through the present.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The lawsuit alleges that JPMorgan, the custodian of silver backing SLV 
      securities and the sub-custodian of silver backing SIVR securities, and 
      HSBC, the custodian of silver backing the SIVR securities,&#160;manipulated 
      and suppressed the price of silver bar financial products, including SLV 
      and SIVR, in violation of Section 9 of the Securities Exchange Act.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If you purchased or sold the iShares Silver Trust ETF (NYSE-Arca &#8220;SLV&#8221;) 
      or the ETF Securities Silver Trust (NYSE-Arca &#8220;SIVR&#8221;) securities during 
      the period March 1, 2008 through the present, you may move the Court&#160;to 
      serve as lead plaintiff within 60 days. The lawsuit, Case No. 
      1:10-cv-07768, was&#160;filed in the Northern District of Illinois on 
      December 7, 2010 and is currently assigned to the Honorable Charles R. 
      Norgle, Sr.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The case is also brought on behalf of&#160;investors who purchased or sold 
      CME Group Inc&#8217;s &#8220;COMEX&#8221; silver futures&#160;or options contracts which are 
      traded electronically&#160;through the Chicago-based &#8220;GLOBEX&#8221; platform 
      and&#160;through COMEX. On behalf of these investors, the lawsuit alleges 
      violations of the anti-manipulation provisions of the Commodity Exchange 
      Act.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to the claims under the anti-manipulation provisions of the 
      Securities Exchange Act and the Commodity Exchange Act, the lawsuit also 
      alleges&#160;that defendants violated federal antitrust law.

      Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day Highlights: Hormel Foods, Vulcan 
      Materials, JPMorgan Chase  Co., U.S. Bancorp and&#160;BBT Corporation
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Zacks Equity Research highlights: 
      Hormel Foods&#160;(NYSE: HRL) 
      as the Bull of the Day and Vulcan Materials (NYSE: VMC) 
      as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides 
      analysis on JPMorgan Chase  Co.&#160;(NYSE: JPM), 
      U.S. Bancorp&#160;(NYSE: USB) 
      and&#160;BBT Corporation&#160;(NYSE: BBT).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Here is a synopsis of all five stocks:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bull 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We upgrade our recommendation on&#160;Hormel Foods&#160;(NYSE: HRL) 
      from Neutral to Outperform based on the expectations of an increase in 
      market demand and food prices in future.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hence, the first quarter and fiscal 2011 Zacks estimate went up by $0.09 
      and $0.15 per share, respectively. With several acquisitions including 
      the recent Don Miguel, Hormel has been strengthening its position. 
      Acquisitions are likely to be its key growth strategy in future combined 
      with strong liquidity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Although the food market is highly competitive, a greater share of 
      value-added branded products in Hormel's product-mix will help it to 
      strengthen its margins and reduce exposure to commodity prices in the 
      long term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bear 
      of the Day:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite being the largest producer of construction aggregates and a 
      leading producer of other construction materials,&#160;Vulcan 
      Materials (NYSE: VMC) 
      faces intense competition and a challenging environment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The nearly stalled construction business has yet to show positive signs 
      of recovery, jeopardizing the prospects of the building materials and 
      other related products markets. In the most recent quarter, Vulcan 
      failed to live up to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.19 per share by 
      posting a profit of only $0.08.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, its cash position has also deteriorated. Based on the above 
      conditions, we continue with our Underperform recommendation on the 
      stock and set a target price of $36.00.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			A Happy New Year for U.S. Economy?
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to&#160;Center for American Progress, the tax-cut deal 
      is expected to create about 3.1 million new jobs in total after adding 
      up different provisions. The estimate is based on the Congressional 
      Budget Office's estimate of one million new jobs for each 1% of GDP 
      growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, based on the same assumption, the Obama administration had 
      previously claimed that the $787 billion American Recovery and 
      Reinvestment Act would create 3.5 million jobs. But the unemployment 
      rate stood at 9.8%. This is basically because the government is a bit 
      reluctant to create jobs in the private sector directly by implementing 
      rules or laws.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Though the government stimulus packages can increase GDP, most of the 
      private sector firms are on the verge of recovering their financial 
      conditions with cost savings by limiting recruitments. We don&#8217;t think 
      the new tax-cut deal will be able to address the unemployment problem to 
      a great extent, as many of the companies are still struggling with weak 
      financials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The recession continues to take its toll on banks. There have been 151 
      bank failures so far this year. With loan losses on commercial real 
      estate on the rise, hundreds of more banks are likely to crash in the 
      next few years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bank failures have resulted in a wave of consolidation in the 
      industry. When Washington Mutual was in the red in 2008 and was deemed 
      as the largest bank failure in the U.S. history, it was acquired by&#160;JPMorgan 
      Chase  Co.&#160;(NYSE: JPM). 
      The other major acquirers of failed institutions since 2008 include&#160;U.S. 
      Bancorp&#160;(NYSE: USB) 
      and&#160;BBT Corporation&#160;(NYSE: BBT).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      If the current pace of consolidation continues, we will see the 
      emergence of a handful of large banks. As a result, the overall economy 
      will not remain unscathed and job creation will become vulnerable.

      Here are highlights from Friday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Another Drop in Crude Stockpiles
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The U.S. Energy Department's weekly inventory release showed a 
      larger-than-expected drop in crude and distillate stockpiles, while 
      gasoline supplies continued with their climb. Meanwhile, refinery 
      run-rates were down slightly from the previous week.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Energy Information Administration (&#8220;EIA&#8221;) Petroleum Status Report &#8211; 
      that contains data for the previous week ending on Friday &#8211; outlines 
      information regarding the weekly change in petroleum inventories held 
      and produced by the U.S., both locally and abroad.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The report provides an overview of the level of reserves and their 
      movements, thereby helping investors to understand the demand/supply 
      dynamics of petroleum products. It is an indicator of current oil prices 
      and volatility that affect businesses of companies engaged in oil and 
      refining industry like&#160;ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM),&#160;Chevron 
      Corp. (NYSE: CVX),&#160;ConocoPhillips 
      (NYE: COP),&#160;Valero 
      (NYSE: VLO)&#160;and&#160;Tesoro 
      (NYSE: TSO).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Crude Oil
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The federal government&#8217;s EIA reported that crude inventories fell by 
      5.33 million barrels for the week ending December 17, 2010, well above 
      expectations by analysts surveyed by Platts. The decrease in oil stocks 
      &#8211; the third in as many weeks &#8211; came even as imports increased and 
      refineries operated at lower capacity. It can be attributed to cold 
      weather conditions and year-end inventory adjustment decisions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Stockpiles in the world's biggest oil user have fallen by more than 19 
      million barrels since November 26, sending crude prices to above $90 a 
      barrel.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, at 340.7 million barrels, crude supplies are 4.0% above the 
      year-earlier level and remain above the upper limit of the average for 
      this time of the year. The crude supply cover was down from 23.8 days in 
      the previous week to 23.1 days. In the year-ago period, the supply cover 
      was 23.7 days.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Gasoline
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Supplies of gasoline rose for the fifth consecutive week, as imports and 
      production rose, while demand slipped. The 2.40 million barrels jump &#8211; 
      more than analyst projections &#8211; took the gasoline stockpiles to 217.2 
      million barrels. Current inventory levels are 0.4% above year-earlier 
      levels and are on the upper half of the average range.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Distillate
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Distillate fuel inventories (including diesel and heating oil) were down 
      by 589 thousand barrels last week, trumping forecasts for a smaller 
      drawdown. The decrease in distillate fuel supplies came as demand rose 
      278 thousand barrels per day, more than offsetting the rise in 
      production levels. At 160.7 million barrels, distillate supplies were 
      0.4% less than the year-ago level but just above the upper boundary of 
      the average range for this time of the year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Refinery Rates
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Refinery utilization was down 0.3% from the prior week to 87.7%. 
      Analysts were looking for the refinery run rate to decrease slightly 
      less to 87.85%.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Microsoft's IDR at 'AA+'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the following ratings for Microsoft Corp. 
      (Microsoft):
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'AA+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF) at 'AA+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'AA+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-Term IDR at 'F1+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial Paper (CP) Program at 'F1+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The affirmations reflect the following considerations:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Modest revenue growth is anticipated through FY 2011 (ending June 30) 
      driven by a continuation of the Windows 7 upgrade cycle, a renewed 
      corporate IT refresh cycle and modestly improved consumer spending.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch expects continued strong cash flow generation which Microsoft 
      utilizes to fund its share repurchase and dividend programs. Fitch 
      expects cash generation from operations to be strong enough to pay for 
      modest annual increases in both dividends and share repurchases over 
      next several years excluding the potential for acquisitions as a use of 
      cash. However, the majority of Microsoft's cash is generated outside the 
      U.S. and will require Microsoft to either repatriate foreign earnings 
      and incur incremental tax expense or use debt financing to fund its U.S. 
      cash needs, absent a change in U.S. tax law.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Fitch expects the company to continue to invest heavily in consumer 
      markets principally with its Windows Mobile, Xbox and Bing search engine 
      platforms (including related on-line initiatives), negatively affecting 
      cash flow and profitability.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Credit strengths include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Microsoft's dominant market position in its core software businesses, 
      including an estimated 90%-plus share in PC operating systems (OS) and 
      75% in servers;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --A very strong balance sheet with $45 billion in cash and short term 
      investments partially offset by $10.7 billion in debt with approximately 
      $1 billion in pretax income from interest and dividends alone;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Diversification of end market demand across consumers and enterprises 
      in addition to strong geographic diversification with no single customer 
      having accounted for 10% of revenue in several years;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Industry leading liquidity, supported by a considerable cash position 
      and consistent strong free cash flow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Credit concerns include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Reliance on Windows and Office products for the vast majority of cash 
      flow generation (approximately 90% based on Fitch estimates) and the 
      potential high correlation between these two business segments if 
      Microsoft were to lose meaningful market share to alternative operating 
      systems;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Growing popularity of other operating systems outside of the core PC 
      space, principally Apple's iOS as well as Google's Android platforms, as 
      Fitch believes both could emerge as significant competitive threats to 
      traditional PC demand (and Microsoft's Windows business) over the next 
      12-24 months;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Minimal historical success in developing profitable businesses outside 
      of Microsoft's core Windows and Office ecosystems despite significant 
      investments over the past decade in other consumer markets which Fitch 
      believes is largely indicative of the challenging competitive 
      environment in markets Microsoft has targeted such as consumer 
      electronics although much of Microsoft's effort in other consumer 
      markets can be viewed as defensive of its core Windows business, 
      particularly its Windows Mobile platform;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Significant dividend and share repurchase programs that will likely 
      force the company to continue to issue increasing amounts of debt to 
      avoid repatriation of foreign earnings as Fitch estimates that a 
      significant majority of Microsoft's existing cash and investment balance 
      plus future cash flow generation is outside of the U.S. and would be 
      subject to incremental tax expense.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total liquidity as of Sept. 30, 2010 was solid and consisted principally 
      of $8.2 billion in cash and equivalents and $1 billion in commercial 
      paper currently outstanding under a $3 billion program. In addition, 
      Microsoft has $36 billion in short-term investments. Microsoft's 'F1+' 
      short-term IDR and commercial paper rating reflect Microsoft's very 
      strong liquidity profile in absence of 100% backstop of the commercial 
      paper facility. Microsoft had a 364-day $1 billion unsecured revolving 
      credit facility which expired in November 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes that the majority of the company's cash and investment 
      balance is located overseas and would be subject to incremental taxes if 
      the company needed to access these funds. Free cash flow of $19.5 
      billion in the latest 12 month period ending September 2010 further 
      supports liquidity, although the majority of cash flow is generated 
      outside the U.S.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total debt as of Sept. 30, 2010 was $10.7 billion and consisted 
      principally of: i) $1.25 billion in 0% convertible notes due June 2013; 
      ii) $1 billion in 0.875% notes due September 2013; iii) $2 billion in 
      2.95% notes due June 2014 but callable in January 2012; iv) $1.75 
      billion in 1.625% notes due September 2015; v) $1 billion in 4.2% notes 
      due June 2019; vi) $1 billion in 3% notes due October 2020; vii) $750 
      million in 5.2% notes due June 2039; viii) $1 billion in 4.5% notes due 
      October 2040; and ix) $1 billion outstanding under the company's 
      commercial paper program.

&lt;p&gt;  MANCHESTER, UNITED KINGDOM, Dec 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Coca-Cola has teamed up with the THINK! Don't Drink and Drive campaign,
operated by the Department for Transport (DfT), to provide free Coca-Cola
to designated drivers in thousands of pubs across the country during the
holidays.

    THINK! Has joined forces with the Coca-Cola Designated Driver campaign to
offer drivers free soft drinks in more than 8,000 participating venues
across Britain as part of the Driver Friendly campaign, in addition to
running radio advertising, posters in pub washrooms and online search
activity.

    Jon Woods, the Country Manager of Coca-Cola Great Britain and Ireland
said "With Christmas just around the corner, our customers are gearing up
to celebrate. We know how much they enjoy the festive period and we don't
want to dampen their spirits. By rewarding those drivers who choose not
to drink, with a free Coke or diet Coke, we can encourage people to do
the right thing while still enjoying a great night out. It's a different
approach to responsible drinking but our consumers love it." Designated
drivers should ask at the bar about how to take advantage of the buy one
soft drink get one free offer at participating pubs.

    Mike Penning, the Road Safety Minister, said "Drivers should be in no
doubt that if they get behind the wheel after drinking they risk losing
their licence as well as facing a fine and even a prison sentence. The
Holidays should be a time for celebration not a night in the cells."

    Last year 380 people were killed in road accidents where the driver was
over the limit. This year the police will be using information from the
public to target areas where drink driving is a particular problem, and
so the chances of getting caught are greater than ever. Many drivers
don't realise that alcohol stays in the system for several hours, and
that they may still be over the legal limit the following morning when
driving to work or taking the children to school.

    A spokesman for Staveley Head, one of the country's leading minicab
insurance providers, said "We support any initiative which reduces the
number of injuries and fatalities caused by drink driving, and Coca-Cola
are to be congratulated on their novel approach to this issue. We would
also recommend an older and far more established procedure - take a
taxi."

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details
regarding this unique opportunity please visit: www.microcapsdaily.com

    On Wednesday 12/8/10 dPollution International Inc. (PINK SHEETS - RMGX)
announced that it has received a request for the supply of 3,000 units of
its patented dPollution Device. The units are to be delivered to Stem
Italia S.R.L. of Rome, Italy and distributed to the members of A.N.C.
Associazione Nazionale di Categoria Trasporto Persone e Mobilita, the
association of tourist bus drivers in the Province of Lazio, Italy.
A.N.C. will be acquiring the units to install on its members fleets of
diesel buses to ensure their compliance with the Province of Lazio's new
Low Emission Zone (LEZ) standards, which will be enforced starting in
2011. 

    In the U.S. market alone, there are 250 million registered passenger
vehicles and dPollution (RMGX) owns the exclusive manufacturing and
distribution rights to a patented fuel conditioning technology which
significantly increases mileage and lowers harmful GHG emissions.
dPollution's revolutionary device improves engine performance by causing
fuel to combust more thoroughly and efficiently. This technology works on
every internal combustion engine in the world. Considering that IC
engines are used in cars, buses, trucks, diesel trains, construction
equipment, farm equipment and a variety of military vehicles the market
for this device is virtually limitless. For more information, please

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/CARACAS (Reuters) - The United States revoked the visa of Venezuela's ambassador to Washington in retaliation for President Hugo Chavez's rejection of a nominated U.S. envoy critical of his government, the U.S. State Department said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The move stokes long-simmering tensions between Washington and the socialist Chavez, who is a fierce U.S. critic, but is unlikely to affect an oil trade crucial to both nations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez had blocked Larry Palmer's arrival after the American diplomat accused Venezuela's government of close ties to leftist Colombian rebels. He also alleged declining morale and professionalism in Venezuela's armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caracas's insistence on refusing to let Palmer take up his post prompted Washington to effectively expel Venezuela's envoy, Bernardo Alvarez Herrera, by withdrawing his visa, diplomatic sources and the U.S. State Department said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's politicking as usual between these two but I don't think we're about to see a crude crisis. They both need to keep exports flowing," said a non-U.S. diplomat in Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The South American OPEC member, which is in a second year of recession, sells about 1.2 million barrels per day of oil and products to the United States. That makes Venezuela the fifth biggest U.S. supplier after Canada, Saudi Arabia, Mexico and Nigeria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although seeking to diversify its export portfolio to sell more to political allies like China, Venezuela cannot now afford to drastically reduce sales to the United States. Threats by Chavez in the past to do so have not materialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spat is, however, sure to add to Chavez's anger over recent U.S. criticism of his assumption of decree powers for 18 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Caracas had brought the visa measure upon itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We said there would be consequences when the Venezuelan government rescinded agreement regarding our nominee, Larry Palmer. We have taken appropriate, proportional and reciprocal action," Toner told reporters in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHAVEZ: "RESPECT US"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was no immediate reaction from Chavez but U.S.-Venezuelan lawyer Eva Golinger, who is a close ally of his, condemned the move as unjustified.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"USA revokes the visa of the Venezuelan ambassador in Washington in revenge for the decision on Larry Palmer," she was quoted by Venezuelan state media as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such cynicism and hypocrisy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alvarez was believed to be out of the country on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a speech Tuesday, the fiery Chavez, who has taken on Fidel Castro's mantle as the leading critic of the United States in Latin America, reiterated his opposition to Palmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have denied permission to this aspiring ambassador and now the U.S. government threatens us with reprisals," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They will do what they want but that man is not coming here as ambassador. Anyone who comes here as an ambassador has to show respect. This is a country that must be respected."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There had been hopes of a rapprochement when Chavez cut tirades against the "empire" and shook hands with Obama at a summit soon after the U.S. leader took office in January 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But within months of that, Chavez said Obama was proving to be a disappointment and continuing the unacceptable foreign polices of his predecessor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez has had a fiery time with U.S. envoys. In 2008, he expelled U.S. Ambassador Patrick Duddy from Caracas in a dispute over what he said was Washington's involvement in violent protests in Bolivia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among his comments to a U.S. senator, Palmer also had expressed concern about Cuba's influence within the Venezuelan military. Chavez is a close ally of Cuba and thousands of Cubans work in Venezuela as doctors, nurses, teachers, technicians and advisers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bill Trott)&lt;/p&gt;

      Akorn, Inc. (NASDAQ: AKRX), a niche generic pharmaceutical company, 
      today reported that its Akorn-Strides LLC joint venture has entered into 
      a purchase agreement with Pfizer Inc. to sell 16 Abbreviated New Drug 
      Approvals (ANDAs) and 6 filed ANDAs. For its portion, Akorn, Inc. will 
      receive $35 million in cash. Akorn-Strides LLC will continue to 
      manufacture and distribute the approved products until April 30, 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the three quarters ended September 30, 2010, Akorn recognized $1.9 
      million in revenue and approximately $2.0 million in adjusted EBITDA as 
      a result of its participation in the Akorn-Strides LLC joint venture.

      Raj Rai, Chief Executive Officer, commented, &#8220;This is a positive outcome 
      for Akorn as the proceeds from the sale provide us with immediate access 
      to capital to accelerate our infrastructure improvements, pursue 
      acquisitions and in-licensing of niche pharmaceuticals, as well as 
      strengthen our balance sheet. We would like to thank our joint venture 
      partner, Strides, for helping build value in our joint venture which has 
      resulted in a mutually beneficial strategic outcome.&#8221;

      This press release includes statements that may constitute

      expenses, and other statements regarding Akorn's goals, regulatory

      statements. These statements are made pursuant to the safe harbor 
      provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
      Because such statements inherently involve risks and uncertainties, 
      actual future results may differ materially from those expressed or 
      implied by such forward-looking statements. You can identify these 
      statements by the fact that they do not relate strictly to historical or 
      current facts. They use words such as "anticipate," "estimate," 
      "expect," "project," "intend," "plan," "believe," and other words and 
      terms of similar meaning in connection with a discussion of future 
      operating or financial performance. Factors that could cause or 
      contribute to such differences include, but are not limited to: 
      statements relating to future steps we may take, prospective products, 
      future performance or results of current and anticipated products, sales 
      efforts, expenses, the outcome of contingencies such as legal 
      proceedings, and financial results. These cautionary statements should 
      be considered in connection with any subsequent written or oral 
      forward-looking statements that may be made by the company or by persons 
      acting on its behalf and in conjunction with its periodic SEC filings. 
      You are advised, however, to consult any further disclosures we make on 
      related subjects in our reports filed with the SEC. In particular, you 
      should read the discussion in the section entitled "Cautionary Statement 
      Regarding Forward-Looking Statements" in our most recent Annual Report 
      on Form 10-K, as it may be updated in subsequent reports filed with the 
      SEC. That discussion covers certain risks, uncertainties and possibly 
      inaccurate assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ 
      materially from expected and historical results. Other factors besides 
      those listed there could also adversely affect our results.

      Fitch Upgrades S Lake Tahoe Recreation Facils JPA (CA), Special Tax 
      Bonds to 'AA-'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings upgrades the following South Lake Tahoe Recreation 
      Facilities Joint Powers Authority Community Facilities District No. 
      2000-1, CA (the district) debt as part of its continuous surveillance 
      effort:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$4.5 million of property assessment-parcel tax bonds upgraded to 'AA-' 
      from 'A+'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      RATING RATIONALE:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The upgrade reflects the strong debt service coverage provided by 
      pledged parcel tax revenues and the exceptional stability of the parcel 
      tax revenues despite the deep downturn in the U.S. housing market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The joint powers authority has built up significant reserve funds in 
      excess of its expenditure needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The amount of debt outstanding is very low relative to the value of 
      property in the district, and the authority has pledged not to issue 
      more debt supported by the special tax levy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The local economy is dominated by tourism, particularly large ski 
      resorts, but the tourism industry has strong underpinnings due to the 
      region's natural beauty and relative proximity to several large 
      metropolitan areas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --The rating is limited by the concentration in the local economy, the 
      authority's plans to spend down some of its significant reserves, and 
      the likely lack of further growth in the tax base.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KEY RATING DRIVERS:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Continued stability in tax levy supporting bond issue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Maintenance of healthy reserve fund levels.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      SECURITY:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The bonds are secured by a first lien on a voter-approved special parcel 
      tax on all property in the district revenues net of administrative fees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CREDIT SUMMARY:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upgrade reflects South Lake Tahoe's well-developed tourism economy 
      and stable financial performance over the past decade. The South Lake 
      Tahoe Joint Powers Authority (JPA) was formed in 2000 by the city of 
      South Lake Tahoe, CA, El Dorado County and the Tahoe Paradise Resort 
      Improvement District to finance construction of an ice rink, athletic 
      fields and other recreational facilities that serve both the community 
      and its key tourism industry. The JPA is located about 200 miles 
      northeast of San Francisco on the south shore of Lake Tahoe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The region's economy and tax base are dominated by the tourism industry, 
      which has strong underpinnings. The Lake Tahoe Basin is a popular 
      tourist destination, particularly for skiing and gaming, located in 
      adjacent Nevada. The region is a popular second-home choice for wealthy 
      residents of Sacramento and the San Francisco Bay Area. El Dorado 
      County's unemployment rate was above the national average but below 
      state levels at 11.7% in October 2010. South Lake Tahoe's housing market 
      has been hurt by the national downturn, but much less than the 
      hardest-hit areas of California. Development is strictly regulated in 
      the Lake Tahoe Basin to protect the lake's clarity, and the region 
      escaped the recent housing construction boom and bust as a result. 
      Foreclosures and mortgage delinquencies have risen, but remain below 
      state and national averages. Assessed values continued to rise through 
      fiscal 2010 before falling 7.3% in fiscal 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Declines in assessed values suggest stress in the housing market but 
      have no bearing on the special tax levy supporting the bonds. The 
      special tax is a fixed parcel tax, and collections have grown slowly and 
      steadily over the past decade. The average annual increase was 0.6%, and 
      the largest decrease was just 0.8%. Fitch views the stability of tax 
      collections as a significant credit strength.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The parcel tax is very small on a per capita basis at about $16 a year. 
      The tax is based on the type of property assessed, with single-family 
      homes assessed $18 a year and large ski resorts assessed $4,500 a year. 
      The district has a very high value-to-lien ratio of more than 
      1,300-to-1. Most of the top 10 taxpayers are time-share resorts and 
      together represent 10.8% of tax collections. The district participates 
      in El Dorado County's Teeter plan, which insulates it from 
      delinquencies, which have risen in recent years. Under a Teeter plan, 
      the county pays the district its full tax levy each year and keeps 
      penalties and interest when they are collected. While the county could 
      eliminate its Teeter plan, Fitch views that as unlikely, and 
      delinquencies at the current rate would not materially impact debt 
      service coverage.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Special tax revenues were $632,000 in fiscal 2010, a 1.4% increase from 
      2009. Revenues, net of the county's 1% tax collection fee, were about 
      1.7 times (x) annual debt service. Coverage increased in recent years 
      due to the gradual rise in revenues and declining debt service payments 
      and is expected to remain in the current range or slightly higher for 
      the life of the bonds. Coverage holds up well under a variety of stress 
      tests. Even with the loss of the district's Teeter protection, the loss 
      of the district's largest taxpayer, the loss of 10% of its residential 
      housing units and an ongoing 10% delinquency rate, the district would 
      maintain coverage of 1.4x or better. The district has built up 
      substantial reserves that continue to grow.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The district faces little-to-no operational risk. It has no full-time 
      employees. It contributes some of its excess funds after payment of debt 
      service to maintenance of the bond-financed recreational facilities, but 
      the facilities are maintained and operated by the JPA's member agencies, 
      not the JPA itself. It has built up a substantial financial cushion with 
      an available fund balance that equals more than one year's debt service 
      budgeted for the end of the current fiscal year. While district 
      officials anticipate seeking voter approval to spend some of the fund 
      balance on other South Lake Tahoe-area recreational facilities, voters 
      have thus far refused to expand the authority's writ, and Fitch 
      anticipates that the authority would maintain an adequate, albeit 
      possibly smaller, financial cushion in any case.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp co-founder Paul Allen relaunched a wide-ranging patent lawsuit against Apple Inc, Google Inc, Facebook and others with specific allegations that the companies are illegally using technology owned by his company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interval Licensing LLC, a small research company set up by Allen in 1992, originally filed a broad patent suit in federal court in Seattle in August, but Judge Marsha Pechman dismissed it on the grounds that it did not specify any actual products or devices. The revised suit was filed by Interval on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975, claims Interval was central to research and development of technology in the Internet arena in the 1990s, amassing more than 300 patents and providing research assistance to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the suit, Allen's company claims four of its patents -- chiefly related to the way Web data is sorted and presented -- have been infringed by a number of successful companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MULTIPLE CLAIMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first patent concerns the generation of data related to information being browsed. Interval claims Google uses this technology to match advertisements from third parties to content being displayed, while AOL's sites use it to suggest items related to news stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval claims Apple's iTunes service uses the technology to suggest music based on a user's searches, and that eBay Inc, Facebook, Netflix, Yahoo Inc and Office Depot's sites have also infringed the patent in the way they direct users to related content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second and third patents concern relaying information on a computer screen in a peripheral, unobtrusive manner, such as in an instant messaging box or overlay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval claims its patent has been infringed by features in AOL's Instant Messenger, Apple's Dashboard, Google Talk and Gmail Notifier, Google's Android phone system and Yahoo Widgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fourth patent concerns alerting Web browsers to new items of interest based on activity of other users. Interval claims AOL uses this technology on its shopping sites, while Apple's iTunes uses it to recommend music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval claims eBay, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Office Depot, Staples Inc, Yahoo and Google's YouTube all have infringed the patent in the way they suggest content to users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO MICROSOFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The suit makes no mention of Microsoft as a patent holder or infringer, even though Allen's former company offers products similar to some described in the suit. A spokesman for Allen declined to comment on the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Allen, 57, is the world's 37th richest person, according to Forbes magazine. He resigned as a Microsoft executive in 1983. Since then, he has funded scientific and medical research through his Paul G. Allen Family Foundation and invested in many projects in his native Seattle and Pacific Northwest region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interval has asked the court for damages and a ban on products that use the disputed patents. It is unclear how seriously the court, or the companies he has targeted, will take Allen's legal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe this suit is completely without merit and we will fight it vigorously," a Facebook spokesman said in an e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EBay declined to comment. AOL, Apple, Google, Netflix, Office Depot, Staples and Yahoo did not immediately respond to requests for a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is C10-1385 MJP in the U.S. District Court Western District of Washington at Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Derek Caney, Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

information being browsed. Interval claims Google uses this
technology to match advertisements from third parties to
content being displayed, while AOL's (AOL.N) sites use it to
suggest items related to news stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interval claims Apple's iTunes service uses the technology
to suggest music based on a user's searches, and that eBay Inc
(EBAY.O), Facebook, Netflix (NFLX.O), Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and
Office Depot's ODP.N sites have also infringed the patent in
the way they direct users to related content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second and third patents concern relaying information
on a computer screen in a peripheral, unobtrusive manner, such
as in an instant messaging box or overlay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interval claims its patent has been infringed by features
in AOL's Instant Messenger, Apple's Dashboard, Google Talk and
Gmail Notifier, Google's Android phone system and Yahoo
Widgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fourth patent concerns alerting Web browsers to new
items of interest based on activity of other users. Interval
claims AOL uses this technology on its shopping sites, while
Apple's iTunes uses it to recommend music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interval claims eBay, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Office
Depot, Staples Inc (SPLS.O), Yahoo and Google's YouTube all
have infringed the patent in the way they suggest content to
users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NO MICROSOFT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The suit makes no mention of Microsoft as a patent holder
or infringer, even though Allen's former company offers
products similar to some described in the suit. A spokesman for
Allen declined to comment on the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allen, 57, is the world's 37th richest person, according to
Forbes magazine. He resigned as a Microsoft executive in 1983.
Since then, he has funded scientific and medical research
through his Paul G. Allen Family Foundation and invested in
many projects in his native Seattle and Pacific Northwest
region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interval has asked the court for damages and a ban on
products that use the disputed patents. It is unclear how
seriously the court, or the companies he has targeted, will
take Allen's legal charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe this suit is completely without merit and we
will fight it vigorously," a Facebook spokesman said in an
e-mail.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EBay declined to comment. AOL, Apple, Google, Netflix,
Office Depot, Staples and Yahoo did not immediately respond to
requests for a comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is C10-1385 MJP in the U.S District Court Western
District of Washington at Seattle.

			MainStay 
      Global High Income A, T. Rowe Price Emerging Markets Bond, Federated

      Today Zacks.com features the Top 5 International Funds: MainStay 
      Global High Income A (MUTF: MGHAX),

      Federated International High Income A&#160;(MUTF: IHIAX),

      These International funds are given our highest rating; Zacks #1 Ranked 
      Strong Buys. That means we expect these funds to outperform their peers

			Top 5 International Bond Funds
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investing in international bond funds is one of the best ways to balance 
      losses incurred from US markets, since interest rate fluctuations differ 
      from country to country. This is because they show little correlation 
      with domestic equities and only moderate correlation with investment 
      grade domestic debt. They also help in diversifying currency exposure 
      and protecting assets against a long-term secular decline in the U.S. 
      dollar. With their widely diversified holdings, mutual funds offer a 
      secure route to investing in the international bond market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Below we will share with you 5 top rated international bond funds. Each 
      has earned a Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) as we expect the fund to 
      outperform its peers in the future.

		&lt;p&gt;
			Here are highlights from Tuesday&#8217;s Analyst Blog:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Vivo Upgraded on Strong Prospects
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We are upgrading our recommendation on&#160;Vivo Participacoes&#160;(NYSE: 
      VIV), the largest 
      wireless operator in Brazil, to Outperform from Neutral. Currently, the 
      stock has the Zacks #2 (Buy) Rank.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vivo has a strong brand name in Brazil and the growth trend for the 
      wireless business in that country remains positive in our view with the 
      expansion of 3G coverage. The company&#8217;s differentiated services along 
      with its investment in spectrum licenses will provide an upside to the 
      company&#8217;s revenue and earnings going forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe the company is benefiting from its new operations in 
      northeastern Brazil and expanded coverage for its 3G WCDMA network, the 
      largest in that country. The expansion of 3G network provides 
      significant advantage over its peers and will enhance additional 
      wireless data revenue growth in future. Vivo invested heavily on 
      spectrum acquisitions (including the 1.9 GHz frequency bands) to 
      reinforce its 3G network.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Third quarter earnings largely outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 
      25 cents on account of strong revenue driven by an expansion in the 3G 
      mobile customer base. Net income shot up 80.9% and revenue climbed 10.4% 
      year over year. However, average revenue per user dropped 7.4% year over 
      year due to dilution caused mainly by the presence of multiple SIM cards 
      in the market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vivo, now fully controlled by Spanish telecom giant&#160;Telefonica&#160;(NYSE: 
      TEF), continues to 
      lead the domestic market in terms of new subscriber additions. The 
      company gained 1.7 million subscribers in the third quarter, to reach 
      57.71 million (up 18.2% year over year) customers in total. Vivo 
      maintained its leadership in terms of net addition with roughly 27.4% 
      market share, beating its biggest rival&#160;America Movil&#8217;s 
      (NYSE: AMX) Claro.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vivo&#8217;s growth trends are expected to remain positive in the foreseeable 
      future given the rapid economic recovery in Brazil. Differentiated 
      services, a premium portfolio of handsets and service plans as well as 
      its bellwether position are contributing to the company&#8217;s growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further, Vivo is leveraging healthy cash flow from its cost cutting 
      measures (through corporate restructuring) to reduce its debt exposure 
      and fund dividend payments. Net debt of R$2.41 billion ($1.38 billion) 
      at the end of the third quarter represents nearly 43.2% year-over-year 
      decline. We expect Vivo to continue generating healthy free cash flow 
      and reduce capital spending need, thereby creating opportunities for 
      sustained debt reduction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			RMBS: 
      License Renewal  Share Buyback
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Rambus Inc. (Nasdaq: RMBS), 
      announced yesterday, the renewal of its patent licensing agreement with 
      Renesas Electronics Corporation, a company formed through the merger of 
      Renesas Technology Corp. and NEC Electronics Corporation. Per the terms 
      of the agreement, Renesas Electronics can use patented innovations of 
      Rambus in its broad range of logic integrated circuit products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The same day, Rambus reported the completion of an accelerated share 
      repurchase program announced on August 19, 2010. The company repurchased 
      4.8 million shares at an average price of $18.88 totaling approximately 
      $90 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The accelerated repurchase agreement is a part of Rambus&#8217; 9.5 million 
      share repurchase program authorized by its Board of Directors 
      previously. As of December 21, 2010, the company had repurchased roughly 
      9.5 million shares at an average price of $20.48 and was left with 
      roughly 5.2 million shares under the authorization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      California-based Rambus designs, develops, and licenses chip interface 
      technologies and architectures that are used in digital electronics 
      products. The company reported an uninteresting third quarter and missed 
      the Zacks Estimates on both the top and bottom lines.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Recently, the company revised its fourth quarter revenue guidance to 
      range within $85-$93 million versus its prior forecast of $40-$50 
      million. The revision was due to an estimated $180 million royalty 
      payment from the Elpida agreement over the next five years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite the positive revision, we believe that higher operating expenses 
      will act as an impediment to growth in the quarters ahead, badly 
      impacting financial results. However, Rambus&#8217; endeavor to diversify into 
      the lighting and display technology space in an effort to grab the 
      tremendous opportunity of solid state lighting is encouraging.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe Rambus is well positioned as a key player to meet the 
      escalating demand for LED lighting technology aided by its tie-up with 
      GE Lighting, a unit of&#160;General Electric Company&#8217;s&#160;(NYSE: GE) 
      Appliances  Lighting business.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We currently have a Neutral recommendation on the stock.

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details
regarding this unique opportunity please visit: www.microcapsdaily.com.

    On Wednesday 12/8/10 dPollution International Inc. (PINK SHEETS - RMGX)
announced that it has received a request for the supply of 3,000 units of
its patented dPollution Device. The units are to be delivered to Stem
Italia S.R.L. of Rome, Italy and distributed to the members of A.N.C.
Associazione Nazionale di Categoria Trasporto Persone e Mobilita, the
association of tourist bus drivers in the Province of Lazio, Italy.
A.N.C. will be acquiring the units to install on its members fleets of
diesel buses to ensure their compliance with the Province of Lazio's new
Low Emission Zone (LEZ) standards, which will be enforced starting in
2011. 

    In the U.S. market alone, there are 250 million registered passenger
vehicles and dPollution (RMGX) owns the exclusive manufacturing and
distribution rights to a patented fuel conditioning technology which
significantly increases mileage and lowers harmful GHG emissions.
dPollution's revolutionary device improves engine performance by causing
fuel to combust more thoroughly and efficiently. This technology works on
every internal combustion engine in the world. Considering that IC
engines are used in cars, buses, trucks, diesel trains, construction
equipment, farm equipment and a variety of military vehicles the market
for this device is virtually limitless. For more information, please

&lt;p&gt; * UAE sets visa fees of $250 to $1,000 for Canadians&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Move follows row over air rights for UAE airlines&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DUBAI, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Canadian nationals will have to
pay as much as $1,000 in visa fees to travel to the United Arab
Emirates from next month, the latest development in a diplomatic
row over landing rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tensions have risen between the two countries since Canada
denied expanded landing rights for UAE airlines flying to
Canada. That triggered a UAE government decision to end access
to a military base used by the Canadian military to support
troops in Afghanistan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UAE embassy in Ottawa said on its website that Canadians
would be charged $250 for a 30-day single entry visa while a
six-month multiple entry visa would cost $1000, with a maximum
stay of 14 days during each visit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Canada was among more than 30 mostly Western countries whose
citizens benefited from a UAE visa waiver, but a UAE official
said in November that Canadians must obtain a visa in advance to
travel from Jan. 2 to the Gulf state, which includes regional
tourism hub Dubai and major oil exporter Abu Dhabi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dubai carrier Emirates [EMIRA.UL] has been lobbying the
Canadian government to boost its thrice-weekly direct flights to
Toronto and more Canadian destinations, with support from the
UAE government, but failed to gain greater access. Abu Dhabi's
Etihad Airways also wants to increase its flights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With 25,000 Canadians living in the UAE...as well as 200
Canadian companies active in the UAE today, six flights per week
does not service the economic needs of both countries or the
potential for growth," the UAE ambassador said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UAE's efforts to gain more landing rights in Canada has been
criticised by Air Canada (ACa.TO) (ACb.TO), which has accused
Emirates of wanting to steal away connecting passengers that
help make its routes profitable. [ID:nN09208309]

&lt;p&gt; * Claims Apple, Facebook, Google using patents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Seeks damages, ban on infringing features&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Suit originally filed in August&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, Dec 29 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
co-founder Paul Allen relaunched a wide-ranging patent lawsuit
against Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Google Inc (GOOG.O), Facebook and
others with specific allegations that the companies are
illegally using technology owned by his firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interval Licensing LLC, a small research company set up by
Allen in 1992, originally filed a broad patent suit in federal
court in Seattle in August, but Judge Marsha Pechman dismissed
it on the grounds that it did not specify any actual products
or devices. The revised suit was filed by Interval on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allen, who co-founded Microsoft with Bill Gates in 1975,
claims Interval was central to research and development of
technology in the Internet arena in the 1990s, amassing more
than 300 patents and providing research assistance to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the suit, Allen's firm claims four of its patents --
chiefly related to the way Web data is sorted and presented --
have been infringed by a number of successful companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The first patent concerns the generation of data related to
information being browsed. Interval claims Google uses this
technology to match advertisements from third parties to
content being displayed, while AOL's (AOL.N) sites use it to
suggest items related to news stories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interval claims Apple's iTunes service uses the technology
to suggest music based on a user's searches, and that eBay Inc
(EBAY.O), Facebook, Netflix (NFLX.O), Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and
Office Depot's sites ODP.N have also infringed the patent in
the way they direct users to related content.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The second and third patents concern relaying information
on a computer screen in a peripheral, unobtrusive manner, such
as in an instant messaging box or overlay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interval claims its patent has been infringed by features
in AOL's Instant Messenger, Apple's Dashboard, Google Talk and
Gmail Notifier, Google's Android phone system and Yahoo
Widgets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fourth patent concerns alerting web browsers to new
items of interest based on activity of other users. Interval
claims AOL uses this technology on its shopping sites, while
Apple's iTunes uses it to recommend music.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interval claims eBay, Facebook, Google, Netflix, Office
Depot, Staples Inc (SPLS.O), Yahoo and Google's YouTube all
have infringed the patent in the way they suggest content to
users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interval has asked the court for damages and a ban on
products that use the disputed patents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is C10-1385 MJP in the U.S District Court Western
District of Washington at Seattle.

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela condemned on Thursday the United States' revocation of its ambassador's visa as an "imperial" move by President Barack Obama's government, saying the measure should be immediately overturned.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the latest flare-up between the ideological foes, Washington withdrew the visa of ambassador Bernardo Alvarez on Wednesday in retaliation for the rejection by socialist President Hugo Chavez of Obama's nominated envoy to Caracas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Diplomat Larry Palmer had criticized Venezuela's government, saying morale in its military was low, and that there were clear ties between members of the Chavez administration and leftist rebels in neighboring Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a new aggression by the State Department," Roy Daza, a prominent ruling party member who heads parliament's foreign affairs committee, told Reuters. "The only possible solution is for the United States to rectify its position."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tit-for-tat appeared to bury any lingering prospects of rapprochement between the Obama administration and Chavez, who has inherited Fidel Castro's mantle as Latin America's leading critic of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the diplomatic spat, few expect either Venezuela or the United States to risk jeopardizing trade ties -- principally oil -- crucial to both nation's economies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The OPEC member is one of the top five oil suppliers to the United States, exporting 930,000 barrels per day of crude and products in October, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. (r.reuters.com/pef34r)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chavez had blocked Palmer's arrival because of the diplomat's comments in a letter to a U.S. senator during his confirmation process. In addition to Palmer's views on military morale and Colombian rebel links, he had also alleged growing Cuban influence in Venezuela's armed forces.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr. Palmer insulted, slandered and lied shamelessly in his speech to the Senate. For this reason, he disqualified himself as the United States' diplomatic representative to Venezuela," Daza said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IMPERIAL MENTALITY"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Obama took office in January 2009, promising more engagement with foes, there had been expectations of a possible rapprochement. Chavez toned down his tirades against the "empire" and shook hands with the new U.S. leader at a summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But within months, Chavez said Obama was disillusioning the world by following his predecessor George W. Bush's foreign policies, and the rhetoric from Caracas cranked up again.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His government said Washington's insistence on naming Palmer showed its "policy of aggression" against the Venezuelan people, and Chavez said the diplomatic cables released by Wikileaks had proved that all U.S. ambassadors were "spies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Daza said the visa revocation showed there had not been any real change in the U.S. line toward the rest of the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It shows that the change in U.S. president did not represent a change of the imperial mentality," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Foreign Ministry also issued a protest note condemning the "history of interventionism and aggression against Venezuela's people, institutions and democracy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts did not expect the spat to affect trade ties including Venezuelan oil exports to the United States. Although it is seeking to diversify its export portfolio toward political allies like China, Venezuela is in a second year of recession and cannot afford to drastically cut U.S. sales. Past threats by Chavez to do so have not materialized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;State Department spokesman Mark Toner said Caracas had brought the visa measure upon itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We said there would be consequences when the Venezuelan government rescinded agreement regarding our nominee, Larry Palmer. We have taken appropriate, proportional and reciprocal action," Toner told reporters in an e-mail late on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A member of Venezuela's political opposition said Chavez and Washington were both playing a dangerous game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This has been a badly-handled relationship by both government, and that worries us in the opposition because the United States is Venezuela's main trade partner," Ramon Jose Medina, foreign affairs spokesman for the Democratic Unity opposition coalition, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The United States is an important nation with which we should have stable and cordial relations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Patricia Rondon; Editing by Frances Kerry and Jackie Frank)&lt;/p&gt;

      million in first-lien term loan, a $40 million first-lien revolving line 
      of credit and a $225 million second-lien facility. Bloomberg reported 
      that the details were given out in a regulatory filing. The debt 
      commitment is expected to cease if the initial funding of the facilities 
      does not occur by April 20, according to the filing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novell agreed to be bought by Attachmate for $2.2 billion, the company 
      said in a November 22 statement. Novell investors will get $6.10 a 
      share. Attachmate also plans to use $425 million in equity financing to 
      help pay for the acquisition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2011. Attachmate 
      Corporation will acquire Novell for $6.10 per share in cash in a 
      transaction valued at approximately $2.2 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The purchase price represents a premium of 28.0% to Novell's closing 
      share price on March 2, 2010 (when Elliott Associates offered to buy 
      Novell in a deal valued at about $1 billion) and a 9% premium to its 
      closing stock price on November 19, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novell was approached by various other entities this year for a 
      takeover. In March, Novell rejected a buyout offer from the investment 
      firm Elliott Associates L.P., citing the proposal of $5.75 per share 
      (49.0% over the company&#8217;s enterprise value)&#160;in cash as inadequate and 
      undervaluing the company's franchise and growth prospects. Elliott 
      Associates will become a shareholder of Attachmate under the latest 
      offer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe Novell&#8217;s Linux assets deserve premium valuation as it has a 
      valued customer base and generates significant revenue. Novell remains 
      the #2 maker of the open source Linux operating system behind&#160;Red 
      Hat&#160;(NYSE: RHT).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novell had also announced that it has entered into a definitive 
      agreement for the concurrent sale of certain intellectual property 
      assets (more than 800 patents) to CPTN Holdings LLC, a consortium of 
      technology companies organized by&#160;Microsoft Corporation&#160;(Nasdaq: 
      MSFT) for $450 
      million in cash. This is reflected in Attachmate&#8217;s total purchase price.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Attachmate will operate Novell as two separate business units, namely 
      Novell and SUSE (its open source business) and will integrate them with 
      its other holdings, Attachmate and NetIQ. Novell had acquired the 
      Germany-based SUSE AG in 2003. We believe the SUSE-Linux acquisition 
      will boost Attachmate&#8217;s competitive position going forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novell will be required to pay $60 million to Attachmate if it accepts a 
      superior bid. If the deal fails to materialize for some other reason, 
      Attachmate might have to pay Novell $120 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Attachmate&#8217;s acquisition of Novell is subject to customary closing 
      conditions, including regulatory approvals and clearance under the 
      Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. It is also dependent on the closing of the 
      proposed sale of certain intellectual property assets to CPTN Holdings 
      LLC. In addition, the transaction is subject to approval by Novell's 
      stockholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			J.P. Morgan&#160;(NYSE: JPM) 
      is serving as financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom 
      LLP is acting as legal advisor to Novell. Credit Suisse and RBC Capital 
      Markets are serving as financial advisors and Jones Day is acting as 
      legal advisor to Attachmate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Take
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novell believes that the deal would add value to customers and would 
      complement its existing product portfolio. In our opinion, the potential 
      acquisition will boost Attachmate&#8217;s customer base and enhance its cloud 
      computing abilities, thereby driving top-line growth over the long term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite having a diversified portfolio and strong customer base, Novell 
      remained undervalued particularly due to weak top-line growth in recent 
      times. The company had $1.04 billion in cash and short-term investments 
      at the end of the recently concluded third quarter. Revenues decreased 
      8.0% to $199.0 million from $216.1 million in the year-ago quarter due 
      to weak license, maintenance and subscription services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Considering the struggle to sustain growth, we believe the $1.2 billion 
      valuation (net of cash), or 1.5 times sales is good. We expect the deal 
      to be completed once it passes all regulatory hurdles. Currently, we 
      maintain a Neutral rating on Novell on a long-term basis (6&#8211;12 months).
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Earnings Scorecard: Carnival Cruises
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Carnival Corporation&#160;(NYSE: CCL), 
      the world&#8217;s largest cruise company, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
      by a penny due to voyage disruption as a fire broke out in the engine 
      room of the Carnival Splendor off the coast of Mexico. The recent 
      earnings announcement, subsequent analyst estimate revisions and the 
      Zacks ratings for both the short-term and long-term outlook for the 
      stock are covered in depth below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Earnings Report Review
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the fourth quarter of 2010, Carnival reported earnings of 31 
      cents, ahead of the year-ago quarter of 24 cents. Earnings for the 
      quarter also exceeded management's guidance of 25 to 29 cents per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The improvement in results was aided by better-than-expected net revenue 
      yields and ongoing cost reduction initiatives, which more than offset 
      the hike in fuel prices. The results fared better despite the recently 
      announced voyage disruptions, which reduced earnings by 7 cents per 
      share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenue spiked 6.6% year over year to $3.5 billion, ahead of the 
      Zacks Consensus Estimate $3.36 billion. On a constant currency basis, 
      net revenue yields rose 3.9% from the prior-year quarter versus 
      management&#8217;s guidance of up 2.5% to 3.5%. Gross revenue yields increased 
      1.5% in current dollars.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net cruise costs, including fuel and voyage disruptions, fell 1.1% from 
      the year-ago level on a constant dollar basis. Fuel price of $488 per 
      metric ton was up 6.0% year over year, a slight increase from 
      management&#8217;s guidance of $479 per metric ton.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Earnings Estimate Revisions &#8211; Overview
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the release of Carnival&#8217;s fourth quarter results, estimate 
      revision trends among the analysts depict a positive outlook for the 
      upcoming quarters. Let&#8217;s dig into the earnings estimate details.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Recommendation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe Carnival will experience a strong booking and pricing trend, 
      going forward. Its successful cost-containment efforts, strong balance 
      sheet and a commendable debt-equity ratio, along with ample cash balance 
      promise above-average long-term growth in an improving economy, marked 
      by slower industry capacity growth and reviving consumer demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, surging fuel prices, a greater exposure to European markets, 
      lower Caribbean prices in the first half of 2011 and the overall 
      economic uncertainty will likely hurt Carnival&#8217;s growth in the near 
      term. Hence, we maintain a Neutral recommendation on the shares of 
      Carnival, with a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold 
      rating.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Attachmate Raises Funds for Novell Buy
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to a Bloomberg report, Attachmate Corporation plans to raise 
      $1.09 billion in loans to fund its acquisition of&#160;Novell Inc.&#160;(Nasdaq: 
      NOVL), an enterprise 
      software developer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Attachmate is a software company providing connectivity solutions and is 
      supported by private equity firms such as Golden Gate Capital, Francisco 
      Partners and Thoma Bravo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to the report, Attachmate is on the look out for an $825 
      million in first-lien term loan, a $40 million first-lien revolving line 
      of credit and a $225 million second-lien facility. Bloomberg reported 
      that the details were given out in a regulatory filing. The debt 
      commitment is expected to cease if the initial funding of the facilities 
      does not occur by April 20, according to the filing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novell agreed to be bought by Attachmate for $2.2 billion, the company 
      said in a November 22 statement. Novell investors will get $6.10 a 
      share. Attachmate also plans to use $425 million in equity financing to 
      help pay for the acquisition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2011. Attachmate 
      Corporation will acquire Novell for $6.10 per share in cash in a 
      transaction valued at approximately $2.2 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The purchase price represents a premium of 28.0% to Novell's closing 
      share price on March 2, 2010 (when Elliott Associates offered to buy 
      Novell in a deal valued at about $1 billion) and a 9% premium to its 
      closing stock price on November 19, 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novell was approached by various other entities this year for a 
      takeover. In March, Novell rejected a buyout offer from the investment 
      firm Elliott Associates L.P., citing the proposal of $5.75 per share 
      (49.0% over the company&#8217;s enterprise value)&#160;in cash as inadequate and 
      undervaluing the company's franchise and growth prospects. Elliott 
      Associates will become a shareholder of Attachmate under the latest 
      offer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe Novell&#8217;s Linux assets deserve premium valuation as it has a 
      valued customer base and generates significant revenue. Novell remains 
      the #2 maker of the open source Linux operating system behind&#160;Red 
      Hat&#160;(NYSE: RHT).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novell had also announced that it has entered into a definitive 
      agreement for the concurrent sale of certain intellectual property 
      assets (more than 800 patents) to CPTN Holdings LLC, a consortium of 
      technology companies organized by&#160;Microsoft Corporation&#160;(Nasdaq: 
      MSFT) for $450 
      million in cash. This is reflected in Attachmate&#8217;s total purchase price.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Attachmate will operate Novell as two separate business units, namely 
      Novell and SUSE (its open source business) and will integrate them with 
      its other holdings, Attachmate and NetIQ. Novell had acquired the 
      Germany-based SUSE AG in 2003. We believe the SUSE-Linux acquisition 
      will boost Attachmate&#8217;s competitive position going forward.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novell will be required to pay $60 million to Attachmate if it accepts a 
      superior bid. If the deal fails to materialize for some other reason, 
      Attachmate might have to pay Novell $120 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Attachmate&#8217;s acquisition of Novell is subject to customary closing 
      conditions, including regulatory approvals and clearance under the 
      Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. It is also dependent on the closing of the 
      proposed sale of certain intellectual property assets to CPTN Holdings 
      LLC. In addition, the transaction is subject to approval by Novell's 
      stockholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			J.P. Morgan&#160;(NYSE: JPM) 
      is serving as financial advisor and Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher  Flom 
      LLP is acting as legal advisor to Novell. Credit Suisse and RBC Capital 
      Markets are serving as financial advisors and Jones Day is acting as 
      legal advisor to Attachmate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Take
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Novell believes that the deal would add value to customers and would 
      complement its existing product portfolio. In our opinion, the potential 
      acquisition will boost Attachmate&#8217;s customer base and enhance its cloud 
      computing abilities, thereby driving top-line growth over the long term.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Despite having a diversified portfolio and strong customer base, Novell 
      remained undervalued particularly due to weak top-line growth in recent 
      times. The company had $1.04 billion in cash and short-term investments 
      at the end of the recently concluded third quarter. Revenues decreased 
      8.0% to $199.0 million from $216.1 million in the year-ago quarter due 
      to weak license, maintenance and subscription services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Considering the struggle to sustain growth, we believe the $1.2 billion 
      valuation (net of cash), or 1.5 times sales is good. We expect the deal 
      to be completed once it passes all regulatory hurdles. Currently, we 
      maintain a Neutral rating on Novell on a long-term basis (6&#8211;12 months).
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Earnings Scorecard: Carnival Cruises
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Carnival Corporation&#160;(NYSE: CCL), 
      the world&#8217;s largest cruise company, missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate 
      by a penny due to voyage disruption as a fire broke out in the engine 
      room of the Carnival Splendor off the coast of Mexico. The recent 
      earnings announcement, subsequent analyst estimate revisions and the 
      Zacks ratings for both the short-term and long-term outlook for the 
      stock are covered in depth below.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Earnings Report Review
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the fourth quarter of 2010, Carnival reported earnings of 31 
      cents, ahead of the year-ago quarter of 24 cents. Earnings for the 
      quarter also exceeded management's guidance of 25 to 29 cents per share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The improvement in results was aided by better-than-expected net revenue 
      yields and ongoing cost reduction initiatives, which more than offset 
      the hike in fuel prices. The results fared better despite the recently 
      announced voyage disruptions, which reduced earnings by 7 cents per 
      share.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total revenue spiked 6.6% year over year to $3.5 billion, ahead of the 
      Zacks Consensus Estimate $3.36 billion. On a constant currency basis, 
      net revenue yields rose 3.9% from the prior-year quarter versus 
      management&#8217;s guidance of up 2.5% to 3.5%. Gross revenue yields increased 
      1.5% in current dollars.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Net cruise costs, including fuel and voyage disruptions, fell 1.1% from 
      the year-ago level on a constant dollar basis. Fuel price of $488 per 
      metric ton was up 6.0% year over year, a slight increase from 
      management&#8217;s guidance of $479 per metric ton.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Earnings Estimate Revisions &#8211; Overview
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Following the release of Carnival&#8217;s fourth quarter results, estimate 
      revision trends among the analysts depict a positive outlook for the 
      upcoming quarters. Let&#8217;s dig into the earnings estimate details.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Our Recommendation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We believe Carnival will experience a strong booking and pricing trend, 
      going forward. Its successful cost-containment efforts, strong balance 
      sheet and a commendable debt-equity ratio, along with ample cash balance 
      promise above-average long-term growth in an improving economy, marked 
      by slower industry capacity growth and reviving consumer demand.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, surging fuel prices, a greater exposure to European markets, 
      lower Caribbean prices in the first half of 2011 and the overall 
      economic uncertainty will likely hurt Carnival&#8217;s growth in the near 
      term. Hence, we maintain a Neutral recommendation on the shares of 
      Carnival, with a Zacks #3 Rank, which translates into a short-term Hold 
      rating.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Case of the Missing U.S. Jobs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While businesses are gaining ground and the stock market is picking up, 
      job growth in the U.S. remains stagnant. What are the reasons behind 
      this sluggish job growth?
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In keeping with the economic cycle, the recovery is definitely powering 
      job creation with a surge in demand for goods and services. However, the 
      U.S. companies are hiring employees out of the domestic periphery to 
      stay competitive. For most of the U.S. companies, international demand 
      for goods and services is growing much faster than the domestic 
      requirement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to The Economic Policy Institute, in 2010, U.S. companies have 
      created 1.4 million jobs abroad, while less than 1 million jobs were 
      created within the country. The senior international economist of the 
      institute, Robert Scott believes that the U.S. unemployment rate would 
      have reduced to 8.9% from 9.8% (the current rate of unemployment) had 
      1.4 million additional jobs been created domestically.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Coca-Cola Company&#160;(NYSE: KO),&#160;DuPont 
      Fabros Technology Inc.&#160;(NYSE: DFT),&#160;United 
      Parcel Service Inc.&#160;(NYSE: UPS) and&#160;Caterpillar Inc. (NYSE: 
      CAT) are among the 
      U.S. companies that have created significant jobs out of the country in 
      recent years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Outsourcing: The Main Culprit
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since 2000, U.S. jobs have been moving overseas. Outsourcing and 
      insourcing have eaten millions of U.S. jobs since then. As part of 
      outsourcing, high-paying jobs have been creeping out to low-wage foreign 
      countries. On the other hand, as part of insourcing, the nation has been 
      importing lower educated foreigners who don&#8217;t mind working at 
      lower-than-average U.S. wages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Of late, outsourcing jobs have become more sophisticated than before. 
      Higher-end jobs are now moving abroad as a result of promising growth in 
      emerging countries like India, China and Brazil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is definitely a comparative advantage, but at the cost of domestic 
      job improvement. Hence, though the economy is recovering, consumer 
      demand has stayed restrained. Also, as the demand for goods and services 
      in emerging and high population countries has grown radically, many of 
      the products are not coming back to the U.S. As a result, U.S. economy 
      is lacking a thrust.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Winners and Losers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The corporate executives and stockholders of U.S. companies are the 
      primary gainers of this practice, as cheap and efficient labor help 
      their companies stay competitive. The emerging countries also benefit 
      from this as their rising unemployment issues can be addressed by 
      additional U.S. jobs, to some extent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, the losers are the U.S. middle class families who are the job 
      seekers. And even if they manage jobs from the few remaining ones; they 
      are hired at effectively lower real wages.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This could be viewed as one of the major drawbacks of free trade. 
      According to Nobel prize-winning economist Paul Samuelson, "There is 
      nothing in the theory that says trade is always a win-win for every 
      group." Unfortunately, the U.S. is currently one of the affected 
      countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Theravance Evenly Poised
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We are maintaining our Neutral recommendation on&#160;Theravance Inc.&#160;(Nasdaq: 
      THRX) with a target 
      price of $27.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Theravance founded in 1996 and headquartered in South San Francisco, 
      California focuses on the discovery, development and commercialization 
      of small molecule medicines. The company develops medicines for 
      respiratory diseases, bacterial infections and gastrointestinal motility 
      dysfunction.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Theravance&#8217;s lead drug Vibativ (telavancin), is an injectable antibiotic 
      which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for 
      the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI) 
      caused by gram-positive bacteria. Vibativ is marketed and sold by 
      Astellas, while Theravance receives royalty percentages ranging from 
      high teens to upper twenties, depending on sales volume.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In October this year, Theravance reported its third quarter 2010 
      results. The loss per share of 29 cents was wider than the Zacks 
      Consensus Estimate by 2 cents, but narrower than the year-ago quarter 
      loss by 6 cents. Revenue at Theravance decreased 3.9% to $5.3 million 
      and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $7 million.

			Alcoa Names Keith Walton Vice President, Government Affairs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Alcoa (NYSE:&#160;AA) announced today that Keith Walton has been named Vice 
      President, Government Affairs, effective January 4, 2011. He succeeds 
      Russell Wisor, who is retiring after 33 years of service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton will lead all of Alcoa&#8217;s federal and state government affairs 
      activities in the U.S. He will be based in the company&#8217;s government 
      affairs office in Washington, DC.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Keith brings to Alcoa a wealth of experience,&#8221; said Daniel Cruise, 
      Alcoa&#8217;s Vice President, Global Government and Public Affairs. &#8220;We know 
      he will represent Alcoa effectively as we continue to grow the role 
      Alcoa aluminum plays in strengthening the U.S. economy and enhancing the 
      sustainability of everything from beverage containers to automobiles. We 
      expect him to have a long and successful career.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A native of Birmingham, AL, Walton has served as of counsel to Nelson, 
      Mullins, Riley  Scarborough, and as principal and chief administrative 
      officer of Global Infrastructure Partners. He also has served as 
      executive vice president and secretary of the university at Columbia 
      University in New York City.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Walton served at the United States Department of the Treasury as deputy 
      chief of staff and chief of staff to the under secretary for 
      Enforcement, Treasury&#8217;s chief law enforcement official. He assisted the 
      under secretary in supervising federal law enforcement organizations 
      that were Treasury bureaus at the time, including the U.S. Secret 
      Service, Customs Service, ATF and IRS Criminal Investigative Division. 
      He also served as deputy director of the White House Security Review.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton is an honors graduate of Yale College and the Harvard Law School. 
      He is a member of the American Law Institute, the Council on Foreign 
      Relations, and the Trilateral Commission. He was a 2005 Henry Crown 
      Fellow of the Aspen Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton succeeds Russell Wisor, who will retire effective February 1. 
      &#8220;Russ Wisor has made enormous contributions to Alcoa, the aluminum 
      industry and the U.S. economy over more than three decades,&#8221; Cruise 
      said. &#8220;We wish him the very best for a long and enjoyable retirement.&#8221;

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details

&lt;p&gt;  LAS VEGAS, NEVADA, Dec 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
MicroCapsDaily.com, a leading authority for micro cap research, provides
in-depth due diligence and analysis of stocks in every sector of the
market. MicroCapsDaily Investment Stock Report's primary mission is to
anticipate which small cap and micro cap companies are on the verge of
explosive movement and alert our valued subscribers with actionable
market intelligence. When it comes to success, timing is everything! 

    MicroCapsDaily issues an alert for the following stocks: Petrobras(PBR),
General Motors Co.(GM), Pfizer Inc.(PFE), Bank of America(BAC), Citigroup
Inc.Copyright, Motorola Inc.(MOT), General Electric Co.(GE), Ford Motor
Co.(F), Sprint Nextel Corp.(S), Chimera Investment Corp.(CIM) and
Thursday morning's top stock on our watch list: dPollution International
Inc. (PINK SHEETS: RMGX)

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details
regarding this unique opportunity please visit: www.microcapsdaily.com.

    On Wednesday 12/8/10 dPollution International Inc. (PINK SHEETS: RMGX)
announced that it has received a request for the supply of 3,000 units of
its patented dPollution Device. The units are to be delivered to Stem
Italia S.R.L. of Rome, Italy and distributed to the members of A.N.C.
Associazione Nazionale di Categoria Trasporto Persone e Mobilita, the
association of tourist bus drivers in the Province of Lazio, Italy.
A.N.C. will be acquiring the units to install on its members fleets of
diesel buses to ensure their compliance with the Province of Lazio's new
Low Emission Zone (LEZ) standards, which will be enforced starting in
2011. 

    In the U.S. market alone, there are 250 million registered passenger
vehicles and dPollution (RMGX) owns the exclusive manufacturing and
distribution rights to a patented fuel conditioning technology which
significantly increases mileage and lowers harmful GHG emissions.
dPollution's revolutionary device improves engine performance by causing
fuel to combust more thoroughly and efficiently. This technology works on
every internal combustion engine in the world. Considering that IC
engines are used in cars, buses, trucks, diesel trains, construction
equipment, farm equipment and a variety of military vehicles the market
for this device is virtually limitless. For more information, please
visit: www.microcapsdaily.com.

    Here at MicroCapsDaily we realize that nothing speaks louder than the
success of our clients. That's why our team works hard to uncover and
track winning companies in the early stages of explosive growth. Timing
is critical when it comes to realizing huge profits in the market. To
capitalize on that key factor we use every resource and technology to
provide our clients with real-time actionable market intelligence to make
that possible. To join our FREE MicroCapsDaily.com newsletter please

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - The race to the top of the global mergers and acquisitions league table looks set to end with Goldman Sachs (GS.N) retaking the honors from the rival which derailed its nine-year grip on the ranking last year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Investment banks Goldman and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) have been neck-and-neck in the MA stakes throughout the year, according to Thomson Reuters data, ahead of rivals JP Morgan (JPM.N), Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), UBS (UBSN.VX)(UBS.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But with only a few hours before the ranking is officially closed at 2300 GMT, Goldman looks set to beat last year's top adviser Morgan Stanley, marking a return to form after getting hurt in the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has advised on 368 deals worth $553.5 billion so far this year, compared with Morgan Stanley's 393 deals worth $537.9 billion. The slim $15.6 billion margin between the two firms -- or about half a percent -- could still change when the final numbers are counted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And with the gap so small, slight differences in the methods used to determine which deals to include in the charts could also still mean Morgan Stanley does come up on top in the rankings of rival data providers, such as Dealogic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Thomson Reuters league tables, Goldman was ahead at the end of the first quarter and Morgan Stanley led in the second quarter. The two firms swapped first and second slots in the second half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRACK RECORDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While both firms have suffered because the financial crisis sent MA volumes tumbling, their strong track records have helped them win more deals and get ahead of rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These banks have a reputation. Nobody would ever get fired in the boardroom for recommending Goldman or Morgan Stanley," said Scott Moeller, director of the MA practice at London's Cass Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was the most active MA adviser for nine years -- a period that included the bottom of the previous cycle after the technology bubble burst -- until it was unseated by Morgan Stanley last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's key partners include London-based Karen Cook, who serves as a non-executive director at retailer Tesco (TSCO.L), and natural-resources specialist Julian Metherell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's star names include Simon Robey, who has worked on a string of high profile mandates for the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MA stakes could be higher in 2011, with bankers hoping for the start of a new multi-year cycle that will feature more companies looking for advice on takeovers and an increase in cross-border deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I sense that people will still be using cash and rising share prices to fund MA in 2011, which means there will be less need for leverage and (which) plays again to the strengths of Goldman and Morgan Stanley," Moeller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thomson Reuters preliminary data showed announced MA grew by nearly a fifth in 2010 to $2.25 trillion globally, with bankers and analysts expecting a further rise in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley's role on the $62.5 billion restructuring bailout for crippled U.S. financial group AIG (AIG.N) -- not yet included in this year's data -- is set to give the bank a strong boost in the league tables next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Douwe Miedema and David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Queues stretched for kilometers at immigration offices in South Africa on Friday as thousands of Zimbabweans tried to meet a year-end deadline to file papers for legalizing their stay in the country.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;South Africa allowed hundreds of thousands from Zimbabwe to enter without documents about two years ago when its neighbor was swept up in political violence and its already unsteady economy collapsed under the weight of hyperinflation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 200,000 had already applied for visas, the Home Affairs Ministry said, far short of what non-governmental groups said could be as many as 1.5 million to 2.5 million Zimbabweans in South Africa, the continent's largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need an extension. There are just too many of us here," said Zimbabwean IT technician Phakamami Dube, one of the few who has received a proper visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With unemployment at 25 percent, South Africa has faced criticism from its poor for allowing Zimbabweans, the largest immigrant group in the state, to enter its territory without documents. The Zimbabweans fill a vast array of jobs, from menial laborers to highly paid professionals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deadline sets the stage for a mass deportation next year that could spark fresh violence directed at foreigners, after deadly attacks two years ago unnerved investors and rattled the government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO EXTENSION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Africa has extended working hours at immigration offices and eased paperwork requirements to make it easier to apply.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It has also said it will not extend the deadline. It will not begin deporting the immigrants until it has processed all the papers filed by the deadline, officials said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zimbabwe has deployed a team in South Africa to help process documents. But few expect the bulk of immigrants to relocate: Zimbabwe is mired in economic hardship, with most people earning less than a dollar a day, and per capita GDP is about 95 percent lower than in South Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The migrants are likely voters for rivals to long-standing leader Robert Mugabe, so their return could alter the course of an election sought by his ZANU-PF party for next year. They are also a source of remittance payments that help steady Zimbabwe's wobbly economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you cut off the supply lines from South Africa and without the money from South Africa, the humanitarian conditions in Zimbabwe would worsen," said Loren Landau, director of the African Center for Migration and Society at the University of the Witwatersrand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mugabe, 86 and in power for three decades, has called for elections in 2011 to dissolve a coalition government he formed last year with his rival, Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai, after a disputed election that was scarred by political violence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Mark Trevelyan)&lt;/p&gt;

    Morgan Stanley's lead commodity analyst Hussein Allidina is forecasting
an average $100 per barrel crude oil prices in 2011. That's a sharp 20%
increase over 2010! (On Tuesday 12/7/10 oil touched a two-year high of
$90 per barrel before retreating) The clear implication of the higher oil
prices is that there will be a strong demand for technologies which make
more efficient use of fossil fuels possible. A company on our radar
screen, dPollution International Inc. is in prime position to become a
leading supplier in this rapidly developing market. For more details
regarding this unique opportunity please visit: www.microcapsdaily.com.

its patented dPollution Device. The units are to be delivered to Stem
Italia S.R.L. of Rome, Italy and distributed to the members of A.N.C.
Associazione Nazionale di Categoria Trasporto Persone e Mobilita, the
association of tourist bus drivers in the Province of Lazio, Italy.
A.N.C. will be acquiring the units to install on its members fleets of
diesel buses to ensure their compliance with the Province of Lazio's new
Low Emission Zone (LEZ) standards, which will be enforced starting in
2011. 

    In the U.S. market alone, there are 250 million registered passenger
vehicles and dPollution (RMGX) owns the exclusive manufacturing and
distribution rights to a patented fuel conditioning technology which
significantly increases mileage and lowers harmful GHG emissions.
dPollution's revolutionary device improves engine performance by causing
fuel to combust more thoroughly and efficiently. This technology works on
every internal combustion engine in the world. Considering that IC
engines are used in cars, buses, trucks, diesel trains, construction
equipment, farm equipment and a variety of military vehicles the market
for this device is virtually limitless. For more information, please

Board focused Wall Street investment advisor. Here at MicroCapsDaily we
know it is more valuable to spot a stock that can go from $1 - $10.00 in
a matter of days than it is to find one which can go from $10.00 -

&lt;p&gt;   * Goldman Sachs on track to win back MA honours&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman, Morgan Stanley swapped MA leadership in 2010&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * AIG bailout will help Morgan Stanley in 2011  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Victoria Howley  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The race to the top of the global
mergers and acquisitions league table looks set to end with
Goldman Sachs (GS.N) retaking the honours from the rival which
derailed its nine-year grip on the ranking last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banks Goldman and Morgan Stanley (MS.N) have been
neck-and-neck in the MA stakes throughout the year, according
to Thomson Reuters data, ahead of rivals JP Morgan (JPM.N),
Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX), Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), UBS
(UBSN.VX)(UBS.N), Bank of America (BAC.N) and Citigroup (C.N). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But with only a few hours before the ranking is officially
closed at 2300 GMT, Goldman looks set to beat last year's top
adviser Morgan Stanley, marking a return to form after getting
hurt in the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has advised on 368 deals worth $553.5 billion so far
this year, compared with Morgan Stanley's 393 deals worth $537.9
billion. The slim $15.6 billion margin between the two firms --
or about half a percent -- could still change when the final
numbers are counted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And with the gap so small, slight differences in the methods
used to determine which deals to include in the charts could
also still mean Morgan Stanley does come up on top in the
rankings of rival data providers, such as Dealogic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the Thomson Reuters league tables, Goldman was ahead at
the end of the first quarter and Morgan Stanley led in the
second quarter. The two firms swapped first and second slots in
the second half of the year.

  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TRACK RECORDS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While both firms have suffered because the financial crisis
sent MA volumes tumbling, their strong track records have
helped them win more deals and get ahead of rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These banks have a reputation. Nobody would ever get fired
in the boardroom for recommending Goldman or Morgan Stanley,"
said Scott Moeller, director of the MA practice at London's
Cass Business School. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman was the most active MA adviser for nine years -- a
period that included the bottom of the previous cycle after the
technology bubble burst -- until it was unseated by Morgan
Stanley last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's key partners include London-based Karen Cook, who
serves as a non-executive director at retailer Tesco (TSCO.L),
and natural-resources specialist Julian Metherell. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley's star names include Simon Robey, who has
worked on a string of high profile mandates for the firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The MA stakes could be higher in 2011, with bankers hoping
for the start of a new multi-year cycle that will feature more
companies looking for advice on takeovers and an increase in
cross-border deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I sense that people will still be using cash and rising
share prices to fund MA in 2011, which means there will be less
need for leverage and (which) plays again to the strengths of
Goldman and Morgan Stanley," Moeller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thomson Reuters preliminary data showed announced MA grew
by nearly a fifth in 2010 to $2.25 trillion globally, with
bankers and analysts expecting a further rise in the year ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Morgan Stanley's role on the $62.5 billion restructuring
bailout for crippled U.S. financial group AIG (AIG.N) -- not yet
included in this year's data -- is set to give the bank a strong
boost in the league tables next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman and Morgan Stanley declined to comment.
