&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co. said on Friday 
it made two changes to its corporate bylaws, including a 
measure allowing the board of directors to adopt a stockholder 
rights plan by a majority vote.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The new provisions are "part of the whole set of steps we 
have been taking to improve corporate governance," a company 
spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The measure giving the board the ability to adopt a 
stockholder rights plan, which is often referred to as a 
"poison pill" and is used to fend off hostile takeovers, is 
similar to a proposal from a shareholder at the company's most 
recent annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The difference is that the earlier shareholder proposal 
called for 75 percent of the board members to approve a plan 
versus the simple majority as outlined by Friday's 
announcement. At the time of the board meeting, Disney chairman 
John Pepper said the company would consider the idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, Disney adopted a change providing that, in 
uncontested elections for board seats, a majority vote was 
needed to elect a board member. Previously only a plurality of 
yes votes was necessary. Disney said back in December it was 
planning on adopting this second change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PARIS (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) will open in France its first nuclear consultancy centre in July, at a time when utilities are looking to build new reactors and stretch the old ones' lifetime, an executive said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp. is banking on a growth of the nuclear industry as the carbon dioxide-free energy source is touted as a tool to combat global warming and increase power output to meet surging demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guido Bartels, IBM's global energy and utilities industry manager told Reuters that in the 30 countries with nuclear generation there was a need for sophisticated risk modeling and information tools driven by nuclear power plant license extensions and construction of new plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the 25-strong nuclear experts' centre, he added, would be mainly focused on Europe. "There is a lot going on here," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full opening of EU power markets on July 1 to households was an opportunity for increased competition and increased pressure to provide cost-effective and reliable power, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company did not disclose the investment cost for the centre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM already provides utilities services for improved design, construction, safety and operation of nuclear power plants to utilities such as French power giant EDF (EDF.PA), U.S. publicly-owned Tennessee Valley Authority and the utility holding company DTE Energy (DTE.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The center, based in southern France, will be near Cadarache, the site of the International Thermonuclear Experimental reactor (ITER) fusion project, and will draw on French expertise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co.'s animated movie "Ratatouille" opens on Friday against strong competition from better-known franchise films, drawing early industry skepticism that it can match its predecessors' success and posing a challenge for Disney.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet, as the film has debuted and positive reviews have poured in, the sentiment has seemed to be growing that "Ratatouille," about a cuisine-loving rat who risks his life to indulge in French cooking, could prove another box office hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney is still proving to investors that last year's acquisition of Pixar Animation is worth its $7.4 billion price tag, and "Ratatouille" is the first Pixar film to be released that was still in production when the Disney-Pixar deal was sealed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pixar's seven previous films all opened at No. 1 at U.S. and Canadian box offices, but "Ratatouille" faces stiff rivalry for that headline-grabbing spot from Bruce Willis action film "Live Free or Die Hard" and second-weekend audiences of family film "Evan Almighty."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are in a super-competitive time frame," said Paul Degarabedian, president of box office tracker Media By Numbers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The most recent four Pixar movies have generated huge opening-weekend ticket sales, ranging from $70.5 million for "The Incredibles" in 2004 to $60.1 for "Cars" last year, according to Media By Numbers.

&lt;p&gt;QUITO, July 2 (Reuters) - Oil major Chevron Corp. (CVX.N)
alleged irregularities in a $6 billion lawsuit that accuses it
of polluting Ecuador's rainforest and will challenge any ruling
against the U.S. firm, a top company lawyer said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The due process is not being respected in our case,"
Ricardo Veiga, Chevron's managing counsel for Latin America,
told Reuters during a visit to Quito.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will not hesitate to go to international tribunals to
review what we believe is an unfair trial and lack of due
process in this country," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jungle residents, including the Cofan Indian tribe, accuse
Chevron's Texaco subsidiary of dumping 18 billion gallons of
oil-polluted water from 1972 to 1992. Nearly 30,000 jungle
residents are demanding money with which to clean up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Texaco merged with Chevron in 2001 and the company denies
any wrongdoing to the provincial judge reviewing the lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Rafael Correa, a leftist former economy minister,
has publicly sided with the plaintiffs and even offered help
gathering evidence to boost their case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are very concerned ... we believe the judiciary should
be independent to review the facts," Veiga said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  He accused the plaintiffs of manipulating the court in
their favor and questions the objectivity of an expert named by
the judge to determine if there was any contamination and if
the company caused it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs' lawyers deny any court manipulation and
said they hope the judge would deliver a ruling by next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron's attitude simply shows that they are afraid
because the truth is coming out after 20 years," said Alejandro
Ponce, one of the lawyers. "They are making accusations without
any proof."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron argues it was released from any liability when it
paid $40 million for an environmental clean-up in the 1990's
and blames state oil company Petroecuador for much of the
pollution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron no longer operates in Ecuador, South America's
fifth-largest oil producer with an output of around 530,000
barrels of oil per day.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 2 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) said
on Monday it does not expect the nationalization of its stake
in the Cerro Negro project in Venezuela to have a material
effect on its operations or financial condition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Last week, Venezuela's government forced Exxon Mobil out of
Cerro Negro as part of a drive for the state to take over many
of the country's oil production assets. ConocoPhillips (COP.N)
also was forced out of several projects there.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said its net investment in Cerro Negro producing
assets was about $750 million, less than 0.7 percent of its
worldwide property, plant and equipment as of March 31.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it was negotiating with Venezuela over
compensation for the project.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The private equity owners of Visant 
Corp. have hired Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse to explore 
strategic options for the marketing and publishing company, 
including a sale, sources close to the matter said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company posted $1.2 billion in net sales last year, 
with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and 
amortization (EBITDA) of $284.7 million, according to public 
filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With media and publishing assets typically selling for at 
least 10 times EBITDA--a measure of cash flow--the company 
could fetch a price of around $3 billion. However, Visant has 
multiple businesses lines, so its comparable multiples could 
vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Armonk, New York-based Visant is owned by private equity 
firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co. and DLJ Merchant Banking 
Partners, an affiliate of Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has three main segments. One is Scholastic, 
which provides class rings and other graduation products to 
high schools and colleges. Another is Yearbook, which provides 
marketing, sales and production services of school yearbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The third group is marketing and publishing services for 
the fragrance, cosmetics and personal care markets. The group 
also produces components for educational publishers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company became known as Visant after KKR and DLJ 
combined the Jostens yearbook business with textbook printer 
Von Hoffmann Corp. and Arcade Marketing, which makes perfume 
samples found in magazines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KKR and DLJ completed the combination of the businesses in 
October 2004, selling Von Hoffman to RR Donnelly in May of this 
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KKR and a spokesman for DLJ Merchant Banking declined to 
comment. Visant and Goldman Sachs did not return a call seeking 
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visant's EBITDA has grown 70 percent to $284 million since 
2004, according to filings, while net sales have held steady 
around $1.1 billion. Long-term debt is $1.77 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2006, $437 million in net sales came from Jostens 
Scholastic, $358 million from Jostens Yearbook and $390 million 
from marketing and publishing services, filings show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visant's exploration process is in its very early stages, 
sources say, and could include various possibilities such as a 
sale to a buyer, an initial public offering, or a 
recapitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Private equity firms, which buy and sell companies by 
borrowing most of the money, typically hold onto their 
businesses for two to four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Shares of Walt Disney 
Co. closed up 1.1 percent on Monday, even though some Wall 
Street observers said the $47 million opening-weekend haul for 
"Ratatouille" fell below their expectations and might be the 
latest sign that animated fare is past its prime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Bear Stearns analyst Spencer Wang said he had projected a 
$50 million tally, with the Street consensus in the $50 
million-$60 million range. He added that "Cars" last year 
grossed $60 million despite worse reviews.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is another sign of our long-held thesis that CG 
(computer-generated) animation has passed its peak given

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Children who were exposed to cocaine in the womb show poorer-than-average language skills during their early years and do not catch up, new research suggests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a study that followed nearly 400 children from birth to age 6, researchers found that those whose mothers used cocaine during pregnancy showed persistently poorer language ability. This was true even when the researchers accounted for factors like the mothers' vocabulary and family income.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dr. Barbara A. Lewis and colleagues at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, report the findings in the journal Pediatrics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Research has tied prenatal cocaine exposure to a number of developmental delays and behavioral problems in childhood. For their study, Lewis and her colleagues tracked the effects of cocaine exposure on children's language development over time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study included 209 children whose mothers had used cocaine during pregnancy and 189 children whose mothers had not abused the drug. At ages 1, 2, 4 and 6, the children took standard tests of their ability to understand and effectively use language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their mothers also took tests of vocabulary and general intelligence, and were interviewed about their caregiving skills. If a child had been placed in a foster home or adopted, the current caregiver was tested and interviewed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Overall, Lewis's team found, cocaine-exposed children performed more poorly on the language tests from early on, and did not catch up over time. Home environment and other factors did not change this link.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to these drug effects, the researchers also found that children whose mothers smoked cigarettes during pregnancy performed more poorly on the language tests. The effect was over and above that of any cocaine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The present findings indicate that tobacco exposure is additive to the risk of (cocaine-exposed) children for language deficits," Lewis and her colleagues write.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pediatricians, they conclude, need to be aware of the language delays linked to prenatal cocaine and tobacco exposure, and step up their efforts to detect such problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SOURCE: Pediatrics, July 2007.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The private equity owners of Visant Corp. have hired Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse to explore strategic options for the marketing and publishing company, including a sale, sources close to the matter said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company posted $1.2 billion in net sales last year, with earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) of $284.7 million, according to public filings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With media and publishing assets typically selling for at least 10 times EBITDA--a measure of cash flow--the company could fetch a price of around $3 billion. However, Visant has multiple businesses lines, so its comparable multiples could vary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Armonk, New York-based Visant is owned by private equity firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co. and DLJ Merchant Banking Partners, an affiliate of Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has three main segments. One is Scholastic, which provides class rings and other graduation products to high schools and colleges. Another is Yearbook, which provides marketing, sales and production services of school yearbooks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third group is marketing and publishing services for the fragrance, cosmetics and personal care markets. The group also produces components for educational publishers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company became known as Visant after KKR and DLJ combined the Jostens yearbook business with textbook printer Von Hoffmann Corp. and Arcade Marketing, which makes perfume samples found in magazines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KKR and DLJ completed the combination of the businesses in October 2004, selling Von Hoffman to RR Donnelly in May of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KKR and a spokesman for DLJ Merchant Banking declined to comment. Visant and Goldman Sachs did not return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visant's EBITDA has grown 70 percent to $284 million since 2004, according to filings, while net sales have held steady around $1.1 billion. Long-term debt is $1.77 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2006, $437 million in net sales came from Jostens Scholastic, $358 million from Jostens Yearbook and $390 million from marketing and publishing services, filings show.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Visant's exploration process is in its very early stages, sources say, and could include various possibilities such as a sale to a buyer, an initial public offering, or a recapitalization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity firms, which buy and sell companies by borrowing most of the money, typically hold onto their businesses for two to four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MOSCOW, July 4 (Reuters) - Shareholders of a Chevron-led
(CVX.N) pipeline project have failed to resolve a strategy
dispute with Russia over the country's only private oil link, a
source close to the shareholders said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Most shareholders of the Caspian Pipeline Consortium turned
down suggestions by Russian pipeline monopoly Transneft
(TRNF_p.RTS), which represents Russia in the group which pumps
oil from Kazakhstan to the Black Sea across Russian territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They failed to agree on Transneft's suggestions to raise
fees, cut interest on credits and make changes in the groups
charter," the source said during a two-day shareholders' meeting
in Moscow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russia, Kazakhstan and Oman own stakes in CPC, while private
shareholders include BP Plc (BP.L), Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L),
ExxonMobil (XOM.N), LUKOIL (LKOH.MM), Rosneft (ROSN.MM) as well
as Chevron, which holds 15 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only LUKOIL has agreed with Transneft's suggestions, while
Kazakhstan abstained, the source said. Transneft declined to
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russia, which has a 24 percent stake in the consortium as a
host stake, has long opposed the group's plans to double
capacity from the current 700,000 barrels per day as it says the
project brings little benefit to Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CPC has to pay back $5.5 billion in loans from its private
shareholders before sharing profits with its state owners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To refinance the loan, Transneft wants the consortium to cut
interest to 6 percent from the current 12.5 percent and raise
fees to $38 per a tonne from $24.6, which experts say could
drive oil flows towards competing routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Russia has also slapped CPC with a 4.7 billion rouble ($183
million) back tax claim for 2002-2003 and is checking its
accounts for 2004-2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CPC has been shipping oil since 2001 and pumps up to 730,000
barrels per day from Kazakh oilfields to Novorossiisk, Russia's
largest Black Sea port, for re-export to world markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Most of the oil goes to European refiners who, wary of
over-reliance on Russia, see Kazakhstan as a new and competing
source of oil. Chinese refiners also look to Central Asia as a
potential energy source to fuel China's roaring economy.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Thursday said it would take a more than $1 billion charge to fix "an unacceptable number of repairs" to its Xbox 360 video game consoles and had missed shipment targets for the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is under pressure with mounting complaints about Xbox 360 failures on the Internet and growing expectations that Sony Corp.

It also said it has made improvements to the Xbox 360 console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The charge will be in a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, before taxes, for the quarter ended June 30, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft had already cut its forecast for Xbox 360 shipments in January. It had previously forecast shipments of 13 million to 15 million by the end of June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you have to ask yourself as an investor is, should Microsoft be in the hardware business?" said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which oversees about $1.2 billion, including Microsoft shares, for clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She added, however, that the charge should not be a concern for long-term investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a lot of money, let's not say it isn't," Caughey said.

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON/VANCOUVER, British Columbia (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Thursday it will open a software development center in Vancouver, giving it a place to employ skilled workers snagged by U.S. immigration quotas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It may signal the start of a new hiring trend, with other U.S. high-tech firms following in Microsoft's footsteps to Canada, where lawyers say it is easier for foreign nationals to obtain work credentials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. businesses want Congress to lift quotas on the number of visas the government issues to skilled professionals such as the software engineers that Microsoft employs. But as recently as last week lawmakers rejected legislation that would have addressed their concerns. Canada doesn't impose quotas on the number of visas it issues each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it plans to open the Vancouver facility by the end of the year. It will initially have about 200 workers, and employ about 900 within a couple years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Businesses, particularly technology firms, say they need to recruit foreign nationals, many of whom have received their graduate degrees in the United States, to compensate for a shortage of qualified programmers, engineers and scientists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evan Green, a Toronto immigration attorney who helps businesses obtain visas for employees, said that other U.S. companies could follow Microsoft's lead.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Lots of companies are looking at (expanding in Canada) because of their frustration with getting U.S. visas," Green said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But supporters of the U.S. cap say it prevents firms from using temporary foreign workers to displace higher paid American employees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said in a statement that the Vancouver center will "allow the company to continue to recruit and retain highly skilled people affected by the immigration issues in the United States."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But company spokesman Lou Gellos said Microsoft's frustration with the U.S. government's visa policy wasn't the only reason for the expansion in Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is part of a larger program to diversify software development outside of Microsoft headquarters in Redmond, Washington, Gellos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has operations in North Carolina, Ireland, Denmark and Israel, and has already announced plans for sites in Boston and Bellevue, Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would be opening this center in Vancouver even if this visa situation didn't exist," Gellos said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, U.S. interest in placing workers in Canada has risen since the beginning of April, when Washington announced there would be a severe visa shortage this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The United States grants about 85,000 H-1B visas annually to workers with skills in specialized fields. A record 150,000, requests, or nearly double the annual quota, were filed on just the first day applications were accepted for this year's allotment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft and other companies have been saying for a long time, 'If you make it so difficult for U.S. companies to bring in talented foreign national that they need, companies are going to fill those positions abroad,'" said Ted Ruthizer, who runs the business immigration practice for the U.S. law firm Kramer Levin Naftalis and Frankel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is just the fulfillment of this promise," Ruthizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green said Vancouver, Toronto and Montreal are poised to get the most jobs as a result of the U.S. visa restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vancouver, Canada's third-largest city, is only about three hours' drive from Microsoft's headquarters, and is already a popular destination for immigrants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Efforts to ease restrictions on the U.S. work visa system were dealt a blow last week when the Senate killed President George W. Bush's planned overhaul of the country's immigration policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bill's supporters say Congress is unlikely to revisit the issue until after the November 2008 election.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL, July 7 (Reuters) - LG Household  Health Care Ltd.
(051900.KS), which agreed to buy Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd.'s
(CCL.AX) South Korean business, said on Saturday it hoped to
sell part of shares in the newly acquired unit to Coca-Cola Co.
(KO.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Amatil, 35-percent owned by Coca-Cola, said on Friday it
had agreed to sell its Korean unit to LG for A$520-A$545
million ($445-$467 million), including debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; South Korean online news provider EDaily quoted an LG
source as saying later in the day that the company was planning
to sell some shares in the unit to Coca-Cola, once the deal
closed, to secure basic liquids from the U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Once the acquisition is completed and Coca-Cola wants such
a deal, we can consider selling part of the shares," said a
spokesman at LG Household. "We have sought investment by
Coca-Cola from the very initial stage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Growth had been slowing in Amatil's South Korean business
as more consumers turn to healthier, low-sugar drinks.
Coca-Cola controls 48 percent of South Korea's soft drinks
market but lost volume following a recall of Coca-Cola bottles
last July after a criminal poisoning case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Amatil and LG expect to close a deal in three months
pending continuing negotiations. Analysts expect the deal would
give LG a distribution network for its beverage business.

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - 
Screenwriter-turned-comic-book publisher Andrew Cosby and

Pictures' "First Ascent."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The film is described as a supernatural action adventure 
that revolves around a group of climbers who, while attempting 
to ascend a mountain in Bhutan, are attacked by an unseen 
beast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney said "Ascent" is a rewrite of an older project and 
is not related to the Expedition Everest roller-coaster ride 
atDisney's Animal Kingdom in Florida, which features an 
encounter with a yeti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cosby is the creator of the TV series "Eureka" and 
"Haunting." He also wrote an adaptation of "Damn Nation" for 
Paramount Pictures and MTV Films as well as "Creature Tech" for

(MSFT.O) said on Thursday said it would take a more than $1 billion charge to fix "an unacceptable number of repairs" to its Xbox 360 video game consoles and had missed shipment targets for the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft is under pressure with mounting complaints about Xbox 360 failures on the Internet and growing expectations that Sony Corp. (6758.T) could slash the price of its rival PlayStation 3 console at a video game exposition next week. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    So far Microsoft has the lead on Sony in the battle for high-end video game machines, but it shipped only 11.6 million 360s by the end of June, compared with a target of about 12 million, Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said during a conference call with analysts on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division, said the timing of the announcement about the charge for the quarter ending in June and a new extended warranty were unrelated to any potential move by Sony. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This is just one of those things that happens when it happens," Bach said in an interview. "We reached our conclusion early this week and because it's a financially meaningful issue we had to announce it immediately." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The hardware issue has marred a string of successes for Xbox 360, which has built an early lead over the PlayStation 3 with Microsoft's strong lineup of games and popular online service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But it is also finding increasing competition for some parts of its business, such as Apple Inc.'s (AAPL.O) incursion into television shows delivered over the Web, which is also a feature of the Xbox online service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    RED FLASHING LIGHTS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft said it had investigated the sources of hardware failures indicated by three red flashing lights on the console and had identified "a number of factors" that can cause such failures. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bach said many of those factors took time to show up in the consoles, explaining why the number of repairs had grown in the second year of the Xbox 360's release. He would not say exactly how many Xbox 360s had been returned due to hardware issues except that "the number is too large." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said it would extend warranty coverage to three years to cover the problem and would reimburse customers who had previously paid for repairs related to the three-flashing-lights error message. It also said it has made improvements to the Xbox 360 console. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The charge will be in a range of $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, before taxes, for the quarter ended June 30, Microsoft said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft had already cut its forecast for Xbox 360 shipments in January. It had previously forecast shipments of 13 million to 15 million by the end of June. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "What you have to ask yourself as an investor is, should Microsoft be in the hardware business?" said Kim Caughey, senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which oversees about $1.2 billion, including Microsoft shares, for clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    She added, however, that the charge should not be a concern for long-term investors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's a lot of money, let's not say it isn't," Caughey said. "But if you're a long-term holder, I don't think it's going to have that great an impact." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bach said the new warranty would not impact the Xbox division's plan to turn a profit in fiscal 2008, which started this month. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He was also mum on the issue of whether Microsoft would announce a price cut for the Xbox 360 console if Sony made a similar move. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We will assess what we do with pricing and other aspects of our business based on our own business," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft shares dropped slightly to $29.91 after closing at $29.99 on Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Nichola Groom; Reuters Messaging: nichola.groom.reuters.com@reuters.net, Tel:+1-213-955-6755; editing by Deborah Cohen)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com))   Keywords: MICROSOFT XBOX/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 6 (Reuters) - U.S. investment bank Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) said on Friday it was working with authorities
investigating letters threatening the bank but it had been told
the threat was not thought to be very credible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Star-Ledger of New Jersey newspaper reported it
received one of the letters, which was signed A.Q.U.S.A., a
possible reference to Al Qaeda. The handwritten letter said:
"Goldman Sachs. Hundreds will die. We are inside. You can not
stop us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs spokesman Michael DuVally said the bank takes
any threat "very seriously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are working closely with the law enforcement
authorities, who tell us they don't believe the threat to be
very credible," he told Reuters by e-mail. "We have a broad
range of security measures in place to counter all likely
threats and we're monitoring the situation closely."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Star-Ledger said the letters were mailed from Queens,
New York, to newspapers in Texas, Indiana, Tennessee and
elsewhere. The paper said it handed over the letter it received
to the FBI for investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FBI officials in New York were not immediately available

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian soft drinks firm Coca-Cola Amatil Ltd. (CCL.AX) said on Friday it has agreed to sell its Korean business to LG Household and Health Care Ltd. (051900.KS), for less than it hoped but more than analysts had expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Amatil, 35 percent-owned by Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N), said the price would be in a range of A$520-A$545 million ($445-$467 million) range, including debt, and it expects the deal to be completed in three months pending continuing negotiations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Amatil had said it wanted to get around A$700 million for the unit, its book value, but analysts had said that was unlikely and saw the price announced on Friday as better than expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is a better price than a lot of people were looking for," ABN Amro Asset Management analyst Matthew Hoult said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's below what the company was talking about publicly but a good price for what has been a disappointing business in terms of return on capital," he said, adding he would have been happy to have seen it sold for as little as A$200 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate statement, LG Household said it expected the final price to be around 400 billion won ($433.9 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Excluding debt, we expect the price to come to about 280 billion won," said LG, which is seeking to expand its beverage unit and diversify from its main businesses of household products and cosmetics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If completed Coca-Cola Amatil will record a loss on book value of A$25-A$50 million. It bought the business in 1998 for US$461 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, South Korean online news provider EDaily quoted an unnamed LG official as saying that the company was planning to sell some shares in the newly-acquired unit to Coca-Cola once the deal closed, to secure basic liquids from the U.S. company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But LG Household spokesman said they could not immediately confirm the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola Amatil shares, which traded up 1.8 percent ahead of the announcement, closed up 0.2 percent at A$9.21 in a lower overall .AXJO market. The stock is up about 19 percent so far this year, outpacing a 12 percent rise on the benchmark index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LG Household shares gained 0.4 percent while the broader market index .KS11 was up 0.7 percent. LG Household's shares have risen 13 percent in the year to date, while the KOSPI index is up 25 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth had been slowing in Amatil's South Korean business as more consumers turn to healthier, low-sugar drinks. Coca-Cola Amatil earned A$18 million in 2006 in South Korea, up from a loss of A$9.2 million a year earlier and helped by a A$7.5 million profit on the sale of properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola controls 48 percent of South Korea's soft drinks market but lost volume following a recall of Coca-Cola bottles last July after a criminal poisoning case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang Jung-hoon, analyst at Samsung Securities, said the price for LG was much lower than had been discussed and the deal would give LG a distribution network for its beverage business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having a solid retail network would allow LG's lines of teas and health drinks to become a revenue source," Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"LG management doesn't seem fazed by Coca-Cola's past problems in South Korea as it believes its beverages and its marketing will be a better fit with the Korean market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;South Korea's SPC Group, parent of Samlip General Foods (005610.KS), had also bid for the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=1.168 Australian Dollar)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=921.8 Won)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Marie-France Han and Kim Yeon-hee in Seoul and Denny Thomas in Sydney)&lt;/p&gt;

(KO.N), said the purchase price would be in the range of A$520 million to A$545 million ($444-$466 million), including debt, and it expected the deal to be completed in three months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    If completed, Coca-Cola Amatil will record a loss on book value of between A$25 million and A$50 million. It had bought the business in 1998 for US$461 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The sale price is well below the A$700 million the company had suggested the operations were worth, but analysts had been sceptical of the sale reaching this level. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "This is a better price than a lot of people were looking for," ABN Amro Asset Management analyst Matthew Hoult said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's below what the company was talking about publicly but a good price for what has been a disappointing business in terms of return on capital." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Hoult said he would have been happy to have seen the business sold for as low as A$200 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    South Korea's SPC Group, the parent of Samlip General Foods (005610.KS), had also made a bid. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Growth had been slowing at Coca-Cola Amatil's South Korean business as more consumers turn to healthier, low-sugar drinks. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coca-Cola Amatil earned A$18 million in 2006 in South Korea, up from a loss of A$9.2 million a year earlier, helped by an A$7.5 million profit on the sale of properties. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Its shares last traded up 0.22 percent against a broader market .AXJO down 0.39 percent. The shares have risen 18.3 percent this year, partly on hopes for a sale of the South Korean operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ((Reporting by Jane Williams, editing by Jonathan Standing; jane.williams@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: jane.williams.reuters.com@reuters.net; +61 3 9286 1464)) Keywords: AMATIL KOREA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

property being sold by insurer Allianz (ALVG.DE), a German
newspaper reported on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Citing market sources, the Financial Times Deutschland said
in an article for Monday's edition that the first tranche of
properties, worth around 1.5 billion euros, would be sold off
in the next few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bidders for the properties, Allianz offices the firm
intends to lease back, include German property company IVG

German shops and offices that Allianz purchased as an
investment, is likely to be sold by August. Bidders include
Goldman Sachs's Whitehall real estate fund and a similar fund

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - An experimental anti-clotting
medicine from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc.
(PFE.N) met its main effectiveness and safety goals in a
mid-stage study, researchers said on Sunday, positioning it as
a future option over current popular but problematic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Patients treated with apixaban, a pill, had comparable
rates in two main measures to those on the standard of care --
an injected therapy plus one drug from the class that includes
the widely used warfarin. The measures included rates of blood
clots and dangerous bleedings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though effective at alleviating clotting, many
anticoagulant therapies come with serious drawbacks. Heparin
drugs must be injected or given intravenously, and warfarin is
notoriously difficult to regulate properly because of its
interactions with food and other medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apixaban, meanwhile, is an oral drug that does not need
regular monitoring or dose adjustments, making it a "great
alternative," said Dr. Harry Buller, lead investigator on the
study and chairman of the department of vascular medicine at
the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The search for new anticoagulants is not so much to beat
them in terms of efficacy," Buller said. The reason for "the
whole explosion of anti-thrombotic agents (is) to make life
easier for these patients," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buller was presenting the study's results on Sunday at the
International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis meeting in
Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Late-stage trials are already underway for apixaban, and
the companies plan to file for U.S. approval in the second half
of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apixaban is one of several pills being developed by drug
makers that block the Factor Xa protein, which plays an early
role in the chemical process leading to blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Researchers hope they also can be used by patients with
atrial fibrillation, or irregular heartbeat, to prevent stroke.
Late-stage data on another Factor Xa drug from Bayer AG
BAYG.DE were set to be presented at the meeting on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'DISASTER WITH EXANTA'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excitement over Factor Xa drugs follows the downfall of
Exanta, a once-promising anticoagulant from AstraZeneca Plc
(AZN.L) that had been associated with liver toxicity. Exanta
blocked another clotting protein called thrombin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After the disaster with Exanta, people are really looking
for new anticoagulants to fill that gap and to replace
warfarin, and I think this step ... is very pleasant to see,"
Buller said of the apixaban clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 12-week Phase 2 study involved 520 patients who
suffered a deep vein thrombosis, which is a clot that forms
most frequently deep inside the leg.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were three apixaban treatment groups: patients on 5
milligrams of the experimental drug twice a day; 10 mg twice a
day; or 20 mg once a day. A fourth control group received an
injectable anticoagulant plus warfarin or a similar drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main efficacy measure involved the combined rate of
incidents, including a new deep vein thrombosis or lack of
improvement in the original DVT, and blood clots that progress
to the lungs known as pulmonary emboli.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rates of the incidents were 6 percent for patients on 5 mg
of apixaban, 5.6 percent for the 10 mg, and 2.6 percent for the
20 mg. The rate was 4.2 percent for the control group. Buller
said differences among treatment groups were not clinically
relevant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The main safety measure examined bleedings, the rates of
which were 8.6 percent for the 5 mg apixaban group, 4.5 percent
for the 10 mg, 7.3 percent for the 20 mg, and 7.9 percent for
the control group. These differences were not clinically
relevant either, Buller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There were no adverse events, including no sign of liver
toxicity, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bristol-Myers and Pfizer agreed in April to develop and
sell apixaban together. They are currently running two Phase 3
apixaban trials: one to prevent blood clots among surgical
patients or those whose illness puts them at risk; a second to
prevent stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation.

Costa Rican coast guards hauled 899 kilograms of cocaine off one boat along the country's Pacific coast and stopped another with a similar amount with help of the U.S. Coast Guard. Authorities have yet to disclose the exact amount on the second boat as Colombian smugglers sabotaged the vessel and caused it to sink in shallow waters, slowing the narcotics collection. Judging by the size of the quantity on the first boat, we expect to find a similar amount on the boat that sank, said Public Security Minister Fernando Berrocal. The Costa Rican and U.S. Coast Guards had been searching for the boats after being alerted by U.S. authorities on Saturday evening, Berrocal said. Traffickers have changed tactics, hugging the Costa Rican coastline in order to avoid detection on the high seas by the U.S. Coast Guard, he added.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Apple declining comment, analyst comment)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) plans to
launch a cheaper version of the iPhone in the fourth quarter
that could be based on the ultra-slim iPod Nano music player,
according to a JP Morgan report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kevin Chang, a JP Morgan analyst based in Taiwan, cited
people in the supply channel he did not name and an application
with the U.S Patent and Trademark office for his report dated
July 8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple filed a patent application document dated July 5 that
refers to a multifunctional handheld device with a circular
touch pad control, similar to the Nano's scroll wheel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Long lines of people turned out on June 29 when U.S. sales
began for the iPhone, a mobile phone with a music player and
Web browser. Analysts have estimated that sales in the first
weekend were as high as 700,000 units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chang said a way to follow up the iPhone with a cheaper

features such as a touch-sensitive screen, later this year.
Such products would help stop iPhone eating into iPod sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the iPhone reveals much of what the iPod will

phone, 2008 sales of 30 million to 40 million units "is
achievable," according to JP Morgan's Chang.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This would be a much larger volume than is expected of the
first iPhone, Apple has targeted sales of 10 million units in
2008, which would give it a 1 percent share of the global
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of the iPhone are expected to be limited to a small
percentage of the market due to its high price tag,
particularly in the United States where 85 percent of consumers
tend to spend $100 or less on cell phones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But analysts forecast that a cheaper phone from Apple,
which leads the digital music player market, could pose a much
bigger threat to long-established phone makers such as Nokia
(NOK1V.HE), Motorola Inc MOT.N, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd
(005930.KS) and Sony Ericsson, owned by Sony Corp (6758.T) and
Ericsson (ERICb.ST).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taiwan's Catcher Technology (2474.TW) will be the "major
source of metal casing" for the new phone, according to Chang,
who cited an unidentified channel source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue from Apple could represent T$6 billion ($183
million) to T$8 billion ($244 million) revenue for Catcher in
2008, Chang estimated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apple shares closed down $1.97, or 1.5 percent, at $130.33
in on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - JP Morgan (JPM.N) and Lehman Brothers LEH.N were ranked the top U.S. bond dealers with the biggest overall market share and the best service, a survey released on Monday showed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Banc of America Securities, the broker dealer arm of Bank of America (BAC.N), rounded out the top five U.S. bond firms in this year's survey by Greenwich Associates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Among various investor groups, Lehman had the largest market share among hedge funds, which have become huge players in the bond market, said the Greenwich, Connecticut-based consulting firm. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Greenwich Associates' survey is based on results from about 1,300 institutional investors active in fixed-income trading. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Richard Leong, editing by James Dalgleish; Reuters Messaging: richard.leong.reuters.com@reuters.net; email: richard.leong@reuters.com; Tel: 646 223-6313)) Keywords: MARKETS BONDS/RANKINGS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds background, details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, July 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) has no plans now to cut the price of its Xbox game console in Japan, the home turf of rivals Nintendo Co. Ltd. 7974.OS and Sony Corp. (6758.T), the head of its Japan unit said on Monday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft also does not expect recent hardware glitches to affect appetite for its Xbox game console, said Darren Huston, president of Microsoft's Japan unit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Xbox prices in Japan are very competitive," Huston told Reuters. Asked if Microsoft plans to cut prices to follow Sony's $100 price cut for the PlayStation3, Huston said, "Not at this time." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But he later added, "We will be watching market conditions. Price cuts are one option." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Although popular in the United States, sales of the Xbox 360 have been slow in Japan. Microsoft sold 122,565 of the consoles in the first half of this year in Japan, while Nintendo sold 1.78 million units of its Wii and Sony sold 503,554 of its PS3 game machines, according to game magazine publisher Enterbrain. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft last week extended its warranty for the video game machine to three years, costing the software giant $1.05 billion to $1.15 billion, due to growing complaints. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft plans to launch the its advanced Xbox 360 game console, the Xbox 360 Elite, on Oct. 11 in Japan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Mayumi Negishi; editing by Sophie Hardach; Reuters Messaging: mayumi.negishi.reuters.com@reuters.net; +81-3-3432-8618; mayumi.negishi@reuters.com)) Keywords: MICROSOFT/JAPAN  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, July 8 (Reuters) - Numerous bidders, including funds controlled by Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), are interested in 3.5 billion euros ($4.8 billion) of property being sold by insurer Allianz (ALVG.DE), a German newspaper reported on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Citing market sources, the Financial Times Deutschland said in an article for Monday's edition that the first tranche of properties, worth around 1.5 billion euros, would be sold off in the next few weeks.  Bidders for the properties, Allianz offices the firm intends to lease back, include German property company IVG IVGG.DE, Australian financial investor Babcock and Brown BNB.AX and U.S. real estate investor Tishman Speyer. IVG is seeking property for a real estate investment trust it aims to list in 2008, the FTD added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The second tranche of properties, around 2 billion euros of German shops and offices that Allianz purchased as an investment, is likely to be sold by August. Bidders include Goldman Sachs's Whitehall real estate fund and a similar fund operated by Morgan Stanley. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Allianz announced the sale plans in May and said it planned to spend the proceeds on overseas property and thereby diversify its portfolio away from Germany. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Investment bank Rothschild [ROT.UL] is handling the first deal and property consultancy Jones Lang LaSalle (JLL.N) the second. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by David Milliken, editing by Gary Hill; Reuters Messaging: david.milliken.reuters.com@reuters.net; david.milliken@reuters.com; +49 69 7565 1209)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=.7355 Euro) Keywords: ALLIANZ PROPERTY/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Lewis Krauskopf &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 8 (Reuters) - An experimental anti-clotting medicine from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) met its main effectiveness and safety goals in a mid-stage study, researchers said on Sunday, positioning it as a future option over current popular but problematic drugs. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Patients treated with apixaban, a pill, had comparable rates in two main measures to those on the standard of care -- an injected therapy plus one drug from the class that includes the widely used warfarin. The measures included rates of blood clots and dangerous bleedings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Though effective at alleviating clotting, many anticoagulant therapies come with serious drawbacks. Heparin drugs must be injected or given intravenously, and warfarin is notoriously difficult to regulate properly because of its interactions with food and other medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Apixaban, meanwhile, is an oral drug that does not need regular monitoring or dose adjustments, making it a "great alternative," said Dr. Harry Buller, lead investigator on the study and chairman of the department of vascular medicine at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The search for new anticoagulants is not so much to beat them in terms of efficacy," Buller said. The reason for "the whole explosion of anti-thrombotic agents (is) to make life easier for these patients," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Buller was presenting the study's results on Sunday at the International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis meeting in Geneva. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Late-stage trials are already underway for apixaban, and the companies plan to file for U.S. approval in the second half of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Apixaban is one of several pills being developed by drug makers that block the Factor Xa protein, which plays an early role in the chemical process leading to blood clots. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Researchers hope they also can be used by patients with atrial fibrillation, or irregular heartbeat, to prevent stroke. Late-stage data on another Factor Xa drug from Bayer AG BAYG.DE were set to be presented at the meeting on Sunday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    'DISASTER WITH EXANTA' &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Excitement over Factor Xa drugs follows the downfall of Exanta, a once-promising anticoagulant from AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L) that had been associated with liver toxicity. Exanta blocked another clotting protein called thrombin. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "After the disaster with Exanta, people are really looking for new anticoagulants to fill that gap and to replace warfarin, and I think this step ... is very pleasant to see," Buller said of the apixaban clinical trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The 12-week Phase 2 study involved 520 patients who  suffered a deep vein thrombosis, which is a clot that forms most frequently deep inside the leg. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    There were three apixaban treatment groups: patients on 5 milligrams of the experimental drug twice a day; 10 mg twice a day; or 20 mg once a day. A fourth control group received an injectable anticoagulant plus warfarin or a similar drug. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The main efficacy measure involved the combined rate of incidents, including a new deep vein thrombosis or lack of improvement in the original DVT, and blood clots that progress to the lungs known as pulmonary emboli. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rates of the incidents were 6 percent for patients on 5 mg of apixaban, 5.6 percent for the 10 mg, and 2.6 percent for the 20 mg. The rate was 4.2 percent for the control group. Buller said differences among treatment groups were not clinically relevant. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The main safety measure examined bleedings, the rates of which were 8.6 percent for the 5 mg apixaban group, 4.5 percent for the 10 mg, 7.3 percent for the 20 mg, and 7.9 percent for the control group. These differences were not clinically relevant either, Buller said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    There were no adverse events, including no sign of liver toxicity, he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bristol-Myers and Pfizer agreed in April to develop and sell apixaban together. They are currently running two Phase 3 apixaban trials: one to prevent blood clots among surgical patients or those whose illness puts them at risk; a second to prevent stroke for patients with atrial fibrillation. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, editing by Brian Moss; lewis.krauskopf@reuters.com; Reuters Messaging: Lewis.Krauskopf.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6082)) Keywords: BRISTOLMYERS PFIZER/APIXABAN &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney has officially 
moved the launch date for its massively mutliplayer online game 
"Pirates of the Caribbean Online" from summer to fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The MMO, which is based on the popular amusement park ride 
and film franchise and has been in beta testing for the past 
several months, originally was scheduled to be ready closer to 
the theatrical release of "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's 
End."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement, Disney Online cited the need for additional 
development time as reason for the delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "After a careful internal assessment of the state of game 
development as well as a review of external feedback, we have 
elected to spend additional development time," the company said 
Friday. "We will use this extra time to further enhance the 
game, respond to additional data we've collected during beta 
testing and incorporate more of the input we have gathered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The MMO, which is designed as a computer game set in a 
virtual world, is an important one for Disney because it is 
deliberately geared toward a nontraditional gaming audience. 
The game incorporates community features and will provide a 
wealth of demographic information about its users. It is also 
Disney's largest effort thus far to create a virtual world 
experience as an extension of a Disney franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The game is subscription-based, but participants can play 
it a third of the way through without subscribing, although 
they will be subjected to ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Tuesday it will 
offer its new Web-delivered business software for tracking 
customers at below-market prices to catch-up with 
Salesforce.com Inc. and other competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software maker this quarter will make 
available Microsoft Dynamics Live CRM, the first version of its 
customer-relationship management software, which aims to tap 
into the fast-growing market for software delivered over the 
Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it will offer a professional version of its 
CRM Live software for a subscription fee of $44 per user per 
month although some companies will be able to get it free for 
2007. An enterprise edition will go for $59 per user per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software maker said its professional edition compares 
to a product that costs $65 to $75 per month from competitors, 
while comparable enterprise versions from its competitors cost 
about $100 per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Salesforce offers a professional version of its CRM 
software for $65 per month per user and $125 per month for its 
enterprise edition, but the company said it can't determine if 
the prices from Microsoft are comparable until it sees what 
Dynamics CRM Live offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A pioneer in the Web-based software market, Salesforce is 
fending off challenges in the CRM market, or software that lets 
businesses follow sales leads and track inventory, from larger 
rivals like Microsoft, Oracle Corp. and SAP AG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think this is a battle that will be won on price

&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, July 10 (Reuters)  - Venezuela is negotiating in
good faith to compensate ExxonMobil (XOM.N) and ConocoPhillips
(COP.N) for their recently nationalized assets, and hopes to
avoid legal arbitration, Venezuela's ambassador to the United
States said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Ambassador Bernardo Alvarez, on a goodwill trip to Texas,
said it was possible his country and the two Texas-based oil
giants would end up on good terms despite rancor over
Venezuela's taking control of their operations in the Orinoco
heavy oil belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have shown we are people of dialogue," Alvarez said.
"Nobody wants to go to arbitration."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips quit their oil operations in
Venezuela last month, after socialist President Hugo Chavez
decreed the giant oil Orinoco fields should be taken over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Four other oil majors - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N), Norway's
Statoil (STL.OL), Britain's BP Plc (BP.L) and France's Total
(TOTF.PA) -- signed pacts with Venezuela allowing the country
to take stakes of up to 83 percent in their Orinoco projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil and ConocoPhillips can negotiate compensation
from Venezuela for their lost operations or, if that fails,
take legal action that could end up in international
arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips has said it expected to take a
second-quarter charge of $4.5 billion for its Venezuelan
interests, but that their fair market value was more than that.
ExxonMobil said it had invested about $750 million in the
Orinoco belt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alvarez would not predict when the issue will be resolved,
but held out hope for a happy resolution in which the companies
and Venezuela continue doing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Maybe what you will see is a readjustment of the
relationship," he told reporters before an event at a Houston
church. "We need each other."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Venezuela is the no. 4 oil supplier to the United States,
but relations between the governments of Chavez and President
George W. Bush are openly hostile, and Chavez tussles with the
Bush administration over everything from oil prices to free
trade to definitions of democracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alvarez was to make several public appearances in Houston,
including a speech on Wednesday to the Greater Houston
Partnership, whose members includes many companies in the
energy industry.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds quotes, more background detail)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Adrian Bathgate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WELLINGTON, July 11 (Reuters) - Top world energy firm Exxon
Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) and Austria's OMV (OMVV.VI) have won the
right to lead oil and gas exploration efforts in the wild
oceans south-east of New Zealand, the government said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New Zealand awarded permits for four blocks, or about 18
percent of the Great South Basin, with exploration efforts
expected to cost nearly $1 billion over five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One permit was awarded to a consortium led by Exxon Mobil
(XOM.N) and the privately owned local explorer Todd Energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A consortium led by Austria's OMV (OMVV.VI), and including
Thailand's PTT Exploration and Production PTTE.BK and Japan's
Mitsui Exploration Production Australia Ltd (8031.T) gained
three permits. A total of five bids were received.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies were expected to spend NZ$1.2 billion ($938
million) over the next five years on exploration, Associate
Energy Minister Harry Duynhoven said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The intensity of the work proposed for the Great South
Basin is unprecedented in New Zealand's history and will
effectively double the amount of investment in oil and gas
exploration here over the next few years," Duynhoven said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government had offered a patchwork of 40 blocks, each
around 9,000 square kilometres (3,475 square miles), in the
Great South Basin, an isolated area off the bottom of the South
Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The region has proven hydrocarbon resources but has been
little explored.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Duynhoven said there had been strong interest shown in the
tender and it was possible that new explorers would come
forward as more data became available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government funded seismic exploration of the area last
year, which revealed new signs of oil and gas, and this has
been made available to bidders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A previous study of the region has estimated two of the
blocks contained up to 10 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas,
three times the size of New Zealand's biggest gas field, Maui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The hunt for new oil and gas fields has stepped up as the
ageing Maui field, off the North Island's western Taranaki
Coast, which has supplied up to 80 percent of the country's
needs, is due to run out around 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All of New Zealand's commercially producing oil and gas
fields are located in Taranaki.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Duynhoven said the whole Great South Basin may contain as
much as 10 times the Maui field's output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The potential amount of oil present is harder to estimate,
but the government expects hundreds of millions of barrels to
be present across the basin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New Zealand currently produces about 150 petajoules (143
billion cubic feet) of gas and 767,000 tonnes (about 16,000
barrels per day) of oil a year, government statistics show.
About 70 percent of the oil is exported.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Tuesday it will 
offer its new Web-delivered business software for tracking 
customers at below-market prices to catch-up with 
Salesforce.com Inc. and other competitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software maker this quarter will make 
available Microsoft Dynamics Live CRM, the first version of its 
customer-relationship management software, which aims to tap 
into the fast-growing market for software delivered over the 
Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it will offer a professional version of its 
CRM Live software for a subscription fee of $44 per user per 
month although some companies will be able to get it free for 
2007. An enterprise edition will go for $59 per user per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The software maker said its professional edition compares 
to a product that costs $65 to $75 per month from competitors, 
while comparable enterprise versions from its competitors cost 
about $100 per month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Salesforce offers a professional version of its CRM 
software for $65 per month per user and $125 per month for its 
enterprise edition, but the company said it can't determine if 
the prices from Microsoft are comparable until it sees what 
Dynamics CRM Live offers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A pioneer in the Web-based software market, Salesforce is 
fending off challenges in the CRM market, or software that lets 
businesses follow sales leads and track inventory, from larger 
rivals like Microsoft, Oracle Corp. and SAP AG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think this is a battle that will be won on price 
alone," said Bruce Francis, a spokesman for Salesforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The latest version of Microsoft's Dynamics CRM software,

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds new details throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) expects
high oil and gas prices, strong refining margins and a large
gain from the sale of its stake in Dynegy Inc. (DYN.N) to help
second-quarter earnings, the second-largest U.S. oil company
said on Tuesday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expect the company to post earnings
of around $2.17 a share, up from $2.10 a share last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said the price it received for oil in the first
two months of the quarter rose both domestically and
internationally compared with the first quarter. Still,
Chevron's prices declined from year earlier levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron also said it will take a $680 million gain from its
sale of its 12 percent interest in power company Dynegy, offset
somewhat by charges of $160 million from the redemption of
bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Production for the first two months of the second quarter
also rose slightly from first-quarter levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total production in April and May was about 2.66 million
barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd), up from about 2.64
million boepd in the first quarter. Last year, the company
produced about 2.67 million boepd in the second quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has said it expects 2007 production to average
about 2.6 million boepd, down about 70,000 boepd from last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; During April and May, Chevron said its average realized
price for a barrel of oil in the United States was $57.62, up
form $51.60 in the first quarter. The company received $62.30
per barrel of oil in the United States in the second quarter of
last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its international price for hydrocarbon liquids rose to
$59.92 per barrel from $51.15 a barrel in the first quarter.
The company received $62.24 per barrel of hydrocarbon liquids
outside the United States in the second quarter of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. natural gas prices rose 2.5 percent from the first
quarter and were up about 11.4 percent from the year-earlier
quarter. International natural gas prices fell about 4 percent
from the previous quarter and 3 percent from the first quarter
of 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Benchmark refining margins were much higher in the second
quarter than in the first quarter of 2007 and were also up from
the year-earlier quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron did not fully benefit from margin increases on the
U.S. West Coast due to scheduled maintenance at its El Segundo,
Calif., refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Its international refining margins were also lower than
market indicators would suggest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said international upstream results are
expected to include about $100 million for write-offs from
exploratory wells and other assets. Downstream results for the
quarter will include over $50 million of environmental
charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares closed down 50 cents at $89 on the New York
Stock Exchange on Tuesday.

(EMC.N) said on Tuesday they have formed an alliance to develop technology for protecting and sharing sensitive government information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The technology, called the Secure Information Sharing Architecture or SISA, will allow government agencies to better communicate while protecting content from being lost or stolen, the companies said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Technology to protect information has historically been enforced system-by-system, the companies said. SISA will allow agencies to set up networks that enable users of different computer systems to access the same information. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    An example is data on pandemics, which is stored by different agencies and by the private sector, Cisco, EMC and Microsoft said in a statement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The partners are providing the core commercial off-the-shelf technology for the project, they said. Cost estimates were not disclosed.  Three other companies in the alliance are Liquid Machines, Swan Island Networks Inc. and Canada's Titus Labs.

&lt;p&gt;The shares will be a "relative safe haven" during the next couple of quarters due to strong long-term fundamentals driven by mid-single-digit revenue growth in the lawn and garden category and Scotts' leading scale and brand equity positions, according to the JP Morgan research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The upgrade came a day after Scotts lowered its yearly earnings outlook, which "mainly reflects unfavorable April weather, given a sharp 19 percent April decline in consumer purchases," JP Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scotts shares were up 5.32 percent, or $2.25, at $44.51 during morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 10 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded General
Motors Corp. (GM.N) and Ford Motor Co. (F.N) to its top rating,
saying a possible contract renewal with United Auto Workers
(UAW) union would add to both the automakers' earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; General Motors went to "overweight" from "neutral", while
Ford jumped to its new rating from "underweight."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, in its base case scenario, expects the
possible UAW contract renewal, which includes savings from the
set up of a healthcare fund, to add $1.86 a share in earnings
for General Motors and 38 cents a share for Ford.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The base case scenario assumes savings from a
Goodyear-style healthcare deal, competitive operating
agreements, the elimination of 'jobs bank' and cuts in active
healthcare costs, analysts Himanshu Patel and Ranjit Unnithan
wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Detroit automakers and UAW are examining a plan that
would shift to the union the responsibility for tens of
billions of dollars in retiree health-care liabilities, similar
to a trust Goodyear Tire  Rubber Co. GT.N and the United
Steelworkers union plan to set up this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage said it is likely that the costs of the 'jobs
bank' -- a program that guarantees nearly full wages and
benefits when the automaker cuts work or closes factories --
are largely eliminated during the 2007 contract talks with the
UAW.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage believes the bank costs General Motors about
$250 million a year pretax and Ford about $700 million a year
pretax.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan sees a further 79 cents in potential earnings per
share upside at General Motors and 12 cents a share at Ford if
the companies win Tier 2 wage agreements and if the Seasonally
Adjusted Annual Rate (SAAR) of sales improves 3 percent over
current levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SAAR is a key measure of the industry's overall sales
trend. The current estimates for U.S. light vehicle SAAR are
about 16.3 million, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of General Motors were trading up about 1.5 percent
at $37.31, while Ford shares were up more than a percent at
$9.19 in early morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange.

"We will use this extra time to further enhance the game, respond to additional data we've collected during beta testing and incorporate more of the input we have gathered."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The MMO, which is designed as a computer game set in a virtual world, is an important one for Disney because it is deliberately geared toward a nontraditional gaming audience. The game incorporates community features and will provide a wealth of demographic information about its users. It is also Disney's largest effort thus far to create a virtual world experience as an extension of a Disney franchise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The game is subscription-based, but participants can play it a third of the way through without subscribing, although they will be subjected to ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    (Adds Apple declining comment, analyst comment) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 9 (Reuters) - Apple Inc. (AAPL.O) plans to launch a cheaper version of the iPhone in the fourth quarter that could be based on the ultra-slim iPod Nano music player, according to a JP Morgan report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Kevin Chang, a JP Morgan analyst based in Taiwan, cited people in the supply channel he did not name and an application with the U.S Patent and Trademark office for his report dated July 8. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Apple filed a patent application document dated July 5 that refers to a multifunctional handheld device with a circular touch pad control, similar to the Nano's scroll wheel. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Apple spokeswoman Natalie Kerris declined comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Long lines of people turned out on June 29 when U.S. sales began for the iPhone, a mobile phone with a music player and Web browser. Analysts have estimated that sales in the first weekend were as high as 700,000 units. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Chang said a way to follow up the iPhone with a cheaper version would be to convert the Nano into a phone and price it at $300 or lower. The iPhone sells for $500 and $600, depending on storage space. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe that iPod Nano will be converted into a phone because it's probably the only way for Apple to launch a lower end phone without severely cannibalizing iPod Nano," he said noting that the new phone could have "rather limited functionality." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Another analyst Gene Munster of Piper Jaffray said he expects Apple to bring out iPods that resemble iPhone, which features such as a touch-sensitive screen, later this year. Such products would help stop iPhone eating into iPod sales. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We believe the iPhone reveals much of what the iPod will soon be," Munster said in a note to clients, "iPods with some of the touchscreen features of the iPhone should lessen the impact of cannibalization." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Kerris also declined comment on Munster's note. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Because of the anticipated lower price for the Nano-based phone, 2008 sales of 30 million to 40 million units "is achievable," according to JP Morgan's Chang. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This would be a much larger volume than is expected of the first iPhone, Apple has targeted sales of 10 million units in 2008, which would give it a 1 percent share of the global  market.    Sales of the iPhone are expected to be limited to a small percentage of the market due to its high price tag, particularly in the United States where 85 percent of consumers tend to spend $100 or less on cell phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But analysts forecast that a cheaper phone from Apple, which leads the digital music player market, could pose a much bigger threat to long-established phone makers such as Nokia (NOK1V.HE), Motorola Inc MOT.N, Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS) and Sony Ericsson, owned by Sony Corp (6758.T) and Ericsson (ERICb.ST). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Taiwan's Catcher Technology (2474.TW) will be the "major source of metal casing" for the new phone, according to Chang, who cited an unidentified channel source. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Revenue from Apple could represent T$6 billion ($183 million) to T$8 billion ($244 million) revenue for Catcher in 2008, Chang estimated. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Apple shares closed down $1.97, or 1.5 percent, at $130.33 in on Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (US$=T$32.8) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Sinead Carew.

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Microsoft Corp. 
announced the addition of Walt Disney Co. films to the Xbox 
360's download service, Xbox Live, on Tuesday night at the 
opening news conference for the E3 Media and Business Summit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney joins the ranks of Warner Bros. Home Entertainment, 
Paramount Pictures and Lionsgate among studios contributing 
high-definition titles to the fast-growing platform. Among the 
35 titles that will be made available beginning Tuesday are 
"Bridge to Terabithia," "The Queen" and "Deja Vu."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a big endorsement for us," Robbie Bach, president 
of the entertainment and devices division at Microsoft, said in 
a interview preceding the news conference. "With this partner, 
we have 28 TV and movie studios on Xbox Live."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Xbox still has some catching up to do in the Disney 
department compared with Apple's iTunes, which has a broader 
array of Disney films on tap as well as bigger titles, 
including "Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End." That 
might have something to do with tight ties between Apple and 
Disney's Pixar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bach reported robust numbers for Xbox Live, which recently 
surpassed 7 million members. He projected reaching 10 million 
by this time next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Contrary to expectations that Microsoft would lower the 
price of Xbox in response to a similar move made this week by 
Sony Corp. for its PlayStation 3 console, Bach did not announce 
such a move but didn't rule it out as an option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "July is the worst month to do something like that," he 
said. "It's the slowest time in every market in the world. 
We'll decide what we'll do in the future when we get there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bach sought to bolster Xbox's image in the wake of a 
disclosure this week that Microsoft would spend more than $1 
billion to repair technical problems experienced by some owners 
of the console as well as extend warranties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He noted that 11.6 million Xbox 360 consoles have been 
sold, 5.6 million in the U.S. In addition, Bach said that Xbox 
owners buy more games per console than owners of Nintendo or 
Sony devices. "When you look at the dollars spent on the 
consoles, we're dramatically ahead of our individual 
competitors," he said. "That's important for the marketplace 
because more publishers will want to develop more games."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bach also touted Xbox's competitive advantage for the 2007 
holiday season, noting that Microsoft will have the only 
console that can service the probable three biggest sellers out 
at that time: "Halo 3," "Madden NFL 08" and "Grand Theft Auto&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IV."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think we have the best lineup of games in history," 
Bach said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Xbox has established itself as a console of choice 
for hardcore gamers, Bach signaled that Microsoft will take 
several steps to make it more accessible to a broader audience, 
including a set of new casual games for Xbox Live Arcade and a 
deal with DVD game brand Scene It? that will bring a customized 
new controller to the console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK (Billboard) - Legendary Irish band the Pogues will 
be touring North America later this fall, but without guitarist 
Philip Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; According to the band's official Web site 
(www.pogues.com), Chevron, who wrote the band's hit 
"Thousands Are Sailing," was diagnosed in early June with 
"locally advanced" throat cancer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This decision to suspend his live work has the complete 
support of the other Pogues who wish him a good and complete 
recovery," a statement on the site says. "Though it is not yet 
known when Chevron will return to live work, it is hoped that 
he will again be available towards the end of this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tickets for the Pogues' fall West Coast dates go on sale 
this week. The tour begins in Seattle on October 17, with 
visits to San Francisco, San Diego, Anaheim, Calif., Los 
Angeles and Las Vegas planned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group also has a handful of U.K. shows on tap in August 
and September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Billboard&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Faced with a protracted sales slump, U.S. record labels are tapping into the tween scene after Walt Disney Co became the unlikely hitmaker of the year with chart toppers like "Hannah Montana" and "High School Musical."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"A lot of entertainment companies are trying to figure out how to replicate Disney's formula and crack the tween code since it's one of the market's few sweet spots," said entertainment lawyer Fred Goldring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After mostly ignoring tweens, kids between the ages of 6 and 12, music labels from Sony BMG Music to Warner Music Group and EMI Group Plc are signing or distributing tween acts. Many are trying to leverage these acts with TV deals to match Disney's success, people in the industry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I predict in the next 12 months, you'll see a lot of these companies chasing the tween market, and I think they'll do it pretty well," said Goldring, noting that tweens and their parents are among the consumers still buying CDs at a time when many music fans are increasingly downloading songs from online stores like Apple Inc.'s iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tweens overall spend about $51 billion a year in the United States, while family members spend another $170 billion on them, according to Alloy Media + Marketing. Getting a piece of this pie would help the U.S. music industry, which has seen annual sales drop 21.2 percent since 1999 to about $11.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Disney is a tough act to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'd be surprised if labels don't try, but they don't have the multiple platforms," said David Agnew, general manager of Disney Music Group.

"Parents buy these records for their kids and a lot of it has to do with the nag factor," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strategy has spawned hits like TV movie "High School Musical," which produced the top-selling CD of 2006 and the "Hannah Montana" series about a schoolgirl who has a secret nocturnal existence as a famous musician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, 14-year-old Miley Cyrus, star of "Hannah Montana", became the youngest artist to have two No. 1 albums on U.S. charts within a year. Disney this week released another new CD by sister duo Aly  AJ, another Disney Channel staple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's an incredible future with tween music," said Deb Klein, general manager for independent label Firm Music, who signed a still unnamed tween duo -- two sisters ages 11 and 13 -- to a multi-platform deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll have enough material to release an album in the fall, but we're trying to air a pilot as well," Klein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMI will distribute the duo's music and has also distributed Disney's tween repertoire overseas with massive success, EMI spokeswoman Jeanne Meyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arista said it has already had two radio hits with Paula DeAnda, who was signed at age 16 last year by music mogul Clive Davis. Arista is part of Sony BMG, a Sony Corp joint venture with Bertelsmann AG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The teen audience is an incredibly reactive audience with disposable income that has to be served," said Scott Seviour, senior vice president marketing for Arista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're in a unique time in the business.

&lt;p&gt;SANTA MONICA, California (Reuters) - After years of arguing whose video game machine has the best bells and whistles, Sony Corp. (6758.T) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) agree the battle boils down to which has the best games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sony is scheduled to hold a media briefing on Wednesday morning expected to focus on new games for its PS3 game machine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tonight, we let the games talk," Peter Moore, Microsoft's vice president of interactive entertainment, said Tuesday night, at the end of an event tied to the E3 video game show, the industry's most important event, which officially kicks off on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a year and a half after Microsoft introduced its 360 machine, developers are only starting to regularly roll out franchise titles that can make a game system a must-have. Some games are exclusive to one machine, while others are cross platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony cut the price tag for its PS3 by 17 percent on Monday, which leaves the two machines comparably priced -- and Microsoft has said it will not drop its own price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The PS3's new price tag of $500 is just $20 more than the most expensive Xbox, the elite model with a 120-gigabyte hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Sony announced a year ago the $600 price for the PS3, gamers howled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost and lack of must-have games has kept many consumers away from the PS3 despite Sony's insistence that the price was reasonable, considering the machine has supercomputer processor, a 60-gigabyte hard drive, and a Blu-ray high-definition DVD player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With one of the fastest price cuts in video game history, Sony admitted its bet on the high-definition DVD and extra features has not paid off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, killer games could make it a formidable antagonist for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If all we had was a price move, then we should have held that until our E3 press conference," Jack Tretton, head of Sony Computer Entertainment America, told Reuters last week. "But really, we've gotten that out front, and while we think it's substantial, we think the real news is the games."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SONY TRAILS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although it was the dominant player in the previous generation console battle, Sony trailed Microsoft coming to market and in sales this round.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it had shipped 11.6 million consoles worldwide by the end of June, missing its target of 12 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, Microsoft has sold about 5.6 million consoles, compared with 2.8 million for Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974.OS Wii, and 1.4 million for the PS3, according to data from NPD, a market data firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's highly anticipated games -- "Halo 3," "Grand Theft Auto IV" from Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO.O) and "Madden 08" football from Electronic Arts Inc. ERTS.O -- are all due out this year for the Xbox 360.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Games cost as much as $20 million to develop, and many publishers wait for machine sales to ramp up in order to insure they have a critical mass of buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All the positioning over price may be moot until the consoles fall to $200 or so. That's the magic point at which past console sales have exploded beyond the hard-core gamers into the mass market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Where these boxes get interesting is, 80 percent of all consoles sold are $199 or cheaper.

&lt;p&gt;SANTA MONICA, California (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Tuesday it will hold firm on pricing for its Xbox 360 game console, defying widespread expectations that it would respond to a price cut by rival Sony Corp. (6758.T) for the PlayStation 3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, Microsoft voiced confidence that a slate of upcoming titles targeting both hardcore and casual gamers would be strong enough to give it the lion's share of consumer dollars in the coming months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have no desire, no need, to react to anything the competition has done," Shane Kim, head of Microsoft Games Studios, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel really great about the Xbox 360 momentum right now. Customers are voting with their wallets, it's not just about console units. We feel great about how we're doing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Sony cut the price of the PlayStation 3, which competes against the Xbox 360, by $100, or 17 percent, in the United States in an effort to boost flagging sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means the machine, which has a 60-gigabyte hard drive and Blu-ray high-definition DVD player, costs $500, or $20 more than the high-end Xbox 360 Elite that has a 120-gigabyte hard drive but no built-in high-definition DVD player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also has a "premium" Xbox 360 with a 20-gigabyte hard drive that sells for $400, and a "core" version with no hard drive that costs $300.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony's cut also came days after Microsoft said the number of broken Xbox 360s was "unacceptable" and that it would book a charge of up to $1.15 billion for repairs and warranty extensions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also said it had shipped 11.6 million consoles worldwide by the end of June, missing its target of 12 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the United States, Microsoft has sold about 5.8 million consoles, compared to 2.8 million for Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974.OS Wii and 1.4 million for the PS3, according to data from NPD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim said the decision not to cut prices was unrelated to Microsoft's goal of making the Xbox business profitable in its 2008 fiscal year, which just started.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since launching the original Xbox in late 2001, Microsoft has spent billions of dollars fighting Sony's dominance in the industry yet has shown little, if any, profit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really not about meeting the profitability goals. We feel very confident that we'll meet the profit goals with our strategy that is already in place," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim pointed to a line-up of games coming out later this year, including Microsoft's highly anticipated "Halo 3," "Grand Theft Auto IV" from Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. (TTWO.O) and "Madden 08" football from Electronic Arts Inc. ERTS.O.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This year, that perfect storm arrives again," Kim said. "And the Xbox 360 is the only platform you'll be able to play all three of those titles on."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also hopes to attract more casual gamers with two new casual games for later this year. One is a multiplayer "party game" based on its "Viva Pinata" franchise, and the other is based on the movie trivia board game "Scene It?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo's Wii has outsold the Xbox 360 and PS3 this year due to a design and price aimed at drawing in casual gamers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kim also said the Xbox Live online service, which allows players to compete online and download movies and games, had 7 million users and would expand to 10 million in one year. He said The Walt Disney Co. (DIS.N) would start making some of its movies available on the service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Xbox Live continues to just be a huge boulder rolling downhill that is gathering momentum," Kim said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BANGKOK, July 11 (Reuters) - Thailand is likely to extend
offshore gas rights held by Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and PTT
Exploration  Production PCL PTTE.BK by 10 years to 2022, a
senior Energy Ministry official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Petroleum Board had approved requests from Chevron and
PTTEP to continue operating their separate fields in the Gulf
of Thailand after the concessions expire in 2012, Krairit
Nilkuha told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The extensions needed final approval from the cabinet,
which could take several weeks, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In return, Chevron would have to invest another $8 billion
in the Erawan field to raise production to 1,240 million cubic
feet per day (mcfpd) from 740 mcfpd and sell it to state-run
PTT PCL (PTT.BK), Krairit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron would have to pay the government $750 million in
fees for the field, which began producing gas in 1981 and was
operated by Unocal until it was acquired by Chevron in 2005, he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PTTEP, part of a consortium that includes France's Total
(TOTF.PA) and BG Group (BG.L), would have to invest another $2
billion in the Bongkot field to maintain its production at 630
mcfpd to be sold to its parent PTT, Krairit said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PTTEP would have to pay the government up to $500 mllion in
fees, he said.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  (Adds Ranbaxy comment, share activity) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 10 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) said on Tuesday that it had won a patent case over its Lipitor drug in an Irish court, which ruled a patent protecting the blockbuster cholesterol fighter would be infringed by a competing product from India's Ranbaxy Laboratories Ltd. (RANB.BO) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The decision by the High Court in Dublin prevents Ranbaxy from launching its drug before the basic Lipitor patent expires in November 2011, Pfizer said.    A Ranbaxy spokesman said the company would appeal the ruling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Lipitor is the world's top-selling drug and amounted to more than one-fourth of Pfizer's $48 billion in revenue last year. The company has been defending its intellectual property for the drug around the world against generic drugmaker Ranbaxy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, the world's largest drugmaker, also is trying to protect Lipitor's market share against an influx of inexpensive generic versions of other cholesterol medicines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer shares were off 10 cents at $25.78 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  (Additional reporting by Himangshu Watts in Mumbai) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  ((Reporting by Lewis Krauskopf, editing by Dave Zimmerman; Reuters Messaging: Lewis.Krauskopf.reuters.com@reuters.net; lewis.krauskopf@reuters.com; 646-223-6082)) Keywords: PFIZER LIPITOR/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Intent on becoming a major player in the gaming industry, Disney Interactive on Thursday used the E3 Media  Business Summit in Santa Monica, California, to unveil a slate of games aimed at the family audience and traditional gamers and also announced DGamer, a connected community for the Nintendo DS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney Interactive Studios general manager and executive VP Graham Hopper stressed the company's commitment to video games by noting that it will spend $130 million on product development this year alone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the event's highlights was DGamer. Using the wireless WiFi connection in the DS portable system, DGamer will enable owners of Disney Interactive DS games to interact with one another worldwide. It will debut in May with the DS version of "The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Interactive has had success leveraging hot properties from its parent company and will continue that trend with "High School Musical: Sing It!" for the Nintendo Wii, "Hannah Montana: World Tour" for the Nintendo Wii and "Hannah Montana: Music Jam" for the Nintendo DS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also showcased a new version of "Turok," a franchise popular with hardcore players more than a decade ago. Developed by Disney Interactive's Propaganda Studios, "Turok" will be released early next year for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 under the Touchstone game label because it is aimed at an older audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Interactive this week also added a fifth development studio by acquiring Austin,Texas-based Junction Point Studios, led by legendary developer Warren Spector. The studio already is working on a project and also will help bring some of Disney's more traditional franchises to the newer gaming platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Faced with a protracted sales 
slump, U.S. record labels are tapping into the tween scene 
after Walt Disney Co became the unlikely hitmaker of the year 
with chart toppers like "Hannah Montana" and "High School 
Musical."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "A lot of entertainment companies are trying to figure out 
how to replicate Disney's formula and crack the tween code 
since it's one of the market's few sweet spots," said 
entertainment lawyer Fred Goldring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After mostly ignoring tweens, kids between the ages of 6 
and 12, music labels from Sony BMG Music to Warner Music Group 
and EMI Group Plc are signing or distributing tween acts. Many 
are trying to leverage these acts with TV deals to match 
Disney's success, people in the industry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I predict in the next 12 months, you'll see a lot of these 
companies chasing the tween market, and I think they'll do it 
pretty well," said Goldring, noting that tweens and their 
parents are among the consumers still buying CDs at a time when 
many music fans are increasingly downloading songs from online 
stores like Apple Inc.'s iTunes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tweens overall spend about $51 billion a year in the United 
States, while family members spend another $170 billion on 
them, according to Alloy Media + Marketing. Getting a piece of 
this pie would help the U.S. music industry, which has seen 
annual sales drop 21.2 percent since 1999 to about $11.5 
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Disney is a tough act to follow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I'd be surprised if labels don't try, but they don't have 
the multiple platforms," said David Agnew, general manager of 
Disney Music Group. "Disney Channel has been an incredible 
incubator and that's something our competitors may never have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Television network Disney Channel features a near-constant 
flow of videos that promote its stars to its tween audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Disney Channel is a real marketing juggernaut," Goldring 
said. "Parents buy these records for their kids and a lot of it 
has to do with the nag factor," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategy has spawned hits like TV movie "High School 
Musical," which produced the top-selling CD of 2006 and the 
"Hannah Montana" series about a schoolgirl who has a secret 
nocturnal existence as a famous musician.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, 14-year-old Miley Cyrus, star of "Hannah 
Montana," became the youngest artist to have two No. 1 albums 
on U.S. charts within a year. Disney this week released another 
new CD by sister duo Aly  AJ, another Disney Channel staple.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There's an incredible future with tween music," said Deb 
Klein, general manager for independent label Firm Music, who 
signed a still unnamed tween duo -- two sisters ages 11 and 13 
-- to a multi-platform deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'll have enough material to release an album in the 
fall, but we're trying to air a pilot as well," Klein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EMI will distribute the duo's music and has also 
distributed Disney's tween repertoire overseas with massive 
success, EMI spokeswoman Jeanne Meyer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Arista said it has already had two radio hits with Paula 
DeAnda, who was signed at age 16 last year by music mogul Clive 
Davis. Arista is part of Sony BMG, a Sony Corp joint venture 
with Bertelsmann AG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The teen audience is an incredibly reactive audience with 
disposable income that has to be served," said Scott Seviour, 
senior vice president marketing for Arista.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're in a unique time in the business. Paula could 
transcend into movies and TV, but you also have to be careful 
of overexposure," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sony will also release this fall the soundtrack to the 
"Naked Brothers Band," a Viacom Inc Nickelodeon series that 
follows the ups and downs of a kids' rock band.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Warner Music Group Corp signed "High School Musical" 
co-star Ashley Tisdale in a move an executive said signaled a 
change from the label's usual vision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At one time, our promotion guys had a hard time getting 
mainstream radio to pay attention to the tween acts, but now 
they realize it's not just kiddy stuff," said Disney's Agnew.&lt;/p&gt;

Kevin Chang, an analyst covering telecom equipment for JPMorgan in Taiwan, issued a report on July 8 saying Apple may introduce a phone in the fourth quarter that is inspired by the design of its ultra-slim nano music players and is half as expensive as its $600 iPhone, launched on June 29. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But a day later, Bill Shope, a U.S. analyst who covers Apple for JPMorgan, followed with a note to clients that contradicted virtually everything his colleague had said and questioned the sources Chang used for his take on Apple product plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Rather than bring out a low-end version of the iPhone any time soon, Shope said, Apple would likely make its next phone a more sophisticated device with high-speed cellular Internet connections, a feature missing from the current iPhone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Asked about the conflicting reports, Brian Marchiony, a U.S. spokesman for JPMorgan, said Shope "holds JPMorgan's official view of Apple's stock." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Chang declined comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On Tuesday, Apple shares rose as much as 3.2 percent following the report. The stock closed 0.03 percent higher at US$132.39 on Wednesday, underperforming the U.S. Dow Jones index's .DJI 0.56 percent rise. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    While Shope said the eventual introduction of a cheaper iPhone is "inevitable," he described the prospects for a near-term launch as "unusual and highly risky." He also dismissed Chang's assertion that Apple could convert its nanos to phones. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We struggle to understand why Apple would abandon one of its most successful product lines with a carrier-centric low-end phone," Shope said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He also questioned his colleague's sourcing, saying "the majority of Mr. Chang's assumptions on the form factor and functionality of the 'nano phone'" were derived from a patent filing that gave little information on actual products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shope said he was unable to independently confirm Chang's reference to unnamed "channel checks" even as he said the channel checks -- supply-chain sources -- were "very interesting and worth further monitoring." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Another investment bank, Goldman Sachs, weighed in on the debate by saying on Wednesday that it was unlikely a nano iPhone was in the works at Apple. Even if there was one, the product is more likely to be launched next year or the year after. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   (Additional reporting by Sheena Lee in Taipei) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Sinead Carew, editing by Gary Hill; email: sinead.carew@reuters.com; +1 646-223-6186)) Keywords: APPLE JPMORGAN/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 12 (Reuters) - Bernstein Research raised its price
target on International Business Machines Corp. (IBM.N) to $125
from $120, and said it expects IBM to deliver relatively
in-line results, with some upside potential to revenue and
earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, which has an "outperform" rating on the
stock, said IBM was attractively valued at current levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the brokerage forecast hardware revenue to be down
slightly, and said there was a U.S. corporate spending
hesitancy towards high-end hardware purchases, in addition to
the declining gaming volumes.

&lt;p&gt; (Changes source, adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 12 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities raised two
defence contractors and downgraded another, saying earnings
growth in the defence sector should remain strong in 2008 and
2009 but weak growth in the years beyond and political
headwinds could limit returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan upgraded Raytheon Co. (RTN.N) to "overweight"
from "neutral" and said it expects the company to use a growing
cash balance to implement more aggressive share buybacks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also upgraded Lockheed Martin Corp. (LMT.N)
to "neutral" from "underweight," saying even though investors
might focus on slow growth due to declining revenue in
aeronautics in 2007 and 2008, the outlook improves in 2009 and
2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Northrop Grumman Corp. (NOC.N) was downgraded to "neutral"
from "overweight" and the brokerage said the stock's strong
performance had substantially narrowed the discount at which it
trades to peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; General Dynamics Corp. (GD.N) remained its top pick among
defence primes, followed by Raytheon, the brokerage added.

&lt;p&gt;SANTA MONICA, California (Reuters) - After years of arguing over whose video game machine has the best bells and whistles, Sony Corp. (6758.T) and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) agree the battle boils down to which one has the best games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The (game) lineup is critical this holiday because it's the first time all three consoles will be in unconstrained supply at retail," Peter Moore, Microsoft's vice president of interactive entertainment, said in an interview at the E3 video game show, the industry's most important event, which officially kicked off on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a year and a half after Microsoft introduced its Xbox 360 and eight months after Sony and Nintendo introduced their next-generation consoles, the PlayStation 3 and Wii, developers are only just starting to regularly roll out the franchise titles that can make a game system a must-have. Some games are exclusive to one machine, while others are cross platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony cut the price tag for its PS3 by 17 percent on Monday, leaving it comparably priced to the Xbox 360. Many expected Microsoft to follow suit with a price cut on the 360, but the company on Tuesday held firm on the console's pricing for now.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new PS3 price tag of $500 is just $20 more than the priciest Xbox, which has a 120-gigabyte hard drive. When Sony announced a year ago the PS3's $600 price tag, gamers howled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost and lack of must-have games put many consumers off the PS3 despite Sony's insistence that the price was fair, considering it has a supercomputer processor, a 60-gigabyte hard drive and a Blu-ray high-definition DVD player.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With one of the fastest price cuts in video game history, Sony admitted its bet on the extra features had not paid off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, great games could make it a formidable antagonist for Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If all we had was a price move, then we should have held that until our E3 press conference," Jack Tretton, head of Sony Computer Entertainment America, told Reuters last week.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes from Arista executive) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Sue Zeidler &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    LOS ANGELES, July 11 (Reuters) - Faced with a protracted sales slump, U.S. record labels are tapping into the tween scene after Walt Disney Co(DIS.N) became the unlikely hitmaker of the year with chart toppers like "Hannah Montana" and "High School Musical." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "A lot of entertainment companies are trying to figure out how to replicate Disney's formula and crack the tween code since it's one of the market's few sweet spots," said entertainment lawyer Fred Goldring. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    After mostly ignoring tweens, kids between the ages of 6 and 12, music labels from Sony BMG Music to Warner Music Group WMG.N and EMI Group Plc EMI.L are signing or distributing tween acts. Many are trying to leverage these acts with TV deals to match Disney's success, people in the industry said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I predict in the next 12 months, you'll see a lot of these companies chasing the tween market, and I think they'll do it pretty well," said Goldring, noting that tweens and their parents are among the consumers still buying CDs at a time when many music fans are increasingly downloading songs from online stores like Apple Inc.'s (AAPL.O) iTunes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tweens overall spend about $51 billion a year in the United States, while family members spend another $170 billion on them, according to Alloy Media + Marketing. Getting a piece of this pie would help the U.S. music industry, which has seen annual sales drop 21.2 percent since 1999 to about $11.5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But Disney is a tough act to follow. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "I'd be surprised if labels don't try, but they don't have the multiple platforms," said David Agnew, general manager of Disney Music Group. "Disney Channel has been an incredible incubator and that's something our competitors may never have." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Television network Disney Channel features a near-constant flow of videos that promote its stars to its tween audience. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Disney Channel is a real marketing juggernaut," Goldring said. "Parents buy these records for their kids and a lot of it has to do with the nag factor," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The strategy has spawned hits like TV movie "High School Musical," which produced the top-selling CD of 2006 and the "Hannah Montana" series about a schoolgirl who has a secret nocturnal existence as a famous musician. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last week, 14-year-old Miley Cyrus, star of "Hannah Montana", became the youngest artist to have two No. 1 albums on U.S. charts within a year. Disney this week released another new CD by sister duo Aly &amp; AJ, another Disney Channel staple. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "There's an incredible future with tween music," said Deb Klein, general manager for independent label Firm Music, who signed a still unnamed tween duo -- two sisters ages 11 and 13 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- to a multi-platform deal. -- to a multi-platform deal. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We'll have enough material to release an album in the fall, but we're trying to air a pilot as well," Klein said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    EMI will distribute the duo's music and has also distributed Disney's tween repertoire overseas with massive success, EMI spokeswoman Jeanne Meyer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Arista said it has already had two radio hits with Paula DeAnda, who was signed at age 16 last year by music mogul Clive Davis. Arista is part of Sony BMG, a Sony Corp(6758.T) joint venture with Bertelsmann AG BERT.UL. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The teen audience is an incredibly reactive audience with disposable income that has to be served," said Scott Seviour, senior vice president marketing for Arista. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We're in a unique time in the business. Paula could transcend into movies and TV, but you also have to be careful of overexposure," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sony will also release this fall the soundtrack to the "Naked Brothers Band," a Viacom IncVIAb.N Nickelodeon series that follows the ups and downs of a kids' rock band. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Warner Music Group CorpWMG.N signed "High School Musical" co-star Ashley Tisdale in a move an executive said signaled a change from the label's usual vision. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "At one time, our promotion guys had a hard time getting mainstream radio to pay attention to the tween acts, but now they realize it's not just kiddy stuff," said Disney's Agnew. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Sue Zeidler, editing by Toni Reinhold; Reuters Messaging: susan.zeidler.reuters.com@reuters.net; e-mail: susan.zeidler@reuters.com; Tel +213-955-6748)) Keywords: MUSIC TWEEN  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds detail, byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Sumeet Chatterjee &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    BANGALORE, July 13 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) aims to grab more outsourcing deals from Indian telecoms companies and is in talks with the Indian unit of Vodafone Plc (VOD.L), a senior official said on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    India is the world's fastest growing mobile market, adding more than 6 million users a month, and telecoms companies are stepping up investment on technology. India had 130.6 million mobile subscribers on the popular GSM platform at end-May. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "My feeling is that in the next 18 months, at least two more operators should be settling for outsourcing," Vivek Gupta, director of communications sector at IBM India and South Asia, told Reuters in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We would be extremely disappointed if we are not the key player there. From my perspective, I want to grab 100 percent of the business." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    International Business Machines Corp. of Armonk, New York, is in talks with unlisted Hutchison Essar Ltd., in which British phone firm Vodafone bought a controlling stake this year, for an outsourcing deal, Gupta said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He did not give details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Last year, Vodafone outsourced key IT functions to IBM, the world's largest technology services company, and Electronic Data Systems Corp. EDS.N. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM, which employs 53,000 staff in India that accounts for 16 percent of its global workforce and makes it the company's second-largest operation after the United States, has been winning large telecoms outsourcing deals in India. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In March, India's fifth-largest mobile phone firm, Idea Cellular Ltd. (IDEA.BO), signed a 10-year pact to outsource some of its operations like managing IT infrastructure and billing services to IBM in a deal valued at up to $800 million. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On Thursday, IBM said it had signed another 10-year deal worth $53 million with Idea for an interactive voice response transformation project. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM had signed a 10-year, $750 million, deal in 2004 with top mobile services firm Bharti Airtel (BRTI.BO) to manage its IT infrastructure. It is now estimated to have gone up to about $1.5 billion due to robust growth in Bharti's subscriber and revenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Telecom is a very fast growing market in India and this is bringing in enormous opportunity... Our intent is to grow outsourcing business in India with rest of the telcos also," said Gupta. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Since the market visibility is very high (and) customers are giving very good reference about us, I think we should be increasing our market dominance for India much more in future." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM's business in India grew 37 percent in 2006, making it the company's fastest-growing country operation, as telecoms, banks and government departments ramped up spending on computer hardware and services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Ranjit Gangadharan; Reuters Messaging: sumeet.chatterjee.reuters.com@reuters.net; +91-80-3982 7450)) Keywords: IBM INDIA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE, July 13 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) aims to grab more outsourcing deals from Indian telecoms companies and is in talks with the Indian unit of Vodafone Plc (VOD.L), a senior official said on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    India is the world's fastest growing mobile market, adding more than 6 million users a month, and telecoms companies are stepping up investment on technology.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "My feeling is that in the next 18 months, at least two more operators should be settling for outsourcing," Vivek Gupta, director of communications sector at IBM India and South Asia, told Reuters in an interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We would be extremely disappointed if we are not the key player there. From my perspective, I want to grab 100 percent of the business."  International Business Machines Corp. of Armonk, New York, is in talks with unlisted Hutchison Essar Ltd., in which British phone firm Vodafone bought a controlling stake this year, for an outsourcing deal, Gupta said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    He did not give details. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Sumeet Chatterjee, editing by Ranjit Gangadharan; Reuters Messaging: sumeet.chatterjee.reuters.com@reuters.net; +91-80-3982 7450)) Keywords: IBM INDIA/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, July 15 (Reuters) - Mexican entertainment
company Grupo Televisa must share programming with other
television stations as a condition for buying a stake in cable
company Cablemas, anti-trust body CFC said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX), which is trying to buy a 49
percent stake in Cablemas, has 90 days to comply with the
ruling, the Mexican competition commission said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We guarantee Televisa will soon offer equal access to its
content and networks," said commission head Eduardo Perez
Motta. "With this we make sure consumers have the best number
of options with open TV and the best prices on pay TV."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, the CFC set similar conditions over Televisa's
bid to buy northern Mexican cable firm TVI. The commission has
still not ruled on whether Televisa has complied in that case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The watchdog said Televisa must carry a broad swathe of
local programming on its satellite and cable networks before
getting regulatory approval for its stake in Cablemas, which
transmits to more than 700,000 subscribers in central Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa is the world's top producer of Spanish-language
shows. It has been trying to expand its grip on the Mexican
subscription TV market by boosting cable holdings.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude price could top $90 a 
barrel this autumn and hit $95 by the end of the year if OPEC 
keeps oil production capped at current levels, Goldman Sachs 
said in a report issued on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; U.S. oil prices have risen to near $74 per barrel, driven 
this month by higher demand and lower supplies, the report 
said, pointed out that such fundamentals could tighten further 
unless key OPEC members hike output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe an increase in Saudi Arabian, Kuwaiti and UAE 
(United Arab Emirate) production by the end of the summer is 
critical to avoid prices spiking above $90 a barrel this 
autumn," the report stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OPEC agreed last year to lower output by 1.7 million 
barrels per day (bpd), and Goldman said global oil production 
is down about 1 million bpd from last summer's levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disappointing output growth from non-OPEC producers also 
helped tighten supplies, Goldman said, adding global demand was 
up by 1 million bpd from year-ago levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our estimates show that keeping OPEC production at current 
levels and assuming normal weather this coming winter, total 
petroleum inventories would fall by over 150 million barrels or 
6.5 percent by the end of the year, which would push prices to 
$95 a barrel without a demand response," the report forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A decision by OPEC to open the taps could take $5 to $10 
off the price of a barrel of crude as some speculators exit the 
market, although the fall might be brief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Such a pullback would likely prove temporary as long as 
global economic growth remains strong, and the consequent 
reduction in oil spare capacity would increase the market 
vulnerability to unexpected oil supply disruptions," Goldman 
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on acquisitions in paragraphs 2 and 3; closing
share price in final paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Philipp Gollner&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 16 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N), which said
on Monday it would buy Canada's DataMirror Corp. DMC.TO, is
likely to announce billions of dollars of additional
acquisitions this year as it seeks to keep pace with 2006, when
it bought 13 companies for $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far this year, the world's largest technology-services
company has announced two acquisitions totaling about $915
million, including DataMirror. It also announced or completed
five purchases whose prices were not disclosed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From 2002 through 2006, IBM made an average of 13
acquisitions per year for an average total of $3.01 billion
annually. That trend means IBM has room to make several billion
dollars more of purchases this year if it is to meet its stated
goal of continuing "the accelerated pace of acquisitions in
2007, depending on valuations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.'s Toni Sacconaghi said IBM's
more than $3.6 billion of announced takeovers in August, 2006,
likely will boost year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter
ended June 30. In an investor note, he wrote that those
acquisitions will probably account for 1.1 percentage points of
his estimate of 5.3 percent revenue growth in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expect IBM to report second-quarter
net income of $2.19 billion, or $1.48 per share, on revenue of
$23.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to DataMirror for about $163.5 million, IBM
this year has announced the acquisition of Sweden's Telelogic
AB TLOG.ST for about $748 million and privately held
Watchfire Corp. for an undisclosed amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Looking back at last year, you can imagine that we will
try to do a similar number, roughly, of acquisitions," said
Kristof Kloeckner, vice president of strategy and technology
for IBM's software group, in a June 29 interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had three acquisitions last August," Kloeckner added.
"You could argue that August is a great time" to make
purchases. "We've got a bunch of things in place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM will probably make more purchases in its most
profitable business of software, as it moves away from
lower-margin computer hardware, according to Kloeckner and
analysts. DataMirror, which IBM plans to buy for about $163.5
million, helps companies identify changes to databases and
alert other computer programs of those changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International Business Machines Corp. of Armonk, New York,
has been making acquisitions to expand in software, where gross
profit margins topped 85 percent in 2006, while it sheds
businesses in hardware, where the margin stood at 37 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM in the past five years has sold its printer, personal
computer and hard-disk drive businesses to focus on
more-profitable software and technology services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM in May said it expected acquisitions, share buybacks,
improved performance and spending on new initiatives to boost
earnings per share by 80 percent in the next three years, to
$11 a share in 2010 from $6.11 in 2006. Of the company's 13
acquisitions last year, 11 were in software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOFTWARE MAKING IBM MONEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They will absolutely continue to make acquisitions," said
Merv Adrian, senior vice president and a software industry
analyst at Forrester Research Inc. "It's really about software.
Software is making IBM's money right now. It's a great
business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kloeckner said IBM's takeovers last year may suggest where
it will buy companies in 2007. In 2006, IBM bought companies
whose technology helps customers manage and integrate
information and physical assets, and secure their networks,
among other functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM also has been acquiring companies that fit into its
strategy of developing its fast-growing business around
service-oriented architecture, which lets customers integrate
existing, often incompatible software without having to buy new
technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the past two years or so, definitely the bulk of our
acquisitions happened in the information management space and
in the service management space," Kloeckner said. IBM also has
acquired companies that help customers manage risk and comply
with new rules and laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You could make a strong case that we will be rounding off
our technology portfolio in these areas," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of IBM closed up 1 percent at $109.66 on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney referred to Disneyland, the only park he saw during his lifetime, as "a show" and its workers as "cast members" who are on always stage when they are in the park.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To that end, Disneyland draws the curtain on maintenance, with about 1,000 workers known as custodians clocking in after midnight, well after the last guest has left, to inspect each ride, scrub each sidewalk, attraction, eatery and storefront.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They are somewhat invisible to our day guests ... but this is the best time to do this work," said Disneyland Resort President Ed Grier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the dark, workers on the so-called Third Shift prettify flower beds, grass and topiaries at the 500-acre resort's two parks and three hotels and entertainment district, planting more than 1 million flowers each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every year they collect more than 17.5 million pounds of trash a year and go through 3,000 mops, 1,000 brooms, 500 dust pans, and change at least 100,000 light bulbs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Third Shifters don't really want guests to see them because peeking beneath the Sorcerer's robe would be "bad show."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our job is to set the stage for the guests," said one custodian, Lori Kimbrell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'GRAVEYARD' AT DISNEYLAND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first week that horticulturist Chris Smith, 19, punched in at midnight, tasked with keeping Frontierland looking groomed yet untouched by human hands was "really tough."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you're up at 2 (a.m.) you're still a little tired. The food schedule changes a lot. You gain weight or lose weight," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ten months later, he loves his upside-down day, including the race to perfect his territory before daylight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You go home and you have the rest of the day. Sometimes you sleep, other times you go to the beach or a movie -- as long as you get to bed by 6 (p.m.)," said Smith&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Actors Johnny Depp and Geoffrey Rush -- their animatronic doppelgangers anyway -- look on in frozen wonder as machinists Dave Werelius and Rick Moody wade down the mile-long flume at the Pirates of the Caribbean ride, inspecting parts for wear.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their chest-high rubber waders keep them mostly dry and insulated from the 65-degree Fahrenheit water, but cannon fire from the shipwrecked Black Pearl is always a hazard, Moody, formerly a retired aerospace mechanic, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the animation is on, the cannon is on," Moody said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You get wet," added Werelius, a 20-year Disney veteran who traded his day shift to have more time with his two children.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rumors of ghosts in the spooky, chlorine-scented cave abound, spawned by nightly tests of animatronic figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're walking around alone and it's dark ... you have all the figures moving and there's no lighting and no sound," said attractions maintenance manager Dave Hulke. "It's a little bit odd sometimes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gum, soda, cotton candy. Cleaning up after an estimated 20 million people a year requires 450 custodians to scrub down everything guests touch -- even steam cleaning the sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's a timed performance with some members preparing and positioning carts of cleaning supplies while others climb aboard rides to remove trash and rub out fingerprints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When the rides are shining, by 3 a.m. if the team is on schedule, they break for lunch then turn to back offices, restrooms and break areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cardinal rule: everything must be dry by opening time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The work is meticulous, but it's not that hard," said Gibson, who spent 29 of his 38 years at Disneyland on the night shift. "Waking up to get here is half the battle."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 16 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N), which said
on Monday it would buy Canada's DataMirror Corp. DMC.TO, is
likely to announce billions of dollars of additional
acquisitions this year as it seeks to keep pace with 2006, when
it bought 13 companies for $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; So far this year, the world's largest technology-services
company has announced about $1 billion of acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That leaves room for another $4 billion or so of purchases
if International Business Machines Corp. is to meet its stated
2007 goal of keeping up last year's "accelerated pace of
acquisitions."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanford C. Bernstein  Co.'s Toni Sacconaghi said IBM's
more than $3.6 billion of announced takeovers in August, 2006,
likely will boost year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter
ended June 30. In an investor note, he wrote that those
acquisitions will probably account for 1.1 percentage points of
his estimate of 5.3 percent revenue growth in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expect IBM to report second-quarter
net income of $2.19 billion, or $1.48 per share, on revenue of
$23.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to DataMirror for about $163.5 million, IBM
this year has announced the acquisition of Sweden's Telelogic
AB TLOG.ST for about $748 million and privately held
Watchfire Corp. for an undisclosed amount.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Looking back at last year, you can imagine that we will
try to do a similar number, roughly, of acquisitions," said
Kristof Kloeckner, vice president of strategy and technology
for IBM's software group, in a June 29 interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We had three acquisitions last August," Kloeckner added.
"You could argue that August is a great time" to make
purchases. "We've got a bunch of things in place."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM will probably make more purchases in its most
profitable business of software, as it moves away from
lower-margin computer hardware, according to Kloeckner and
analysts. DataMirror, which IBM plans to buy for about $163.5
million, helps companies identify changes to databases and
alert other computer programs of those changes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Armonk, New York-based IBM has been making acquisitions to
expand in software, where gross profit margins topped 85
percent in 2006, while it sheds businesses in hardware, where
the margin stood at 37 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM in the past five years has sold its printer, personal
computer and hard-disk drive businesses to focus on
more-profitable software and technology services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM in May said it expected acquisitions, share buybacks,
improved performance and spending on new initiatives to boost
earnings per share by 80 percent in the next three years, to
$11 a share in 2010 from $6.11 in 2006. Of the company's 13
acquisitions last year, 11 were in software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SOFTWARE MAKING IBM MONEY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They will absolutely continue to make acquisitions," said
Merv Adrian, senior vice president and a software industry
analyst at Forrester Research Inc. "It's really about software.
Software is making IBM's money right now. It's a great
business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kloeckner said IBM's takeovers last year may suggest where
it will buy companies in 2007. In 2006, IBM bought companies
whose technology helps customers manage and integrate
information and physical assets, and secure their networks,
among other functions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM also has been acquiring companies that fit into its
strategy of developing its fast-growing business around
service-oriented architecture, which lets customers integrate
existing, often incompatible software without having to buy new
technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the past two years or so, definitely the bulk of our
acquisitions happened in the information management space and
in the service management space," Kloeckner said. IBM also has
acquired companies that help customers manage risk and comply
with new rules and laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "You could make a strong case that we will be rounding off
our technology portfolio in these areas," he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (GS.N) has hired former U.S. Trust Chief Executive Peter Scaturro as global head of its private wealth management business, the investment bank said in an internal memo on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scaturro, who is 47, left New York-based private wealth manager U.S. Trust before it was acquired by Bank of America Corp. (BAC.N) from its parent, Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW.O, on July 1. Scaturro in 2004 was forced out of Citigroup Inc. (C.N) after regulators forced the shutdown of its private bank in Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scaturro assumed the top job at U.S. Trust in 2005. Prior to joining Citigroup, he was a partner at Bankers Trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, the world's largest investment bank by market value, is also one of the fastest-growing money managers that is expanding its reach among wealthy individuals. In less than six years, private wealth management client assets have almost doubled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman hopes Scaturro, who once ran Citi's 98 private bank offices in 38 countries, can lead the continued expansion of its private banking. Goldman has 20 private wealth management offices worldwide but does not disclose client assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are expanding our global footprint, increasing client coverage and opening new offices in a number of key locations," Kraus said in the memo. Scaturro's "extensive experience will help us to continue the robust growth of our global business."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TORONTO (Reuters) - International Business Machines Corp. (IBM.N) said on Monday that it would buy Canada's DataMirror Corp. DMC.TO for about $163.5 million, continuing its push to expand software revenue through acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM said it would buy all outstanding DataMirror common shares for C$27.00 cash each, or a total of C$170 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The news sent DataMirror's shares soaring 18.7 percent, or C$4.20, to C$26.70 on the Toronto Stock Exchange in morning trade. The price marked a year high for DataMirror.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DataMirror's technology helps companies capture and analyze data in real-time, identifying changes to databases and immediately alerting other computer programs of those changes. This gives those programs more current data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Markham, Ontario, company's 2,200 customers include FedEx Ground (FDX.N), Priority Health, Tiffany  Co. (TIF.N) and Union Pacific Railroad (UNP.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said it expected the deal to close in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=$1.04 Canadian)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. crude price could top $90 a barrel this autumn and hit $95 by the end of the year if OPEC keeps oil production capped at current levels, Goldman Sachs said in a report issued on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. oil prices have risen to near $74 per barrel, driven this month by higher demand and lower supplies, the report said, pointed out that such fundamentals could tighten further unless key OPEC members hike output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe an increase in Saudi Arabian, Kuwaiti and UAE (United Arab Emirate) production by the end of the summer is critical to avoid prices spiking above $90 a barrel this autumn," the report stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OPEC agreed last year to lower output by 1.7 million barrels per day (bpd), and Goldman said global oil production is down about 1 million bpd from last summer's levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disappointing output growth from non-OPEC producers also helped tighten supplies, Goldman said, adding global demand was up by 1 million bpd from year-ago levels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Our estimates show that keeping OPEC production at current levels and assuming normal weather this coming winter, total petroleum inventories would fall by over 150 million barrels or 6.5 percent by the end of the year, which would push prices to $95 a barrel without a demand response," the report forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A decision by OPEC to open the taps could take $5 to $10 off the price of a barrel of crude as some speculators exit the market, although the fall might be brief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Such a pullback would likely prove temporary as long as global economic growth remains strong, and the consequent reduction in oil spare capacity would increase the market vulnerability to unexpected oil supply disruptions," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexican entertainment company Grupo 
Televisa must share programming with other television stations 
as a condition for buying a stake in cable company Cablemas, 
antitrust body CFC said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Televisa, which is trying to buy a 49 percent stake in 
Cablemas, has 90 days to comply with the ruling, the Mexican 
competition commission said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We guarantee Televisa will soon offer equal access to its 
content and networks," said commission head Eduardo Perez 
Motta. "With this we make sure consumers have the best number 
of options with open TV and the best prices on pay TV."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, the CFC set similar conditions over Televisa's 
bid to buy northern Mexican cable firm TVI. The commission has 
still not ruled on whether Televisa has complied in that case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The watchdog said Televisa must carry a broad swath of 
local programming on its satellite and cable networks before 
getting regulatory approval for its stake in Cablemas, which 
transmits to more than 700,000 subscribers in central Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa is the world's top producer of Spanish-language 
shows. It has been trying to expand its grip on the Mexican 
subscription TV market by boosting cable holdings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Nielsen&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Saturday night and thrill-seekers from around the world crowd the streets of Amsterdam's red-light district ready to binge on sex, drugs and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Hey, mister, do you want some cocaine?" a man mutters from a dark corner while a blonde prostitute removes her bra in a shop window, to lure customers into her room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no accident the dealer was offering cocaine before he moved on to other drugs. Cocaine use has almost tripled in Europe over the past decade, while U.S. consumption has stabilized, according to U.N. figures released in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a certain glamour to cocaine in the media which has become very appealing to all sectors of European society," said Peter Thomas, a spokesman for European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in Lisbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portuguese police say a stronger euro is also attracting cocaine smugglers into European cities like Amsterdam, London and Madrid where party-goers can easily pay up to 60 euros ($82.78) to get high on a few lines of the white powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wholesale, the drug in Europe fetches up to $77,000 per kg, almost twice the amount it sells for in the U.S., according to the U.S Drug Enforcement Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dealers focus their trade in cities with money," Jose Braz, the director of the Department of Narcotics in Portugal, which has become a significant entry-point for cocaine into Europe, told Reuters. "There is more and more dirty money in euros."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFRICA HUB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a lot of euphoria with love-drugs like ecstasy 10 years ago but that is going away now," said an employee of the Magic Mushroom Smartshop near Amsterdam's night club scene in Rembrandtplein square. He identified himself simply as AR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Coke is cold and ego-boosting and allows people to forget about their insecurities. I suppose the world is becoming a colder place these days," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe's demand for cocaine may be growing but the real test for the Latin American cartels is breaking into Europe's sophisticated external borders and airports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution normally comes in the form of bribes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the United Nations, cartels increasingly rely on corrupt officials in poor West African nations like Guinea Bissau, a tiny former Portuguese colony, to store the cocaine before it is smuggled into Europe's booming market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These criminals are entrepreneurs. They see a window of opportunity and immediately jump in," said Braz, who worked with Bissau police recently to help fight cocaine smuggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Guinea Bissau's police was commended by the United Nations for seizing over 600 kg of cocaine -- worth more than 30 million euros -- but it was later discovered the traffickers had still managed to escape with about 2.5 tonnes of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is regrettable that the rest of the consignment was not intercepted, but hardly surprising as the police were woefully ill-equipped and often do not have enough gasoline to operate their vehicles," said Antonio Costa, the Executive Director of the U.N.'s Office of Drugs and Crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to authorities in Bissau, Costa urged them to ensure that the seized cocaine would not "disappear" like previous drug busts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cocaine that eludes authorities is normally split among hundreds of smugglers willing to risk hefty jail sentences to enter Europe through countries like Portugal and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, police in both countries, which have strong geographical and cultural ties with Africa and historic links with Latin America, seized a combined 70 tonnes of cocaine, about the same amount that was seized in all of Europe in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are now a key entry point of drugs into Europe," said Braz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MULES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But record drug busts in 2006 and 2007 in Europe have prompted cartels to turn to people who are willing to fly to Europe with cocaine hidden in bags or inside their bodies for up to 5,000 euros -- a small sum considering the risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we have found is that drug mules have increasingly been used to smuggle the drug through airports," said Peter Thomas from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, two British teenage girls were arrested at Accra airport in Ghana, allegedly carrying 300,000 pounds ($609,500) worth of cocaine in laptop bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike the movie Maria Full of Grace, which portrays a teenage women as a drug mule, most of the mules are still young men like Jackson, a 27-year-old architect from Venezuela, who was caught in Lisbon trying to bring the drug into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trapped in a downward spiral of debt and with a family to provide for, Jackson boarded a flight from Caracas to Amsterdam via Lisbon in June last year with one kg of cocaine inside his stomach and two kg strapped around his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal was to deliver 3 kilos of cocaine in Amsterdam but I couldn't swallow all the capsules and was afraid to die. So I hid some of the drugs on my body," Jackson told a Lisbon-based judge at his first hearing after being arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He now faces at least five years in prison and fears reprisals against his family back home from the drug cartel which hired him to do the job, but he is lucky to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Europeans, like the group of men waiting outside the bathroom of a popular club in Amsterdam to snort another line, the party goes on. Or so they hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They may forget about their problems when they're high but reality will eventually sink in. I just hope most of them are able to cope with it," said AR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sofia Van Holle in Lisbon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment, background, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Scott Hillis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O)
said on Tuesday the head of its gaming business, Peter Moore,
will leave the company to join Electronic Arts Inc. ERTS.O,
the world's biggest video game publisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moore will be replaced by Don Mattrick, a former top
Electronic Arts executive who has served as an adviser to
Microsoft on video games for the past six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moore will stay at Microsoft until Sept. 1, though Mattrick
will start his new job on July 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The announcement comes two weeks after Microsoft said it
would take a charge of up to $1.15 billion to fix an
"unacceptable" number of broken Xbox 360 game consoles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also comes on the heels of E3, the video game industry's
annual expo, where Moore had a highly visible role as host of
Microsoft's press briefing. Microsoft said there was nothing to
be read into the timing of Moore's departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's just how things fall. A lot of this timing was driven
by Electronic Arts," said Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's
entertainment and devices division that includes the Xbox 360.
"Peter's a sports nut, so it's a good job for Peter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As head of EA Sports, Moore will take charge of some of the
company's biggest money-spinning franchises, such as "Madden"
football, "FIFA" soccer and "Tiger Woods PGA Tour" golf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A month ago, Electronic Arts' new chief executive, John
Riccitiello, reorganized the publisher into four units to help
make it more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What I want to try to do is ... look at new ways to grow
that business both domestically and internationally,"
Riccitiello told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Peter is an unbelievably talented executive. When he was
running Sega and their sports business, it was the only time
that EA felt threatened in sports," Riccitiello said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After joining Microsoft from Sega Toys Ltd., 7842.Q Moore
became the marketing face of the company's Xbox push,
delivering sharp attacks on Microsoft's main rival, Sony
Corp.'s (6758.T) (SNE.N) PlayStation console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moore will receive a one-time bonus of $1.5 million from
Electronic Arts to offset future compensation he was due at
Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The change in management comes at a time when Microsoft's
competitors are gearing up to cut into the company's early lead
in the battle of next-generation game machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sony recently cut prices for its PlayStation 3, while
Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974.OS Wii console is outselling both
machines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is enough institutional knowledge within the Xbox
business, and there are enough people who have been there a
long time, so things should keep running pretty smoothly," said
Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft, an
independent research firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mattrick was president of EA's Worldwide Studios and was
considered a shoo-in to become the company's next CEO before he
left the company in 2005.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, July 17 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) said on Tuesday the head of its gaming business, Peter Moore, would leave the company to join Electronic Arts IncERTS.O, the world's biggest video game publisher. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Moore will be replaced by Don Mattrick, a former Electronic Arts executive who has served as an adviser to Microsoft on video games for the past six months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Moore will stay at Microsoft until Sept. 1, though Mattrick will start his new job on July 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The announcement comes two weeks after Microsoft said it would take a charge of up to $1.15 billion to fix an "unacceptable" number of broken Xbox 360 game consoles. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It also comes on the heels of E3, the video game industry's annual expo, where Moore had a highly visible role as host of Microsoft's press briefing. Microsoft said there was nothing to be read into the timing of Moore's departure. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's just how things fall. A lot of this timing was driven by Electronic Arts," said Robbie Bach, president of Microsoft's entertainment and devices division that includes the Xbox 360. "Peter's a sports nut, so it's a good job for Peter." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A month ago, EA's new chief executive, John Riccitiello, reorganized the publisher into four units to help make it more efficient. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As head of EA Sports, Moore will take charge of some of the company's biggest money-spinning franchises, such as "Madden" football, "FIFA" soccer and "Tiger Woods PGA Tour" golf. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "What I want to try to do is ... look at new ways to grow that business both domestically and internationally," Riccitiello told Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Peter is an unbelievably talented executive. When he was running Sega and their sports business, it was the only time that EA felt threatened in sports," Riccitiello said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Scott Hillis, editing by Toni Reinhold; e-mail: scott.hillis@reuters.com; Tel +1 415 677 2505)) Keywords: MICROSOFT EA/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Friday night was a good 
one for Disney Channel and USA Network.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Disney Channel beat all TV competition -- including 
broadcast fare -- from 8-9:30 p.m. Friday with a programming 
event featuring new episodes of "Hannah Montana," "The Suite 
Life of Zack  Cody" and "Cory in the House."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The 90-minute Disney Channel programming block, called 
"Wish Gone Amiss," averaged 5.1 million total viewers, 
surpassing the closest network, NBC, by 11 percent (4.6 
million), according to Nielsen Media Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, "Suite Life" was the most-watched program of 
the day in basic cable -- and No. 2 overall in all of 
television -- in total viewers (5.7 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In all of primetime, Disney Channel finished as TV's No. 2 
network in total viewers (4.5 million) behind NBC (5 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney Channel also was Friday's most-watched basic cable 
network in total day (2.3 million) and primetime (4.5 million) 
among total viewers and was the No. 1 network overall for the 
day in kids 6-11 (944,000) and tweens 9-14 (958,000).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, "Wish Gone Amiss" improved Disney Channel's 
viewership over a year ago by 50 percent in total viewers (5.1 
million vs. 3.4 million), 47 percent in 6-11 (2.2 million vs. 
1.5 million) and 92 percent in 9-14 (2.5 million vs. 1.3 
million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Meanwhile, "Psych" had its second-season premiere on USA at 
8 p.m. Friday, followed at 9 p.m. by the sixth-season premiere 
of "Monk." The shows were the two most-watched basic cable 
programs of Friday night among the key adult demos of 18-49 and 
25-54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Psych" averaged 1.8 million viewers in 18-49 and 2.1 
million in 25-54, outdelivering even broadcast competition from 
CBS in both demos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Monk" was Friday's No. 2 basic cable program in the demos, 
averaging 1.6 million in 18-49 and 2.1 million in 25-54. That 
outperformed all broadcast fare in 25-54 as well as competition 
from ABC, CBS and Fox in 18-49.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both shows performed only slightly under the recent 
premiere of USA's new hit Thursday night series "Burn Notice," 
which averaged 2 million in 18-49 and 2.2 million in 25-54 on 
June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The premieres of "Monk" and "Psych" helped USA win the 
night in basic cable primetime in both demos as well as in 
adults 18-34.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters/Hollywood Reporter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Michael Erman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - New York State sued Exxon
Mobil Corp (XOM.N) on Tuesday to force the cleanup of a
decades-old, 17 million gallon oil spill in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit concerns a leak that was discovered in 1978 in
Newtown Creek, the waterway that separates the boroughs of
Queens and Brooklyn. It has formed an underground contamination
over 55-acres of the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, the
lawsuit says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides the cleanup, the lawsuit asks Exxon to restore the
creek and is seeking substantial financial penalties and
damages for the injuries to financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This company cannot ignore the harm its oil spill has
caused to the environment and residents of Greenpoint,
Brooklyn," New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said in
a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This suit sends the message that even the largest
corporations in the world cannot escape the consequences of
their misdeeds," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cuomo filed a notice of intent to sue the company last
February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The allegations made by the New York State attorney
general are not supported by the facts and are unfounded,"
Exxon Mobil spokesman Barry Wood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil takes its environmental responsibility very
seriously, and our policy is to comply with all applicable
environmental laws and regulations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the company would vigorously defend against the
lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greenpoint, a waterfront neighborhood that is a longtime
home to Polish immigrants and more recently to hipsters, was an
industrial hub for shipbuilding, iron making and refining
before World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's property on the creek was the site of one of the
earliest refineries of original U.S. oil giant Standard Oil,
but most of the refinery structures were decommissioned and

&lt;p&gt; (Adds analysts' estimates, volume, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 17 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N) said on Tuesday second-quarter profit rose slightly, helped by strength in emerging markets such as China, Turkey, India and Brazil. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's largest soft-drink maker reported net income of $1.85 billion, or 80 cents per share, up less than 1 percent from $1.84 billion, or 78 cents per share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Excluding restructuring charges and other one-time items, the company earned 84 cents per share, beating analysts' average estimate by 2 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Net operating revenue rose 19 percent to $7.73 billion from $6.48 billion. Worldwide case volume increased 6 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In recent years, Coke has lagged rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP.N) in offering alternatives to the sugary soft drinks that North Americans have begun to avoid. But some analysts see its recent acquisitions of juice and tea company Fuze Beverages and vitamin water maker Glaceau as evidence that Coke is focused on closing the gap. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's No. 1 beverage company saw strong gains in emerging markets such as India, Turkey and Africa, as well as moderate gains in developed markets like the European Union, which overshadowed an expected decline in North America. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coke shares have traded in their in their highest range since July 2002 in recent weeks. Before Tuesday, the stock traded at 20.5 times estimated 2007 earnings, making it the fifth costliest stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI on a price-to-earnings basis.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - A European court confirmed on Tuesday that it will rule on September 17 on whether software giant Microsoft (MSFT.O) broke European Union antitrust regulations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is appealing at the Court of First Instance against a landmark 2004 decision by the European Commission, which ordered the company to change its business practices and fined it close to half a billion euros ($690 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Luxembourg-based court, second-highest in the EU, confirmed a June 5 Reuters report that the ruling will come on September 17, the final working day before the retirement of court president Bo Vesterdorf, who is presiding over the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU's executive Commission found in 2004 that Microsoft had broken competition rules by abusing the dominance of its Windows product, muscling out competitors unable to make software that would work smoothly on the operating system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite Microsoft's appeal, it was still liable to implement the Commission's decision, which involved giving rivals information needed to make their software work with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Three years on, the Commission has repeatedly warned Microsoft that it has failed to comply with the 2004 decision because it supplied insufficient information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commission spokesman Jonathan Todd said the EU executive was still looking into those charges, after Microsoft prepared a set of technical documents for rivals and set fees for their use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We haven't yet reached a view as to whether or not the technical documentation made available is enough, or indeed as to whether we're happy with the fees charged for licensing. We're still investigating that," he told a regular briefing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CARACAS, July 17 (Reuters) - Venezuela demands U.S. oil
companies ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Chevron (CVX.N) pay at
least $37.2 million in back taxes for a project the two ran
before a nationalization this year, the tax agency said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Hugo Chavez decreed the takeover of four
foreign-run, joint venture heavy crude upgrader projects to
ensure the state oil company had at least a 60 percent stake in
each.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron negotiated to stay on in its project, which is
known as Ameriven. But ConocoPhillips last month decided to
leave the OPEC nation and seek compensation for its loss of
assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The head of the Venezuelan tax authority, Jose Vielma Mora,
told reporters the companies would soon receive a bill for
taxes owed from 2001 to 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The opposition accuses Chavez of using the agency as a
political tool against companies and critics. The government
says its increased enforcement of tax payments is due to better
state efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent months, ConocoPhillips has received the highest
bills for back taxes among the six foreign companies that were
the target of nationalizations in the massive Orinoco heavy
crude reserve.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other companies that were involved in this year's
takeovers were Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), Britain's BP (BP.L),
France's Total (TOTF.PA) and Norway's Statoil (STL.OL).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All decided to stay in the projects except Exxon, which is
seeking compensation like ConocoPhillips.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N) posted higher-than-expected quarterly profit on Tuesday, helped by strength in its developing China and India markets, and moderate gains in mature markets such as Germany and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest beverage company, best known for its namesake soft drinks, also saw strong volume growth for noncarbonated products, including Powerade and Dasani bottled water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Coke shares, which had rallied to a five-year high in recent days on expectations of positive earnings news, were down about 1 percent at $53.29 in midday New York Stock Exchange trading, as some investors were disappointed the news was not better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This shows you that Coke has arrived, to some extent," JP Morgan analyst John Faucher said. "People are beginning to believe in the (turnaround) story so there tends to be more good news priced in by the time they actually report."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Faucher, who rates Coke shares "overweight," also guessed that some hedge funds had invested in Coke in recent days and were selling their shares now that the market did not strongly applaud Coke's results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke shares gained a modest 1 percent earlier in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Second-quarter net income rose less than 1 percent to $1.85 billion, or 80 cents per share, from $1.84 billion, or 78 cents a share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding charges and a tax benefit, profit was 84 cents a share, 2 cents higher than the analysts' average forecast compiled by Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher-than-expected earnings were further evidence that Chief Executive E. Neville Isdell, who was brought out of retirement in 2004 to lead the company, was successfully turning it around.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Isdell's watch, Coca-Cola introduced Coke Zero, its most notable brand launch in many years, and acquired vitamin-water maker Glaceau. It also has smoothed over relationships with bottlers and launched a new marketing campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst Judy Hong termed the results largely positive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It reaffirms our view that Coke could be in a position to deliver 11 percent to 12 percent earnings-per-share growth results that exceed consensus over the next few years, driven by healthy emerging market gains and improved developed market results," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke Chief Operating Officer Muhtar Kent was also optimistic on a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We remain relatively positive on the macroeconomic outlook for the remainder of the year, especially in many of our emerging markets," Kent said. He also forecast a sequential improvement later this year in North America, where second-quarter sales volume declined 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;STRENGTH IN NUMBERS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Quarterly net operating revenue rose 19 percent to $7.73 billion, helped by price increases and acquisitions in addition to higher product sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Breaking down the revenue growth, the Atlanta-based company attributed nearly 3 percentage points of it to the weak dollar. That is equal to nearly 16 percent of the total revenue gain, and more than just a nominal contribution to the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worldwide case volume increased 6 percent. Volume was up 12 percent for noncarbonated beverages, due to higher sales of Powerade and Dasani bottled water, and 4 percent for carbonated soft drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, Coke has lagged rival PepsiCo Inc. (PEP.N) in offering alternatives to the sugary soft drinks that North Americans have begun to avoid. But some analysts see its recent acquisitions of Glaceau and juice and tea company Fuze as evidence that Coke is focused on closing the gap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company saw strong gains in emerging markets, as well as moderate gains in the European Union and Japan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Before Tuesday, Coke traded at 20.5 times estimated 2007 earnings, making it the fifth-costliest stock in the Dow Jones Industrial Average .DJI on a price-to-earnings basis. Rival PepsiCo's multiple is only slightly lower at 20.0.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So far in 2007, Coke has repurchased $1 billion of the $1.75 billion to $2 billion in stock it plans to buy back for the full year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Microsoft (MSFT.O) has launched a pay-as-you-go computing system aimed at making its office software more accessible for people in emerging markets, the company said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will charge 199 rand ($28.54) for a three-month subscription to use Microsoft Office 2007 and first-time users will get an extra three months for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After that, customers top up their subscription as they go, which the company said was more affordable for those who could not manage the upfront fee. The technology is only available on new computers, Microsoft said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology, based on the pre-paid cell phone model that has proved a hit throughout the developing world, is being launched in South Africa and Romania this month, and may be available in other markets at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to think differently in order to address the needs of the next five billion users of computers and how we can make technology accessible to them," Cyril Belikoff, information worker business group executive at Microsoft South Africa, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is trying to push into developing countries where fewer people have access to computers, but faces competition from the free open source Linux operating system, and is looking for ways to make its software more affordable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said the new technology, which it started testing a year ago, would be aimed at students, home users and small businesses who might not be able to afford to pay for up-to-date software in a lump sum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HAVANA (Reuters) - Cuba accused the United States on Tuesday of issuing too few visas for Cuban emigres, saying the delay was part of Washington's efforts to overthrow the Cuban government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Under migration accords aimed at discouraging Cubans from taking to the sea illegally in makeshift crafts after the 1994 rafter exodus, the U.S. government agreed to issue 20,000 visas a year to Cubans seeking to emigrate to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in the first nine months of fiscal 2007, U.S. immigration authorities have only granted 10,724 visas to Cubans and may not meet the annual target in the three months left, Cuba's Foreign Ministry complained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This failure to comply (with the quota) will encourage further illegal emigration," the ministry said in a statement published by the ruling Communist Party newspaper Granma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said Washington was deliberately dragging its feet on the visas to undermine the migration accords, which are meant to ensure legal, orderly and safe migration between the two countries that have been ideological foes since the Cold War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The migration agreements are opposed by anti-Castro exiles concentrated in Miami because they include the repatriation of emigres who are intercepted at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After 35,000 Cubans took to the sea in boats, rafts and inflated inner tubes in 1994, the United States changed its policy of automatically welcoming any Cuban emigre. Under the current "dry-foot, wet-foot" policy, those stopped at sea are returned to Cuba, those that make it ashore get to stay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Havana insists U.S. policy still encourages Cubans to leave illegally, often risking their lives in precarious vessels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This irresponsible policy ... is a permanent cause of unjustified and unnecessary deaths, and the victims are often women and children," the ministry statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics of the Cuban government say the flow of emigration to the United States, legal or illegal, acts as a escape valve for simmering discontent over economic hardship in Cuba.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With calmer waters in the Florida Straits during the summer, more Cubans are leaving by sea, in makeshift boats or aboard powerful "cigarette" speed boats that whisk emigres across to Florida for about $8,000 a trip.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Coast Guard reported a rise in the number of Cuban migrants it has picked up in the last few weeks, though interceptions are below last year's levels. Last week it repatriated 94 Cubans, the week before 100.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI, July 17 (Reuters) - JPMorgan's (JPM.N) China asset
management venture said on Tuesday it is preparing to launch its
first qualified domestic institutional investor (QDII) fund to
invest clients' money in overseas securities markets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We are actively preparing to launch a fund for overseas
investment. We have been making preparations in terms of staffing
and equipment," Mandy Wang, chief executive officer of China
International Fund Management Co. Ltd., told a clients' meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wang did not disclose the size and timing of the planned
fund, but said it would be a main focus of her company in the
second half of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China has just issued rules to let select fund management
companies and brokerages launch such funds as part of efforts to
encourage capital outflows and ease upward pressure on its
currency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Only one Chinese fund management company, Huaan, has launched
a QDII product since Beijing adopted the scheme last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demand for most of the existing QDII products, mainly
launched by banks, has been tepid partly because of the
appreciation of the Chinese yuan against the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China has granted quotas of about $14.8 billion for 19 banks,
$5.2 billion for insurance companies and $500 million for Huaan,
but only a small fraction of the approved quotas has been used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In order to make the products more attractive, China recently
allowed banks to invest client money in Hong Kong stocks
directly, in addition to existing fixed-income products that have
yielded mediocre returns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A number of Chinese fund management companies, including
China Southern Fund Management Co., have unveiled plans to launch
such stock funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Xu Yunkai, a fund manager at China International Fund --
which manages 57 billion yuan ($7.54 billion) through six
domestic funds -- said at Tuesday's meeting he did not expect
China's QDII programme to expand greatly until the yuan
CNY=CFXS stopped rising against the dollar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But a gradual expansion of the QDII scheme would help to
narrow the gap between the prices of mainland China-listed stocks
and their Hong Kong counterparts, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yuan is expected to climb 4 to 5 percent versus the
dollar this year, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The yuan has appreciated a further 7.2 percent since it was
revalued by 2.1 percent to 8.11 per dollar on July 21, 2005.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details on acquisitions in paragraphs 2 and 3; closing share price in final paragraph) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Philipp Gollner &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    SAN FRANCISCO, July 16 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N), which said on Monday it would buy Canada's DataMirror Corp. DMC.TO, is likely to announce billions of dollars of additional acquisitions this year as it seeks to keep pace with 2006, when it bought 13 companies for $5 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    So far this year, the world's largest technology-services company has announced two acquisitions totaling about $915 million, including DataMirror. It also announced or completed five purchases whose prices were not disclosed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    From 2002 through 2006, IBM made an average of 13 acquisitions per year for an average total of $3.01 billion annually. That trend means IBM has room to make several billion dollars more of purchases this year if it is to meet its stated goal of continuing "the accelerated pace of acquisitions in 2007, depending on valuations." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sanford C. Bernstein &amp; Co.'s Toni Sacconaghi said IBM's more than $3.6 billion of announced takeovers in August, 2006, likely will boost year-over-year revenue growth in the quarter ended June 30. In an investor note, he wrote that those acquisitions will probably account for 1.1 percentage points of his estimate of 5.3 percent revenue growth in the quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company reports second-quarter earnings on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Analysts, on average, expect IBM to report second-quarter net income of $2.19 billion, or $1.48 per share, on revenue of $23.1 billion, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In addition to DataMirror for about $163.5 million, IBM this year has announced the acquisition of Sweden's Telelogic AB TLOG.ST for about $748 million and privately held Watchfire Corp. for an undisclosed amount. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Looking back at last year, you can imagine that we will try to do a similar number, roughly, of acquisitions," said Kristof Kloeckner, vice president of strategy and technology for IBM's software group, in a June 29 interview. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We had three acquisitions last August," Kloeckner added. "You could argue that August is a great time" to make purchases. "We've got a bunch of things in place." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM will probably make more purchases in its most profitable business of software, as it moves away from lower-margin computer hardware, according to Kloeckner and analysts. DataMirror, which IBM plans to buy for about $163.5 million, helps companies identify changes to databases and alert other computer programs of those changes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    International Business Machines Corp. of Armonk, New York, has been making acquisitions to expand in software, where gross profit margins topped 85 percent in 2006, while it sheds businesses in hardware, where the margin stood at 37 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM in the past five years has sold its printer, personal computer and hard-disk drive businesses to focus on more-profitable software and technology services. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM in May said it expected acquisitions, share buybacks, improved performance and spending on new initiatives to boost earnings per share by 80 percent in the next three years, to $11 a share in 2010 from $6.11 in 2006. Of the company's 13 acquisitions last year, 11 were in software.  SOFTWARE MAKING IBM MONEY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "They will absolutely continue to make acquisitions," said Merv Adrian, senior vice president and a software industry analyst at Forrester Research Inc. "It's really about software. Software is making IBM's money right now. It's a great business." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Kloeckner said IBM's takeovers last year may suggest where it will buy companies in 2007. In 2006, IBM bought companies whose technology helps customers manage and integrate information and physical assets, and secure their networks, among other functions. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    IBM also has been acquiring companies that fit into its strategy of developing its fast-growing business around service-oriented architecture, which lets customers integrate existing, often incompatible software without having to buy new technology. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "In the past two years or so, definitely the bulk of our acquisitions happened in the information management space and in the service management space," Kloeckner said. IBM also has acquired companies that help customers manage risk and comply with new rules and laws. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "You could make a strong case that we will be rounding off our technology portfolio in these areas," he said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of IBM closed up 1 percent at $109.66 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Philipp Gollner, editing by Tim Dobbyn; Telephone: +1 415 677-2547, E-mail: philipp.gollner@reuters.com))   Keywords: IBM ACQUISITIONS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds analyst comment and comment from JPMorgan CFO) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Tim McLaughlin &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM.N) said on Wednesday it tripled the amount set aside for loan losses as even borrowers with good credit defaulted on home equity loans, hurting the bank's quarterly profit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The negative trend provides a new worry for investors. Until now, most of the angst has been focused on subprime lending, or loans to people with weak credit. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said losses on home equity loans to prime borrowers, or those with good credit, will steepen, partly because U.S. housing prices have flattened or fallen in some areas. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The No. 3 U.S. bank said second-quarter net income was $4.2 billion, or $1.20 a share, compared with $3.5 billion, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat analysts' average estimate of $1.08 a share, helped by a sharp rise in investment banking revenue. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But the bank set aside $1.53 billion for loan losses, up from $493 million a year earlier. The increase was driven by higher loss estimates on home equity loans where borrowers had little equity in houses whose values are falling. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It's definitely a change in trend that we're reacting to," Cavanagh told reporters on a conference call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The bank's reserve for losses is being bolstered as the lender transitions from a benign credit environment to one that is expected to get worse. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We think these reserve additions will cover us for the carrythrough of the trends we're already seeing," Cavanagh said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo estimated the extra money set aside for loan losses reduced JPMorgan's earnings by about $350 million, or 10 cents a share. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan shares were down 85 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $49.07 in morning trade on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    WEAK SPOTS &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan said regional banking and auto finance were weak spots in the quarter, with profit in those areas declining.  The bank's retail finance division set aside $587 million, part of the overall loan loss reserve number, up from $100 million a year earlier, to reflect weak housing prices and the resulting increase in losses on home equity loans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Cavanagh said the bank had problems with home equity loans started by independent mortgage brokers. The bank has since tightened underwriting standards and raised prices to reflect elevated risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan's overall net revenue rose 25 percent to $18.9 billion, better than the $17.5 billion expected by analysts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Investment banking continued to be a bright spot as JPMorgan raked in fees from merger and acquisition advice. Investment banking revenue surged 34 percent to $5.8 billion, up from $4.3 billion a year earlier. The first quarter was better, though, at $6.3 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The bank's retail financial services division, which includes home loans, credit cards and auto financing, reported $785 million in net income, down 10 percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    JPMorgan's asset management business saw profit soar 44 percent to $493 million as the unit took in more money from clients. The unit now has $1.1 trillion under management. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tim McLaughlin) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by John Wallace; Reuters messaging: tim.mclaughlin.reuters.com@reuters.net; +1 646 223 6033)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: JPMORGAN EARNS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) on Wednesday 
reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings on competition 
with generics and a surprisingly big 13 percent decline in 
sales of its best-selling Lipitor cholesterol fighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The world's biggest drug maker, whose shares fell almost 4 
percent, said it earned $1.27 billion, or 18 cents per share in 
the second quarter. That compares with $2.42 billion, or 33 
cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excluding special items, New York-based Pfizer earned 42 
cents per share. Analysts on average expected 50 cents, 
according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company affirmed its 2007 and 2008 profit forecasts, 
but investors and industry analysts remained skeptical. HSBC 
analyst Kevin Scotcher cut his rating on Pfizer to "neutral," 
saying the results called into question whether Pfizer can meet 
its earnings targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that a loss of confidence in a single quarter 
is enough to persuade investors to defer a decision to buy 
Pfizer," Scotcher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer, hurt by the recent loss of patent protection on its 
anti-depressant Zoloft and blood pressure treatment Norvasc, 
said global company revenue fell 6 percent to $11.08 billion. 
That was shy of Wall Street expectations of $11.44 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Regarding Lipitor, we are in a tough battle," Pfizer Chief 
Executive Jeffrey Kindler said, noting the pill was facing 
"intensely" greater competition from other cholesterol drugs 
than the company had envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's disappointing results compound a bumpy start to 
the second-quarter reporting season for drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, rivals Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N) and Novartis 
AG (NOVN.VX) cut their sales forecasts. However, Abbott 
Laboratories (ABT.N) on Wednesday encouraged investors with its 
strong quarterly results and forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While Pfizer's results do not bode well for the group 
overall, Pfizer's underlying fundamentals are substantially 
worse than the industry average and thus should not be 
representative of the group as a whole," Morgan Stanley analyst 
Jami Rubin said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The New York-based company said sales of Lipitor, by far 
the world's biggest drug, rose 5 percent overseas but tumbled 
25 percent in the important U.S. market. Global Lipitor sales 
were $2.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer attributed Lipitor's U.S. free-fall to declining 
prescriptions for the medicine, now facing competition from far 
cheaper generic forms of Merck  Co.'s (MRK.N) Zocor, and by 
patterns of stocking by wholesalers and related factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wholesaler inventory patterns should not have a 
negative impact on U.S. Lipitor sales during the rest of the 
year, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the full year, the company expects Lipitor sales to 
range from flat to a 5 percent decline compared with 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lipitor, whose U.S. patent could expire as soon as 2010, is 
showing weakness at a time when Pfizer has no apparent 
cholesterol medicine to replace it. The company scrapped 
development of another possible blockbuster cholesterol drug in 
December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aside from Lipitor, sales of schizophrenia drug Geodon, 
painkiller Celebrex and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra came 
in below expectations, said Leerink Swann  Co. analyst Seamus 
Fernandez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geodon sales rose 8 percent to $178 million, while sales of 
Celebrex edged up 1 percent to $478 million. Viagra sales 
slipped 3 percent to $382 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales of Lyrica, its neuropathic pain drug that recently 
won U.S. approval for fibromyalgia, jumped 49 percent to $405 
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's net income was hurt by a number of charges related 
to restructuring, acquisitions and deals, including payments 
made to Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) related to their 
co-development of a drug to prevent blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kindler said Pfizer, which has not produced many 
big-selling drugs in the past five years, has put a number of 
initiatives into motion to boost productivity -- including 
placement of new leaders in its laboratories to "better unleash 
the creativity of our scientists."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares fell $1.01 to $24.95 in late afternoon 
trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a moderate decline 
for the drug sector. The stock is down about 3 percent in 2007, 
underperforming a roughly 2.5 percent rise for the American 
Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical index. .DRG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Lewis Krauskopf)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N), the world's largest technology services company, on Wednesday posted a 12 percent jump in quarterly profit and raised its 2007 earnings forecast as revenue surged on software-company acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM shares, which hit a five-year high this week, rose 3.3 percent to $114.72 in after-hours trading following the earnings report, which beat analysts' forecasts.

Second-quarter net income included a gain of $81 million, or 5 cents per share, on the sale of IBM's printer division earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's gross profit margin improved to 41.8 percent in the second quarter from 41.2 percent a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Revenue in IBM's global technology services business rose 10.1 percent to $8.76 billion.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background on drinks consumption)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Noel Randewich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, July 18 (Reuters) - KOF, the world's
second-largest Coke bottler, and the Coca-Cola Co. have
received the go-ahead from the Mexico's antitrust regulator to
acquire No. 2 juice maker Jugos del Valle for $380 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KOF (KOFL.MX), or Coca-Cola Femsa, and Coke received
permission, with some conditions meant to safeguard
competition, after appealing the antitrust watchdog's earlier
rejection of the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Controlled by Mexican drinks company Femsa (FMSAUBD.MX)
(FMX.N) and part-owned by Coca Cola Co. (KO.N), KOF produces
Coca-Cola in nine Latin American countries, including Brazil
and Argentina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; KOF is Mexico's biggest non-alcoholic drinks company with
revenues of more than $5 billion annually. The acquisition of
Jugos del Valle, with annual revenue of about $440 million,
will increase its market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Consumers in Mexico quaff more Coca-Cola products per
capita than any other nation in the world, about 40 gallons
(150 litres) of carbonated drinks per person a year, according
to producers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico's competition watchdog, the Federal Competition
Commission, or CFC, nixed the proposed merger in May but on
appeal the regulator gave it the green light with certain
requirements meant to limit the combined company's market
dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The antitrust regulator gave KOF and Coca Cola five years
to eliminate exclusivity deals to sell only their drinks at
leading convenience store chain Oxxo, which is owned by KOF's
parent company, Femsa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also, the companies may not make exclusivity agreements
with small convenience stores. And where Coca-Cola and KOF pay
for refrigerators to sell Coca-Cola products in corner stores,
refrigerators must also be provided to sell competing brands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexican President Felipe Calderon, who took office in
December, has said he wants more competition in industries
where a handful of companies dominate. But so far his
government has taken little concrete action against firms that
dominate certain industries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New York-traded shares of KOF gained 0.46 percent to close
at $47.93. Jugos del Valle's VALLEB.MX stock rose 0.05
percent to 63.50 pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jugos del Valle also said on Wednesday it was fined
$181,000 by the Mexico's securities regulator for providing
inadequate information to media and investors last year before
the sale was announced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Jugos del Valle more than doubled in the five
weeks before it announced the deal in December.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) on Wednesday reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings on competition with generics, and said global sales of cholesterol fighter Lipitor fell 13 percent amid slipping demand for the company's flagship product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's biggest drug maker, which affirmed its 2007 and 2008 profit forecasts, said it earned $1.27 billion, or 18 cents per share in the period. That compares with $2.42 billion, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Excluding special items, New York-based Pfizer earned 42 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 50 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, hurt by the recent loss of patent protection on its anti-depressant Zoloft and blood pressure treatment Norvasc, said global company revenue fell 6 percent to $11.08 billion. That was shy of Wall Street expectations of $11.44 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said sales of Lipitor, by far the world's biggest drug, rose 5 percent overseas but tumbled 25 percent in the important U.S. market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It attributed Lipitor's U.S. freefall to declining prescriptions of the medicine, now facing competition from far cheaper generic forms of Merck &amp; Co's (MRK.N) Zocor, and by patterns of stocking by wholesalers and related factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The wholesaler inventory patterns should not have a negative impact on U.S. Lipitor sales during the rest of the year, New York-based Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Derek Caney; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

Inc. (PHM.N), the No. 3 U.S. home builder, said late on
Tuesday it expects a second-quarter loss. Pulte shares fell
2.3 percent to $22.19 on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PFIZER, INTEL DISAPPOINT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) fell 3.2 percent to $25.13 after the
drug maker reported earnings and revenues that missed Wall

the market's expectations, driving its stock down 4.8 percent
to $25.06 on the Nasdaq. Internet media company Yahoo reported
a dip in quarterly profit, sending its shares down 4.8 percent
to $26.20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With so much else going on, normally market-moving
indicators took a back seat. U.S. consumer prices rose by a
slightly bigger-than-expected 0.2 percent in June, the Labor
Department reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Building permits -- a measure of future construction plans
--plunged, but housing starts rose last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Trading was moderate on the NYSE, with about 1.77 billion
shares changing hands, below last year's estimated daily
average of 1.84 billion, while on Nasdaq, about 2.27 billion
shares traded, above last year's daily average of 2.02
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Declining stocks outnumbered advancing ones by a ratio of
about 2 to 1 on the NYSE and by about 3 to 2 on Nasdaq.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) on Wednesday reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings on competition with generics and a surprisingly big 13 percent decline in sales of its best-selling Lipitor cholesterol fighter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest drug maker, whose shares fell almost 4 percent, said it earned $1.27 billion, or 18 cents per share in the second quarter. That compares with $2.42 billion, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excluding special items, New York-based Pfizer earned 42 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 50 cents, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company affirmed its 2007 and 2008 profit forecasts, but investors and industry analysts remained skeptical. HSBC analyst Kevin Scotcher cut his rating on Pfizer to "neutral," saying the results called into question whether Pfizer can meet its earnings targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that a loss of confidence in a single quarter is enough to persuade investors to defer a decision to buy Pfizer," Scotcher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, hurt by the recent loss of patent protection on its anti-depressant Zoloft and blood pressure treatment Norvasc, said global company revenue fell 6 percent to $11.08 billion. That was shy of Wall Street expectations of $11.44 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regarding Lipitor, we are in a tough battle," Pfizer Chief Executive Jeffrey Kindler said, noting the pill was facing "intensely" greater competition from other cholesterol drugs than the company had envisioned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's disappointing results compound a bumpy start to the second-quarter reporting season for drugmakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, rivals Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N) and Novartis AG (NOVN.VX) cut their sales forecasts. However, Abbott Laboratories (ABT.N) on Wednesday encouraged investors with its strong quarterly results and forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While Pfizer's results do not bode well for the group overall, Pfizer's underlying fundamentals are substantially worse than the industry average and thus should not be representative of the group as a whole," Morgan Stanley analyst Jami Rubin said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The New York-based company said sales of Lipitor, by far the world's biggest drug, rose 5 percent overseas but tumbled 25 percent in the important U.S. market. Global Lipitor sales were $2.7 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer attributed Lipitor's U.S. free-fall to declining prescriptions for the medicine, now facing competition from far cheaper generic forms of Merck  Co.'s (MRK.N) Zocor, and by patterns of stocking by wholesalers and related factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wholesaler inventory patterns should not have a negative impact on U.S. Lipitor sales during the rest of the year, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the full year, the company expects Lipitor sales to range from flat to a 5 percent decline compared with 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lipitor, whose U.S. patent could expire as soon as 2010, is showing weakness at a time when Pfizer has no apparent cholesterol medicine to replace it. The company scrapped development of another possible blockbuster cholesterol drug in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aside from Lipitor, sales of schizophrenia drug Geodon, painkiller Celebrex and erectile dysfunction drug Viagra came in below expectations, said Leerink Swann  Co. analyst Seamus Fernandez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geodon sales rose 8 percent to $178 million, while sales of Celebrex edged up 1 percent to $478 million. Viagra sales slipped 3 percent to $382 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sales of Lyrica, its neuropathic pain drug that recently won U.S. approval for fibromyalgia, jumped 49 percent to $405 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's net income was hurt by a number of charges related to restructuring, acquisitions and deals, including payments made to Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMY.N) related to their co-development of a drug to prevent blood clots.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler said Pfizer, which has not produced many big-selling drugs in the past five years, has put a number of initiatives into motion to boost productivity -- including placement of new leaders in its laboratories to "better unleash the creativity of our scientists."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell $1.01 to $24.95 in late afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange, amid a moderate decline for the drug sector. The stock is down about 3 percent in 2007, underperforming a roughly 2.5 percent rise for the American Stock Exchange Pharmaceutical index. .DRG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Lewis Krauskopf)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;         By Henrique Almeida          AMSTERDAM, July 18 (Reuters) - Saturday night and thrill-seekers from around the world crowd the streets of Amsterdam's red-light district ready to binge on sex, drugs and alcohol.          Hey, mister, do you want some cocaine? a man mutters from a dark corner while a blonde prostitute removes her bra in a shop window, to lure customers into her room.          It's no accident the dealer was offering cocaine before he moved on to other drugs. Cocaine use has almost tripled in Europe over the past decade, while U.S. consumption has stabilised, according to U.N. figures released in June.          There is a certain glamour to cocaine in the media which has become very appealing to all sectors of European society, said Peter Thomas, a spokesman for European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in Lisbon.          Portuguese police say a stronger euro is also attracting cocaine smugglers into European cities like Amsterdam, London and Madrid where party-goers can easily pay up to 60 euros ($82.78) to get high on a few lines of the white powder.          Wholesale, the drug in Europe fetches up to $77,000 per kg, almost twice the amount it sells for in the U.S., according to the U.S Drug Enforcement Administration.          Dealers focus their trade in cities with money, Jose Braz, the director of the Department of Narcotics in Portugal, which has become a significant entry-point for cocaine into Europe, told Reuters. There is more and more dirty money in euros.                            AFRICA HUB          There was a lot of euphoria with love-drugs like ecstasy 10 years ago but that is going away now, said an employee of the Magic Mushroom Smartshop near Amsterdam's night club scene in Rembrandtplein square. He identified himself simply as AR.          Coke is cold and ego-boosting and allows people to forget about their insecurities. I suppose the world is becoming a colder place these days, he added.          Europe's demand for cocaine may be growing but the real test for the Latin American cartels is breaking into Europe's sophisticated external borders and airports.          The solution normally comes in the form of bribes.          According to the United Nations, cartels increasingly rely on corrupt officials in poor West African nations like Guinea Bissau, a tiny former Portuguese colony, to store the cocaine before it is smuggled into Europe's booming market.          These criminals are entrepreneurs. They see a window of opportunity and immediately jump in, said Braz, who worked with Bissau police recently to help fight cocaine smuggling.          In April, Guinea Bissau's police was commended by the United Nations for seizing over 600 kg of cocaine -- worth more than 30 million euros -- but it was later discovered the traffickers had still managed to escape with about 2.5 tonnes of the drug.          It is regrettable that the rest of the consignment was not intercepted, but hardly surprising as the police were woefully ill-equipped and often do not have enough gasoline to operate their vehicles, said Antonio Costa, the Executive Director of the UN's Office of Drugs and Crime.          In a statement to authorities in Bissau, Costa urged them to ensure that the seized cocaine would not disappear like previous drug busts.          The cocaine that eludes authorities is normally split among hundreds of smugglers willing to risk hefty jail sentences to enter Europe through countries like Portugal and Spain.          Last year, police in both countries, which have strong geographical and cultural ties with Africa and historic links with Latin America, seized a combined 70 tonnes of cocaine, about the same amount that was seized in all of Europe in 2004.          We are now a key entry point of drugs into Europe, said Braz.                            MULES          But record drug busts in 2006 and 2007 in Europe have prompted cartels to turn to people who are willing to fly to Europe with cocaine hidden in bags or inside their bodies for up to 5,000 euros -- a small sum considering the risks involved.          What we have found is that drug mules have increasingly been used to smuggle the drug through airports, said Peter Thomas from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.          Last week, two British teenage girls were arrested at Accra airport in Ghana, allegedly carrying 300,000 pounds ($609,500) worth of cocaine in laptop bags.           But unlike the movie Maria Full of Grace, which portrays a teenage women as a drug mule, most of the mules are still young men like Jackson, a 27-year-old architect from Venezuela, who was caught in Lisbon trying to bring the drug into Europe.          Trapped in a downward spiral of debt and with a family to provide for, Jackson boarded a flight from Caracas to Amsterdam via Lisbon in June last year with one kg of cocaine inside his stomach and two kg strapped around his body.          The deal was to deliver 3 kilos of cocaine in Amsterdam but I couldn't swallow all the capsules and was afraid to die. So I hid some of the drugs on my body, Jackson told a Lisbon-based judge at his first hearing after being arrested.          He now faces at least five years in prison and fears reprisals against his family back home from the drug cartel which hired him to do the job, but he is lucky to be alive.          For Europeans, like the group of men waiting outside the bathroom of a popular club in Amsterdam to snort another line, the party goes on. Or so they hope.          They may forget about their problems when they're high but reality will eventually sink in. I just hope most of them are able to cope with it, said AR.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N) said on Wednesday it tripled the amount set aside for loan losses as even borrowers with good credit defaulted on home equity loans, hurting the bank's quarterly profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The negative trend provides a new worry for investors. Until now, most of the angst has been focused on subprime lending, or loans to people with weak credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's stock, a Dow 30 component, sank $1.75 or 3.5 percent to $48.17 in early afternoon trade and was one of the biggest losers in the Dow Jones industrial average. The index was off about 1 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chief Financial Officer Mike Cavanagh said losses on home equity loans to prime borrowers, or those with good credit, will steepen, partly because U.S. housing prices have flattened or fallen in some areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The No. 3 U.S. bank said second-quarter net income was $4.2 billion, or $1.20 a share, compared with $3.5 billion, or 99 cents a share, a year earlier. That beat analysts' average estimate of $1.08 a share, helped by a sharp rise in investment banking revenue and big gains from private equity deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the bank set aside $1.53 billion for loan losses, up from $493 million a year earlier. About a one-third of the increase resulted from higher loss estimates on home equity loans in which borrowers had little equity in houses with falling values.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo estimated that the extra money set aside for loan losses reduced JPMorgan's earnings by about $350 million, or 10 cents a share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's definitely a change in trend that we're reacting to," Cavanagh told reporters on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank bolstered its reserve for loan losses to make the transition from a benign credit environment to one that is expected to get worse, the executives said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The loan loss reserve increase has investors spooked," said Kenneth Crawford, a portfolio manager at Argent Capital, which owns about $12 million in JPMorgan stock. "Credit quality is decreasing and it's a moving target."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WEAK SPOTS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said regional banking and auto finance were weak spots in the quarter, with profit in those areas declining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank's retail finance division set aside $587 million, part of the overall loan loss reserve number, up from $100 million a year earlier, to reflect weak housing prices and the resulting increase in losses on home equity loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cavanagh said the bank had problems with home equity loans started by independent mortgage brokers. The bank has since tightened underwriting standards and raised prices to reflect elevated risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's overall net revenue rose 25 percent to $18.9 billion, higher than the $17.5 billion expected by analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking continued to be a bright spot as JPMorgan raked in fees from merger and acquisition advice. Investment banking revenue surged 34 percent to $5.8 billion, from $4.3 billion a year earlier. The first quarter was better, though, at $6.3 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The take-away message from JPMorgan's results is that even better operators are going to catch some flak from weak spots in the mortgage and leveraged lending markets," analysts at independent research firm CreditSights said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chairman Jamie Dimon slammed loaning cash upfront on leveraged buyout deals, calling it a terrible idea. But JPMorgan and other big banks make these loans to keep prized private equity clients happy, despite a big potential downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think equity bridges are a terrible idea," Dimon said during the conference call. "...I don't think they're good for the private equity guys, so I hope they go the way of the dinosaur because they're basically a one-sided put on our balance sheet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, the bank's retail financial services division, which includes home loans, credit cards and auto financing, reported $785 million in net income, down 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's asset management business saw profit soar 44 percent to $493 million as the unit took in more money from clients. The unit now has $1.1 trillion under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tim McLaughlin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details throughout)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Tim Mclaughlin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N)
Chairman James Dimon on Wednesday called the practice loaning
cash upfront on leveraged buyout deals a terrible idea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon, one of Wall Street's most influential bankers,
criticized so-called equity bridges during a conference call
with analysts and investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan and other big banks make these loans to keep
prized private equity clients happy, despite a big potential
downside.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Equity bridge loans allow private equity firms to get
investment banks to share in the cash payment on deals. Such
loans are great for buyout firms wanting to pursue takeovers
without joining forces with competitors, but carry huge risk
and skimpy pay-offs for the investment banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think equity bridges are a terrible idea," Dimon said.
"I think they're bad -- I think they're a bad financial policy.
I don't think they're good for the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These commitments are a descendant of bridge loans, which
assure clients funds needed for a deal will be delivered. But
this financial product led to huge losses for Wall Street after
markets tumbled in the late 1980s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup Inc (C.N) and RBS Securities (RBS.L) recently
arranged an equity bridge of $450 million in a $25 billion
leveraged buyout of wireless company Alltel Corp (AT.N),
according to filings with securities regulators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And JPMorgan joined two other banks in offering a $1
billion equity bridge in an LBO offer for Texas utility TXU
Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I don't think they're good for the private equity guys, so
I hope they go the way of the dinosaur because they're
basically a one-sided put on our balance sheet," Dimon added.
"I also think the street is topped up on them. There is only so
much you can do and feel comfortable with."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon said it is "kind of silly" to take that downside risk
and have none of the upside potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We feel fine about the ones because we underwrite," he
said. ... "We try to underwrite those as if we're going to own
them. ... "Otherwise, we don't want to be involved in them."

&lt;p&gt;(Corrects year-ago loan loss reserve figure in third paragraph to million from billion)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By Tim McLaughlin&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co. (JPM.N) said on Wednesday it tripled the amount it set aside for loan losses as home equity borrowers missed payments, hurting the bank's second-quarter net income growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The third-largest U.S. bank said net income was $4.2 billion, or $1.20 a share, compared with $3.5 billion, or 99 cents a share, in the year-earlier period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That beat the average analysts' estimate of $1.08 a share, but the bank said it set aside $1.53 billion for loan losses, up from $493 million in the year-ago quarter. Much of that increase comes from higher loss estimates on home equity loans given to borrowers who put little money down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares slipped 72 cents to $49.20 in electronic trade before the market opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan also said regional banking and auto finance were weak spots, as profits in those areas declined. The bank's retail finance division set aside $587 million for loan losses, up from $100 million in the year-earlier period, to reflect weak housing prices and the resulting increase in losses on home equity loans that had small down payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Home equity loans originated in the wholesale channel caused problems, the bank said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York State sued Exxon Mobil Corp 
on Tuesday to force the cleanup of a decades-old, 17 million 
gallon oil spill in New York City.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit concerns a leak that was discovered in 1978 in 
Newtown Creek, the waterway that separates the boroughs of 
Queens and Brooklyn. It has formed an underground contamination 
over 55-acres of the Greenpoint section of Brooklyn, the 
lawsuit says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides the cleanup, the lawsuit asks Exxon to restore the 
creek and is seeking substantial financial penalties and 
damages for the injuries to financial resources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This company cannot ignore the harm its oil spill has 
caused to the environment and residents of Greenpoint, 
Brooklyn," New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said in 
a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This suit sends the message that even the largest 
corporations in the world cannot escape the consequences of 
their misdeeds," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cuomo filed a notice of intent to sue the company last 
February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The allegations made by the New York State attorney 
general are not supported by the facts and are unfounded," 
Exxon Mobil spokesman Barry Wood said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon Mobil takes its environmental responsibility very 
seriously, and our policy is to comply with all applicable 
environmental laws and regulations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the company would vigorously defend against the 
lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greenpoint, a waterfront neighborhood that is a longtime 
home to Polish immigrants and more recently to hipsters, was an 
industrial hub for shipbuilding, iron making and refining 
before World War II.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's property on the creek was the site of one of the 
earliest refineries of original U.S. oil giant Standard Oil, 
but most of the refinery structures were decommissioned and 
demolished after 1969.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mobil Corp, acquired by Exxon in 1999, used some of the 
property for bulk storage operations until 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the 
Eastern District of New York, located in Brooklyn. U.S. 
District Judge Carol Amon has been assigned to hear the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In February, Cuomo also filed notices of intent to sue BP 
Plc, Chevron Corp, utility KeySpan Corp and mining company 
Phelps Dodge, which has since been acquired by 
Freeport-McMoRan, over contamination in the creek. No suits 
have been filed against those companies yet, but a source close 
to the lawsuit said conversations were ongoing with the other 
companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The third-largest U.S. bank said net income was $4.2

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Saturday night and thrill-seekers from around the world crowd the streets of Amsterdam's red-light district ready to binge on sex, drugs and alcohol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Hey, mister, do you want some cocaine?" a man mutters from a dark corner while a blonde prostitute removes her bra in a shop window, to lure customers into her room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no accident the dealer was offering cocaine before he moved on to other drugs. Cocaine use has almost tripled in Europe over the past decade, while U.S. consumption has stabilized, according to U.N. figures released in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a certain glamour to cocaine in the media which has become very appealing to all sectors of European society," said Peter Thomas, a spokesman for European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction (EMCDDA) in Lisbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Portuguese police say a stronger euro is also attracting cocaine smugglers into European cities like Amsterdam, London and Madrid where party-goers can easily pay up to 60 euros ($82.78) to get high on a few lines of the white powder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wholesale, the drug in Europe fetches up to $77,000 per kg, almost twice the amount it sells for in the U.S., according to the U.S Drug Enforcement Administration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dealers focus their trade in cities with money," Jose Braz, the director of the Department of Narcotics in Portugal, which has become a significant entry-point for cocaine into Europe, told Reuters. "There is more and more dirty money in euros."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AFRICA HUB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There was a lot of euphoria with love-drugs like ecstasy 10 years ago but that is going away now," said an employee of the Magic Mushroom Smartshop near Amsterdam's night club scene in Rembrandtplein square. He identified himself simply as AR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Coke is cold and ego-boosting and allows people to forget about their insecurities. I suppose the world is becoming a colder place these days," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Europe's demand for cocaine may be growing but the real test for the Latin American cartels is breaking into Europe's sophisticated external borders and airports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution normally comes in the form of bribes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the United Nations, cartels increasingly rely on corrupt officials in poor West African nations like Guinea Bissau, a tiny former Portuguese colony, to store the cocaine before it is smuggled into Europe's booming market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These criminals are entrepreneurs. They see a window of opportunity and immediately jump in," said Braz, who worked with Bissau police recently to help fight cocaine smuggling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Guinea Bissau's police was commended by the United Nations for seizing over 600 kg of cocaine -- worth more than 30 million euros -- but it was later discovered the traffickers had still managed to escape with about 2.5 tonnes of the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is regrettable that the rest of the consignment was not intercepted, but hardly surprising as the police were woefully ill-equipped and often do not have enough gasoline to operate their vehicles," said Antonio Costa, the Executive Director of the U.N.'s Office of Drugs and Crime.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement to authorities in Bissau, Costa urged them to ensure that the seized cocaine would not "disappear" like previous drug busts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cocaine that eludes authorities is normally split among hundreds of smugglers willing to risk hefty jail sentences to enter Europe through countries like Portugal and Spain.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, police in both countries, which have strong geographical and cultural ties with Africa and historic links with Latin America, seized a combined 70 tonnes of cocaine, about the same amount that was seized in all of Europe in 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are now a key entry point of drugs into Europe," said Braz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MULES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But record drug busts in 2006 and 2007 in Europe have prompted cartels to turn to people who are willing to fly to Europe with cocaine hidden in bags or inside their bodies for up to 5,000 euros -- a small sum considering the risks involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we have found is that drug mules have increasingly been used to smuggle the drug through airports," said Peter Thomas from the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, two British teenage girls were arrested at Accra airport in Ghana, allegedly carrying 300,000 pounds ($609,500) worth of cocaine in laptop bags.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But unlike the movie Maria Full of Grace, which portrays a teenage women as a drug mule, most of the mules are still young men like Jackson, a 27-year-old architect from Venezuela, who was caught in Lisbon trying to bring the drug into Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Trapped in a downward spiral of debt and with a family to provide for, Jackson boarded a flight from Caracas to Amsterdam via Lisbon in June last year with one kg of cocaine inside his stomach and two kg strapped around his body.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The deal was to deliver 3 kilos of cocaine in Amsterdam but I couldn't swallow all the capsules and was afraid to die. So I hid some of the drugs on my body," Jackson told a Lisbon-based judge at his first hearing after being arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He now faces at least five years in prison and fears reprisals against his family back home from the drug cartel which hired him to do the job, but he is lucky to be alive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Europeans, like the group of men waiting outside the bathroom of a popular club in Amsterdam to snort another line, the party goes on. Or so they hope.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They may forget about their problems when they're high but reality will eventually sink in. I just hope most of them are able to cope with it," said AR.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Sofia Van Holle in Lisbon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase are hastily selling some of the assets of troubled Australian hedge fund Basis Capital, the Wall Street Journal reported on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The assets were among a long list of subprime-related bonds being sold by Wall Street firms in an effort to contain losses amidst turmoil in structured credit markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Basis Capital suspended withdrawals from its flagship fund, days after informing investors that the investment house had been swept up in the U.S. sub-prime mortgage crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The current situation in structured credit markets is currently extremely uncertain which has resulted in difficulty valuing the underlying investments of the funds. For that reason, we have decided to suspend applications and redemptions," said the firm's Managing Director Stuart Fowler, in a brief statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Basis Yield Fund, with net assets of A$341 million ($296 million) in net assets, fell by just under 13.7 percent and Basis Aust-Rim Fund, with A$316 million in net assets, fell by 9.2 percent in June, according to a report by the Australian Financial Review.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ratings agency Standard and Poor's was due to talk to the hedge fund to discuss the underperformance of the funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The troubled funds are rated five stars, the highest rank by SP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment research provider Van Eyk said it put the ratings of Basis Capital's funds on hold on Friday. The research house had previously downgraded the funds but did not give more details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Van Eyk holds a minor interest in Basis Capital with less than A$1 million out of a A$1.6 billion fund. The firm has been redeeming its stake since July 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Basis Capital's turmoil follows the collapse of two of Bear Stearns Cos. Inc.'s BSC.N hedge funds which bet heavily on risky subprime loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bear Stearns told investors on Tuesday the funds now have "very little value." The losses sent a benchmark index of subprime mortgage bonds to record lows, reflecting concern that the worst is not yet over for the US$7 trillion market for mortgage-related bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=$1.15)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Joseph A. Giannone &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), the world's largest investment bank, said on Thursday it is building a third office tower in the New York City area to accommodate rapid growth in its staff.  Goldman on Wednesday received approval from Jersey City, New Jersey, to build a 30-story, $560 million office building on property directly across the Hudson River from lower Manhattan. The firm already has a 42-story, $1.3 billion Jersey City tower, and is building a new 42-story headquarters in the Battery Park City area of lower Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman has grown at an explosive rate since its 1999 initial public offering, and its need for space has increased. Total employees have nearly tripled to 26,000 from 9,000 in that time, with 13,000 based in the New York City region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The new tower, which would hold 3,500 front and back office workers, will be built on land owned by Goldman, located next to the current Jersey City tower site.   Once again, the world's most profitable bank will get a helping hand from local taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Jersey City's Municipal Council granted a property tax break worth $4 million a year for the building, already approved by the city's planning department. Goldman said it would probably begin construction in 2009, the time it expects to complete its $2.4 billion headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Two years ago Goldman received some of the largest ever financial benefits from New York City in exchange for its promise to keep 9,000 employees and add 4,000 in Manhattan. That deal raised eyebrows since Goldman's current Jersey tower is only 60 percent occupied and still has room for 3,000 more staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    New York state and city officials, eager to keep companies in a downtown still recovering from the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, provided $1.65 billion in "Liberty Bonds" and $140 million in tax breaks and cash, as well as a sharp reduction in other payments in lieu of taxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Joseph Giannone, editing by Richard Chang; Reuters messaging: joseph.giannone.reuters.com@reuters.net;+1 646 223 6184)) Keywords: GOLDMANSACHS JERSEYCITY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Neil Shah &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - A closely watched gauge of investor sentiment on risky subprime home loans may not have much further to fall, analysts at J.P. Morgan Securities said during a conference call on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are near, we think, a bottom in that sector," said Christopher Flanagan, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The fundamental outlook for subprime credit remains very bleak," Flanagan said, referring to subprime mortgages, or home loans granted to borrowers with patchy credit histories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The good news, though, is that the most visible pricing in the market, the ABX index, we believe, has already priced in most of this bad news that is to come." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The ABX derivative index is a popular tool used to hedge risks tied to risky mortgage loans. The index has plummeted in recent weeks on a surge in defaults on subprime loans and worries about fallout from the near collapse of two hedge funds run by Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N that made bad bets on subprime investments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The index includes five separate sub-indexes that reference a different ratings category: AAA, AA, A, BBB and BBB-minus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The riskiest portion of the ABX 2007-1 index, which references loans made in last year's second half, has tumbled roughly 50 percent this year as defaults and delinquencies on subprime loans increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This surge in defaults has also prompted Wall Street credit rating agencies to downgrade billions of dollars worth of bonds tied to such loans, rattling financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    J.P. Morgan's Flanagan said the 2007-1 index's "BBB-minus" and "BBB" tiers, along with similar tiers of the 2006-2 index, have priced in "80 to 85 percent of the bad news." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The ABX 2007-1 "BBB-minus" index is trading at 46 on Thursday, according to a trader, having bounced back slightly from its record low of 45 on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The newest benchmark ABX series, tied to subprime loans made in this year's first half, climbed 3.5 points to 52.5 in its debut session on Thursday, traders said. For details, see [nN19217259]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We think the double-A and triple-A (portions of the index), at least as of yesterday, were substantially undervalued on a fundamental basis and should have been bought," Flanagan also said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In recent sessions, weakness in the ABX index has moved higher from the most actively traded tier -- the "BBB-minus" tier -- to even the highest-rated "AAA" tier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Neil Shah, editing by Kenneth Barry; Reuters Messaging:neil.shah.reuters.com@reuters.net; e-mail:neil.shah@reuters.com; Tel 1-646-223-6324)) Keywords: USA SUBPRIME/JPMORGAN &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) posted a 7 percent gain in net profit as demand for its Office software and improved results from its online arm more than compensated for a $1.1 billion charge to repair Xbox video game consoles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also slightly raised full-year earnings and revenue forecasts citing demand for new software products like its Windows Server 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said on Thursday net profit was $3.04 billion, or 31 cents per diluted share, in its fiscal fourth quarter, up from $2.83 billion, or 28 cents per diluted share, a year earlier. Sales rose 13 percent to $13.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earnings met analysts' expectations while sales were slightly better than the target of $13.27 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They beat by a little bit and raised by a little bit," said Jane Snorek, technology analyst at First American Funds. "There were some expectations that with this PC boom we would see some big upside, but I guess not."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But strong personal computer sales did not pay off as much as some analysts had hoped, and shares dipped about 2 percent in extended trade to $30.88 after closing at $31.51 on Nasdaq. It had run up nearly 6 percent since Monday on expectations of good results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it estimated the personal computer market to have grown between 11 percent and 13 percent in the past three months. The company forecast PC market growth of 9 percent to 11 percent this year with Windows sales expected to move in line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Many of the same factors that helped us be successful in 2007, such as a healthy PC hardware market, customer acceptance of our new versions of Office and Windows ... will help propel us in 2008," Microsoft Chief Financial Officer Chris Liddell said on a conference call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current quarter, Microsoft sees diluted earnings per share of between 38 cents and 40 cents, based on a revenue range of $12.4 billion to $12.6 billion. The average estimates of Wall Street analysts are for earnings per share of 38 cents on sales of $12.5 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company lifted both ends of its fiscal 2008 earnings-per-share forecast range by a penny, to $1.69 to $1.73. The fiscal 2008 revenue range was raised $300 million to a range of $56.8 billion to $57.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XBOX AIMS FOR PROFIT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker had warned earlier this month that it would incur a charge of up to $1.15 billion in the quarter ended in June to fix an "unacceptable" number of Xbox 360 repairs and offer a new extended warranty to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it still aims for its entertainment and devices division to turn profitable in fiscal 2008, with a boost expected from the September release of "Halo 3," the latest installment of one of the best-selling game franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said the Microsoft Business division, home to its Office business, posted a 19 percent rise in revenue to $4.63 billion, exceeding its sales expectations by $200 million on the back of Office 2007 demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its online services group notched a third-straight quarter of revenue growth with an increase of 19 percent from a year earlier, boosted by a 33 percent rise in Web advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The segment's improved sales still did not lead the division to profit. Microsoft's 19 percent sales growth at its online unit also pales in comparison to Google Inc.'s (GOOG.O) 58 percent revenue growth in the prior quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's server and tools business expects revenue to grow 14 percent to 15 percent this year, boosted by several new products being introduced, including Windows Server 2008 and SQL Server 2008 database software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft stock has risen 6 percent in the year to date, compared with a 10 percent gain in the SP 500 during the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Additional reporting by Gina Keating in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

Sales rose 13 percent to $13.4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The earnings met analysts' expectations for profit of 31 cents per share while sales were slightly better than the forecast of $13.27 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They beat by a little bit and raised by a little bit," said Jane Snorek, technology analyst at First American Funds. "There were some expectations that with this PC boom we would see some big upside, but I guess not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it estimated the personal computer market to have grown between 11 percent and 13 percent in the past three months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Microsoft fell in extended trade to $31.08 after closing at $31.51 on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software maker had warned earlier this month that it would incur a charge of up to $1.15 billion in the quarter ended in June to fix an "unacceptable" number of Xbox 360 repairs and offer a new extended warranty to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the current quarter, Microsoft sees diluted earnings per share of between 38 cents and 40 cents, based on a revenue range of $12.4 billion to $12.6 billion. The average estimates of Wall Street analysts are for earnings per share of 38 cents on sales of $12.5 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company lifted its fiscal 2008 earnings-per-share forecast range to $1.69 to $1.73 from its previous estimate of $1.68 to $1.72. It lifted its fiscal 2008 revenue range to between $56.8 billion and $57.8 billion from its prior forecast of $56.5 billion to $57.5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it continued to see strong adoption of its new Windows Vista operating system and Office 2007 business software, launched earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said the Microsoft Business division, home to its Office business, posted a 19 percent rise in revenue to $4.63 billion, exceeding its sales expectations by $200 million on the back of Office 2007 demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its online services group notched a third-straight quarter of revenue growth with an increase of 19 percent from a year earlier, boosted by a 33 percent rise in Web advertising.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stock has risen 6 percent in the year to date, compared with a 10 percent gain in the SP 500 during the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Daisuke Wakabayashi; Additional reporting by Gina Keating in Los Angeles)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Joseph A. Giannone &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N), the world's largest investment bank, said on Thursday it is building a third office tower in the New York City area to accommodate rapid growth in its staff.  Goldman on Wednesday received approval from Jersey City, New Jersey, to build a 30-story, $560 million office building on property directly across the Hudson River from lower Manhattan. The firm already has a 42-story, $1.3 billion Jersey City tower, and is building a new 42-story headquarters in the Battery Park City area of lower Manhattan. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Goldman has grown at an explosive rate since its 1999 initial public offering, and its need for space has increased. Total employees have nearly tripled to 26,000 from 9,000 in that time, with 13,000 based in the New York City region. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The new tower, which would hold 3,500 front and back office workers, will be built on land owned by Goldman, located next to the current Jersey City tower site.   Once again, the world's most profitable bank will get a helping hand from local taxpayers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Jersey City's Municipal Council granted a property tax break worth $4 million a year for the building, already approved by the city's planning department. Goldman said it would probably begin construction in 2009, the time it expects to complete its $2.4 billion headquarters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Two years ago Goldman received some of the largest ever financial benefits from New York City in exchange for its promise to keep 9,000 employees and add 4,000 in Manhattan. That deal raised eyebrows since Goldman's current Jersey tower is only 60 percent occupied and still has room for 3,000 more staff. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    New York state and city officials, eager to keep companies in a downtown still recovering from the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks, provided $1.65 billion in "Liberty Bonds" and $140 million in tax breaks and cash, as well as a sharp reduction in other payments in lieu of taxes. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Joseph Giannone, editing by Richard Chang; Reuters messaging: joseph.giannone.reuters.com@reuters.net;+1 646 223 6184)) Keywords: GOLDMANSACHS JERSEYCITY &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    By Neil Shah &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - A closely watched gauge of investor sentiment on risky subprime home loans may not have much further to fall, analysts at J.P. Morgan Securities said during a conference call on Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We are near, we think, a bottom in that sector," said Christopher Flanagan, an analyst at J.P. Morgan Securities in New York. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The fundamental outlook for subprime credit remains very bleak," Flanagan said, referring to subprime mortgages, or home loans granted to borrowers with patchy credit histories. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "The good news, though, is that the most visible pricing in the market, the ABX index, we believe, has already priced in most of this bad news that is to come." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The ABX derivative index is a popular tool used to hedge risks tied to risky mortgage loans. The index has plummeted in recent weeks on a surge in defaults on subprime loans and worries about fallout from the near collapse of two hedge funds run by Bear Stearns Cos. Inc. BSC.N that made bad bets on subprime investments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The index includes five separate sub-indexes that reference a different ratings category: AAA, AA, A, BBB and BBB-minus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The riskiest portion of the ABX 2007-1 index, which references loans made in last year's second half, has tumbled roughly 50 percent this year as defaults and delinquencies on subprime loans increased. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    This surge in defaults has also prompted Wall Street credit rating agencies to downgrade billions of dollars worth of bonds tied to such loans, rattling financial markets. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    J.P. Morgan's Flanagan said the 2007-1 index's "BBB-minus" and "BBB" tiers, along with similar tiers of the 2006-2 index, have priced in "80 to 85 percent of the bad news." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The ABX 2007-1 "BBB-minus" index is trading at 46 on Thursday, according to a trader, having bounced back slightly from its record low of 45 on Wednesday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The newest benchmark ABX series, tied to subprime loans made in this year's first half, climbed 3.5 points to 52.5 in its debut session on Thursday, traders said. For details, see [nN19217259]. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We think the double-A and triple-A (portions of the index), at least as of yesterday, were substantially undervalued on a fundamental basis and should have been bought," Flanagan also said on the call. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    In recent sessions, weakness in the ABX index has moved higher from the most actively traded tier -- the "BBB-minus" tier -- to even the highest-rated "AAA" tier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Neil Shah, editing by Kenneth Barry; Reuters Messaging:neil.shah.reuters.com@reuters.net; e-mail:neil.shah@reuters.com; Tel 1-646-223-6324)) Keywords: USA SUBPRIME/JPMORGAN &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, CEO comments, share movement) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE, July 19 (Reuters) - Biotechnology company ImmuCell Corp. (ICCC.O) said Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE.N) animal health division terminated a product development and marketing agreement for ImmuCell's Mast Out, a treatment for udder inflammation in lactating cows. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Portland, Maine-based ImmuCell hit a year low of $4.12 on Thursday. They were trading down nearly 24 percent at $4.58 in early afternoon trade, making it the third top loser on the Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The product "did not have the high-enough rate of return to keep them (Pfizer) going... but that's a $2.3 billion company, they look at those things a little differently than a company like ImmuCell," Chief Executive of ImmuCell, Michael Brigham, said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ImmuCell, which manufactures products to improve animal health and productivity in the dairy and beef industries, said in a statement that the termination was not due to any unexpected efficacy, technical or regulatory issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer was not immediately available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    PRODUCT HAS POTENTIAL &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Brigham said Mast Out still has potential for ImmuCell. The company intends to carry on development efforts for the product but did not provide any details on future plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bovine Mastitis causes inflammation of the udder and results in reduced quantity and quality of milk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mastitis causes economic loss of about $2 billion per year and is the biggest cause of economic loss to the dairy industry, Brigham added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ImmuCell expects to recognize the remaining deferred income from non-refundable milestone payments received from Pfizer. It sees a related increase of about $602,000 to net income before taxes during the third quarter, with no impact on cash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company posted a net income of $297,000 during the first quarter of 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jennifer Robin Raj in Bangalore) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Himani Sarkar; Reuters Messaging: aruna.jennifer.reuters.com@reuters.net;  within U.S. +1 646 223 8780; outside U.S. +91 80 4135 5800)) Keywords: IMMUCELL CONTRACT/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  (New throughout, previous LONDON) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - The scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency said on Friday it had recommended approval of Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE.N) Celsentri, a new type of treatment for HIV whose approval has been delayed in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) said it had recommended marketing approval of Celsentri, known as maraviroc in the United States, for use with other anti-HIV drugs among adult patients infected with the HIV-1 strain of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But the committee said Celsentri is meant to be used only among CCR5-tropic patients, meaning those whose HIV virus uses the CCR5 co-receptor as a portal into human cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer last month received a so-called approvable letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its twice-a-day maraviroc pill, the first drug designed to keep the HIV virus that causes AIDS from entering healthy cells of the immune system. Older HIV medicines attack the virus itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said the FDA would approve maraviroc once certain conditions were met, but it did not specify the requirements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Committee for Medicinal Products on Friday said it had also recommended approval in Europe of Pfizer's Ecalta &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(anidulafungin) as a treatment for invasive candidiasis in adult patients who have normal levels of infection-fighting immune system cells called neutrophils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Invasive candidiasis is an infection that occurs when the Candida species of fungus enters the bloodstream, where it can then spread througout the body. People at greatest risk of the fungal condition are low-birthweight babies, surgery patients and those with immune deficiencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Recommendations for marketing approval by the Committee for Medicinal Products are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York, Jonathan Cable in London) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Editing by Leslie Gevirtz; Reuters messaging: rm://jonathan.cable.reuters.com@reuters.net; +44 20 7542 4688;  Email jonathan.cable@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER ECALTA CELSENTRI/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details of other bidders, Imperial comments)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Jeffrey Jones&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CALGARY, Alberta, July 19 (Reuters) - Imperial Oil Ltd.
(IMO.TO) and Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) won exploration rights
in Canada's Beaufort Sea after bidding to spend C$585 million
($563 million) on a work program in the far northern region,
Imperial said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imperial, Canada's biggest oil producer and refiner, said
the acreage adds to an already large resource base in the
Beaufort, where there have been numerous oil and gas
discoveries over the years but no current production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The five-year license covers 205,321 hectares (507,300
acres), effectively doubling Imperial's net acreage in the
Beaufort, spokesman Gordon Wong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imperial has not drilled a well in the region since
1989-90, Wong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2006, U.S. independent Devon Energy Corp. (DVN.N)
finished drilling the first Beaufort well in 15 years, but the
C$60 million effort failed to yield hoped-for quantities of
natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Imperial and Exxon Mobil are 50-50 partners in the northern
venture.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They are also proponents of the proposed C$16.2 billion
Mackenzie Valley pipeline in Canada's Arctic, which has
suffered surging costs and regulatory delays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any Beaufort gas discoveries would need a pipeline to link
production to southern markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although the Arctic remains a high potential,
technology-intensive frontier area, this presents a potential
opportunity to add to our resource base in the Beaufort Sea and
is consistent with our continued interest in energy development
for Canada," Imperial Vice-President Randy Broiles said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the license terms, Imperial must spend at least
C$73.1 million, it said. Exxon Mobil owns 69.6 percent of
Imperial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indian and Northern Affairs Canada, the government agency
responsible for resource development in the far north, awarded
two other parcels after a call for bids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips (COP.N) won rights to a 103,711 hectare
(256,200 acre) block after bidding to spend C$12 million, and
Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) acquired a 108,185 hectare (267,100 acre)
license for about C$1 million, the agency said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ($1=$1.04 Canadian)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goodman Global Inc. GGL.N, which manufactures commercial heating and air-conditioning units, has hired Goldman Sachs (GS.N) to explore strategic options, including a possible sale of the company, three sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private equity firm Apollo Management owns about 40 percent of the company, which went public in April 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company rose 12 percent to $24.85 on the news.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a matter of practice, we do not comment on any rumors," said Goodman spokeswoman Sue Ellen Nutt. Goldman Sachs and Apollo declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sources said that private equity firms are pursuing the company, though the process that Goldman is running is in its early stages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harold Goodman founded the business in 1975 to make products that would simplify the installation of central air conditioning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, it is one of the largest U.S. makers of heating, ventilation and air-conditioning products. Goodman makes air conditioners, heat pumps and blowers.

early stages.

&lt;p&gt; By Kristina Cooke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Thursday
after earnings from companies such as IBM and Juniper Networks
topped expectations, moving the spotlight back onto profit
optimism, away from subprime mortgage concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of International Business Machines Corp. (IBM.N),
the world's largest technology services company, rose 4.3
percent after it posted a jump in quarterly profit and raised
its 2007 earnings forecast. For details, see [ID:nN18415715].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A 12 percent gain in the shares of network equipment maker
Juniper Networks Inc. JNPR.O helped the Nasdaq Composite
index hit a 6 1/2-year intraday high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You had some decent earnings reports today. The global
economy continues to grow at a strong pace and a lot of the
U.S. large caps have significant exposure there, so you see a
nice run-up." said Michael Church, senior portfolio manager at
Church Capital Management in Philadelphia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up 63.41
points, or 0.46 percent, at 13,981.63. The Standard  Poor's

quarterly profit and lifted its full-year earnings outlook.
[ID:nN18354345]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hewlett-Packard Co.(HPQ.N) shares climbed after research

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Shares of IBM(IBM.N), the world's largest technology services company, rose to their highest price since January 2002 on Thursday after the company reported its largest quarterly revenue gain since 2001.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM shares were up $4.50, or 4.1 percent, at $115.58 in midday trading after reaching $116.48 earlier in the day. The stock was the best performer on the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which added 0.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM said on Wednesday that second-quarter net income rose 12 percent as revenue grew 8.6 percent to $23.8 billion, helped by about $5 billion of software-company acquisitions that strengthened the company's most profitable business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The results, which beat analysts' average forecasts, led IBM to raise its 2007 earnings-per-share growth forecast to 14 percent to 15 percent from a May projection of 13 percent to 14 percent growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM is gaining share in virtually every portion of its product and services portfolio thanks to technology, thought, and cost leadership, as well as prudent investments in demand generation for software and services," Citigroup analyst Richard Gardner wrote in a research note on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gardner, who has a "buy" rating on the shares, raised his full-year earnings-per-share estimate for IBM to $7 from $6.91 and increased his target price for the shares to $135 from
$122.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International Business Machines Corp, based in Armonk, New York, said on Wednesday that second-quarter revenue from its software business surged 13 percent to $4.8 billion, with half the growth coming from about $5 billion of software-company acquisitions in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Software is IBM's most profitable business, with a gross profit margin of 84.9 percent in the second quarter compared with 29.8 percent for the global technology services unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs analyst Laura Conigliaro wrote in a note to investors on Thursday that IBM's second-quarter results signal a shift in strategy from one driven mainly by earnings and cash flow to a model based on revenue growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IBM has been increasing spending on sales, marketing and acquisition-related operating expenses in an effort to trade-off some operating leverage for better revenue growth," wrote Conigliaro, who has a "buy" rating on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Conigliaro raised her earnings-per-share estimate for 2007 to $6.99 from $6.85 and boosted her estimate for 2008 to $8.05 from $7.95.

&lt;p&gt;BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia extradited a top cocaine trafficker to the United States on Thursday to face trial, hoping that testimony he gives will help dismantle the Andean country's toughest drug cartel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A handcuffed Luis Hernando Gomez, known as "Scratch," boarded his plane wearing a bullet-proof vest to ward off any last-minute attacks from fellow traffickers or corrupt politicians who fear what he might tell U.S. prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gomez helped run the Norte del Valle drug organization, the last Colombian cartel to manage all areas of the business from coca cultivation to cocaine production and distribution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He got his nickname as a young gangster who, after being grazed in the cheek by a bullet, dismissed the wound as "just a scratch." He co-managed the Norte del Valle empire from 1990 to 2004, according to U.S. federal prosecutors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He can reveal just how deeply drug trafficking has infiltrated Colombia's public institutions," said Mauricio Romero, a Bogota political analyst specializing in illegal groups. "It is not just other traffickers who need to be afraid of what he can say, but corrupt politicians and police as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities say the cartel, based near the western city of Cali, has exported about 500 tons of cocaine since 1999. Colombia's total production of the drug is estimated at between 600 and 700 tons per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gomez, who says he managed 800 of the 6,000 people who worked for the cartel, is wanted on drug smuggling and money laundering charges in New York and Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authorities have Gomez's personal computer, which he said contains files outlining his links with local politicians. He says he "managed" several members of Colombia's Congress and also had eight town mayors on his payroll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That computer is going to do a lot of damage," he said in a March newspaper interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gomez, who paid right-wing paramilitary militias to protect his smuggling routes, was deported from Cuba in February after trying to enter the island with a fake Venezuelan passport.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He turned some of the trophies of his gangster life over to authorities after his arrest, including a Ferrari and two paintings he claims are originals of Baroque master Peter Paul Rubens. Experts are checking the authenticity of the pieces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 18 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) on Wednesday reported lower-than-expected quarterly earnings on competition with generics, and said global sales of cholesterol fighter Lipitor fell 13 percent amid slipping demand for the company's flagship product. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The world's biggest drug maker, which affirmed its 2007 and 2008 profit forecasts, said it earned $1.27 billion, or 18 cents per share in the period. That compares with $2.42 billion, or 33 cents per share, a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Excluding special items, New York-based Pfizer earned 42 cents per share. Analysts on average expected 50 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer, hurt by the recent loss of patent protection on its anti-depressant Zoloft and blood pressure treatment Norvasc, said global company revenue fell 6 percent to $11.08 billion. That was shy of Wall Street expectations of $11.44 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said sales of Lipitor, by far the world's biggest drug, rose 5 percent overseas but tumbled 25 percent in the important U.S. market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    It attributed Lipitor's U.S. freefall to declining prescriptions of the medicine, now facing competition from far cheaper generic forms of Merck &amp; Co's (MRK.N) Zocor, and by patterns of stocking by wholesalers and related factors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The wholesaler inventory patterns should not have a negative impact on U.S. Lipitor sales during the rest of the year, New York-based Pfizer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Derek Caney; Reuters Messaging: ransdell.pierson.reuters.com@reuters.net; 646-223-6034; ransdell.pierson@reuters.com)) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Lewis Krauskopf) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Multimedia versions of Reuters Top News are now available for: * 3000 Xtra: visit topnews.session.rservices.com &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;     * BridgeStation: view story .134 For more information on Top News: topnews.reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N), the world's largest 
technology services company, on Wednesday posted a 12 percent 
jump in quarterly profit and raised its 2007 earnings forecast 
as revenue surged on software-company acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; IBM shares, which hit a five-year high this week, rose 3.3 
percent to $114.72 in after-hours trading following the 
earnings report, which beat analysts' forecasts. The shares had 
added 14 percent this year as of Tuesday's close.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citing the strong results, IBM increased its forecast for 
earnings-per-share growth in 2007 to 14 percent to 15 percent 
from a previous forecast of 13 percent to 14 percent, as it 
benefits from software acquisitions and improved profitability 
in its services division, its largest business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue growth of 8.6 percent, the strongest since 2001, 
was fueled by more than $5 billion of acquisitions of software 
companies in the past year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisitions are part of a strategy by International 
Business Machines Corp., based in Armonk, New York, to boost 
the software business's share of total profit to 50 percent by 
2010 from 40 percent last year. About half of the software 
unit's second-quarter revenue growth of 13 percent, to $4.8 
billion, came from recent purchases, IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The software growth is a highlight," said Jane Snorek, a 
technology analyst at First American Funds, which manages about 
$66 billion, including IBM shares. "Everything here (at IBM) 
centers on the software -- being able to build someone a Web 
platform, a big data center, that they then surround with 
services. They are doing really well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second-quarter net income advanced to $2.26 billion, or 
$1.55 per share, from $2.02 billion, or $1.30 per share, a year 
earlier. Revenue rose to $23.8 billion from $21.9 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. revenue grew 6 percent to $10.1 billion, reversing a 
slowdown in the first quarter, Chief Financial Officer Mark 
Loughridge said on a conference call with analysts. Revenue in 
Europe, the Middle East and Africa rose 13 percent and 
Asia-Pacific revenue was up 10 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "To get double-digit revenue increases in any part of the 
world is good news for them," said Kim Caughey, vice president 
and senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital Group, which has about 
$1.2 billion under management, including IBM shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, had forecast earnings per share of 
$1.47 before certain items and revenue of $23.1 billion, 
according to Reuters Estimates. Second-quarter net income 
included a gain of $81 million, or 5 cents per share, on the 
sale of IBM's printer division earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's gross profit margin improved to 41.8 percent 
in the second quarter from 41.2 percent a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Revenue in IBM's global technology services business rose 
10.1 percent to $8.76 billion. Global business services revenue 
grew 10 percent to $4.34 billion. IBM signed services contracts 
totaling $11.7 billion, compared with $11.1 billion in the 
first quarter and $9.6 billion a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM said on Monday it signed a $1.4 billion outsourcing 
agreement with drug maker AstraZeneca Plc (AZN.L), expanding an 
existing contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've got a good deal list as we go into the third 
quarter," CFO Loughridge said on the conference call. "Our 
objective is for full-year signings growth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Systems and Technology revenue, which includes sales of 
mainframe computers, servers for businesses and microchips, 
advanced 1.8 percent to $5.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM shares trade at about 16 times expected 2007 earnings 
per share, compared with a multiple of 17 for rival 
Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Sue Zeidler and Gina Keating in

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI, July 19 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) listed a
group of Taiwan tech firms, including Advanced Semiconductor
Engineering (2311.TW), the world's top chip packager, among its
best buys for the second half as new tech products spur demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The U.S. investment bank also recommended motherboard maker
Asustek Computer Inc. (2357.TW), components supplier Delta
Electronics (2308.TW), laptop PC maker Compal Electronics
(2324.TW) and smartphone maker High Tech Computer (2498.TW).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe most of the current strong sell-in order flows in
the supply chain are based on tech vendors' high expectations for
2H07," Goldman Sachs wrote in a research report on Thursday.
"As all (computer, communications and consumer)
products should follow a similar seasonal pattern this year and
vendors are concerned about possible component/capacity shortages
on the back of potentially strong 2H07 demand, they have begun to
increase their orders and build inventories for the peak season."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs also recommended D-Link (2332.TW), which makes
networking products, Powerchip Semiconductor 5346.TWO, the
island's biggest DRAM memory chip maker, and chip designer
Mediatek (2454.TW).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank gave "buy" ratings for all these Taiwan
companies, some of which sell to top PC vendors such as Dell Inc.
DELL.O, Hewlett-Packard Co. (HPQ.N) and Apple Inc. (AAPL.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the next 12 months, the stocks had potential upside of
between 3.2 percent and 29.9 percent from their current share
prices, Goldman Sachs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before the report, investors had been enthusiastic on
Taiwan's tech-heavy stock market amid growing optimism over the
outlook for technology demand. Foreign investors have been big
buyers of local stocks recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Taiwan's electronics sub-index .TELI has risen 20 percent
so far this year, helping to send the main TAIEX share index
.TWII to a seven-year high this week.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds Pfizer reaction) By Camillus Eboh ABUJA, July 20 (Reuters) - The Nigerian government will refile an amended suit seeking $6.5 billion in damages from U.S. drug company Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) over tests conducted on children, lawyers said on Friday. The case centers on 200 children who were given drugs during a meningitis outbreak in 1996, including Pfizer's antibiotic Trovan. Nigerian authorities say Pfizer deceived them about the details of the tests and caused the deaths of 11 children. Pfizer, which has steadfastly denied the allegations, confirmed the case was withdrawn earlier on Friday. It said in a statement that it has not been served with any new lawsuit and was not aware of any new suit being filed. On June 26, a court had rejected the government's request to amend its suit to add a clause explaining the 11-year delay in filing it. At a court hearing on Friday, government lawyers said they would refile an amended version. We came to discontinue the statement of claim because our amendment was refused ... We are filing a new suit, possibly by the end of the day, said lawyer Babatunde Irukera. The government alleges Pfizer acted unethically when it tested Trovan on children in the northern state of Kano. Doctors also used another drug, ceftriaxone, during the tests. The plaintiff avers that on account of the defendants' fraudulent use of the unapproved drug Trovan and the deliberate and purposeful low-dosing of ceftriaxone, 11 children ... died, the government says in the amended suit, obtained by Reuters. Others suffered varying degrees of injuries and/or disorders including deafness, muteness, paralysis, brain damage, loss of sight, slurred speech, the suit says. Pfizer says that it conducted the tests in the full knowledge of the government and in a responsible and ethical way consistent with its commitment to patient safety, and that the drug helped save lives. To our knowledge there is no additional information in the case, Pfizer said on Friday. Any purported new facts more than 11 years after the study was conducted are simply rehashed allegations dressed up differently, and equally without merit, the drugmaker said. The government of Kano state is also suing Pfizer over the tests, seeking damages of $2 billion, and has also pressed criminal charges. Both the civil and the criminal cases have so far been bogged down in technicalities and have been adjourned. The federal government lawyers had said at the June 26 hearing that they wanted to amend their suit to explain that the government had been waiting for the outcome of a U.S. court case on the same tests, which explained the 11-year delay. A U.S. federal judge in 2005 dismissed the suit, saying the case should be heard in a Nigerian court. The damages sought by the federal government, as listed in the amended suit, add up to 826.4 billion naira ($6.5 billion). Lawyers had previously said the government's claim amounted to $6.95 billion. It was unclear whether the amount of the claim was amended or the original figures were incorrect.

&lt;p&gt;    By Cyntia Barrera Diaz &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, July 20 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster Televisa will post a sharp drop in second-quarter profit due to the lack of strong one-time advertising recorded in the first half of last year, but its cable and satellite television units continue to bloom. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A Reuters poll of analysts forecast that Televisa (TV.N)(TLVACPO.MX) earned 1.884 billion pesos ($174 million) in the April-June period, down 21 percent compared with 2.399 billion pesos in the year-ago quarter. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Profit in the second quarter of 2006 jumped a whopping 75 percent on the back of political advertising ahead the July 2 presidential elections. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Ads, from retailers to car makers, related to the 2006 Summer soccer World Cup also contributed strongly to results last year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Second-quarter revenue is expected to be down 3.7 percent at 9.815 billion pesos ($908 million). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Broadcasting revenue is staying resilient, and the difficult comps from elections/WorldCup in 2006 are being offset by growth at Sky, cable, and gaming," said UBS in a report. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Quarterly earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) -- a key performance measure for Mexican companies -- is expected to be down 9.1 percent and operating profit is also expected to decline 11.21 percent.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts lead, adds quotes, background, byline)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Walden Siew and Nancy Leinfuss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Borrowers of almost half of
the $500 billion of risky subprime mortgages facing higher
interest rates over the next 18 months will have trouble
refinancing, J.P. Morgan Chase  Co. JPM.N. said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An inability by many homeowners with spotty credit
histories to refinance their mortgages would lead to more
mortgage delinquencies and defaults, increasing losses in
investment portfolios that hold securities backed by the
loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan forecasts that by the end of 2008, subprime
borrowers with home loans totaling $230 billion will not be
able to refinance as they face higher rates, nearly quadruple
the expected $60 billion this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are really heading into the reset storm," said J.P.
Morgan analyst Chris Flanagan. "We are on the cusp of that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flanagan, J.P. Morgan's global head of asset-backed
securities and collateralized debt obligation research, spoke
during a conference call with clients on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Virtually all subprime mortgages are adjustable-rate loans
that offer borrowers low teaser interest rates that then reset
at sharply higher rates within two or three years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Federal Reserve Bank President William Poole said on Friday
that problems in subprime mortgage markets -- which Fed
Chairman Ben Bernanke said on Thursday could add up losses of
$50 billion to $100 billion -- may have been unavoidable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While it was widely expected around 2004 that interest
rates would rise, it was surprising that adjustable-rate loans
were made so extensively to borrowers with shaky credit
histories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is difficult to avoid the judgment that these ARM loans
were poorly underwritten at the outset," Poole said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An ABX derivative index, a popular tool used by investors
to hedge subprime risks, has posted a series of sharp sell-offs
and continues to signal further deterioration in the $565
billion U.S. subprime mortgage market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The index has plummeted in recent weeks amid mounting
losses at several hedge funds and as credit rating agencies
slashed or placed under review over billions of dollars of
subprime mortgage securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "BBB-" ABX indexes fell to record intraday lows on
Friday. The ABX 07-1 index, which is tied to loans made in last
year's second half, fell to 42.5 after closing at a record low
of 44.86 on Thursday. The ABX 06-2, which references loans made
in last year's first half, slid to 46.5 following its close of
50 on Thursday. The newest series, ABX 07-2, was not actively
trading on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flanagan expects the latest ABX 07-2 index will experience
similarly weak performance as the prior two index series.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Flanagan also forecast more rating downgrades of ABS and
ABS CDOs over the next six to 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Standard  Poor's on Thursday cut ratings on portions of 75
ABS CDOs that affected almost $2 billion of debt, which make up
less than 1 percent of about $250 billion of synthetic CDOs
rated by SP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cuts on Thursday also included 10 CDO tranches that
were cut to junk from investment-grade status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(additional reporting by Mark Felsenthal, Neil Shah)

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;July 20 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its Americas
software coverage group to "attractive" from "neutral," citing
better-than-expected North American software spending, share
buybacks and merger activities as well as stock performance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Second-quarter earnings reports and third-quarter outlook
thus far have been stronger than many have feared, particularly
for large-cap companies such as International Business Machines
Corp. (IBM.N), Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O), Oracle Corp. ORCL.O,
and SAP (SAPG.DE), the brokerage said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman added Oracle to its Americas conviction buy list,
replacing Citrix Systems (CTXS.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Oracle's consolidation strategy has given it an expansive
product set, resulting in greater account control and
tremendous cross-selling opportunities," Goldman analyst Sarah
Friar said in her note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She also added BMC Software Inc. BMC.N and LimeLight
Networks Inc. (LLNW.O) to Americas buy list, and upgraded both
stocks to "buy" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She expects BMC Software to continue to buy back shares "at
a robust clip."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Comments from companies have been consistent about a
rebound in European spending and continued strong spending in
Asia, Friar said. North American spending also appears to be
stronger than expected, she added.

&lt;p&gt;BUENAVENTURA, Colombia (Reuters) - Colombia's most infamous cocaine lords have been killed or jailed, violence has fallen sharply and drug seizures are at an all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the string of successes in the world's No. 1 producer has not been enough to slash the amount of cocaine for sale on the streets of the United States or Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even as the U.S.-backed war on drugs has tamed top cartels, smaller groups have emerged, shifting coca leaf to areas that are harder to fumigate and opening new smuggling routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Colombia's Pacific coast is now a key battleground.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is one of the heaviest trafficking zones," said Lt. Juan Correa, patrolling in a U.S.-made Piranha gunboat in search of speedboats carrying drugs and guns near the large port of Buenaventura.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They use all the rivers in speedboats, and use the mangroves for improvised factories. Then they take the drugs out into the open sea to larger ships," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Days earlier, Colombian Marines waded chest deep through a jungle river an hour's helicopter ride away and found 6.5 tonnes of cocaine buried in the earth and waiting for shipment out into the Pacific Ocean.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the latest major seizure in a security crackdown that has won President Alvaro Uribe strong approval ratings at home and the full support of U.S. President George W. Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marines make daily captures of cocaine, drug-making chemicals and weapons in the rivers and impoverished wooden slums around the harbor here, where traffickers, rebel groups and paramilitaries all battle for control of smuggling routes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since 2000, the United States has pumped more than $4 billion in mostly narcotics and security aid into its Plan Colombia program to slash cocaine shipments and curb Latin America's oldest guerrilla insurgency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It says the money helped rescue Colombia and clearly much has changed from the late 1980s, when drug lord Pablo Escobar unleashed a wave of bombing and shooting attacks that killed hundreds of police, government officials and civilians.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ruthless man who portrayed himself as a friend of the poor and opened a zoo on his ranch featuring giraffes, rhinos and hippos, Escobar was shot dead in a police chase across the rooftops of Medellin in December 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since then, both the Medellin and the rival Cali cartels have been devastated by arrests and extraditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uribe's government has sent hundreds of drug traffickers to face U.S. justice since he took office in 2002, and the military has retaken large areas once held by Marxist guerrillas also involved in the cocaine trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The country is much stronger institutionally to contain drug trafficking, and in that Plan Colombia has achieved a purpose," top police chief Gen. Oscar Naranjo told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'COULD SLIDE BACK'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it was also supposed to slash the flow of cocaine to the United States, and there it has failed, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;United Nations figures show Colombia's cocaine output is steady at around 600 tonnes a year, or more than 60 percent of world supply. Despite a jump in seizures, the U.S. government concedes there has been no major long-term impact on the availability or price of cocaine on U.S. streets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We underestimated the difficulties when we started Plan Colombia, I will grant you that. But I think we have come a long way and if we cut this now, we could slide back," said a top U.S. Embassy official in Bogota. "This wasn't going to be finished in five years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Democrats, who control of the U.S. Congress, are questioning Plan Colombia's record and the White House's attempts to extend the largest U.S. aid package outside the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some want to slash funds for coca fumigation in favor of programs encouraging farmers in impoverished rural areas to grow other crops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Fumigation has proved able to reduce coca-growing in a specific zone for a specific period of time. But outside that zone and even in the same zone after the spray planes go elsewhere coca cultivation always increases," said Adam Isacson at the Center for International Policy in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uribe warns that cutting fumigation aid now could trigger an increase in coca production even as his government plans more social spending in areas once abandoned by the state.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His allies insist the country would be in much worse shape and cocaine output higher if it were not for Plan Colombia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we hadn't fumigated, Colombia could have 250,000 hectares of coca," Vice President Francisco Santos said recently. "Nothing competes with coca. It is so profitable and we must see that as a reality we face."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Around Buenaventura, several key traffickers and FARC rebel leaders have been captured in the last few weeks, but the war goes on. A string of bomb attacks on the port that killed two people and wounded 23 more last month were attributed to the FARC trying to gain more control.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Drug trafficking is a high profitable business," said Col. Hector Aguas, the marine commander in Buenaventura. "That gives people the push to keep trying it."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 20 (Reuters) - Wall Street looked set to end
the week on a weak note on Friday, with technology shares
likely to fall after disappointing results from Microsoft Corp.
(MSFT.O) and Google Inc. (GOOG.O)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, the world's largest software maker, posted
higher earnings after the closing bell on Thursday, but
personal computer sales did not pay off as much as some
analysts had hoped, sending shares down 2 percent in
extended-hours trading. For details, see [ID:nN19429097].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google reported earnings that missed expectations due to
increased hiring and a jump in operating expenses, sending its
stock down 7 percent after the bell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Nasdaq obviously might encounter some selling pressure due
to some disappointing earnings," said Peter Cardillo, chief
market economist at Avalon Partners in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SP 500 futures SPc1 were 0.3 point, below fair value, a
mathematical formula that evaluates pricing by taking into
account interest rates, dividends and time to expiration on the
contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dow Jones industrial average futures DJc1 were flat, and
Nasdaq 100 NDc1 futures were down 1 point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup Inc. (C.N), the largest U.S. bank, said on Friday
that second-quarter profit rose, helped by record revenue and
expense controls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another Dow component expected to report earnings on Friday
is heavy-equipment maker Caterpillar Inc. (CAT.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Caterpillar, like other providers of infrastructure
building equipment, is seen as benefiting from swift economic
growth abroad.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; China raised interest rates on Friday in the latest of a
series of tightening steps aimed at keeping inflation in check
and preventing the world's fourth-largest economy from
overheating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cheap money is slowly but surely evaporating on a global
scale," Cardillo said. "It's a step in the right direction to
begin reining in some of the excess speculation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The rate increase came a day after the government reported
that annual growth accelerated to the fastest pace in 11 1/2
years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Thursday, the Dow Jones industrial average .DJI was up
82.19 points, or 0.59 percent, to end at a record 14,000.41.
The Standard  Poor's 500 Index .SPX was up 6.91 points, or
0.45 percent, to finish at 1,553.08. The Nasdaq Composite Index
.IXIC was up 20.55 points, or 0.76 percent, to close at
2,720.04, after earlier hitting 2,724.74, its highest in 6 1/2
years.

Both the civil and the criminal cases have so far been bogged down in technicalities and have been adjourned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nigerian authorities allege that the Trovan tests caused the deaths of some children and permanent health problems for others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The federal government lawyers had said at the June 26 hearing that they wanted to amend their suit to explain that the government had been waiting for the outcome of a U.S. court case on the same tests, which explained the 11-year delay.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. federal judge in 2005 dismissed the suit, saying the case should be heard in a Nigerian court.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;  (New throughout, previous LONDON) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 19 (Reuters) - The scientific committee of the European Medicines Agency said on Friday it had recommended approval of Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE.N) Celsentri, a new type of treatment for HIV whose approval has been delayed in the United States. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Committee for Medicinal Products (CHMP) said it had recommended marketing approval of Celsentri, known as maraviroc in the United States, for use with other anti-HIV drugs among adult patients infected with the HIV-1 strain of the virus. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    But the committee said Celsentri is meant to be used only among CCR5-tropic patients, meaning those whose HIV virus uses the CCR5 co-receptor as a portal into human cells. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer last month received a so-called approvable letter from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for its twice-a-day maraviroc pill, the first drug designed to keep the HIV virus that causes AIDS from entering healthy cells of the immune system. Older HIV medicines attack the virus itself. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer said the FDA would approve maraviroc once certain conditions were met, but it did not specify the requirements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Committee for Medicinal Products on Friday said it had also recommended approval in Europe of Pfizer's Ecalta &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(anidulafungin) as a treatment for invasive candidiasis in adult patients who have normal levels of infection-fighting immune system cells called neutrophils. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Invasive candidiasis is an infection that occurs when the Candida species of fungus enters the bloodstream, where it can then spread througout the body. People at greatest risk of the fungal condition are low-birthweight babies, surgery patients and those with immune deficiencies. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Recommendations for marketing approval by the Committee for Medicinal Products are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a few months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   (Reporting by Ransdell Pierson in New York, Jonathan Cable in London) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ((Editing by Leslie Gevirtz; Reuters messaging: rm://jonathan.cable.reuters.com@reuters.net; +44 20 7542 4688;  Email jonathan.cable@reuters.com)) Keywords: PFIZER ECALTA CELSENTRI/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

They were trading down nearly 24 percent at $4.58 in early afternoon trade, making it the third top loser on the Nasdaq. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The product "did not have the high-enough rate of return to keep them (Pfizer) going... but that's a $2.3 billion company, they look at those things a little differently than a company like ImmuCell," Chief Executive of ImmuCell, Michael Brigham, said by phone. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ImmuCell, which manufactures products to improve animal health and productivity in the dairy and beef industries, said in a statement that the termination was not due to any unexpected efficacy, technical or regulatory issues. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer was not immediately available for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    PRODUCT HAS POTENTIAL &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Brigham said Mast Out still has potential for ImmuCell. The company intends to carry on development efforts for the product but did not provide any details on future plans. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Bovine Mastitis causes inflammation of the udder and results in reduced quantity and quality of milk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Mastitis causes economic loss of about $2 billion per year and is the biggest cause of economic loss to the dairy industry, Brigham added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    ImmuCell expects to recognize the remaining deferred income from non-refundable milestone payments received from Pfizer. It sees a related increase of about $602,000 to net income before taxes during the third quarter, with no impact on cash. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company posted a net income of $297,000 during the first quarter of 2007. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Jennifer Robin Raj in Bangalore) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Himani Sarkar; Reuters Messaging: aruna.jennifer.reuters.com@reuters.net;  within U.S. +1 646 223 8780; outside U.S. +91 80 4135 5800)) Keywords: IMMUCELL CONTRACT/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 22 (Reuters) - Merrill Lynch MER.N, Lehman
Brothers LEH.N, Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Citigroup (C.N) are
among a group of investment banks developing an electronic
trading platform for unregistered securities to compete with
existing systems, such as one created by Goldman Sachs (GS.N),
according to The Financial Times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The move comes after Goldman signed up hedge fund group
Oaktree Capital and private equity firm, Apollo Management, to
sell unregistered shares through its GSTRuE private trading
system, a report on the Web site of the newspaper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Such unregistered shares, known as 144A issues, are
expected to become an increasingly popular way for alternative
asset managers to raise capital without submitting to the
disclosure required when selling stock through an initial
public offering, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Merrill Lynch, Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley and
Citigroup were not immediately available for comment.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. said on Sunday the software maker was taking new steps to protect consumer privacy in the areas of Web search and online advertising and called on the Internet industry to support it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it was responding to public concern over the recent consolidation of the online ad industry as well as stepped-up interest from government regulators in its call for a comprehensive rather than piecemeal approach to privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think it's time for an industrywide dialogue," Peter Cullen, Microsoft's chief privacy officer, said in an interview. "The current patchwork of protections and how companies explain them is really confusing to consumers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Specifically, Microsoft said it would make all Web search query data anonymous after 18 months on its "Live Search" service, unless it receives user consent to store it longer. The policy changes are retroactive and worldwide, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to store customer search data separately from data tied to people, e-mail addresses or phone numbers and take steps to assure no unauthorized correlation of these types of data can be made. It also will permanently remove "cookie" user identification data, Web address? or other identifiers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft is going to do a more thorough scrub of customer data once it is too old," said Peter Swire, a law professor at Ohio State University who served as U.S. privacy czar in the 1990s. "Previously, the practice was to do a partial scrub."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of Microsoft's push, Ask.com, the Web search business of Barry Diller's IAC/InterActiveCorp, has agreed to join Microsoft in calling for the industry to adopt a common set of privacy practices for data collection, commercial use and consumer protection in search and online advertising. Last week, it unveiled AskEraser, a service that will allow Ask customers to change their privacy preferences at any time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's initiatives follow recent moves by Google, the dominant provider of Web searches and the company most under fire by privacy advocates concerned at how rapid advances in search technology may pose unprecedented threats to consumer privacy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google set in motion industry efforts to limit how long Web search data is stored by being first to say it will in the future cleanse personal information from its databases after 18 months. Microsoft is one-upping Google by making its move retroactive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has stepped up its own efforts to reach compromises with European Union and U.S. policy-makers in recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WHO DO YOU TRUST?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Redmond, Washington-based company said it was taking new steps to notify users how technologies affect them, giving users more specific controls over their privacy and setting tighter limits on how long it keeps search data. It will also minimize the amount of data it collects via its "Live Search" and online advertisement targeting services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Search, itself, is a relatively new business and advertising-supported search, and the issues it raises, are also relatively new," Cullen said, adding, "You have almost a collision of these two things."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Google and Microsoft face scrutiny from U.S. and European regulators over their plans to merge with major players in the online advertising industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google is seeking approval to buy advertising services firm DoubleClick for $3.1 billion, a move analysts say will more than double the number of Web users to whom it serves up online ads. Similarly, Microsoft plans to buy diversified ad services company aQuantive, a DoubleClick rival, for $6 billion. A shareholder meeting to approve the deal is set for August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The DoubleClick deal, in particular, faces congressional hearings over the potential privacy issues that could arise from the concentration of data about consumer Web-surfing habits, buying behavior and advertising data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Forrester privacy analyst Jennifer Albornoz Mulligan says the Internet industry is feeling the heat from customers who are confused by the many conflicting state and federal privacy policies across banking, retail, advertising and elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most consumers haven give up reading the detailed privacy notices contained in footnotes on Web sites because everyone knows that "you can adopt privacy principles without really doing a great job of protecting privacy," Mulligan says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cullen said Microsoft did not believe a one-size-fits-all approach to online privacy could work. It wants consumers who seek anonymity online to have the power to do so, while giving customers who prize convenience over anonymity the access to a new class of personalized services that depend on user data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People want a high degree of personalization, but they don't want to feel like they are being surveilled," he said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - Wall Street bank JPMorgan (JPM.N) said on Monday it had won final approval to set up a wholly owned unit in China to strengthen its wholesale banking business in the world's fastest growing major economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This move will make JPMorgan the second U.S. bank to incorporate in China, after Citigroup Inc. (C.N) did so early this year, while more than a dozen foreign banks queue to secure regulatory approval for their China-incorporated units.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most foreign banks choose to incorporate in China because they want to tap the country's retail banking sector through fast branch expansion across the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local incorporation makes it much easier for foreign banks to apply to open new branches and offer a full range of local currency-denominated retail banking services to Chinese customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, JPMorgan said it would still focus on its wholesale banking business such as trade finance, cash management and financial derivatives, but may tap the retail market when it finds the right opportunity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We do see that China's consumer banking and card markets have great potential for growth and we are very optimistic on the future growth of the market," Charles Li, JPMorgan China chairman, said in an email response to Reuters questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(We) would like to consider exploring the opportunities if we could find the right approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Besides expanding the wholesale banking business in China, JPMorgan is making efforts to win underwriting deals for Chinese companies' overseas listings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currently, JPMorgan does not have any retail business outside of the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China fully opened its banking markets to overseas lenders late last year as part of Beijing's commitment to the World Trade Organisation, which it joined in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Foreign banks not incorporated domestically are not allowed to issue bank cards independently and are required to impose a minimum deposit of 1 million yuan ($132,200) on retail customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The local incorporation won't immediately accelerate the pace of growth and lead to aggressive recruiting of branch expansion," said Li.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"However, there is no doubt that the incorporation will form a strong foundation for progressive and long-term expansion."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan will locate the headquarters of its China-incorporated subsidiary in Beijing, making it the first foreign bank to incorporate in China's capital instead of Shanghai, the country's financial hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan currently operates three branches in first-tier Chinese cities including Beijing, Tianjin and Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"After local incorporation, all the three branches will be fully licensed for local and foreign currencies and products, and all branches will have a derivatives license," Carl Walter, JPMorgan China's chief operating officer, said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds quote, details, background) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ABUJA, July 20 (Reuters) - The Nigerian government has withdrawn its suit seeking $6.95 billion in damages from U.S. drug company Pfizer (PFE.N) over tests conducted in 1996, but will immediately refile an amended suit, lawyers said on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    On June 26, a court had rejected the government's request to amend its suit to add a clause explaining the 11-year delay in filing it. At a court hearing on Friday, government lawyers said they would refile an amended version. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "We came to discontinue the statement of claim because our amendment was refused ... We are filing a new suit, possibly by the end of the day," said lawyer Babatunde Irukera. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The government alleges Pfizer failed to obtain regulatory approval and acted unethically when it tested the antibiotic drug Trovan on children in the northern Nigerian state of Kano during a meningitis outbreak in 1996. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer says it conducted the tests in the full knowledge of the government and in a responsible and ethical way consistent with its commitment to patient safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The government of Kano state is also suing Pfizer over the tests, seeking damages of $2 billion, and has also pressed criminal charges. Both the civil and the criminal cases have so far been bogged down in technicalities and have been adjourned. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nigerian authorities allege that the Trovan tests caused the deaths of some children and permanent health problems for others. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The federal government lawyers had said at the June 26 hearing that they wanted to amend their suit to explain that the government had been waiting for the outcome of a U.S. court case on the same tests, which explained the 11-year delay. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    A U.S. federal judge in 2005 dismissed the suit, saying the case should be heard in a Nigerian court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Camillus Eboh; Editing by Giles Elgood; Abuja newsroom; +234 9461 3214; estelle.shirbon@reuters.com))   Keywords: NIGERIA PFIZER/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has showed early signs of narrowing the gap with Google Inc (GOOG.O) in its Web business, leading Wall Street to ask whether the world's biggest software company may be able to turn an overlooked unit into a financial powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's top executives plan to update investors about every facet of the $50 billion software maker's business, from its bread-and-butter Windows and Office franchises to its Xbox game console unit, at its annual analyst meeting on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company's smallest business division -- online services -- may garner the most attention, because it poses both the greatest opportunity for growth and the biggest risk of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After investing billions to build data centers and pay for acquisitions, Microsoft wants to convince investors its loss- making online services will eventually become an engine of growth alongside desktop software, which accounts for almost all of its profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If there is an Achilles heel, you have to say it's there," said Charles Di Bona, an analyst at Bernstein Research. "It will be an important bellwether, but it's a ways off before the segment has an impact on the top line or the bottom line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The online services group, led by former Ask.com Chief Executive Steve Berkowitz, is showing signs of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft posted a third straight quarter of revenue growth after sales in the four previous quarters fell. The company forecast the division's revenue would grow as much as 13 percent in fiscal 2008, with online advertising sales increasing by more than 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These estimates do not factor in the impact of Microsoft's $6 billion acquisition of Web advertising company aQuantive Inc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AQNT.O&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's U.S. Web search market share rose nearly 3 percentage points to 13.2 percent in June after months of languishing around 10 percent, according to research firm comScore Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those share gains, coming at the expense of Google and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), were driven largely by a marketing campaign to encourage people to use Microsoft's Live Search for everyday searches. It remains to be seen whether those gains can be maintained in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Catching up to Google, which is estimated to have captured nearly one-third of the world's online advertising market, remains a difficult and crucial task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Web search leader is growing four times as fast as Microsoft and it is introducing new software services such as online word processing and spreadsheets that strike at the heart of Microsoft's software dominance on the desktop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BILLION-DOLLAR OPTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts are interested in Microsoft's online business, specifically because it has been overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The stock price right now, the valuation, gives Microsoft no credit for its online initiatives," said Morningstar analyst Toan Tran. "If you buy the stock right now, you get a free option for the billions of dollars Microsoft is spending."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares are trading at 18 times estimated fiscal 2008 earnings, broadly in line with the SP 500. The shares of the company's Web rivals, Google and Yahoo, are valued at 26 and 46 times next year's estimated earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares fell 39 cents to close at $30.80 in Nasdaq trading. The stock is up 5 percent in the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another area of focus at the analyst meeting will be Microsoft's estimate for Windows sales for this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, which earns more than 75 cents in operating profit for every dollar of Windows sales, said segment revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter came in slightly below the company's 14 percent estimates. It also forecast sales would grow between 9 percent and 10 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst said that forecast for Vista sales seemed conservative since Microsoft said at the introduction of Windows Vista in January that users will upgrade to the new operating system faster than its predecessor Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's almost as if investors are treating the Vista cycle as the last hurrah," said Bernstein's Di Bona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In order to get really enthusiastic about the stock, which I am frankly, you have to believe that, not only is Vista a big deal, Vista is not the last big deal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 24 (Reuters) - Issuance of U.S.
collateralized debt obligations may begin to pick up after
falling to the lowest in at least a year, according to J.P.
Morgan Chase  Co.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; CDO sales in the U.S. fell to about $6 billion in July
through Friday, a fraction of the $34 billion monthly average
this year, J.P. Morgan said in a report on Monday. Sales may
begin to rise with $35.7 billion in CDOs set for sale,
including almost half in collateralized loan obligations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The US forward pipeline shows some signs of life ... and
is quite swollen for CLOs," J.P. Morgan said in a separate
report on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Concerns about risky home loans that make up the underlying
collateral for CDOs have sapped investor interest in the debt
structures that pool together various debt securities,
including subprime loans, to garner greater yield and to help
diversify risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This month Bear Stearns said two troubled hedge funds that
bet on risky subprime loans lost almost all their value. Rating
companies also have announced billions of dollars worth of debt
downgrades due to delinquencies and defaults on subprime loans
made to borrowers with poor credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global sales of CDOs fell to about $20 billion through last
Friday, with about one week left in July, due mostly to the
U.S. slowdown. CDO sales in Europe totaled about $12.6 billion
and $1.2 billion in Asia, close to their monthly averages,
according to J.P. Morgan data.

activities in all product markets concerned ... the proposed
concentration would not give rise to any competition concerns,"
the top European Union antitrust regulator said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Although ENI is active at the upstream wholesale level in
the Czech Republic, it appears highly unlikely that the merged
entity would engage in closing off supply from its competitors
at the downstream retail level," the Commission said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Esso Hungaria, Esso Ceska and Esso Slovensko sell motor fuel
in Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, the Commission
said. Esso Ceska and Esso Slovensko sell jet fuel at the Prague

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, July 24 (Reuters) - Mexican broadcaster
Televisa, which has a growing betting business, said on Tuesday
it is trying to convince the government that a planned 20
percent tax on gaming is too high and will hurt the industry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mexico's president, Felipe Calderon, last month presented a
long-awaited fiscal reform plan, part of which would close off
corporate tax loopholes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government wants to slap a 20 percent tax on gaming as
part of the bill, which is expected to get the go-ahead before
Congress starts discussing next year's budget in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are talking to the minister of finance of Mexico. We
believe that tax is extremely high," Televisa's executive vice
president, Alfonso de Angoitia, told analysts during a
conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX) received a government permit
in 2005 to operate 65 gaming halls with sports betting, bingo
and digital slot machines. At the end of June, eight halls were
operating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa plans to open six more, including two in the
popular beach resorts of Acapulco and Cancun, over the the next
few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is a developing industry, and if you impose a tax of
that magnitude to a business or an industry that is still
developing in Mexico, it will affect it severely," the
executive added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government's new tax plan also calls for a 19 percent
flat rate on companies and a 2 percent rate on monthly bank
cash deposits of over 20,000 pesos ($1,855),&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed tax on cash deposits will "curb somewhat our
cable subsidiaries, (satellite operation) SKY, the magazine
business," De Angoitia said. "In those businesses you receive a
lot of cash payments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gaming rivals like CIE (CIEB.MX) and privately held
Caliente are also expected to be hurt by the gaming tax,
analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Televisa reported a 15 percent decline in
second-quarter earnings as advertising revenues slumped.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales at Televisa's division that includes the gaming
business jumped nearly 38 percent in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SATELLITE TV EXPANDS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The direct-to-home television service, SKY, along with
cable operator Cablevision, have become two of Televisa's main
revenue generators in recent quarters, offsetting softer
results from its core broadcast unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SKY launched in Costa Rica this month and plans to expand
to Nicaragua, Panama and the Dominican Republic soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; De Angoitia, the executive vice president, said those four
countries will be served through a single platform and bring in
a combined 100,000 customers in several years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Referring to its cable business, Televisa said there is
room for more acquisitions as the industry, which is composed
of over 200 cable systems, consolidates.

&lt;p&gt;  (Adds quote, background) By Camillus Eboh ABUJA, July 25 (Reuters) - The Nigerian federal government has filed criminal charges against U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N) alleging improper behaviour in a 1996 drug trial in the northern state of Kano in which it says 11 children died.

Under Nigerian law, defendants in criminal trials must be present. A source at the Justice Ministry said two of the nine defendants were under arrest, without specifying the names. The defendants include Pfizer Inc., its Nigerian arm and seven company executives, staff and associates. The case centers on 200 children who were given drugs during a meningitis outbreak in 1996, including Pfizer's antibiotic Trovan.  The 23 criminal charges include importing an illegal drug, failing to obtain a trial certificate, misleading patients and procuring a forged trial certificate. In the civil case, the Nigerian government says Pfizer deceived authorities about the details of the tests and caused the deaths of 11 children and permanent health problems for many others. Pfizer has steadfastly denied the allegations. In various defence statements filed in Kano state and federal courts, Pfizer has contested the validity of evidence against it and said it acted legally and ethically at all times. The company was not immediately available for comment on the release of the criminal charges. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared Trovan for adult use in 1997 but did not approve the drug for use by children. A U.S. federal judge in 2005 dismissed a suit against Pfizer about the same case, saying it should be heard in a Nigerian court.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it will pipe advertisements into a slate of popular sports video games from Electronic Arts Inc. ERTS.O, including its best-selling "Madden" football franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal, which also covers EA's "NASCAR," "Tiger Woods" golf, "NHL" hockey and upcoming "Skate" skateboarding games, is a significant win for Microsoft as it tries to build an early lead over rivals such as Google Inc. (GOOG.O) in putting ads into video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The real issue here is that we're making a network play. If I just had 'Madden,' while great, it would be of limited value to advertisers," said Cory Van Arsdale, chief executive of Massive, a game ad company that Microsoft bought last year for $200 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal comes as Massive faces increased competition from Google, which bought game ad service Adscape for a reported $23 million in March, and from privately held companies such as Double Fusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to build an overall network and this is a major stepping point to have us do that," Van Arsdale said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massive acts as a broker between companies that want to get their ads in front of gamers, and game publishers eager to tap new sources of revenue to offset higher development costs for flashy new titles that can cost $20 million or more to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. In-game advertising was worth just $50 million in 2005, but that is expected by many analysts and industry executives to balloon to $1 billion over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $30 billion global video game industry is also one of the fastest-growing entertainment sectors, thanks to new home and handheld gaming machines and a rush among publishers to win over nontraditional buyers like women and seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ads Massive delivers are dynamic, meaning they can be tailored by advertisers to target specific groups or areas. Unlike static ads that are a permanent part of a game, they can be altered quickly to pitch new products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is also the latest indication of increasingly cozy ties between Microsoft, the world's biggest software company and EA, the No. 1 independent video game publisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft said its gaming chief, Peter Moore, will leave to become head of EA Sports. Moore's replacement at Microsoft will be Dan Mattrick, a former EA executive who has been a high-level adviser for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrangement only covers versions of those games for personal computers and Microsoft's Xbox 360, two platforms that have a high proportion of users connected to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974.OS Wii console and Sony Corp.'s (6758.T) PlayStation 3 also have online services but they are not yet as developed as Xbox Live, which Microsoft has made into a cornerstone of its gaming strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would love to do Nintendo and PlayStation, but they control the platform, they control the ecosystem and they have to decide what to allow or not. It's not something that's in our control," Van Arsdale said.&lt;/p&gt;

government lawyer said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The federal government was already seeking $6.5 billion in a
separate civil case. The government of Kano state is also
seeking $2 billion in damages from Pfizer and has filed separate
criminal charges too.

&lt;p&gt;July 25 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N) on Wednesday said a
Spanish court upheld a patent covering an active ingredient in
its cholesterol fighter Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The court found a second patent, covering a stabilized

invalid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The patents were challenged by India's Ranbaxy Laboratories

&lt;p&gt;Co announces that a Spanish court has upheld the co's enantiomer patent covering the calcium salt of atorvastatin, the active ingredient in Lipitor. The Commercial Court of First Instance Number 4 in Barcelona, which issued the ruling, found a second patent covering a stabilized formulation that includes atorvastatin is invalid. The patents were challenged by generic manufacturer Ranbaxy. Lipitor is sold in Spain under the brand names Zarator and Cardyl. This case is the fourth in a series of challenges to the calcium salt patent by generic companies in Spain. The patent was upheld in one of three previous cases and found invalid in two others. All of the previous decisions are currently on appeal.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) said on Wednesday it will pipe advertisements into a slate of popular sports video games from Electronic Arts Inc. ERTS.O, including its best-selling "Madden" football franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The deal, which also covers EA's "NASCAR," "Tiger Woods" golf, "NHL" hockey and upcoming "Skate" skateboarding games, is a significant win for Microsoft as it tries to build an early lead over rivals such as Google Inc. (GOOG.O) in putting ads into video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The real issue here is that we're making a network play. If I just had 'Madden,' while great, it would be of limited value to advertisers," said Cory Van Arsdale, chief executive of Massive, a game ad company that Microsoft bought last year for $200 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal comes as Massive faces increased competition from Google, which bought game ad service Adscape for a reported $23 million in March, and from privately held companies such as Double Fusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We need to build an overall network and this is a major stepping point to have us do that," Van Arsdale said in an interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Massive acts as a broker between companies that want to get their ads in front of gamers, and game publishers eager to tap new sources of revenue to offset higher development costs for flashy new titles that can cost $20 million or more to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Financial details of the deal were not disclosed. In-game advertising was worth just $50 million in 2005, but that is expected by many analysts and industry executives to balloon to $1 billion over the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $30 billion global video game industry is also one of the fastest-growing entertainment sectors, thanks to new home and handheld gaming machines and a rush among publishers to win over nontraditional buyers like women and seniors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ads Massive delivers are dynamic, meaning they can be tailored by advertisers to target specific groups or areas. Unlike static ads that are a permanent part of a game, they can be altered quickly to pitch new products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is also the latest indication of increasingly cozy ties between Microsoft, the world's biggest software company and EA, the No. 1 independent video game publisher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Microsoft said its gaming chief, Peter Moore, will leave to become head of EA Sports. Moore's replacement at Microsoft will be Dan Mattrick, a former EA executive who has been a high-level adviser for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The arrangement only covers versions of those games for personal computers and Microsoft's Xbox 360, two platforms that have a high proportion of users connected to the Internet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nintendo Co. Ltd.'s 7974.OS Wii console and Sony Corp.'s (6758.T) PlayStation 3 also have online services but they are not yet as developed as Xbox Live, which Microsoft has made into a cornerstone of its gaming strategy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would love to do Nintendo and PlayStation, but they control the platform, they control the ecosystem and they have to decide what to allow or not. It's not something that's in our control," Van Arsdale said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has showed 
early signs of narrowing the gap with Google Inc (GOOG.O) in 
its Web business, leading Wall Street to ask whether the 
world's biggest software company may be able to turn an 
overlooked unit into a financial powerhouse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's top executives plan to update investors about 
every facet of the $50 billion software maker's business, from 
its bread-and-butter Windows and Office franchises to its Xbox 
game console unit, at its annual analyst meeting on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the company's smallest business division -- online 
services -- may garner the most attention, because it poses 
both the greatest opportunity for growth and the biggest risk 
of failure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After investing billions to build data centers and pay for 
acquisitions, Microsoft wants to convince investors its loss- 
making online services will eventually become an engine of 
growth alongside desktop software, which accounts for almost 
all of its profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If there is an Achilles heel, you have to say it's there," 
said Charles Di Bona, an analyst at Bernstein Research. "It 
will be an important bellwether, but it's a ways off before the 
segment has an impact on the top line or the bottom line."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The online services group, led by former Ask.com Chief 
Executive Steve Berkowitz, is showing signs of progress.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft posted a third straight quarter of revenue growth 
after sales in the four previous quarters fell. The company 
forecast the division's revenue would grow as much as 13 
percent in fiscal 2008, with online advertising sales 
increasing by more than 20 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These estimates do not factor in the impact of Microsoft's 
$6 billion acquisition of Web advertising company aQuantive Inc&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AQNT.O&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's U.S. Web search market share rose nearly 3 
percentage points to 13.2 percent in June after months of 
languishing around 10 percent, according to research firm 
comScore Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those share gains, coming at the expense of Google and 
Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O), were driven largely by a marketing campaign 
to encourage people to use Microsoft's Live Search for everyday 
searches. It remains to be seen whether those gains can be 
maintained in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Catching up to Google, which is estimated to have captured 
nearly one-third of the world's online advertising market, 
remains a difficult and crucial task.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Web search leader is growing four times as fast as 
Microsoft and it is introducing new software services such as 
online word processing and spreadsheets that strike at the 
heart of Microsoft's software dominance on the desktop.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BILLION-DOLLAR OPTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many analysts are interested in Microsoft's online 
business, specifically because it has been overlooked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The stock price right now, the valuation, gives Microsoft 
no credit for its online initiatives," said Morningstar analyst 
Toan Tran. "If you buy the stock right now, you get a free 
option for the billions of dollars Microsoft is spending."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares are trading at 18 times estimated fiscal 
2008 earnings, broadly in line with the SP 500. The shares of 
the company's Web rivals, Google and Yahoo, are valued at 26 
and 46 times next year's estimated earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares fell 39 cents to close at $30.80 in Nasdaq 
trading. The stock is up 5 percent in the last two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Another area of focus at the analyst meeting will be 
Microsoft's estimate for Windows sales for this fiscal year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, which earns more than 75 cents in operating 
profit for every dollar of Windows sales, said segment revenue 
in its fiscal fourth quarter came in slightly below the 
company's 14 percent estimates. It also forecast sales would 
grow between 9 percent and 10 percent this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst said that forecast for Vista sales seemed 
conservative since Microsoft said at the introduction of 
Windows Vista in January that users will upgrade to the new 
operating system faster than its predecessor Windows XP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's almost as if investors are treating the Vista cycle 
as the last hurrah," said Bernstein's Di Bona.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In order to get really enthusiastic about the stock, which 
I am frankly, you have to believe that, not only is Vista a big 
deal, Vista is not the last big deal."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;REDMOND, Washington (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) 
Chief Executive Steve Ballmer defended the software company's 
expansion beyond its Windows and office software businesses, 
saying Web services and consumer devices are key to the 
company's future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Speaking on Thursday at an annual meeting with financial 
analysts, Ballmer acknowledged he had been "hammered" by 
investors who argued Microsoft should focus on its core desktop 
and server software business and forget businesses like digital 
music players and video games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft aims to make software that integrates the best 
features of desktop software, higher-end corporate software, 
Web services and devices, and it needs to be in all of those 
areas to keep up with the pace of innovation, Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Great things don't happen overnight," he said. "Most 
successes require long-term investment and innovation ... and 
that's our perspective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said he is more "optimistic" now than at any point 
in the company's history and sees more opportunities for growth 
in the next 10 years than in the past 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's expansion into new businesses has not always 
been smooth. Ballmer said the $1.06 billion charge the company 
took to fix problems with the Xbox game console was "painful," 
teaching it a lesson about hardware design.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has been under pressure from investors in the 
face of faster-growing rivals, especially Google Inc.(GOOG.O), 
and analysts noted that the company on Thursday was setting out 
a road map rather than basking in the profits of its 
established franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The focus of the message today seemed to be about where 
this company is going for the next few years," Bernstein 
Research analyst Charles Di Bona said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Software Architect Ray Ozzie, who spearheads 
Microsoft's push into Web services, argued that leading-edge 
technologies began with consumers. Microsoft's access to 
consumers gave it a leg up over rivals focused on serving 
corporations and large organizations, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft can also drive growth through its 
bread-and-butter software products like the Windows operating 
system and Office productivity software, Ballmer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those products, which account for almost all of the 
company's profit, support Microsoft's newer initiatives like 
online advertising, its Zune music player, software for mobile 
phones and online service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it sold 60 million Windows Vista licenses as 
of the end of June, including 20 million copies sold since 
mid-May. Windows Vista, the latest version of its dominant 
Windows operating system, was released on January 30.
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EMBRACE DISRUPTION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ballmer said the company plans to embrace "disruptive 
technologies" like Web-based applications that threaten 
Microsoft's traditional desktop software, which runs locally on 
a computer hard drive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Every piece of software -- the basic core value in the way 
software gets created -- will change in the next three, five or 
10 years," said Ballmer, adding that future software will all 
factor in some aspect of desktop, Web and server elements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, he rejected the idea that the software industry 
would shift entirely to an Internet delivery model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft also said it is committed to building an 
advertising powerhouse to compete with Google and Yahoo Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (YHOO.O)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company announced the acquisition of AdECN, a market 
for buyers and sellers of Web advertising. AdECN functions like 
a stock exchange for advertisers and publishers to buy and sell 
display advertising online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition comes on the heels of Microsoft's plan to 
purchase Web advertising firm aQuantive Inc. AQNT.O for $6 
billion earlier this year. Microsoft said the aQuantive deal 
cleared regulatory hurdles and will close in mid-August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platforms and 
services division, said the company's online services group 
will undergo another year of investment in this fiscal year, 
suggesting that the loss-making division will not turn a profit 
in fiscal 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with analysts' estimates, comments; segment results; background; byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Martinne Geller &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE.N) on Thursday reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit, citing cost controls, price increases in North America and the European launch of Coke Zero, and the bottler raised its full-year outlook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) drinks has been squeezed by high raw material costs and falling U.S. soft-drink demand in the United States, its largest market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Second-quarter net income fell 20 percent to $270 million, or 56 cents per share, from $339 million, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier, when a tax benefit boosted results.  Excluding restructuring charges and other items, profit was 58 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 55 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Atlanta-based company, which also sells Coke products in Belgium, France, Britain and the Netherlands, said the weak dollar added 2 cents per share to earnings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coke Enterprises, which bottles, sells and distributes more than three-quarters of the Coke drinks sold in North America,  said it now expected to earn $1.27 to $1.32 per share for the full year. That's above the analysts' average estimate of $1.24 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company, which is about 36 percent owned by Coca-Cola Co., had previously forecast that 2007 earnings would be 5 percent to 10 percent lower than the $1.30 it earned last year. That forecast implied earnings of $1.17 to $1.24, according to Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Given that consensus is too low on 2007 and we are significantly above (consensus) on 2008 due to savings and benefits of (recently-acquired) Glaceau, we expect a positive reaction with the shares," Pecoriello said in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coke Enterprises shares were up 7 cents at $23.65 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NORTH AMERICA VOLUME STILL WEAK &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Quarterly net operating revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $5.67 billion, as price increases in North America helped offset volume declines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sales by volume, a closely watched industry metric, fell 3 percent in North America, where consumers are moving from soft drinks toward bottled water, teas and energy drinks, which they perceive to have functional or health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Volume of carbonated soft drinks fell 4.5 percent in the United States, while noncarbonated drinks -- including Powerade sports drink, Dasani bottled water and Minute Maid orange juice &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- rose in the mid-single-digit range. -- rose in the mid-single-digit range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Price increases and cost cuts helped offset the impact of sharply higher costs for aluminum in cans and high-fructose corn syrup used for sweetener, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    European volume rose 2 percent, helped by strong sales of Coca-Cola Zero, a new no-calorie cola that Coke has called the best brand launch in decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As of Wednesday, shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises were trading at 19 times full-year earnings estimates, a premium to Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. PBG.N, the largest bottler of PepsiCo Inc. (PEP.N) drinks, which had a price-to-earnings multiple of 17, according to Reuters Data.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Martinne Geller) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Lisa Von Ahn; Reuters messaging: martinne.geller.reuters.com@reuters.net; martinne.geller@reuters.com; +1 646 223 6023)) Keywords: COCACOLAENTERPRISES RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

Windows Vista, the latest version of its dominant Windows operating system, was released on Jan. 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said it expects the total installed base of the Windows operating system to hit one billion -- which Microsoft noted was more than the number of cars in the world -- during the current fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    EMBRACE DISRUPTION &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Ballmer said the company plans to embrace "disruptive technologies" like Web-based applications that threaten Microsoft's traditional desktop software, which runs locally on a computer hard drive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Every piece of software -- the basic core value in the way software gets created -- will change in the next three, five or 10 years," said Ballmer, adding that future software will all factor in some aspect of desktop, Web and server elements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    However, he rejected the idea that the software industry would shift entirely to an Internet delivery model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft also said it is committed to building an advertising powerhouse to compete with Google Inc. (GOOG.O) and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company announced the acquisition of AdECN, a market for buyers and sellers of Web advertising. AdECN functions like a stock exchange for advertisers and publishers to buy and sell display advertising online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It allows us to move ahead with all the core components needed to enable an ad platform," said Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platforms and services division, without disclosing the deal's financial terms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The acquisition comes on the heels of Microsoft's plan to purchase Web advertising firm aQuantive Inc. AQNT.O for $6 billion earlier this year. Microsoft said the aQuantive deal cleared regulatory hurdles and will close in mid-August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Johnson said the company's online services group will undergo another year of investment in this fiscal year, suggesting that the loss-making division will not turn a profit in fiscal 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Researchers working with laboratory mice have found a way to reverse the effects of cocaine on the brain, according to a study published on Thursday that could lead to better treatments for drug addicts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The researchers focused on the part of the brain they knew was involved with pleasure and addictive drugs and found a way to repress hyperactive cells charged up by cocaine.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Scientists have long studied what parts of the brain are affected by cocaine but this study is the first to identify the mechanism needed to reverse the effects of cocaine, said Christian Luscher, the Swiss researcher who led the study.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is the piece of the puzzle that was not known before -- the mechanism a cell uses to get back to normal," he said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The study, published in the journal Science, builds on Luscher's earlier research that identified the part of the brain where cells became excited after cocaine use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal this time was to figure a way to reverse the impact of cocaine on receptors in the brain, said Luscher, a neuroscientist at the University of Geneva.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Receptors are the proteins responsible for transferring all information in the brain and which eventually produce feelings of satisfaction and pleasure and play a key role in addiction, Luscher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study, the team targeted the receptors that go into overdrive after cocaine use. They found in order to correct the imbalance brought on by cocaine they needed to replace the affected receptors with new ones.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To do this they administered a short burst of stimulation to another set of receptors to repress the hyper-charged cells, Luscher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have reversed the effect of cocaine and we show how the machinery in the cells has to be engaged in order to be reversed," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research could one day make it easier to treat addicts because scientists now know what needs to be done in the brain to modify the effect of drug use, Luscher said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also hopes the research will spur others to look at drug addiction as a brain disease and target treatment and studies focused on this.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This sort of sets the framework for what is needed to reverse the cocaine," Luscher said in a telephone interview. "We hope that in the future this could be beneficial for some aspects of addiction."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Thursday that it expects less downtime at U.S. refineries
during the second half of the year compared with the first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; According to analysts, Exxon Mobil's US refineries operated
at 82 percent during the first half of 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This was due to turnarounds at the company's two big
refineries in Texas -- Beaumont and Baytown, said Henry Hubble,
a spokesman for the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hubble said that gasoline production was maximized during
this time because work was being performed on the pipestills or
crude distillation units which allowed the company to buy
feedstocks to keep the catalytic crackers and other units
full.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp.

&lt;p&gt;HD DVD is a next-generation technology developed by Toshiba Corp. (6502.T) and backed by Microsoft and film studios including Warner Bros. (TWX.N).

(6758.T) (SNE.N), which is built into its PlayStation 3 game console, an Xbox rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attaching the players to popular game consoles is seen by both camps as a way to get the technology into millions of homes, and pique consumers' interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A mass market for high-definition video is still some way off, due in part to the high price of the devices. Blu-ray and HD DVD are battling for domination in a war reminiscent of the VHS-Betamax battle of the 1970s and 1980s.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp. (XOM.N) posted a 1 percent drop in quarterly earnings on Thursday, missing expectations, as weaker natural gas prices and output offset higher margins from gasoline and chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The company's shares fell 4 percent to $89.08 on the New York Stock Exchange, weighing on the Dow Jones industrial average, of which it is a component.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, it was another enormous quarter for Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly-traded company, which has ridden the energy boom to previously unforeseen levels of profitability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company posted record earnings of $39.5 billion in 2006 and is just under pace to match that mark this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's production dipped 1 percent on an oil equivalent basis from last year due to field decline and lower European demand for natural gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Net income in the second quarter decreased to $10.26 billion, or $1.83 a share, from $10.36 billion, or $1.72 a share, last year. Earnings per share rose because the number of Exxon's outstanding shares dropped nearly 7 percent through the company's aggressive buyback program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The average forecast of Wall Street analysts was $1.96 a share, according to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Europe had a warm winter, so European natural gas prices were down in the first half for Exxon, Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and other companies that sell into that market," said McDep Associates analyst Kurt Wulff.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"European natural gas has been one of their biggest areas of profits over the years, but the market's working in the other direction right now," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wulff noted that benchmark gas prices in Europe have turned upwards in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REFINING STILL STRONG&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earnings from its exploration and production segment fell over 16 percent to $5.95 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's European natural gas prices fell nearly 14 percent to $6.67 per thousand cubic feet, while its price for other natural gas sales outside the U.S. fell 10 percent to $6 per thousand cubic feet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's U.S. natural gas prices were up 8 percent from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company's profit from its downstream unit -- which includes its refineries and service stations -- rose 36 percent to $3.39 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the street was a little optimistic on the downstream," said Gene Pisasale, who helps manage about $25 billion at Mercantile Capital Advisors, a unit of PNC Wealth Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said the refining and marketing results were still very strong, noting that the company's better-than-expected first quarter results may have prodded analysts to ratchet up their forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Integrated oil companies that both produce and refine oil and gas were expected to have yet another in a series of stellar quarters as soaring refining margins picked up the slack for a year over year drop in oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;ConocoPhillips (COP.N) and Royal Dutch Shell both posted better-than-expected second-quarter profits on the back of strong results from their refineries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But British oil major BP Plc (BP.L) said its profit fell 1 percent as lower production and refinery outages prevented it from taking advantage of the refining boon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through Wednesday's close, Exxon's shares were up about 21 percent this year, just underperforming the Chicago Board Options Exchange's oil index .OIX, which rose nearly 22 percent in the same period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Matt Daily)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 26 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) plans to
restart its 326,000-barrel per day Fawley refinery in Britain
over the next several days, it said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The European physical oil product market rose, however,
reflecting traders' expectations that the outage may last longer
than Exxon's announcement suggested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company closed the Fawley plant and chemical
manufacturing sites on Wednesday, after a fire broke out at a
unit producing steam to run other systems at Britain's largest
refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Plans have been developed for an orderly restart of
operations over the next several days," Exxon Mobil said in a
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Fawley plant, which accounts for about a fifth of the
country's oil processing capacity, is one of the most complex
refineries in Europe and has a high gasoline yield.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The outage came at the height of summer gasoline demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon said it would use fuel held in storage tanks and
alternative sources to keep its customers supplied.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders were surprised by the speed of the expected
resumption of operations. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They had expected the stoppage to last several weeks,
especially after Exxon begun to inquire about buying spot July
gasoline and jet fuel caroges in Northwest Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gasoline cargo prices rose about $20 from Wednesday to
$724/$726 a tonne NWE. EURO/DIFF/MOGAS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The benchmark Eurograde gasoline barge market rose about $27
to $710/$712 a tonne on Thursday from four-month lows hit on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News of the outage had pushed New York's gasoline futures
RBc1 up by 2 percent on Wednesday. They were trading 1.58
percent higher at $2.1208 a gallon by 1358 GMT.

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, July 26 (Reuters) - Indonesia and Exxon Mobil Corp.
(XOM.N) continue to differ in negotiations on the disputed
Natuna D-Alpha gas block, which is now controlled by the U.S.
company, Indonesia's mines and energy minister said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon controls a 76 percent stake in the block and disputes
Indonesia's view that the contract giving it that share has
expired. Indonesian state oil firm, Pertamina, holds the
remaining 24 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia has said it wants Pertamina to be majority share
holder in Natuna and the state oil firm said in January it
wanted to take its stake up to 50 percent, while Exxon says that
its contract is valid until January 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have still differences on Natuna (with Exxon), including
on the split issue. But the negotiation is still going on...,"
Energy Minister Purnomo Yusgiantoro told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He did not say what split Indonesia was seeking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the price of Natuna gas, which contained around 70
percent carbon dioxide, is still too high for the market, making
it expensive to develop and difficult to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The price at the well head of Natuna gas is about $9 per
million British Thermal units. But that's with a content of 6
percent carbon dioxide, which is not acceptable for liquefied
natural gas (LNG)," Purnomo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said the cost would be higher to cut the carbon dioxide
content to 1 percent so it could be processed into LNG.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Natuna D-Alpha block has around 222 trillion cubic feet
(tcf) of gas reserves, of which about 46 tcf is thought to be
commercially recoverable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The block, about 1,100 km (680 miles) north of Jakarta and
200 km (124 miles) east of the West Natuna fields that feed gas
to Singapore, accounts for about a quarter of Indonesia's total
commercially recoverable gas reserves of 182 tcf.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia and Exxon Mobil signed a basic agreement in 1995
covering an estimated $40 billion to be invested in the offshore
gas project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any move to end Exxon's contract would cause unease among
foreign investors about the uncertainties of doing business in
Indonesia, compounding worries over the legal system, labour
laws and corruption.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon Mobil official in Jakarta declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt; Net income in the quarter decreased to $10.26 billion, or
$1.83 a share, from $10.36 billion, or $1.72 a share, last
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Integrated oil companies that both produce and refine oil
and gas were expected to have yet another in a series of
stellar quarters as soaring refining margins picked up the
slack for a year over year drop in oil prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the beginning of the year, Exxon's shares are up
about 21 percent, just underperforming the Chicago Board
Options Exchange's oil index .OIX, which rose nearly 22
percent in the same period.

SCA (EDLP.PA) said on Thursday its third-quarter revenues rose
12 percent to 322 million euros ($444.7 million), citing
stronger hotel revenues as well as a rise in the number of
visitors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Theme park revenues gained 8 percent to 173.7 million euros,
boosted by a 9 percent rise in attendance to Disneyland Paris.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hotels and Disney Village revenues rose 21 percent to 132.7

spending per room as well as a 4.7 percentage point increase in
hotel occupancy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company's real estate development segment revenues
gained 1.0 million euros, boosted by the closing of a larger
residential transaction than closed in the prior-year period, it
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our third quarter and year-to-date revenues are
encouraging, and both represent records for Disneyland Resort
Paris for their respective periods. Naturally, the higher Resort
activity and labor rate inflation have caused costs and expenses
to also increase," Chairman and Chief Executive Karl Holz said

of the French capital, said revenues for the nine months ended

(KO.N) on Friday named Joseph Tripodi as chief marketing and commercial officer, filling a post that has been vacant for months. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Tripodi comes from Allstate Corp. (ALL.N), where he was senior vice president and chief marketing officer for Allstate Insurance Co. He will be responsible for marketing as well as managing relations with customers such as Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT.N). He takes over the post on Sept. 4. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest, the industry newsletter that first reported Tripodi's appointment, said the nomination was significant since Tripodi comes from outside consumer products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "People I've talked to say he is skilled and experienced. But he'll now have to learn a business which is much more complex than it appears to many people from the outside," Sicher said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    At Coke, Tripodi succeeds Mary Minnick, whose departure was announced in January, less than two months after the world's largest beverage company named Muhtar Kent to the No. 2 job of chief operating officer, a position some industry observers thought might go to Minnick. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coke shares were down 34 cents at $52.64 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Martinne Geller, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) is looking
for spot oil product supplies in Europe, traders said on Friday,
as its Fawley refinery in the UK remains closed after a fire.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon shut its 326,000-barrel per day plant, Britain's
largest, and a chemical complex after fire broke out in a steam
generator on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said Exxon had been looking for prompt July
gasoline, jet fuel and diesel cargoes in Northwest Europe since
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stasco on Friday bought a jet fuel cargo for delivery into
Fawley between Aug 12 and Aug 16 at $70 a tonne over front month
ICE gas oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the cargo may be part of a regular supply of jet fuel
imports -- brokers said Stasco had a contract to supply Exxon
with the product -- an extended shutdown at the refinery would
spur additional buying, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Europe is structurally short of jet fuel, and relies on
imports from outlets such as the Middle East.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prompt gasoline cargoes PU-C-NWE were assessed at
$706.50/$$710.50 a tonne cif NWE, maintaining $14 premiums
against benchmark Eurograde gasoline barges PU-10PP-ARA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, the gasoline cargo premiums against the
Eurograde barges were about $8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Exxon said the company would ensure it
supplied its customers with oil products, but declined to
comment on specific inquiries for spot purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to say when the company would restart the Fawley
plant, which accounts for almost a fifth of Britain's refining
capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, Exxon said it would restart the plant over the
next several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European gasoline's crack against Brent crude BFO- has
recovered to around $6.95 a barrel on Friday, after hitting
about $4 earlier this week, the weakest since February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The outage of Fawley could support product crack levels,
coming at a time when some European refiners are trimming output
because of poor margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ConocoPhillips has reduced runs at its 227,000 barrel-a-day
Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany, the U.S. company's Chief
Executive Officer Jim Mulva said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We've taken an economic decision to cut back runs at the
Wilhelsmaven refinery because of the run-up in crude prices and
the impact on margins," Mulva said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brent crude futures LCOc1 surged to $78.40 a barrel
earlier in July, just 25 cents shy of its all-time high.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was trading at $75.78 a barrel by 1722 GMT on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Complex European refineries' margins recovered to $1.53 a
barrel as of Friday, comapred with the profit level of 80 cents
a barrel over the past week, according to Reuters calculation.

 "toolkit" for small businesses in developing countries, and
women and minority entrepreneurs in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The toolkit, which offers software, business forms,
training and more help to small businesses, is meant to provide
them with access to technological tools "usually reserved for
Fortune 1000 companies," IBM said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Small businesses are the growth engines of the world's

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) Chairman and Chief Executive Dave O'Reilly said on Friday restart of units at the company's 265,000 barrel per day (bpd) Los Angeles-area refinery in El Segundo, California, was nearing completion.&lt;/p&gt;

co-head of mergers and acquisitions Dag Skattum, who is leaving
the U.S.-based investment bank, will join private equity firm
TPG [TPG.UL], sources familiar with the matter said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Skattum, who has worked for 21 years at the U.S. bank in
both the New York and London offices, will be a partner at the
buyout firm, the sources said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan on Thursday named Larry Slaughter and Hernan
Cristerna as co-heads of MA for Europe, the Middle East and
Africa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan and TPG both declined to comment on Skattum's

Skattum was promoted to global co-head of MA last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jimmy Elliott, the other co-head, will continue as
JPMorgan's sole global head of MA.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, July 27 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) said on
Friday it plans to drill another appraisal well at its closely
watched Jack prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico in early
2008.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In June, the company said it would drill the well either
later this year or early next year, noting that lack of
availability of drilling rigs had slowed the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron operates the Jack field and has a 50 percent stake
in the project. Devon Energy Corp. (DVN.N) and Norway's Statoil
(STL.OL) each own a 25 percent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron-led group announced it had successfully tested
an appraisal well at Jack in September 2006, making it the
deepest successful well in the Gulf of Mexico.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) is looking
for spot oil product supplies in Europe, traders said on Friday,
as its Fawley refinery in the UK remains closed after a fire.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon shut its 326,000-barrel per day plant, Britain's
largest, and a chemical complex after fire broke out in a steam
generator on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traders said Exxon had been looking for prompt July gasoline
and diesel cargoes in Northwest Europe since Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prompt gasoline cargoes PU-C-NWE were assessed at
$706.50/$$710.50 a tonne cif NWE, maintaining $14 premiums
against benchmark Eurograde gasoline barges PU-10PP-ARA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Tuesday, the gasoline cargo premiums against the
Eurograde barges were about $8.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman for Exxon said the company would ensure it
supplied its customers with oil products, but declined to
comment on specific inquiries for spot purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined to say when the company would restart the Fawley
plant, which accounts for almost a fifth of Britain's refining
capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Thursday, Exxon said it would restart the plant over the
next several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European gasoline's crack against Brent crude BFO- has
recovered to around $6.95 a barrel on Friday, after hitting
about $4 earlier this week, the weakest since February.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Shares of Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) rose before the opening bell on Friday after the oil company reported earnings and revenues that topped Wall Street estimates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares rose 1.2 percent to $88.50 in electronic composite trading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reports Q2 (Jun) earnings of $2.52 per share, $0.24 better than the Reuters Estimates consensus of $2.28; revenues rose 6.8% year/year to $56.09 bln. Worldwide oil-equivalent production was 2.63 million barrels per day in the second quarter 2007, a decline of about 1 percent from the corresponding period in 2006, due mainly to the effect of the conversion of operating service agreements in Venezuela to joint-stock companies and lower production in the United States. Production increased between periods in Bangladesh, Angola, Azerbaijan and the United Kingdom. The average sales price per barrel of crude oil and natural gas liquids was $57 in the second quarter 2007, a decrease of about $3 from the corresponding 2006 period. The average sales price of natural gas increased approximately 11 percent to $6.56 per thousand cubic feet.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Recasts with analysts' estimates, comments; segment results; background; byline) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Martinne Geller &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NEW YORK, July 26 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Enterprises Inc. (CCE.N) on Thursday reported higher-than-expected quarterly profit, citing cost controls, price increases in North America and the European launch of Coke Zero, and the bottler raised its full-year outlook. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The largest bottler of Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) drinks has been squeezed by high raw material costs and falling U.S. soft-drink demand in the United States, its largest market. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Second-quarter net income fell 20 percent to $270 million, or 56 cents per share, from $339 million, or 71 cents per share, a year earlier, when a tax benefit boosted results.  Excluding restructuring charges and other items, profit was 58 cents per share. Analysts on average were expecting 55 cents, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Atlanta-based company, which also sells Coke products in Belgium, France, Britain and the Netherlands, said the weak dollar added 2 cents per share to earnings. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coke Enterprises, which bottles, sells and distributes more than three-quarters of the Coke drinks sold in North America,  said it now expected to earn $1.27 to $1.32 per share for the full year. That's above the analysts' average estimate of $1.24 per share, according to Reuters Estimates. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company, which is about 36 percent owned by Coca-Cola Co., had previously forecast that 2007 earnings would be 5 percent to 10 percent lower than the $1.30 it earned last year. That forecast implied earnings of $1.17 to $1.24, according to Morgan Stanley analyst William Pecoriello. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Given that consensus is too low on 2007 and we are significantly above (consensus) on 2008 due to savings and benefits of (recently-acquired) Glaceau, we expect a positive reaction with the shares," Pecoriello said in a research note. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Coke Enterprises shares were up 7 cents at $23.65 in morning New York Stock Exchange trade. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    NORTH AMERICA VOLUME STILL WEAK &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Quarterly net operating revenue rose nearly 4 percent to $5.67 billion, as price increases in North America helped offset volume declines. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Sales by volume, a closely watched industry metric, fell 3 percent in North America, where consumers are moving from soft drinks toward bottled water, teas and energy drinks, which they perceive to have functional or health benefits. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Volume of carbonated soft drinks fell 4.5 percent in the United States, while noncarbonated drinks -- including Powerade sports drink, Dasani bottled water and Minute Maid orange juice &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- rose in the mid-single-digit range. -- rose in the mid-single-digit range. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Price increases and cost cuts helped offset the impact of sharply higher costs for aluminum in cans and high-fructose corn syrup used for sweetener, the company said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    European volume rose 2 percent, helped by strong sales of Coca-Cola Zero, a new no-calorie cola that Coke has called the best brand launch in decades. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    As of Wednesday, shares of Coca-Cola Enterprises were trading at 19 times full-year earnings estimates, a premium to Pepsi Bottling Group Inc. PBG.N, the largest bottler of PepsiCo Inc. (PEP.N) drinks, which had a price-to-earnings multiple of 17, according to Reuters Data.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Martinne Geller) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Lisa Von Ahn; Reuters messaging: martinne.geller.reuters.com@reuters.net; martinne.geller@reuters.com; +1 646 223 6023)) Keywords: COCACOLAENTERPRISES RESULTS/  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt; (Adds more quotes from Ballmer, details) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    By Daisuke Wakabayashi &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    REDMOND, Wash., July 26 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp. (MSFT.O) Chief Executive Steve Ballmer defended the software company's expansion beyond its Windows and office software businesses, saying Web services and consumer devices are key to the company's future. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Speaking on Thursday at an annual meeting with financial analysts, Ballmer acknowledged he had been "hammered" by investors who argued Microsoft should focus on its core desktop and server software business and forget businesses like digital music players and video games. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft aims to make software that integrates the best features of desktop software, higher-end corporate software, Web services and devices, and it needs to be in all of those areas to keep up with the pace of innovation, Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Great things don't happen overnight," he said. "Most successes require long-term investment and innovation ... and that's our perspective." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Ballmer said he is more "optimistic" now than at any point in the company's history and sees more opportunities for growth in the next 10 years than in the past 30 years. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft's expansion into new businesses has not always been smooth. Ballmer said the $1.06 billion charge the company took to fix problems with the Xbox game console was "painful," teaching it a lesson about hardware design. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft can also drive growth through its bread-and-butter software products like the Windows operating system and Office productivity software, Ballmer said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    New versions of Office and Windows are yielding higher-than-expected renewals of multiyear agreements with large organizations, according to Microsoft. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The cash generated from those products, which account for almost all of the company's profit, support Microsoft's newer initiatives like online advertising, its Zune music player, software for mobile phones and online service. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft said it sold 60 million Windows Vista licenses as of the end of June, including 20 million copies sold since mid-May. Windows Vista, the latest version of its dominant Windows operating system, was released on Jan. 30. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company said it expects the total installed base of the Windows operating system to hit one billion -- which Microsoft noted was more than the number of cars in the world -- during the current fiscal year. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    EMBRACE DISRUPTION &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Ballmer said the company plans to embrace "disruptive technologies" like Web-based applications that threaten Microsoft's traditional desktop software, which runs locally on a computer hard drive. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Every piece of software -- the basic core value in the way software gets created -- will change in the next three, five or 10 years," said Ballmer, adding that future software will all factor in some aspect of desktop, Web and server elements. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    However, he rejected the idea that the software industry would shift entirely to an Internet delivery model. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Microsoft also said it is committed to building an advertising powerhouse to compete with Google Inc. (GOOG.O) and Yahoo Inc. (YHOO.O) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The company announced the acquisition of AdECN, a market for buyers and sellers of Web advertising. AdECN functions like a stock exchange for advertisers and publishers to buy and sell display advertising online. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "It allows us to move ahead with all the core components needed to enable an ad platform," said Kevin Johnson, president of Microsoft's platforms and services division, without disclosing the deal's financial terms. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The acquisition comes on the heels of Microsoft's plan to purchase Web advertising firm aQuantive Inc. AQNT.O for $6 billion earlier this year. Microsoft said the aQuantive deal cleared regulatory hurdles and will close in mid-August. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Johnson said the company's online services group will undergo another year of investment in this fiscal year, suggesting that the loss-making division will not turn a profit in fiscal 2008. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Eric Auchard in San Francisco) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY (Reuters) - The Australian government said on Sunday it would not reinstate the work visa of an Indian doctor who has been freed from jail after authorities dropped terrorism charges against him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The doctor, Mohamed Haneef, was released from prison on Friday after a charge against him of supporting terrorism was dropped due to a lack of evidence to prove his connection with a failed car bomb plot in Britain. He voluntarily flew home to India on Saturday after 25 days in custody.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But despite the collapse of the case, Australia Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews has ruled out reinstating Haneef's work visa, barring a possible court ruling to overturn his decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"His visa has been cancelled and unless there is some overturning of that by the Federal Court, it's my indication that that visa will remain cancelled," Andrews told local television Seven Network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haneef, 27, had been charged with recklessly supporting terrorism by providing a relative in Britain -- his second cousin Sabeel Ahmed -- with his mobile phone SIM card.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors had told an Australian court that Haneef's SIM card was found in the burning jeep in Glasgow, allegedly used by his second cousin, Kafeel Ahmed, in a failed car bombing on June 30.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But prosecution lawyers agreed on Friday the SIM card was in fact found in the home of Sabeel, Kafeel's brother, in Liverpool, more than 200 kilometers from the attack scene.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haneef has all along said that he had left his SIM card with Sabeel in Liverpool in mid-2006, when Haneef left Britain to work in Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haneef's lawyers have submitted a court application to appeal against the immigration office's decision to revoke Haneef's work visa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Haneef's case has drawn sharp criticisms against the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for prosecuting the doctor despite the lack of strong evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty has defended his department's handling of the case and said errors such as where Haneef's mobile SIM card was found, were initially made by British authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Haneef attempted to leave the country.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, July 29 (Reuters) - The Australian government said on Sunday it would not reinstate the work visa of an Indian doctor who has been freed from jail after authorities dropped terrorism charges against him. The doctor, Mohamed Haneef, was released from prison on Friday after a charge against him of supporting terrorism was dropped due to a lack of evidence to prove his connection with a failed car bomb plot in Britain. He voluntarily flew home to India on Saturday after 25 days in custody. But despite the collapse of the case, Australia Immigration Minister Kevin Andrews has ruled out reinstating Haneef's work visa, barring a possible court ruling to overturn his decision. His visa has been cancelled and unless there is some overturning of that by the Federal Court, it's my indication that that visa will remain cancelled, Andrews told local television Seven Network. Haneef, 27, had been charged with recklessly supporting terrorism by providing a relative in Britain -- his second cousin Sabeel Ahmed -- with his mobile phone SIM card. Prosecutors had told an Australian court that Haneef's SIM card was found in the burning jeep in Glasgow, allegedly used by his second cousin, Kafeel Ahmed, in a failed car bombing on June 30. But prosecution lawyers agreed on Friday the SIM card was in fact found in the home of Sabeel, Kafeel's brother, in Liverpool, more than 200 kilometres from the attack scene. Haneef has all along said that he had left his SIM card with Sabeel in Liverpool in mid-2006, when Haneef left Britain to work in Australia. Haneef's lawyers have submitted a court application to appeal against the immigration office's decision to revoke Haneef's work visa. Haneef's case has drawn sharp criticisms against the Australian Federal Police (AFP) for prosecuting the doctor despite the lack of strong evidence. But AFP Commissioner Mick Keelty has defended his department's handling of the case and said errors such as where Haneef's mobile SIM card was found, were initially made by British authorities. Haneef attempted to leave the country. If we had let him go, we would have been accused of letting a terrorist escape our shores, Keelty was quoted as saying in the Sydney Morning Herald. Police in Britain have charged three people over the attempted attacks, including Sabeel, who is accused of failing to disclose information that could have prevented an attack. Kafeel remains in hospital after being badly burned when a jeep was driven into an airport terminal in Glasgow and set ablaze.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, July 29 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp. (CVX.N) reported
flaring at its 243,000 barrel per day San Francisco-area
refinery in Richmond, Callfornia, late on Friday night to
California pollution regulators, according to a regulatory
filing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The flaring was due to an instrumentation problem on the
sulfur recovery system, according to the notice filed on
Saturday with the California Office of Emergency Services.

&lt;p&gt;MIAMI (Reuters) - Rights to O.J. Simpson's book "If I Did It," a hypothetical account of how he could have killed his ex-wife, on Monday passed to relatives of Ron Goldman, who was murdered along with Nicole Brown Simpson in 1994.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KANO, Nigeria, July 30 (Reuters) - A Nigerian court on Monday adjourned until October a case brought by the northern state of Kano against U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N), which it accuses of harming children by testing an unapproved drug on them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Kano state government is seeking $2 billion in damages from Pfizer, which it says caused the deaths of 11 children and permanent health problems for many others in a 1996 drug trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer denies the allegations and says it acted ethically when it tested the antibiotic Trovan on 200 children during a meningitis outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Justice Sanusi Ciroma Yusuf of the Kano state high court deferred the civil suit to Oct. 3 after the government's lawyer asked for time to study a defence statement filed by Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The U.S. drugmaker is challenging the court's jurisdiction to hear the lawsuit on the grounds that Pfizer is not a Nigerian company. When a U.S. federal judge dismissed a similar suit in 2005, he said the case should be heard in a Nigerian court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Kano state has filed separate criminal charges against Pfizer, with a hearing also due in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nigeria's federal government has also filed criminal charges and a $6.5 billion civil lawsuit against Pfizer, saying the company deceived authorities about the details of the tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer says it conducted the tests in the full knowledge of the government, in a responsible and ethical way consistent with its commitment to patient safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Trovan for adult use in 1997 but did not clear the drug for use by children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Mike Oboh, writing by Tume Ahemba, editing by Catherine Evans; Lagos newsroom tel: +234 1 463 0257))   Keywords: PFIZER NIGERIA/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.

Monday a weekend instrumentation problem at its 243,000 barrel

California, was quickly corrected without affecting
operations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company filed a notice on Saturday with California
pollution regulators indicating a vapor release at the refinery
due to the problem with instrumentation on the sulfur recovery
system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The instrumentation difficulties were corrected without any
vapor release and the filing was made as a precaution, said
refinery spokeswoman Camille Priselac.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, July 30 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) said on
Monday it was restarting some units at its 326,000 barrels per
day Fawley oil refinery in the UK after an unplanned shutdown
last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last Wednesday, a fire at a steam generator forced Exxon to
close the whole refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are restarting operation down there," an Exxon
spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She declined to specify the units the company was bringing
back online or when the plant, Britain's largest, would return
to normal operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The restart is in line with Exxon's statement on Thursday in
which it said it planned to restart the refinery, which accounts
for almost a fifth of the UK's total refining capacity, over the
next several days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The outage coincided with several glitches at refineries in
the region last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fire at Fawley followed a blaze at Exxon's Rotterdam
fire, which forced the comapny to shut a vacuum distillation
column and a flexicoker, another spokesman for Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The units returned to normal operation by the end of Tuesday
and were working normally on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Besides Fawley, traders said ConocoPhillips had problems 
producing gasoline and diesel at its 227,000 barrel-a-day
Wilhelmshaven refinery in Germany on Thursday and Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While the problems have been solved, they came on top of
reduced refinery runs at the plant due to weak margins.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Iain Pocock)

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, July 30 (Reuters) - Natural gas from Indonesia's
Cepu block contains high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) that
will increase production costs from the field, an Exxon Mobil
Indonesia official said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil (XOM.N), which jointly operates the $2.6
billion Cepu development onshore East and Central Java with
state oil firm Pertamina, has no time frame for producing gas
from the field. But crude oil production from the block is
expected to begin at the end of 2008 or early 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The CO2 in the Jambaran field in Cepu block is around 30
percent. I don't think it is a problem, but the cost will be
higher to produce the gas," Maman Budiman, senior
vice-president at Exxon Mobil Indonesia, told Reuters by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It will cost more to separate the C02 from the gas," he
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An official at energy watchdog BPMIGAS said normal CO2
levels in natural gas are between 0 and 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is a technology to separate the CO2. BPMIGAS wants
Exxon to continue with its plan to develop the gas from Cepu,
because Indonesia needs it," the official, who declined to be
identified, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dodi Hidayat, deputy chief of BPMIGAS, said the cost of
producing natural gas from Jambaran field is estimated at 30
percent higher than normal production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon Mobil's Budiman said it was too early to say how much
it would add to costs, or whether it would delay production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cepu has an estimated 1.7 trillion cubic feet of natural
gas reserves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kurtubi, an analyst at the Center for Petroleum and Energy
Economics Studies in Jakarta, said there was a possibility of a
delay in gas production from Cepu.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Exxon and Pertamina have to assess cost production and
re-study whether the market can absorb the gas from the block
as high prices," Kurtubi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indonesia, Asia-Pacific's only OPEC member, is increasing
its use of alternative energy such as natural gas in a bid to
reduce oil use amid high prices and its dwindling oil
production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cepu also has estimated crude oil reserves of up to 600
million barrels, equivalent to 6.7 percent of Indonesia's
total, and is expected to produce up to 180,000 barrels per day
at its peak.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A weak dollar, confident consumers 
and a new television ratings system could buttress Walt Disney 
Co's (DIS.N) performance this year, analysts said ahead of the 
company's third quarter results announcement on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Most analysts expect Disney's broadcast and cable business, 
the largest contributor to revenue and operating income, to 
fuel a fifth straight year of double-digit growth in operating 
income, and for its theme parks to contribute at least modestly 
to the bottom line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts, on average, expect net earnings of 56 cents per 
share and revenue of $9.04 billion for the quarter, according 
to Reuters Estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The weak dollar could be attracting greater numbers of 
European travelers to Walt Disney World Resort, which generates 
about 80 percent of the theme parks division's revenue and 
operating income, said SMH Capital analyst David Miller.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I would say that folks are going to be pleasantly 
surprised by the performance of parks in the June quarter," 
Miller said. "It wouldn't surprise us to see Disney clock in 
with mid-single digit revenue growth at the parks."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts expect big things from Disney Consumer Products, 
its smallest business, which said earlier this year it would 
see record-breaking global retail sales of $26 billion in 
fiscal 2007. Disney receives royalties and other revenue equal 
to a low double-digit percentage of retail sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This segment should be up nicely," Bank of America analyst 
Jonathan Jacoby said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Despite generally upbeat expectations for fiscal 2007, 
which ends September 30, some, including UBS analyst Michael 
Morris, cautioned Disney was "highly exposed" to risk from a 
slowing economy or consumer weakness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miller also said three of the company's business were 
"highly tethered to the economy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The stock price could be affected by any measurable 
economic downturn ... but aside from housing, the economy is 
good," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Data released on Tuesday by the Confidence Board showed 
U.S. consumer confidence in July rising to a near-six-year high 
and that most U.S. consumers expect business conditions, income 
and employment to remain the same in the next six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For the third quarter, Walt Disney Studios faces tough 
comparisons with last year, which included the top-selling DVD 
release of "The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch and 
the Wardrobe." But the studio's performance should benefit 
later this year when their costs are accounted for, from 
"Ratatouille" and the third "Pirates of the Caribbean," and on 
lower costs from a smaller film slate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two films, released in May and June, have racked up 
$1.16 billion so far at global box offices and are expected to 
be released on DVD in Disney's fiscal 2008 first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts said the ABC network could enjoy momentum in the 
quarter and back half of the year from hit shows such as 
"Grey's Anatomy" and "Ugly Betty," which continue to deliver 
strong advertising and syndication revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cable networks, especially ESPN and the Disney Channel, 
were seen as strong drivers of affiliate fees and subscriber 
growth, with ESPN delivering deferred revenue in the quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's TV business could see an upside starting this fall 
from political advertising and from a new audience measuring 
system that counts viewers who record shows and watch them 
later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman Bros. analyst Anthony DiClemente said Disney appears 
to have benefited from the new ratings system, which pushed up 
prices during this year's advance advertising sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MILAN, July 31 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is poised to
win a war with Merrill Lynch MER.N for an Italian real estate
fund after its higher offer, valuing the fund around 548 million
euros ($750.9 million), won the favour of the fund's manager.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman's final offer for 95 percent of the Berenice fund
QFBER.MI, or 570,000 units, stood at 913 euros per unit
against Merrill's 827 euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund's manager, Pirelli  C Real Estate (PCRE.MI),
recommended on Tuesday that Berenice unit holders accept
Goldman's offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the offer was 19.8 percent higher than the fund's
net asset value on June 30. It was also 40 percent higher than
Goldman's initial offer of 650 euros, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pirelli RE, a real estate company controlled by Pirelli  C
(PECI.MI), said it had suspended the sale of five properties in
Rome owned by the fund, as requested by Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Berenice owns 51 properties with a combined market value of
about 845.4 million euros as at June 30, it said. Most are
office buildings in Rome and Milan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman made the offer through a vehicle called Zwinger,
while Merrill did it through its Galante vehicle.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;KANO, Nigeria, July 30 (Reuters) - A Nigerian court on Monday adjourned until October a case brought by the northern state of Kano against U.S. drugmaker Pfizer Inc. (PFE.N), which it accuses of harming children by testing an unapproved drug on them. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The Kano state government is seeking $2 billion in damages from Pfizer, which it says caused the deaths of 11 children and permanent health problems for many others in a 1996 drug trial. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer denies the allegations and says it acted ethically when it tested the antibiotic Trovan on 200 children during a meningitis outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Justice Sanusi Ciroma Yusuf of the Kano state high court deferred the civil suit to Oct. 3 after the government's lawyer asked for time to study a defence statement filed by Pfizer. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The U.S. drugmaker is challenging the court's jurisdiction to hear the lawsuit on the grounds that Pfizer is not a Nigerian company. When a U.S. federal judge dismissed a similar suit in 2005, he said the case should be heard in a Nigerian court. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Kano state has filed separate criminal charges against Pfizer, with a hearing also due in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Nigeria's federal government has also filed criminal charges and a $6.5 billion civil lawsuit against Pfizer, saying the company deceived authorities about the details of the tests. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Pfizer says it conducted the tests in the full knowledge of the government, in a responsible and ethical way consistent with its commitment to patient safety. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Trovan for adult use in 1997 but did not clear the drug for use by children. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((Reporting by Mike Oboh, writing by Tume Ahemba, editing by Catherine Evans; Lagos newsroom tel: +234 1 463 0257))   Keywords: PFIZER NIGERIA/ &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2007.
