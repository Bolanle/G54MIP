 By Ayesha Rascoe

 WASHINGTON, June 1 (Reuters) - Natural gas drillers are
doing too little to inform the public about the chemicals used
in hydraulic fracturing, a practice essential for tapping the
United States' shale gas reserves, a Chevron (CVX.N) executive
told a federal panel on Wednesday.

 Advances in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, have led to
a boom in shale gas drilling, but the expansion of shale gas
development has led to concerns about potential water
contamination. [ID:nN18229665]

 While companies have begun releasing some details about the
chemicals they use when drilling wells, firms have raised
concerns about possibly revealing trade secrets.

 Gary Luquette, president of North America exploration and
production for Chevron, said it was time for industry to stop
dragging its feet on disclosure.

 "We have used this 'intellectual property' issue as a
convenient excuse to move slow," Luquette told a federal panel
set up by the Obama administration to offer recommendations on
improving the safety of hydraulic fracturing.

 "I personally believe there is space in the middle between
protecting the IP and giving the public the information they
desire," he said.

 Landowners near shale gas developments have blamed
fracking, which involves injecting water, sand and chemicals
into rock formations to obtain oil and gas, for fouling water
supplies.

 Aubrey McClendon, chief executive of Chesapeake Energy Corp
(CHK.N), disputed the notion that companies had been slow to
reveal information about their fracking fluids.

 "I think we're going very, very quickly," he said, pointing
out that Chesapeake had begun releasing details about the wells
it drills on a central website, fracfocus.org.

 A blowout at a Chesapeake Energy natural gas well spewed
thousands of gallons of fracking fluids in northeastern
Pennsylvania in late April.

 EVERYTHING'S LOCAL?

 At its first public meeting, the federal natural gas panel
also weighed the need for a new industry group focused on
developing best practices for shale gas drillers.

 Industry representatives at the meeting stressed that any
standards developed for natural gas drilling should be
implemented by state regulators to address local needs and be
responsive to rapidly changing techniques.

 Environmental groups at the meeting said fracking, which is
mostly exempt from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
oversight, should be regulated at the federal level.

 But drillers argue that fracking is safe, and that onerous
federal regulations would hurt natural gas output.

 The panel, which includes Daniel Yergin, chairman of IHS
Cambridge Energy Research Associates, is slated to report what
immediate steps are needed to improve public and environmental
safety of fracking within 90 days of beginning its work.

 Within six months it will also develop advice for the
government on practices for shale extraction to ensure public
health.

 Green groups complained that the composition of the panel
seemed biased toward industry interests.

 "The Obama administration says it's concerned about
ethics and lack of conflicts of interest, but now we're
spending ... taxpayer dollars to create an industry-dominated
panel," said Dusty Horwitt, of the Environmental Working
Group.

 Horwitt said six out of seven panel members had financial
ties to the oil and gas industry and he called for the panel's
chair John Deutch to step down. Deutch, a professor at MIT, has
served on the board of directors for Schlumberger Ltd (SLB.N),
a top oil services company involved in fracking.

      Advances in Product Line Engineering for Systems and Software at IBM 
      Innovate 2011
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			General Motors and BigLever Software to Co-present New Innovations 
      in Product Line Engineering for the Automotive Industry
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BigLever Software&#8482;, the leading provider of systems and software product 
      line (SPL) engineering framework, tools and services, announced today 
      that Dr. Charles Krueger, the company's Founder and CEO, has been 
      invited to present three sessions during this year&#8217;s IBM Innovate 
      conference to be held in Orlando, Florida, June 5-9, 2011. Dr. Krueger 
      was also invited to serve as an industry expert on a panel discussion 
      about the emerging convergence of application lifecycle management 
      (ALM), product lifecycle management (PLM) and product line engineering 
      (PLE).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a strategic IBM partner, BigLever Software has teamed with IBM 
      Rational to deliver leading-edge PLE solutions to meet growing demand 
      among the companies&#8217; mutual customers. Dr. Krueger&#8217;s role at Innovate 
      2011 will be to spotlight the latest innovations enabled by new 
      generation PLE technologies and methodologies. In his overview 
      presentation, entitled &#8220;Product Line Engineering for Systems and 
      Software,&#8221; he will explore how new generation PLE approaches are 
      delivering dramatic improvements in efficiency, scalability and quality. 
      Dr. Krueger will provide a snapshot of the industry&#8217;s most notable PLE 
      implementations across a spectrum of market sectors such as automotive, 
      aerospace and defense, electronics, alternative energy, computer 
      hardware and software, and e-commerce systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			General Motors and BigLever Software Presentations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. Krueger&#8217;s Innovate participation will include co-presented sessions 
      with General Motors representatives, including a GM case study entitled 
      &#8220;Feature-based Product Line Engineering Across the Lifecycle at General 
      Motors&#8221; and a requirements-focused session entitled &#8220;Product Line 
      Requirements Engineering at General Motors using DOORS, Gears and 
      Publishing Engine.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The case study session will address how GM&#8217;s deployment of a 
      feature-based PLE solution is enabling the company to manage the 
      exponential complexities of product line engineering including a vast 
      number of vehicles and subsystems, with diverse variations in features, 
      across multiple software and hardware lifecycles phases, on overlapping 
      development streams targeting different delivery dates. Key innovations 
      to be explored include the engineering and automated assembly of 
      different vehicle configurations from a high-level bill-of-features, 
      rather than manual assembly of a low-level bill-of-materials.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The requirements-focused presentation will offer insights into the 
      innovative combination of tools and methods GM is implementing to 
      achieve new levels of efficiency in product line requirements 
      engineering. This session will feature how GM&#8217;s PLE approach is enabling 
      engineering teams to create a consolidated collection of common and 
      varying product line requirements, leverage feature-based variation 
      points and an automated feature-based product configurator, and 
      automatically translate PLE requirements into different formats needed 
      for downstream lifecycle standards.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			ALM/PLM/PLE Convergence Panel
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The panel discussion, entitled &#8220;The Convergence of ALM, PLM and PLE in 
      Modern Systems Engineering,&#8221; brings together industry leaders from the 
      three systems engineering disciplines to explore the issues and 
      challenges created by this technology convergence. The panelists will 
      address how these disciplines must collaborate to create converge 
      solutions for overcoming the complexities of delivering multiple 
      systems, with multiple variations in features and functions, through 
      multiple lifecycle phases, synchronized across both hardware and 
      software development lifecycles, on multiple overlapping development 
      streams targeting a rolling sequence of different delivery dates.

			Virtual Computer Added to Microsoft System Center Alliance

		&lt;p&gt;
			NxTop&#174; Solution Complements Microsoft System 
      Center with Distributed Desktop Virtualization
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Virtual Computer, the market leader in distributed desktop 
      virtualization, today announced its membership in the Microsoft 
      System Center Alliance. Virtual Computer NxTop&#174; 
      is the first solution in the industry to work with Microsoft System 
      Center to manage virtual 
      desktops running locally on end-user PCs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Organizations of all sizes use the Microsoft System Center suite of 
      products for better insight and control of their servers and end-point 
      devices across physical, virtual and distributed environments. Through 
      the addition of the Virtual Computer NxTop desktop virtualization 
      solution, Microsoft customers are able to combine centralized management 
      with distributed execution directly on locally virtualized desktops. For 
      example, customers can use System Center Configuration Manager task 
      manager to quickly build golden images that NxTop can publish to 
      thousands of virtualized desktops. Virtual Computer is also adding 
      functionality that will allow NxTop to provide hardware and software 
      inventory information from virtual machines through Configuration 
      Manager.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Virtual Computer&#8217;s addition to the Microsoft System Center Alliance 
      continues our longstanding commitment to the Microsoft product 
      ecosystem,&#8221; said Sham Sao, SVP of Product for Virtual Computer. &#8220;We&#8217;re 
      excited to be deepening and extending our relationship with Microsoft.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      NxTop&#8217;s central management technology accelerates customer adoption of 
      Microsoft Hyper-V on either Windows Server 2008 R2 or Windows Server 
      2008 R2 SP1 and enables broader use of App-V. The combination of System 
      Center and NxTop enables joint customers to augment their existing 
      native PC and virtual desktop management capabilities, reducing upfront 
      data center expenses and accelerating return on investment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;NxTop working in concert with Microsoft System Center offers a powerful 
      new option for realizing the management benefits of desktop 
      virtualization while leveraging existing infrastructure and 
      investments,&#8221; said Sergio Klarreich, Director Strategic Alliances, 
      Management and Security Division at Microsoft Corp. &#8220;We are pleased to 
      welcome Virtual Computer into the Microsoft System Center Alliance and 
      look forward to collaborating on new ways to help IT teams reduce costs 
      and improve operational efficiency.&#8221;

			ZeaChem Executes Joint Development Agreement with Procter  Gamble
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Agreement Will Accelerate Commercialization of Sustainable Bio-based 
      Chemicals
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ZeaChem Inc., a developer of biorefineries for the conversion of 
      renewable feedstocks into sustainable fuels and chemicals, today 
      announced a binding multi-year joint development agreement with Procter 
       Gamble (NYSE: PG). The agreement will accelerate development of 
      ZeaChem&#8217;s product platform beyond C2 through the 
      commercialization of &#8220;drop-in&#8221; bio-based chemicals and other products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As part of its long-term environmental sustainability vision, PG is 
      committed to using 100% sustainably sourced renewable or recycled 
      materials for all products and packaging,&#8221; said Len Sauers, PG&#8217;s vice 
      president for global sustainability. &#8220;Novel innovations from our 
      suppliers, such as ZeaChem&#8217;s unique process to create bio-based 
      chemicals, are critical to us achieving this vision.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re very pleased to partner with Procter  Gamble, a global leader in 
      consumer products and sustainable operations,&#8221; said Jim Imbler, 
      president and CEO of ZeaChem. &#8220;This definitive agreement will accelerate 
      the time to market for our new product platform and the commercial 
      production of economical and sustainable biofuels and bio-based 
      chemicals using ZeaChem&#8217;s highly efficient technology.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ZeaChem&#8217;s process uses renewable feedstocks such as poplar trees and 
      agricultural residues to produce the highest yield and lowest carbon 
      emissions of any known biorefining technology. The company has begun 
      fermentation work on this new product platform using the same processes 
      and equipment that the company used to prove and scale up its C2 
      product platform. The
			new platform also enables ZeaChem to 
      ultimately deploy its technology for the production of other bio-based 
      chemicals as well as drop-in fuels. The two companies will utilize 
      ZeaChem&#8217;s existing infrastructure at its lab in Menlo Park, Calif., 
      pilot facility at Hazen Research in Golden, Colo., and 
      demonstration-scale biorefinery in Boardman, Ore. Together, PG and 
      ZeaChem will research, develop and demonstrate, scale-up, and 
      commercialize this new product platform.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About ZeaChem Inc.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ZeaChem Inc. has developed a cellulose-based biorefinery platform 
      capable of producing advanced fuels and intermediate chemicals. 
      ZeaChem's indirect approach leapfrogs the yield and carbon dioxide (CO2) 
      problems associated with traditional and cellulosic based biorefinery 
      processes. In addition, ZeaChem has a significant capital cost advantage 
      compared to other cellulosic technologies. By efficiently extracting the 
      most energy possible from biomass feedstocks, ZeaChem significantly 
      increases output while reducing both production costs and environmental 
      impacts. Incorporated in 2002, ZeaChem is headquartered in Lakewood, 
      Colo. and operates a research and development laboratory facility in 
      Menlo Park, Calif.

			Motorola Solutions Expands PremierOne&#8482; CSR to Microsoft SQL Server 
      2008 for Increased Flexibility and Savings for Cities and Counties
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Next generation Citizen Relationship Management (CRM) system helps 
      reduce total cost of ownership for cities and counties by eliminating 
      need to implement a new database platform
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Motorola 
      Solutions, Inc. (NYSE: MSI) today expanded its Customer 
      Service Request (CSR) portfolio with the release of PremierOne CSR 
      4.2, the first PremierOne CSR version available on both the Microsoft 
      SQL 2008 Server and Oracle 11g platforms. Cities and counties can now 
      choose between either database management system to deploy PremierOne 
      based on their individual public service agency and 3-1-1 Contact Center 
      needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			KEY FACTS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        PremierOne CSR 4.2 enables improved functionality for citizen 
        reporting of issues using a redesigned and enhanced Citizen Web user 
        interface that has a more progressive look and feel, allowing for 
        easier data entry and faster search.
      
			
        PremierOne CSR Citizen Web is the web front-end solution that allows 
        citizens to bypass 311 phone support by going to a city or county web 
        site to look for information and submit service requests, helping to 
        reduce Contact Center call loads.
      
			
        With PremierOne CSR 4.2, Citizen Web is now fully mobile-enabled, 
        allowing citizens to report issues on their smartphones and other 
        mobile devices directly to an appropriate city or county department 
        for action. Citizens can include attachments such as pictures from 
        their PC or mobile device to assist in identifying specific issues 
        being reported.
      
			
        Customers can deploy PremierOne CSR 4.2 on their own information 
        technology (IT) systems or take advantage of Motorola&#8217;s Application 
        Service Provider (ASP) hosted model, which relieves customers of the 
        need to deploy new IT systems while retaining full security and 
        operational control.
      
			
        Fully supporting the Open 311 Standards, CSR 4.2 is available now and 
        being implemented by cities and counties across the U.S.
      
			
        Designed specifically for government, PremierOne CSR streamlines 
        response by automatically routing service requests, weeding out 
        duplicates and coordinating work among service teams. It automates 
        work processes, dispatches crews, tracks progress, and keeps citizens 
        informed, all while producing and maintaining statistical data for 
        cities and counties.
      
			
        PremierOne CSR also helps reduce non-emergency calls to 911 lines and 
        enables governments to communicate with citizens in multiple ways, 
        over the phone or online.

      &#8220;The launch of PremierOne CSR 4.2 demonstrates Motorola Solutions&#8217; 
      ongoing commitment to provide CSR users continued product improvements 
      and mobile-enabled solutions to help enhance citizen safety and service. 
      The availability of two database management systems for PremierOne CSR 
      also means a significant cost reduction for governments because they 
      won&#8217;t be forced to implement a new IT platform with associated 
      equipment, software and personnel costs.&#8221;

			Interxion, Microsoft, KPN International, NL-ix and HP Launch Cloud 
      Testlab
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			INTERXION 
      HOLDING NV, (NYSE:INXN), a leading European provider of carrier-neutral 
      colocation data centre services, together with,Microsoft, KPN 
      International, NL-ix and HP today announced the launch of the Cloud 
      Testlab, a turnkey cloud hosting test environment for service providers, 
      combining industry-leading software, systems, connectivity and 
      colocation capabilities. The collaboration is designed to enable hosting 
      providers to develop cloud services and virtualised environments for 
      their customers at high speed and with best-in-class performance 
      guarantees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first platform deployed in the Cloud Testlab is the Microsoft 
      Dynamic Data Center (DDC) Toolkit for Hosters, which is built on 
      Microsoft&#174; Windows Server&#174; 2008 Hyper-V&#8482; and Microsoft System Center. 
      The toolkit enables hosters to establish service level agreements (SLAs) 
      and create portals that customers can use to directly provision, manage, 
      and monitor their infrastructure. Setup and testing of Microsoft&#8217;s Cloud 
      solution for hosters is offered free of charge for a limited period and 
      is available throughout Europe.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft DDC provides high levels of performance and security, with 
      fast setup and easy scalability. It allows hosting providers to address 
      the growing demand for dynamic cloud infrastructure delivered on 
      state-of-the-art server architecture in high-availability data centers. 
      Their portfolios can be extended with high-value, high-margin services, 
      such as managed hosting, on-demand virtualised servers, clustering, and 
      network services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Creating this test platform enables hosting partners to take the first 
      step for customers moving to the cloud,&#8221; comments Andrew Lund, EMEA 
      Director, Business Services Operator Channels at Microsoft &#8220;Through 
      Microsoft Hyper-V technology, service provider customers can manage all 
      of their physical and virtual resources from a single set of integrated 
      management utilities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The platform is built on a single, shared-service environment (servers, 
      storage and network). This environment, HP Converged Infrastructure, is 
      based out of one of Interxion's 13 Cloud Hub data centres, which provide 
      high levels of security and availability, and in-house access to a wide 
      range of service providers, systems integrators and connectivity 
      providers. Users of the test platform can either connect directly in the 
      data centre or access the solution via an Internet connection provided 
      by NL-ix, one of the world&#8217;s largest Internet exchanges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our HP Converged Infrastructure ensures the Cloud Testlab users a data 
      centre of the future that delivers a whole new level of simplicity, 
      integration and automation,&#8221; said Sander Thonissen, Manager, Service 
      Providers Channel, HP.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Interxion&#8217;s Cloud Hubs offer the highest levels of redundancy, 
      reliability and standards-based operation, with up to 2N UPS power and 
      N+1 cooling, as well as advanced alarm and monitoring systems. Each data 
      center is designed using Interxion&#8217;s energy-efficient modular 
      architecture, with free cooling and maximum-efficiency components as 
      standard. In a Cloud Hub data centre, customers can access the major 
      Tier 1 and Tier 2 networks, leading content distribution networks 
      and&#160;Europe&#8217;s public Internet exchanges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Over the last ten years, NL-ix has developed to become one of world&#8217;s 
      largest Internet exchanges, and NL-ix is proud to connect such a key 
      player as Cloud Testlab to the center of the Internet via our network,&#8221; 
      said Jan Hoogenboom, CEO of NL-ix.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;KPN&#8217;s international IP network ensures that service providers from 
      across Europe can connect to the Cloud Testlab,&#8221; said Edwin Punt, 
      Product Manager KPN International.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Leveraging the Cloud Testlab enables private cloud solutions to be 
      deployed in close proximity to business and residential users across 
      Europe, delivering an exceptional end-user experience,&#8221; said Kevin Dean, 
      Interxion CMO.

&lt;p&gt; * Pfizer files approval application for axitinib&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Co to present full data on drug at ASCO meeting
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; June 1 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc said European
regulators have accepted its  approval application for axitinib
in patients with a certain type of advanced kidney cancer. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer will present full data from the late-stage trial, on
which the submission is based, at a meeting of the American
Society of Clinical Oncology starting later this week. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is looking for European approval to treat
patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of
prior systemic treatment. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axitinib is an oral drug and inhibits certain receptors that
can influence tumor growth and progression of cancer.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About 210,000 people worldwide are diagnosed with kidney
cancer every year and nearly 102,000 people are expected to die
from the disease, Pfizer said in a statement.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axitinib is also being tested in another late-stage trial in
patients with treatment-naive as well as previously treated
advanced renal cell carcinoma, and in a mid-stage study for
treating liver cancer.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - New York prosecutors have asked Goldman Sachs to explain its behavior in the run-up to the financial crisis, the latest investigation that has cast a pall over the reputation of the largest U.S. investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs Group Inc now faces probes by several government authorities into derivatives trades it executed in late 2006 and 2007. On Thursday, sources close to the matter said Goldman received a subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney, who joins the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission in examining Goldman's actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is investigating Goldman as part of a broader probe into the mortgage operations and securitization practices of seven banks. A source familiar with the situation said Schneiderman's office met Goldman executives and attorneys in the past two weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The probes follow a scathing report by U.S. lawmakers that cast Goldman as a central villain of the financial crisis and accused it of misleading clients about mortgage-linked securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report by a Senate subcommittee, headed by Democrat Carl Levin, said Goldman offloaded much of its subprime mortgage exposure to unsuspecting clients as the market for such securities was starting to tank. In some cases, the bank dragged its heels when clients wanted to get out of their losing positions, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investigations do not imply the bank or its top executives will face criminal or civil charges, but they display a growing interest by prosecutors to build a case against Goldman, legal experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They have subpoena power to get certain records, correspondence, emails and they're trying to find out every last detail that could prove fraud," said Peter Berlin, an attorney who represents defendants in white-collar cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Department of Justice is also likely to subpoena the bank, The Wall Street Journal reported recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, is not seeking new documents, according to one source, but wants to ask further questions about the information contained in the Levin report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vance, the son of former U.S. secretary of state Cyrus R. Vance, said earlier this year he wanted to use a far-reaching 1921 law called the Martin Act to toughen penalties for securities fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The state attorney general's probe is largely being conducted under that statute, according to the source familiar with that case. The state can seek civil or criminal charges, while the Manhattan D.A. can only pursue criminal charges, potentially making its burden of proof more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, the Manhattan D.A.'s office has used the Martin Law to crack down on white-collar crime in the past. High-profile cases the office prosecuted using the Martin Act include brokerage firm A.R. Baron  Co and ex-Tyco chief Dennis Kozlowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Goldman said: "We don't comment on specific regulatory or legal issues, but subpoenas are a normal part of the information request process and, of course, when we receive them we cooperate fully."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Levin's and Vance's offices declined comment on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCATHING REPORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The probes into the behavior of Goldman and some of its peers signal increasing determination by U.S. government agencies to investigate the actions of banks in the years leading up to the financial crisis and to determine whether misdeeds by executives made the meltdown worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of the first big cases was the Securities and Exchange Commission's civil fraud suit against Goldman last year over the bank's failure to disclose information linked to a complex mortgage security. Goldman settled those charges in July without admitting or denying guilt, but it did express regret for failing to disclose information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman's shares fell as much as 3.4 percent as news of the subpoena emerged on Thursday, but then took back much of their losses and closed 1.3 percent down at $134.38. The stock has been declining since January, but its sell-off has accelerated since the release of the Levin report and it is now approaching its 52-week low of $129.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if there is a low likelihood of successful civil or criminal action against Goldman Sachs, continued pressure from politicians and the public could still hurt the firm, Sanford Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz wrote in a note on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe that Goldman's clients will begin to rethink their relationship with the firm and the franchise will ultimately suffer," Hintz wrote, adding the bank would be wise to make amends with the public soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But other veteran analysts said recently that concerns about the Goldman investigations are overblown and little will likely come from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein raised his rating on the bank to "overweight" from "neutral" earlier this week and said possible negative news is already reflected in the bank's share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some investors take a more negative view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When the government has you in its cross-hairs, it takes forever to get out of it," said Matt McCormick, portfolio manager at Cincinnati-based Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shareholders need to understand, this is going to be an ongoing risk for years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; additional reporting by David Gaffen, Maria Aspan; editing by Dan Wilchins, John Wallace, Matthew Lewis and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

			SAFE HARBOR PROVISIONS FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This news release may contain forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of the federal securities laws. Statements regarding future 
      events, developments, the Company's future performance, as well as 
      management's expectations, beliefs, intentions, plans, estimates or 
      projections relating to the future (including, without limitation, 
      statements concerning revenue and net income), are forward-looking 
      statements within the meaning of these laws and involve a number of 
      risks and uncertainties. Management believes that these forward looking 
      statements are reasonable and are based on reasonable assumptions and 
      forecasts, however, undue reliance should not be placed on such 
      statements that speak only as of the date hereof. Moreover, these 
      forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and 
      uncertainties, some of which are outlined below. As a result, actual 
      results may vary materially from those anticipated by the 
      forward-looking statements. Among the important factors that could cause 
      actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such 
      forward-looking statements are: the volume and timing of systems sales 
      and installations; length of sales cycles and the installation process; 
      the possibility that products will not achieve or sustain market 
      acceptance; seasonal patterns of sales and customer buying behavior; 
      impact of incentive payments under The American Recovery and 
      Reinvestment Act on sales and the ability of the Company to meet 
      continued certification requirements; the development by competitors of 
      new or superior technologies; the timing, cost and success or failure of 
      new product and service introductions, development and product upgrade 
      releases; undetected errors or bugs in software; product liability; 
      changing economic, political or regulatory influences in the health-care 
      industry; changes in product-pricing policies; availability of 
      third-party products and components; competitive pressures including 
      product offerings, pricing and promotional activities; the Company's 
      ability or inability to attract and retain qualified personnel; possible 
      regulation of the Company's software by the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration; uncertainties concerning threatened, pending and new 
      litigation against the Company including related professional services 
      fees; uncertainties concerning the amount and timing of professional 
      fees incurred by the Company generally; changes of accounting estimates 
      and assumptions used to prepare the prior periods' financial statements; 
      general economic conditions; and the risk factors detailed from time to 
      time in the Company&#8217;s periodic reports and registration statements filed 
      with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			A significant portion of the Company's quarterly sales of software 
      product licenses and computer hardware is concluded in the last month of 
      the fiscal quarter, generally with a concentration of such revenues 
      earned in the final ten business days of that month. Due to these and 
      other factors, the Company's revenues and operating results are very 
      difficult to forecast. A major portion of the Company's costs and 
      expenses, such as personnel and facilities, are of a fixed nature and, 
      accordingly, a shortfall or decline in quarterly and/or annual revenues 
      typically results in lower profitability or losses. As a result, 
      comparison of the Company's period-to-period financial performance is 
      not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indicator 
      of future performance. The Company undertakes no obligation to publicly 
      update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new 
      information, future events or otherwise.

&lt;p&gt; * Experts differ over seriousness of recent subpoenas&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Goldman shares fall 3.4 pct, then take back some losses
 (Adds information about New York Attorney General probe)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lauren Tara LaCapra&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - New York prosecutors have
asked Goldman Sachs to explain its behavior in the run-up to
the financial crisis, the latest investigation that has cast a
pall over the reputation of the largest U.S. investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) now faces probes by several
government authorities into derivatives trades it executed in
late 2006 and 2007. On Thursday, sources close to the matter
said Goldman received a subpoena from the Manhattan district
attorney, who joins the Justice Department and the Securities
and Exchange Commission in examining Goldman's actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman is
investigating Goldman as part of a broader probe into the
mortgage operations and securitization practices of seven
banks. A source familiar with the situation said Schneiderman's
office met Goldman executives and attorneys in the past two
weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The probes follow a scathing report by U.S. lawmakers that
cast Goldman as a central villain of the financial crisis and
accused it of misleading clients about mortgage-linked
securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report by a Senate subcommittee, headed by Democrat
Carl Levin, said Goldman offloaded much of its subprime
mortgage exposure to unsuspecting clients as the market for
such securities was starting to tank. In some cases, the bank
dragged its heels when clients wanted to get out of their
losing positions, according to the report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investigations do not imply the bank or its top
executives will face criminal or civil charges, but they
display a growing interest by prosecutors to build a case
against Goldman, legal experts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They have subpoena power to get certain records,
correspondence, emails and they're trying to find out every
last detail that could prove fraud," said Peter Berlin, an
attorney who represents defendants in white-collar cases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. Department of Justice is also likely to subpoena
the bank, The Wall Street Journal reported recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Manhattan district attorney, Cyrus Vance, is not
seeking new documents, according to one source, but wants to
ask further questions about the information contained in the
Levin report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Vance, the son of former U.S. secretary of state Cyrus R.
Vance, said earlier this year he wanted to use a far-reaching
1921 law called the Martin Act to toughen penalties for
securities fraud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The state attorney general's probe is largely being
conducted under that statute, according to the source familiar
with that case. The state can seek civil or criminal charges,
while the Manhattan D.A. can only pursue criminal charges,
potentially making its burden of proof more difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, the Manhattan D.A.'s office has used the Martin Law
to crack down on white-collar crime in the past. High-profile
cases the office prosecuted using the Martin Act include
brokerage firm A.R. Baron  Co and ex-Tyco chief Dennis
Kozlowski.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement, Goldman said: "We don't comment on specific
regulatory or legal issues, but subpoenas are a normal part of
the information request process and, of course, when we receive
them we cooperate fully."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both Levin's and Vance's offices declined comment on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SCATHING REPORT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The probes into the behavior of Goldman and some of its
peers signal increasing determination by U.S. government
agencies to investigate the actions of banks in the years
leading up to the financial crisis and to determine whether
misdeeds by executives made the meltdown worse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the first big cases was the Securities and Exchange
Commission's civil fraud suit against Goldman last year over
the bank's failure to disclose information linked to a complex
mortgage security. Goldman settled those charges in July
without admitting or denying guilt, but it did express regret
for failing to disclose information.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's shares fell as much as 3.4 percent as news of the
subpoena emerged on Thursday, but then took back much of their
losses and closed 1.3 percent down at $134.38. The stock has
been declining since January, but its sell-off has accelerated
since the release of the Levin report and it is now approaching
its 52-week low of $129.50.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (For a Reuters Insider report on Goldman options trading
soaring, click: link.reuters.com/wyd89r )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Even if there is a low likelihood of successful civil or
criminal action against Goldman Sachs, continued pressure from
politicians and the public could still hurt the firm, Sanford
Bernstein analyst Brad Hintz wrote in a note on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe that Goldman's clients will begin to rethink
their relationship with the firm and the franchise will
ultimately suffer," Hintz wrote, adding the bank would be wise
to make amends with the public soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But other veteran analysts said recently that concerns
about the Goldman investigations are overblown and little will
likely come from them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan analyst Kian Abouhossein raised his rating on the
bank to "overweight" from "neutral" earlier this week and said
possible negative news is already reflected in the bank's share
price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, some investors take a more negative view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When the government has you in its cross-hairs, it takes
forever to get out of it," said Matt McCormick, portfolio
manager at Cincinnati-based Bahl  Gaynor Investment Counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Shareholders need to understand, this is going to be an
ongoing risk for years."

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Two people have reportedly been killed in a fire involving a process tank and a truck broke on Thursday at Chevron's oil refinery in southwest Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The BBC said there were reports that two people had been killed in the fire and an explosion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Welsh Ambulance Service said there were casualties at the scene, but there was no official confirmation of any deaths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire service said the fire at the 220,000 barrel per day Pembroke refinery, which sent a pall of black smoke into the air, had been put out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service told Reuters there had been a fire at a process tank at the refinery and a fire and explosion involving a heavy-goods vehicle -- a term which could cover a truck or a tanker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had no further details about what had happened.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was in the back garden and I just heard a large explosion, looked around and I could see a fireball rising up into the sky," local resident Phil Horne told the BBC, adding that smoke billowed out for between 30 and 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire service said it sent 10 emergency vehicles to the scene and the ambulance service said it responded with three ambulances and an air ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The police said they were at the scene but gave no further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEVRON CONFIRMS INCIDENT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron confirmed an "incident" had occurred at the refinery at 6:20 p.m. (1720 GMT) and that the fire had been extinguished, but gave no further details about it or about any injuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Emergency services were called and responded immediately and remain on the scene. ... We are taking appropriate action to respond to the situation. We are still in the process of accounting for all personnel," Chevron said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokeswoman for Britain's Health and Safety Executive, an independent watchdog for workplace safety issues, said the agency was aware of the incident and making initial enquiries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valero Energy Corp agreed in March to buy the refinery from Chevron but since the deal has not yet closed, a Valero spokesman referred any questions about the incident to Chevron.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The $730 million deal for the refinery and other assets, and $1 billion for the plant's inventories, was expected to close in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron put the refinery up for sale last year to lower its exposure to the refining business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Michael Holden, Matt Falloon, Ikuko Kurahone; Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Chief Executive Jamie Dimon is upbeat on the prospects for the world's largest economy, telling investors Thursday that pessimism is overdone and the economy is actually "getting stronger."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Affirms Goldman Sachs Financial Square Prime Obligations Fund At 
      'AAAmmf'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings affirms the 'AAAmmf' rating assigned to the Goldman Sachs 
      Prime Obligations Fund, a money market fund managed by Goldman Sachs 
      Asset Management, L.P. (GSAM).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The rating affirmation follows Fitch's annual review of the fund. The 
      main drivers of the affirmation are the credit quality, diversification 
      and liquidity of the fund portfolio and the capabilities and resources 
      of GSAM as investment advisor. As of May 29, 2011, the fund had $20.1 
      billion in assets under management.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Goldman Sachs Prime Obligations Fund seeks to maximize current 
      income, to the extent consistent with the preservation of capital and 
      maintenance of liquidity, by investing in high credit quality money 
      market instruments. The fund pursues its investment objective by 
      investing in U.S. government securities, obligations of U.S. banks, 
      commercial paper and other short-term obligations of U.S. companies, 
      states, municipalities and other entities and repurchase agreements. Per 
      its prospectus, the fund does not incur any direct exposure to foreign 
      entities, although such exposures may be incurred indirectly, for 
      example, through investments in asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) 
      conduits sponsored by foreign financial institutions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Consistent with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating criteria, the fund maintains a 
      high credit quality by investing exclusively in securities rated at 
      least 'A/F1' by Fitch or equivalent. The fund limits its exposure to 
      individual repurchase agreement counterparties to 25% of their total 
      assets for those repurchase agreements fully collateralized by U.S. 
      Treasury and government securities. Other types of repurchase agreements 
      entail lower counterparty exposure limits. The fund's Portfolio Credit 
      Factor (PCF) was below 1.50, the level consistent with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' 
      rating criteria. The PCF is a risk weighted measure of the fund's 
      portfolio assets, accounting for the credit quality and maturity profile 
      of the portfolio securities.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      The fund's additional investment restrictions are aimed at maintaining 
      sufficient levels of daily and weekly liquidity to meet investors' 
      redemption requests. Specifically, the fund must invest at least 10% of 
      its total assets in securities maturing overnight of other qualified 
      assets such as U.S. Treasuries and at least 30% of its total assets in 
      securities maturing within seven days or other qualified assets. The 
      fund manages its market risk exposure by limiting its weighted average 
      maturity to reset date (WAMr) and weighted average maturity to final 
      maturity (WAMf) to 60 and 120 days, respectively. All these fund's 
      investment policies are consistent with Fitch's 'AAAmmf' rating 
      criteria. As of the day of the review, the fund fully met its internal 
      WAMr, WAMf and liquidity requirements.

      GSAM is an affiliate of Goldman Sachs Group (rated 'A+/F1+' by Fitch). 
      GSAM manages assets on behalf of institutions and individuals worldwide

      alternative investment products. Fitch views GSAM's investment advisory 
      capabilities, resource commitment, operational controls, corporate 
      governance, and compliance procedures as consistent with the rating 
      assigned to the fund.

      Fitch believes the current rating is very stable. However, the rating 
      may be sensitive to material changes in the credit quality or market 
      risk profile of the fund. A material adverse deviation from Fitch 
      criteria for any key rating driver could cause the rating to be lowered 
      by Fitch. For additional information about Fitch money market fund

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 2 (Reuters) - A fire at a Chevron (CVX.N) oil
refinery at Pembroke in Wales has been put out, the local fire
service said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The fire has been extinguished," a spokesman for the Mid

refinery. The spokesman had no information about any injuries.

reported on Thursday at a Chevron (CVX.N) oil refinery at
Pembroke in Wales, the local fire service said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It was reported as an explosion and a confirmed fire," a
spokeswoman for the Mid and West Wales Fire and Rescue Service

the fire service said firefighters were still battling the
blaze. Chevron had no immediate comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Television pictures showed a pall of black smoke rising from
the sprawling refinery complex. The BBC said witnesses had seen
a fireball and smoke at the refinery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fire spokeswoman said the fire service had sent five
pumps and five specialist trucks to the scene. She had no
further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) said in March it would pay $730
million for Chevron's Pembroke refinery and other assets, and $1
billion for the plant's inventories, giving the U.S. refiner its
first foothold in Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron put the 220,000 barrels-per-day refinery up for sale
last year to lower its exposure to the refining business.

      Application at TA Truck Service and Petro:Lube Locations

			PC-Based System Allows for Quick Vehicle Diagnostics
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      TravelCenters of America LLC (&#8220;TA&#8221;) today announced that it has 
      completed its nationwide rollout of Noregon Systems, Inc.&#8217;s JPRO Fleet 
      Diagnostics, a highly advanced, truck repair diagnostic tool for all 
      makes. The heavy duty diagnostic software is installed on portable 
      computers, which connect to any truck&#8217;s diagnostic port to provide an 
      immediate display of fault codes and key vehicle component information. 
      The new tool will allow for faster diagnosis and resolution of 
      mechanical and related issues and get drivers back up and running.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The JPRO diagnostic tool is the most complete commercial vehicle 
      diagnostic tool on the market and will have a huge positive impact on 
      truck repair services we provide to our customers,&#8221; stated Tom O&#8217;Brien, 
      President and CEO of TA. &#8220;The ability to plug directly into a vehicle&#8217;s 
      nerve center to pinpoint issues is a wildly powerful capability to add 
      to the already broad range of capabilities of our master technicians. 
      Whether it&#8217;s the engine, the transmission, or the tractor or trailer 
      braking system, the JPRO diagnostic tool has the potential to decrease 
      downtime for our customers and get them back on the road faster than 
      ever before.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All of TA and Petro:Lube&#8217;s truck service technicians are trained in 
      troubleshooting and performing diagnostics on heavy duty truck systems, 
      including using the JPRO diagnostic tool. The JPRO tool works with 
      original equipment software to provide an accurate diagnosis of issues 
      in today&#8217;s highly complex vehicles. TA and Petro:Lube are running 
      Noregon&#8217;s JPRO version 5.0 &#8211; with diagnostic abilities for heavy duty 
      vehicles through the 2010 model year, including components manufactured 
      by Allison, Bendix, Caterpillar, Cummins, Detroit Diesel, Daimler 
      Trucks, Eaton Fuller, International/Navistar, Mack, Mercedes Benz, 
      Meritor WABCO, Volvo and ZF Friedrichshafen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Combined, TA and Petro have 220 Truck Service and Petro:Lube locations, 
      with over 2,500 technicians on staff, many of whom are ASE-certified by 
      the National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence. These 
      technicians also provide roadside truck repair services through TA&#8217;s 
      RoadSquad&#174; 24-hour emergency roadside service.

      United Way of the Bay Area and Richmond Community Foundation are pleased 
      to announce that Chevron has contributed $1 million to United Way to 
      help establish the SparkPoint West Contra Costa Center, which opened 
      today in the City of Richmond.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Created by United Way of the Bay Area, SparkPoint Centers are one-stop,

      &#8220;Chevron is proud to support the new SparkPoint West Contra Costa 
      Center, which will help families build futures. We view our support as 
      an investment that can ultimately benefit our entire community,&#8221; said 
      Mike Coyle, general manager of Chevron&#8217;s Richmond Refinery. &#8220;Chevron is 
      committed to strengthening the communities in which our employees live 
      and work. We applaud the Richmond Community Foundation for its efforts 
      to bring this vital program to Contra Costa County, and United Way of 
      the Bay Area for its leadership in establishing SparkPoint Centers.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Richmond Community Foundation is the lead agency for the SparkPoint 
      West Contra Costa Center. The Richmond Community Foundation and the 
      United Way of the Bay Area are working with the center&#8217;s other partner 
      agencies, which collaborate to serve clients, including Anew America, 
      Bay Area Legal Aid, Brighter Beginnings, City of Richmond - LEAP,

      Costa Health Services, Neighborhood Housing Services of the East Bay,

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At today&#8217;s celebration, United Way also announced that with the opening 
      of the Richmond location, the number of SparkPoint Centers serving the 
      Bay Area has now doubled this spring &#8211; from four to eight &#8211; with three 
      centers opening last month. United Way of the Bay Area&#8217;s SparkPoint 
      program now spans six counties, with centers in American Canyon (Napa), 
      Bay Point (Contra Costa), Fairfield (Solano), Oakland (Alameda), 
      Richmond (Contra Costa), San Bruno (San Mateo), San Rafael (Marin) and 
      Vallejo (Solano).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With one in five Bay Area families struggling to make ends meet, 
      Chevron&#8217;s support for expanding SparkPoint into West Contra Costa could 
      not come at a better time,&#8221; said Anne Wilson, CEO of United Way of the 
      Bay Area. &#8220;I want to extend a special thanks to Chevron for its efforts 
      to engage business and community leaders in supporting SparkPoint, which 
      is a key component of United Way&#8217;s efforts to cut poverty in half in the 
      Bay Area by 2020.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      some of its executives serving on the board of directors for several 
      years, championing participation in United Way&#8217;s annual Week of Caring, 
      and providing $1 million to support the 211 helpline.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      &#8220;We are pleased to have been selected as the Lead Agency for SparkPoint 
      West Contra Costa,&#8221; said Joan Davis, President and CEO of the Richmond

      Chevron has been a supporter of, and involved in, many RCF initiatives 
      in the community. The new SparkPoint Center further illustrates that 
      support and involvement and really demonstrates the vision shared by 
      many for the community and the commitment to improving the conditions 
      for families in Richmond for many years to come.

&lt;p&gt;Leading IBM Business Partner Launches Next Generation Offering for Converting
Lotus Notes Applications

NEW YORK, June 2, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GBS Enterprises, Inc. (OTCBB:GBSX),
announced that its subsidiary, GROUP Business Software AG, has unveiled a
combination of expert services and accelerator tools, called Transformer 2.0,
that allows enterprises to transfer large portfolios of Lotus Notes applications
to the Web. The launch event was held was held in conjunction with IBM
(NYSE:IBM) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Museum in
Cambridge MA on the evening of May 25, 2011. The location was significant
because MIT is world renowned for fostering innovation and advancement in
technology and Cambridge was also the birthplace of Lotus.

Speaking at the event were Joerg Ott, CEO and other executives of GBS
Enterprises along with Alistair Rennie, GM, IBM Collaboration Solutions, Kristen
Lauria, VP of Marketing, IBM Collaboration Solutions, and Kevin Cavanaugh, VP
Business &amp; Technical Strategy, IBM Collaboration Solutions. The event also
featured Ryan Chin, Research Specialist at MIT who talked about some of the
newest innovations being developed.

"Helping our customers move to a future with rich capabilities in the cloud is
extremely important to our Notes and Domino community," stated Kristen Lauria,
VP of Marketing, IBM Collaboration Solutions. "It is a game changer. GBS has
provided our customers with a path to transform their Lotus business
applications to the next generation of web and mobile-capable collaborative
applications."

For the first time, organizations have a set of analytical and executable
processes that transform their existing Lotus Notes rich client applications on
to the Web, where they can now be run in the cloud, on mobile devices and be
more easily integrate with social media platforms. Transformer provides the
continuity of the past with all the benefits that are now available in the
latest release of IBM Domino.

This comes at a time when organizations are rapidly embracing new ways to
develop and deliver applications to their users. By 2014, 40% of all new
business applications will be delivered via subscription or self-service via
cloud technology. With over 10 million active Lotus Notes applications
worldwide, it is no surprise there is increasing pressure on organizations to
web-enable these applications. The challenge is doing so without having to
invest in time and resource intensive re-development projects, risky data
migration and costly retraining of staff.

GBS points to the very high demand for these conversions as proof companies want
to migrate and have not been able to figure out how. "Every day we see companies
wanting to move their applications to take advantage of the web, but they have
been unable to justify the high financial cost," says Joerg Ott, CEO of GBS.
"Transformer provides a turnkey solution combining platform expertise with
technology, allowing clients to preserve their existing investments in
intellectual capital."

For nearly 20 years, GBS has been singularly focused on delivering compelling
business solutions and innovation to the Lotus market.   Building on this
expertise GBS has developed a comprehensive set of tools and services to plan
and execute an orderly and fast migration. "Trying to migrate these applications
to a totally different technology like Sharepoint or Google Apps, is disruptive
and requires huge amounts of money and time," says Scott Hooks, GM of GBS
Experts division. "To be effective, you must have the expertise to know what to
do and the technology to do it."

Recent enhancements provided in Transformer 2.0 are:

  --  Transformer Investigator -- collects statistics on which applications
      are being used, how often and by whom so that an organization can target
      which applications have the highest impact to transform.
  --  Transformer Extension Library - allows a variety of enhancements to be
      applied to all aspects of transformed applications without writing any
      additional code.
  --  GBS WebSpace -- is a web enabled version of the familiar Notes client
      Workspace.
  --  Support of Object Oriented Programming.
  --  Ability to maintain application business logic in LotusScript.

&lt;p&gt;DAR ES SALAAM (Reuters) - International Business Machines said on Thursday it expects Africa to be a strong growth area for the information technology business over the next five years, thanks to growth in banking and telecoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM, which signed a deal in September to manage Bharti Airtel's IT operations in 16 African countries, has embarked on an expansion program across the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Industry analysts are predicting a 10 percent growth year-on-year in IT over the next two to five years across Africa ... In east Africa, it's even probably higher than that," Tony Mwai, country general manager for IBM East Africa told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is a very intense focus on Africa. There are growth opportunities in the banking sector, public sector and telecommunications."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM opened a subsidiary office in Tanzania this week, its 20th outlet in Africa as it continues to increase its footprint on the continent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are seeing growth in the financial services sector, certainly in telecommunications because of the explosion of mobile technology and we are seeing growth in the public sector as governments transform to e-government type of operations and delivery of services to citizens," Mwai said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Tanzania, IBM has signed a deal with the country's biggest commercial bank, National Microfinance Bank (NMB), to provide technology services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The banking sector in Tanzania has seen a complete transformation over the last five years. This transformation has been driven mainly by technology," said John Ncube, NMB's chief information officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Fumbuka Ng'wanakilala; Editing by David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 2 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N)
received a subpoena from New York prosecutors seeking
information on the investment bank's role leading into the
global financial crisis, a person familiar with the matter
said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The subpoena from the Manhattan District Attorney's office
is based on information contained in a U.S. Senate subcommittee
investigation into Wall Street's role in the housing market
collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Manhattan District Attorney's office was not
immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We don't comment on specific regulatory or legal issues,
but subpoenas are a normal part of the information request
process and, of course, when we receive them we cooperate
fully," Goldman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman's shares were down 2 percent in a broadly flat
market.

			Pfizer and Hisun Sign MOU to Increase Access to Quality and Low-Cost 
      Medicines for Patients in China
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Zhejiang Hisun Pharmaceuticals (SSE stock 
      code 600267), a leading pharmaceutical company in China, today jointly 
      announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on their 
      intention to establish a joint venture. This potential partnership would 
      aim to strengthen the ability of both companies to reach more patients 
      with high-quality and low-cost medicines in the branded generics arena.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the MOU, the two companies will explore a potential business 
      collaboration focused on manufacturing cooperation to deliver 
      high-quality medicines, broader commercialization of medicines through a 
      local and global sales and marketing infrastructure and research and 
      development of off-patent medicines. Both parties could contribute 
      select existing products and other relevant assets and capabilities to 
      provide a solid platform for this potential joint venture.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Today&#8217;s announcement demonstrates Pfizer&#8217;s commitment to China&#8217;s 
      ongoing healthcare reforms,&#8221; said David Simmons, President and General 
      Manager, Emerging Markets and Established Products of Pfizer Inc.
			&#8220;The 
      potential joint venture would be an important milestone for Pfizer&#8217;s 
      efforts to broaden the reach of its world-class healthcare solutions in 
      China, and would also help support Chinese industry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Collaborating with the world&#8217;s leading pharmaceutical companies to form 
      potential joint ventures is a strategy being adopted by Hisun,&#8221; stated 
      Hua Bai, CEO and President of Hisun Pharmaceuticals. &#8220;With the 
      combination of Hisun&#8217;s strategic vision and Pfizer&#8217;s global resources, 
      we can better perform our roles and obligations to support the 
      development of China&#8217;s pharmaceutical industry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Off-patent medicines, including branded generics, represent one of the 
      fastest growth segments in the global pharmaceutical market. This is 
      especially true in emerging markets, where costs and access are primary 
      drivers of off-patent medicine growth. In China, branded generics 
      account for 60% of the domestic market. With a population exceeding 1.3 
      billion and rapidly increasing urbanization rates, the nation is 
      expected to become the world&#8217;s second-largest pharmaceutical market by 
      2015. Providing high-quality, accessible and affordable health care to 
      people of all walks of life has become a primary objective of Chinese 
      healthcare reforms.

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI/PALOS VERDES, California (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp showed off a version of its next operating system at technology conferences in the United States and Taipei, as some PC makers grumbled over restrictions on their involvement in the development of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is expected to launch the new system, code-named Windows 8 and highlighting touchscreen features optimized for tablet computers, in the next 18 months, as it races to catch up with Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft has told chipmakers who want to use the system for tablets to work with only one manufacturer to speed up the delivery, Bloomberg and Dow Jones news reported, sparking worries among some PC vendors that they will be left out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In demonstrations at the D9 conference in Palos Verdes, California, and the Computex show in Taipei, Microsoft executives showed a starting page that resembles Microsoft's latest phone software, with live 'tiles' manipulated by pressing and swiping the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demonstration shows Microsoft is making progress toward the new operating system, which it promises will run on a range of hardware devices from traditional PCs to laptops and tablets, using both touchscreen and mouse and keyboard commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said in Palos Verdes that it was "not out of the game" in tablets, a view backed by some in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that it's a year or two years after the iPad doesn't really matter. There is already a lot of built-in infrastructure," Adrian Crisan, Sony's director of engineering for VAIO and Mobile of America, told reporters in Taipei on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today Apple is first on one thing and Microsoft is first for another and, overall, it's going to be a race and whatever customers will like, they will buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately on Thursday, U.S. chip maker Qualcomm Inc said it would collaborate with Microsoft on the next version of Windows for its Snapdragon family of processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC VENDORS UNHAPPY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Taiwanese vendors are concerned that the reported restrictions mean they would have to be chosen by chipmakers to make tablet PCs for the new Windows operating system. Previously PC vendors could choose their own partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By missing those chances, is it good for the whole industry together? This industry doesn't belong to Microsoft or Google, it belongs to all the participants," Jim Wong, president of world No.2 PC vendor Acer Inc told a news conference in Taipei on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So they can't make the decision for all of us. That's the problem," Wong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony's Crisan declined to comment on the reported restrictions, but said Windows 8 would probably eventually be opened to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Steven Sinofsky, the head of Microsoft's Windows unit, said the new system did not yet have a name and did not say when it would be available. He promised more details at a developers' conference in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release date is a "Defense Department secret," joked Sinofsky, adding that it would not be this autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft typically aims for 24 to 36 months between major Windows versions, suggesting a launch date for the next Windows between October 2011 and October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky said Microsoft is working to integrate Internet telephone service Skype into the new system, following its agreement to purchase the company last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had shown a crude version of the new Windows system working on ARM Holdings chips -- which work better on mobile devices due to their low power requirements -- at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That signaled a change in emphasis for Microsoft toward mobile devices, although the new Windows will still run on chips made by traditional partner Intel Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sarah McBride and Bill Rigby in Palos Verdes, and Lee Chyen Yee and Clare Jim in Taipei; editing by Jonathan Standing and Vinu Pilakkot)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Natural gas drillers are doing too little to inform the public about the chemicals used in hydraulic fracturing, a practice essential for tapping the United States' shale gas reserves, a Chevron executive told a federal panel on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Advances in hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, have led to a boom in shale gas drilling, but the expansion of shale gas development has led to concerns about potential water contamination.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While companies have begun releasing some details about the chemicals they use when drilling wells, firms have raised concerns about possibly revealing trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Luquette, president of North America exploration and production for Chevron, said it was time for industry to stop dragging its feet on disclosure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have used this 'intellectual property' issue as a convenient excuse to move slow," Luquette told a federal panel set up by the Obama administration to offer recommendations on improving the safety of hydraulic fracturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I personally believe there is space in the middle between protecting the IP and giving the public the information they desire," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Landowners near shale gas developments have blamed fracking, which involves injecting water, sand and chemicals into rock formations to obtain oil and gas, for fouling water supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aubrey McClendon, chief executive of Chesapeake Energy Corp, disputed the notion that companies had been slow to reveal information about their fracking fluids.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think we're going very, very quickly," he said, pointing out that Chesapeake had begun releasing details about the wells it drills on a central website, fracfocus.org.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A blowout at a Chesapeake Energy natural gas well spewed thousands of gallons of fracking fluids in northeastern Pennsylvania in late April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EVERYTHING'S LOCAL?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At its first public meeting, the federal natural gas panel also weighed the need for a new industry group focused on developing best practices for shale gas drillers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry representatives at the meeting stressed that any standards developed for natural gas drilling should be implemented by state regulators to address local needs and be responsive to rapidly changing techniques.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Environmental groups at the meeting said fracking, which is mostly exempt from U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversight, should be regulated at the federal level.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But drillers argue that fracking is safe, and that onerous federal regulations would hurt natural gas output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The panel, which includes Daniel Yergin, chairman of IHS Cambridge Energy Research Associates, is slated to report what immediate steps are needed to improve public and environmental safety of fracking within 90 days of beginning its work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within six months it will also develop advice for the government on practices for shale extraction to ensure public health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Green groups complained that the composition of the panel seemed biased toward industry interests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Obama administration says it's concerned about ethics and lack of conflicts of interest, but now we're spending ... taxpayer dollars to create an industry-dominated panel," said Dusty Horwitt, of the Environmental Working Group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horwitt said six out of seven panel members had financial ties to the oil and gas industry and he called for the panel's chair John Deutch to step down. Deutch, a professor at MIT, has served on the board of directors for Schlumberger Ltd, a top oil services company involved in fracking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Dale Hudson)&lt;/p&gt;

      Disney Store today announced the launch of its new fragrance collection, 
      a captivating array of scents and associated products, each inspired by 
      some of Disney&#8217;s most timeless and beloved characters and stories. The 
      premium personal fragrances, home scents, candles and unique gifts were 
      created in conjunction with some of the world&#8217;s leading fragrance 
      houses, perfumers and an award-winning design team.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The power of fragrance is truly magical - it can evoke memories and 
      convey dreams and aspirations. Disney&#8217;s rich heritage and most beloved 
      characters also have that same allure,&#8221; says Jim Fielding, President of 
      Disney Stores Worldwide. &#8220;With the launch of Disney Store&#8217;s own 
      fragrance collection, we&#8217;re touching all of the senses for the first 
      time in a uniquely Disney way.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first fragrance in the collection will be available in Disney Store 
      locations nationwide beginning from June 2011 with other fragrances 
      introduced throughout the rest of 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Discover a new world of&#8230;..Imagination
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Imagination, the signature fragrance used throughout the newly 
      designed Disney Store, is described as an enchanted forest of sequoia 
      trees, cool moss and green leaves. Inspired by the trees that line the 
      route of the magical path within the new stores, the fragrance gives the 
      sense of being in an enchanted forest. It&#8217;s a timeless scent inspired by 
      nature that instills a feeling of natural calm, allowing the imagination 
      to soar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Imagination products are available as home fragrances, including 
      candles and room scents, in Disney Store locations nationwide in June 
      2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Discover a new world of&#8230;..Magic
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Magic, an unforgettable blend of icy blue mint, rich chocolate 
      and invigorating sea spray, epitomizes the adventure of Disney and all 
      that is Mickey Mouse. Along with Imagination, its inspiration 
      comes from the outside world to give it a refreshing sense of nature. Magic 
      is the freedom of children playing outdoors; it&#8217;s a breeze of fresh, 
      cool, minty air, green grass, clean woods and a surprise of chocolate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Magic home fragrances, candles and room scents
			will launch 
      in stores in July 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Discover a new world&#8230;&#8230;Pixie Dust
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pixie Dust, a shimmering scent of citrus sorbet, candied fruits 
      and summer rain, is the fragrance inspired by Tinker Bell. It&#8217;s the 
      fragrance one could imagine floating through the air as Tinker Bell 
      showers the earth with her Pixie Dust, causing nature to blossom. Pixie 
      Dust captures Tinker Bell&#8217;s personality perfectly &#8211; it charms with a 
      shimmering sweetness yet it also has a subtle hint of sassiness that we 
      love about this beloved Disney character.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pixie Dust comes as a range of personal products including Eau de 
      Toilette, Body Mist and Body Lotion, available in all Disney Store 
      locations in fall 2011. Gift sets with body glitter, a roll on Eau de 
      Toilette and lip gloss will also be available.

      Knowledge Webinar
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global 
      Knowledge, worldwide leader in IT and business skills 
      training, will host a free, live webinar entitled &#8220;Are 
      You Ready for Office 365?&#8221; at 12 p.m. EST on Wednesday, 
      June 8, 2011. In the hour-long webinar, Brett Hill, Office 365 MVP, will 
      discuss how best to prepare your organization for Microsoft Office 365, 
      Microsoft's next-generation cloud services offering.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Webinar attendees will learn about cloud services and how using 
      cloud services differs from using on-premise services. They will learn 
      about the components of Microsoft Office 365 and how Office 365 compares 
      to Microsoft Business Productivity Online Suite. Attendees will take a 
      look at basic Office 365 setup and administration, and discover some key 
      differences in Office 365 plans. They will gain insight into their 
      organization's readiness to move to Office 365, and which resources 
      offer the best and most updated information about Office 365.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;Office 365 is commanding the attention of businesses worldwide, 
      and while it&#8217;s certainly worthy of the attention, moving to cloud 
      services is not like performing an in-place upgrade of an on-premise 
      server,&#8221; explained Hill. &#8220;Microsoft has released a lot of information 
      about the Office 365 services, but it can be challenging to distill that 
      information into a proposal or plan of action. This webinar will help.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;TAIPEI/PALOS VERDES, California (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) showed off a version of its next operating system at technology conferences in the United States and Taipei, as some PC makers grumbled over restrictions on their involvement in the development of the system.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is expected to launch the new system, code-named Windows 8 and highlighting touchscreen features optimized for tablet computers, in the next 18 months, as it races to catch up with Apple Inc (AAPL.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft has told chipmakers who want to use the system for tablets to work with only one manufacturer to speed up the delivery, Bloomberg and Dow Jones news reported, sparking worries among some PC vendors that they will be left out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In demonstrations at the D9 conference in Palos Verdes, California, and the Computex show in Taipei, Microsoft executives showed a starting page that resembles Microsoft's latest phone software, with live 'tiles' manipulated by pressing and swiping the screen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The demonstration shows Microsoft is making progress toward the new operating system, which it promises will run on a range of hardware devices from traditional PCs to laptops and tablets, using both touchscreen and mouse and keyboard commands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said in Palos Verdes that it was "not out of the game" in tablets, a view backed by some in the industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The fact that it's a year or two years after the iPad doesn't really matter. There is already a lot of built-in infrastructure," Adrian Crisan, Sony's director of engineering for VAIO and Mobile of America, told reporters in Taipei on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today Apple is first on one thing and Microsoft is first for another and, overall, it's going to be a race and whatever customers will like, they will buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Separately on Thursday, U.S. chip maker Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) said it would collaborate with Microsoft on the next version of Windows for its Snapdragon family of processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PC VENDORS UNHAPPY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Taiwanese vendors are concerned that the reported restrictions mean they would have to be chosen by chipmakers to make tablet PCs for the new Windows operating system. Previously PC vendors could choose their own partners.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By missing those chances, is it good for the whole industry together? This industry doesn't belong to Microsoft or Google (GOOG.O), it belongs to all the participants," Jim Wong, president of world No.2 PC vendor Acer Inc (2353.TW) told a news conference in Taipei on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"So they can't make the decision for all of us. That's the problem," Wong said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sony's Crisan declined to comment on the reported restrictions, but said Windows 8 would probably eventually be opened to everyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, Steven Sinofsky, the head of Microsoft's Windows unit, said the new system did not yet have a name and did not say when it would be available. He promised more details at a developers' conference in September.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The release date is a "Defense Department secret", joked Sinofsky, adding that it would not be this autumn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft typically aims for 24 to 36 months between major Windows versions, suggesting a launch date for the next Windows between October 2011 and October 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sinofsky said Microsoft is working to integrate Internet telephone service Skype into the new system, following its agreement to purchase the company last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He had shown a crude version of the new Windows system working on ARM Holdings (ARM.L) chips -- which work better on mobile devices due to their low power requirements -- at the Consumer Electronics Show in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That signaled a change in emphasis for Microsoft toward mobile devices, although the new Windows will still run on chips made by traditional partner Intel Corp (INTC.O).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sarah McBride and Bill Rigby in Palos Verdes, and Lee Chyen Yee and Clare Jim in Taipei; editing by Jonathan Standing and Vinu Pilakkot)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds comments, changes dateline)	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Windows 8 is code name for new system&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * No date for release, expected before Oct 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Demo shows features optimized for tablets&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Qualcomm supports Windows 8&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * PC firms grumble over Microsoft restrictions
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TAIPEI/PALOS VERDES, Calif., June 2 (Reuters) - Microsoft
Corp showed off a version of its next operating system
at technology conferences in the United States and Taipei, as
some PC makers grumbled over restrictions on their involvement
in the development of the system.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company is expected to launch
the new system, code-named Windows 8 and highlighting
touchscreen features optimized for tablet computers, in the next
18 months, as it races to catch up with Apple Inc .	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Microsoft has told chipmakers who want to use the system
for tablets to work with only one manufacturer to speed up the
delivery, Bloomberg and Dow Jones news reported, sparking
worries among some PC vendors that they will be left out.
[ID:nL3E7H10QR]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In demonstrations at the D9 conference in Palos Verdes,
California, and the Computex show in Taipei, Microsoft
executives showed a starting page that resembles Microsoft's
latest phone software, with live 'tiles' manipulated by pressing
and swiping the screen.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The demonstration shows Microsoft is making progress toward
the new operating system, which it promises will run on a range
of hardware devices from traditional PCs to laptops and tablets,
using both touchscreen and mouse and keyboard commands.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said in Palos Verdes that it was "not out of the
game" in tablets, a view backed by some in the industry.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The fact that it's a year or two years after the iPad
doesn't really matter. There is already a lot of built-in
infrastructure," Adrian Crisan, Sony's director of engineering
for VAIO and Mobile of America, told reporters in Taipei on
Thursday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today Apple is first on one thing and Microsoft is first
for another and, overall, it's going to be a race and whatever
customers will like, they will buy."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately on Thursday, U.S. chip maker Qualcomm Inc
 said it would collaborate with Microsoft on the next
version of Windows for its Snapdragon family of processors.
[ID:nWNAB2596]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 	
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PC VENDORS UNHAPPY	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some Taiwanese vendors are concerned that the reported
restrictions mean they would have to be chosen by chipmakers to
make tablet PCs for the new Windows operating system. Previously
PC vendors could choose their own partners.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "By missing those chances, is it good for the whole industry
together? This industry doesn't belong to Microsoft or Google
 , it belongs to all the participants," Jim Wong,
president of world No.2 PC vendor Acer Inc told a news
conference in Taipei on Wednesday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "So they can't make the decision for all of us. That's the
problem," Wong said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sony's Crisan declined to comment on the reported
restrictions, but said Windows 8 would probably eventually be
opened to everyone.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Wednesday, Steven Sinofsky, the head of Microsoft's
Windows unit, said the new system did not yet have a name and
did not say when it would be available. He promised more details
at a developers' conference in September.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The release date is a "Defense Department secret", joked
Sinofsky, adding that it would not be this autumn.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft typically aims for 24 to 36 months between major
Windows versions, suggesting a launch date for the next Windows

&lt;p&gt;Resolutions addressing hydraulic fracturing won substantial shareowner support at the annual meetings of major oil and gas companies last week. The resolutions, which call for increased transparency and risk management in an increasingly widespread drilling practice that has raised serious environmental concerns, gained 41 percent of the votes of shareowners at Chevron and 28 percent at ExxonMobil.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The results of a vote on the practice at Ultra Petroleum, where a similar resolution won 10 percent of shareowner votes last year, has not yet been released by the company. This year, the resolution at Ultra was supported by Glass Lewis, a major proxy advisory service.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, requires the injection of as much as 7.5 million gallons of water per well, as well as often toxic chemicals, to crack open rock and allow natural gas to flow to the surface. According to a press release issued after the votes by As You Sow, a co-filer of the resolutions at the three companies, Thousands of documents obtained from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have revealed that the threats of fracking to the environment and public health are greater than anticipated. The two critical issues -- toxic chemicals used in fracking fluid and the disposal of wastewater -- have the most potential to limit expansion of this practice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the environmental and health risks, the American Petroleum Institute (API), an industry trade group, has estimated that as much as 80 percent of natural gas wells drilled in the next decade will require hydraulic fracturing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shareholders are concerned that these potential environmental and health impacts will result in regulatory, legal, financial, and reputational risks to the companies and want to know how the companies intend to mitigate the risks associated with fracking, the release continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following the annual meeting of ExxonMobil, CEO Rex Tillerson addressed the proposal, which had been co-filed by As You Sow and the Unitarian Universalist Service Committee, telling reporters, We know there are risks. We're not trying to characterize this as an activity that does not have risks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Tillerson continued, We think there have been a lot of pretty casual statements about risks that are simply not backed up by facts. The early detractors slap a label on something, and then it takes us a long time to get it peeled off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Tillerson did not describe who those detractors might be, EPA announced in 2010 that it would conduct a new scientific study of the effects of hydraulic fracturing, and sent letters to nine natural gas service companies, seeking information on the chemical composition of fluids used in the hydraulic fracturing process, data on the impacts of the chemicals on human health and the environment, standard operating procedures at their hydraulic fracturing sites and the locations of sites where fracturing has been conducted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At Chevron, where the resolution was co-filed by As You Sow and members of the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility (ICCR), the shareowner vote was an exceptionally high level of support for a first-year resolution, Michael Passoff of As You Sow said. The fact that 41 percent of Chevron investors voted in favor of more disclosure shows how seriously the company's shareholders are taking this issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Larisa Ruoff of Green Century Capital Management, co-filer of the resolution at Ultra Petroleum, the company declined to announce the results of the vote and, for the second year, refused shareholders their right to speak on behalf of the resolution.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This article originally appeared on SocialFunds.com, and is reprinted with permission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo CC-licensed by NotAnAlternative.&lt;/p&gt;

(GS.N) disclosed estimates of potential losses from legal
issues after pressure from U.S. Securities and Exchange
Commission staff, according to documents released on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a letter to Goldman on Feb. 22, Stephanie Hunsaker, the
senior assistant chief accountant in the SEC's division of
corporate finance, questioned an assertion by Goldman
management that the bank was unable to come up with solid loss
estimates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hunsaker said the assertion by Chief Financial Officer
David Viniar "appears unusual" and requested that Goldman
revise its financial statement to provide loss estimates and
additional disclosures about legal matters, or an explanation
for why it could not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC has been pushing banks to provide more disclosures
about their legal liabilities, which has become a major
investor concern.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, Goldman spent $700 million on lawyers hired to
defend the bank in various lawsuits and also spent $550 million
to settle civil fraud charges with the SEC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to civil suits filed by private parties,
Goldman also faces probes from the SEC, the Commodities Futures
Trading Commission, the Justice Department, the New York
Attorney General and the Manhattan District Attorney's office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman responded to the SEC's request that it disclose
more information by estimating its "reasonably possible losses"
for legal matters to be approximately $3.4 billion in its
annual report for 2010 filed on March 1. That figure was
adjusted to $2.7 billion in Goldman's first-quarter report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The SEC also asked Goldman for more information about its
impairment of intangible assets for its designated market maker
rights, growth rates for components of its equities business,
its decision to separate principal lending and investing
activities and its potential costs for repurchasing residential
mortgage-backed securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other large banks, including Bank of America Corp (BAC.N),
Citigroup Inc  (C.N), Wells Fargo  Co  (WFC.N), JPMorgan Chase
 Co  (JPM.N) and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), have also disclosed
more information in recent quarters related to legal costs and
mortgage repurchases.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Safety experts Friday launched an investigation into an explosion that killed four people and seriously injured a fifth worker at a Chevron Corp oil refinery in southwest Wales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Britain's Health and Safety Executive (HSE) said it was launching a joint probe with police while Chevron started an investigation whose results it said were unlikely to be made public.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have immediately launched our own investigation which will run in tandem with the HSE's own investigation," a Chevron spokeswoman said in a statement read out at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One storage tank is out of action and another is damaged but other than that the plant remains fully operational. However, given the circumstances, non-essential work has been suspended today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns over refining safety have reverberated through the U.S. oil industry since an explosion at a BP refinery in Texas City in 2005, after which BP released an internal probe which said safety shortcomings were common across the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron said it did not anticipate the blast would have an impact on the planned $730 million sale of the facility to U.S. independent refiner Valero, but Valero said it was too early to tell if the sale would be impacted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares shrugged off the disaster, trading down 0.4 percent at 1415 GMT, in line with rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blast occurred at the 220,000 barrel per day Pembroke refinery Thursday night. Police said a fire broke out after an explosion in a storage tank during maintenance. An adjacent storage tank was also damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tank maintenance is a regular occurrence and this was planned work involving members of our contractor workforce, routine work which had been carried out before," the Chevron spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The tank contained a component which refiners routinely use in the refining process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the HSE, the Pembroke plant had received one formal warning notice over safety in recent years and had rectified the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In contrast, the Coryton refinery in southeast England had been cited four times over safety before BP sold it to Swiss-based Petroplus Holdings AG and three notices were given to Exxon Mobil Corp's Fawley refinery in southern England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO DISRUPTION TO SUPPLIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pembroke refinery is one of eight in the UK and accounts for about 12 percent of total capacity. Any closure of the plant would be unlikely to cause major disruption in Europe where supply already exceeds demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems the incident was in a non-core part of the refinery since it's still running. There's no reason why it should disrupt supplies anywhere in Europe. There's overcapacity in the downstream sector anyway," said Robert Beaman, oil analyst at Business Monitor International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But traders said it could boost prices and trim available exports of gasoline to the United States during the peak summer driving season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of the refinery's output is gasoline. The bulk of fuels are loaded from the refinery's port, with only around 10 percent distributed by road and pipe to the UK inland market, according to the UK Petroleum Industry Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Emma Farge; editing by Keith Weir and David Cowell)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - U.S.-based Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on Friday it had launched an inquiry into an explosion at its oil refinery in southwest Wales which killed four people and seriously injured one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Concerns over refining safety have reverberated through the U.S. oil industry since an explosion at a BP refinery in Texas City in 2005, after which BP said safety shortcomings were common across the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have immediately launched our own investigation which will run in tandem with the HSE's (Britain's Health and Safety Executive regulator) own investigation," a Chevron spokeswoman said in a statement read out at the plant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One storage tank is out of action and another is damaged but other than that the plant remains fully operational. However, given the circumstances, non-essential work has been suspended today."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The blast occurred at the 220,000 barrel per day Pembroke refinery on Thursday evening. Police said a fire had broken out after an explosion in a storage tank during maintenance. An adjacent storage tank was also damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Tank maintenance is a regular occurrence and this was planned work involving members of our contractor workforce, routine work which had been carried out before.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The tank contained a component which refiners routinely use in the refining process," the Chevron spokeswoman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the HSE's enforcement database, the Pembroke plant had received one enforcement notice in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This criticized the plant for "failure to demonstrate the company had identified safety instrumented systems," though the HSE noted the enforcement notice had been complied with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, four enforcement notices were issued to the Coryton refinery in southeast England, which was owned by BP before being sold to Swiss-based Petroplus Holdings AG PPHN.VX, and three notices were given to Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) Fawley refinery in southern England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NO DISRUPTION TO SUPPLIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pembroke refinery is one of eight operating refineries in the UK and accounts for about 12 percent of total online capacity. However, any closure of the plant would be unlikely to cause major disruption to supplies Europe where supply already exceeds demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It seems the incident was in a non-core part of the refinery since it's still running. There's no reason why it should disrupt supplies anywhere in Europe. There's overcapacity in the downstream sector anyway," said Robert Beaman, oil analyst at Business Monitor International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But traders said it could boost prices and trim available exports of gasoline to the United States during the peak summer driving season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearly half of the refinery's output is gasoline. The bulk of fuels are loaded from the refinery's port, with only around 10 percent distributed by road and pipe to the UK inland market, according to the UK Petroleum Industry Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Olesya Dmitracova, Tom Bergin and Emma Farge; editing by Keith Weir)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Four people were killed and one was seriously injured in an explosion at an oil refinery in southwest Wales, the plant's owner Chevron Corp said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The blast occurred at the 220,000 barrel per day Pembroke refinery on Thursday evening. A Chevron spokeswoman said the refinery remained fully operational on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Police said a fire had broken out after an explosion in a storage tank during maintenance. An adjacent storage tank was also damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was in the back garden and I just heard a large explosion, looked around and I could see a fireball rising up into the sky," local resident Phil Horne told the BBC, adding that smoke billowed out for between 30 and 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The fire service said it sent 10 emergency vehicles to the scene and the ambulance service said it responded with three ambulances and an air ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will take every step possible to determine the series of events that led to this tragic incident," U.S.-based Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milford Haven, a nearby port which is home to two large liquefied natural gas terminals, said its shipping operations had not been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron put the refinery up for sale last year to lower its exposure to the refining business, echoing similar moves by rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc and BP Plc. Falling oil demand in Europe has made it the least attractive location for refinery investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp agreed in March to buy the refinery and other assets in a $730 million deal expected to close in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Valero was not available for comment on whether it would go ahead with the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAFETY PROBE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Britain's Health  Safety Executive (HSE) regulator said it would be on site on Friday to begin an investigation in which the Environment Agency would also participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Concerns over refining safety have reverberated through the U.S. oil industry since an explosion at a BP refinery in Texas City in 2005, after which BP said safety shortcomings were common across the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to a HSE's enforcement database, the Pembroke plant had received one enforcement notice in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This criticized the plant for "failure to demonstrate the company had identified safety instrumented systems," though the HSE noted the enforcement notice had been complied with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By comparison, four enforcement notices were issued to the Coryton refinery in southeast England, which was owned by BP before being sold to Swiss-based Petroplus Holdings AG, and three notices were given to Exxon Mobil Corp's Fawley refinery in southern England.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Olesya Dmitracova, Simon Webb and Karolina Tagaris; Editing by David Holmes, Greg Mahlich and Erica Billingham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Plant's safety record no worse than peers-HSE&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Plant due to be sold to Valero Energy&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds comment from port authorities)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Tom Bergin and Adrian Croft&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, June 3 (Reuters) - Four people were killed and one
was seriously injured in an explosion at an oil refinery in
southwest Wales, the plant's owner Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on
Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The blast occurred at the 220,000 barrel per day Pembroke
refinery on Thursday evening. A Chevron spokeswoman said the
refinery remained fully operational on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Police said a fire had broken out after an explosion in a
storage tank during maintenance. An adjacent storage tank was
also damaged.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I was in the back garden and I just heard a large
explosion, looked around and I could see a fireball rising up
into the sky," local resident Phil Horne told the BBC, adding
that smoke billowed out for between 30 and 45 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fire service said it sent 10 emergency vehicles to the
scene and the ambulance service said it responded with three
ambulances and an air ambulance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We will take every step possible to determine the series of
events that led to this tragic incident," U.S.-based Chevron
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Milford Haven, a nearby port which is home to two large
liquefied natural gas terminals, said its shipping operations
had not been affected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron put the refinery up for sale last year to lower its
exposure to the refining business, echoing similar moves by
rivals such as Royal Dutch Shell Plc (RDSa.L) and BP Plc (BP.L).
Falling oil demand in Europe has made it the least attractive
location for refinery investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. refiner Valero Energy Corp (VLO.N) agreed in March to
buy the refinery and other assets in a $730 million deal
expected to close in the third quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valero was not available for comment on whether it would go
ahead with the purchase.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SAFETY PROBE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Britain's Health  Safety Executive (HSE) regulator said it
would be on site on Friday to begin an investigation in which
the Environment Agency would also participate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Concerns over refining safety have reverberated through the
U.S. oil industry since an explosion at a BP refinery in Texas
City in 2005, after which BP said safety shortcomings were
common across the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to a HSE's enforcement database, the Pembroke
plant had received one enforcement notice in recent years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This criticised the plant for "failure to demonstrate the
company had identified safety instrumented systems", though the
HSE noted the enforcement notice had been complied with.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By comparison, four enforcement notices were issued to the
Coryton refinery in southeast England, which was owned by BP
before being sold to Swiss-based Petroplus Holdings AG
PPHN.VX, and three notices were given to Exxon Mobil Corp's
(XOM.N) Fawley refinery in southern England. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Olesya Dmitracova, Simon Webb and

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 5 (Reuters) - Two JPMorgan Chase  Co 
executives in the bank's 15-member operating committee are
expected to step down in the coming months from their roles, the
Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Commercial banking chief Todd Maclin is expected step down
from the job by year-end, but could take on another role that
keeps him in the operating committee of the second-largest U.S.
bank, the paper reported.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Heidi Miller, who is a longtime ally of Chief Executive
Jamie Dimon and oversees the bank's international business,
would likely retire in 2012, the paper reported, citing unnamed
sources.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dimon has indicated he might stay as CEO for five more
years, the paper said, but last year announced that his board is
looking for a successor.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The next chief could be chosen from a group of JPMorgan
executives in their forties, the paper reported.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These executives include Michael Cavanagh, who is in charge
of the bank's treasury unit; Mary Erdoes, head of asset
management; Charles Scharf, head of retail banking; and
investment-bank executives Matt Zames and Daniel Pinto.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Financial Officer Douglas Braunstein could also be a
candidate, the paper said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miller was also seen as a potential candidate to succeed
Dimon. Another potential candidate is Jes Staley, the chief of
the investment bank.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the paper reported that Staley is considered a long shot
by some insiders because he is only a year younger than Dimon.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment on Sunday.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - In her continuing drama with the producers of "The X Factor," it appears that ousted judge Cheryl Cole may yet be headed back to the United States.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The British pop singer -- who was dropped from the U.S. version of the show after four days for reasons that remain unclear -- was willing to return to the U.K. version of the show, as its producers had wished.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But TMZ reports that she was owed $1.5 million in her contract for the U.S. season regardless of whether she appeared on the show, and she wanted to be paid the agreed-upon amount as well as a separate fee for performing in the British show. An industry source told The Hollywood Reporter that producer Fremantle bristled at this point and the two sides are in a stand off.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To avoid breaching her contract for the U.S. show, Cole will have to seek a nonimmigrant work visa in the days ahead, return to the U.S. and turn up for "X Factor" tapings. Whether she will have a role in the show is unclear; certainly it's possible that the two sides will reach some sort of agreement returning her to a role in the U.S. show to end an embarrassing public dispute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cole has not yet applied for a visa due to paparazzi hounding her, according to a source in her camp, but intends to do so. The show's next auditions in New Jersey are scheduled for June 9 at the Prudential Center in Newark, N.J.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cole will be lucky to make it. The waiting time for a visa appointment at the U.S. embassy in London is typically seven days, and it takes an additional five days to process the application, according to the embassy's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fremantle and Fox, which will air the show in September, declined to comment. A source close to Cole says "nothing would make her happier" than to collect the payout she's due. Cole and series creator Simon Cowell's representatives also declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(To read more about our entertainment news, visit our blog "Fan Fare" online at blogs.reuters.com/fanfare/)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SMITH LAKE, AL, Jun 05 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
At a real estate auction on Smith Lake today, J. P. King Auction Company
sold four condos and four lots -- all waterfront -- for $1.19 million.
With forty registered bidders from five states, attending from as far
away as Texas and Michigan, seller Marty Roberson sold all the offered
units at Waterford Condos. 

    Over 100 people attended the auction event at the Windemere Lots in
Bremen, where four lots sold for as high as $74,800. The three-bedroom,
two-bath condos were the final available units at Waterford and sold for
prices ranging from $225,500 to $247,500. 

    "The condos were very well received, which was evidenced by strong
bidding," said Craig King, president and CEO of J. P. King Auction
Company. "Both the lots and the condo units came with great amenities
like a boat slip and pool access. Marty has created a beautiful
atmosphere and community on both locations."

    J. P. King Auction Company specializes in high-value properties and
portfolios such as luxury homes, developments, condominiums, land and
ranches. The company has marketed properties in all 50 states and six
countries. Upcoming sales include two luxury homes in Montana, a
three-day, bank-ordered sale in Florida and a ski resort in Colorado.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) shareholder sued Rajat Gupta, a former director of the investment bank, over trades revealed in civil and criminal insider trading cases against Gupta and convicted Galleon hedge fund founder Raj Rajaratnam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The lawsuit, filed in Manhattan federal court on Monday, said Goldman shareholder James Mercer of Kirkland, Washington, sought judgment for profits from millions of dollars in transactions. It said Mercer wrote to the Goldman board on March 11 explaining that Gupta failed to disclose the details of his conduct and relationship with Rajaratnam as required by statute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam, 53, was convicted last month on charges of securities fraud and conspiracy for insider trading, including Goldman corporate secrets leaked to him by his friend Gupta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former director is an unindicted co-conspirator in the case and denies any wrongdoing. He faces civil charges in the Rajaratnam matter filed by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and is fighting those allegations with his own lawsuit against the market regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gupta's lawyer, Gary Naftalis, said the shareholder lawsuit "is without merit and we will vigorously defend it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A spokesman for Goldman Sachs declined to comment. The firm was identified as a nominal plaintiff by the shareholder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During Rajaratnam's two-month trial, U.S. prosecutors played secretly-recorded phone conversations in which Rajaratnam is heard discussing information he received from Gupta about Goldman Sachs. These and other conversations between the two men in 2008 are also cited in the SEC's complaint against Gupta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shareholder lawsuit focused on short-swing trading -- trading within a period of less than six months. The SEC alleges that profits and loss avoidance amounted to $17 million from tips on Berkshire Hathaway's $5 billion investment in Goldman at the height of the financial crisis and its second and fourth quarter financial results in 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Mr Rajaratnam/Galleon engaged in short-swing trading of Goldman Sachs securities, which generated substantial profits," the lawsuit said. "Mr Gupta was a beneficial owner of these securities because he had a pecuniary interest in the profits generated by this trading activity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said Gupta "as a statutory insider and beneficial owner of securities traded profitably on the short swing, must therefore disgorge all profits from those trades to issuer Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rajaratnam and Gupta, who was also the former global head of McKinsey  Co executive consultancy, were co-founders of a private equity investment firm New Silk Route Partners LLC in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is James Mercer v Rajat Gupta, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, No. 11-3828.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool; editing by Andre Grenon and Tim Dobbyn)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - Walt Disney Studios is set to cut between 200 and 250 positions next week, amounting to less than 5% of its 5,000-strong worldwide workforce.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The majority of the cuts will be in distribution, although marketing and production could be affected as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Declining revenue from the home entertainment division has been cited as one of the causes (consumers are shifting away from buying movies to renting), as well as piracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But organizational changes are also factors, such as combining domestic and international distribution divisions and the growing reliance of Disney on DreamWorks, Marvel and Pixar to fill the movie pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp is looking to put its popular Kinect motion-sensing device at the heart of its Xbox game console, unveiling plans on Monday to allow users to control live television feeds, search YouTube and play action games with voice commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The moves, announced at the annual E3 video game show in Los Angeles, should help the software giant further its ambitions to make its gaming device an essential media hub in the living room.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will give users access to live television programing through the Xbox in the United States sometime next year, following live TV services it already offers in Britain, France and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Xbox users will also be able to access Hulu Plus, Netflix, search the Internet and watch YouTube videos on the system, all controllable through the Kinect, Microsoft said, presenting a challenge to cable TV's dominance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, Microsoft thrilled hardcore gamers at a pre-show event by showing off upcoming versions of action games with new Kinect-enabled features, such as assembling guns and weapons in Ubisoft's "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier", or using voice controls for the upcoming shooter game "Mass Effect 3" next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts were initially skeptical that core gamers would migrate to the Kinect, which has attracted mostly newcomers with its simple dancing, animal and sports-themed games.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The concept of playing a core game without a controller is difficult," said Wedbush Securities analyst Michael Pachter. "A controller makes sense for most actions. It's awkward when you combine Kinect and a controller. But it's a start for Microsoft."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the company announced some new games for Kinect including a Star Wars-themed title and "Disneyland Adventure", a partnership with Walt Disney Co. It also said "Halo 4", the latest version of its blockbuster combat game will be released next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KINECT SUCCESS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Kinect has sold 10 million units since it launched last fall and become one of the software giant's fastest selling consumer products ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device, which hooks up to the company's Xbox console, lets gamers control movements on-screen with gestures and voice commands. It competes with the latest version of Nintendo Wii system and Sony Corp's PlayStation Move device.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced the news ahead of this week's Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) convention, the videogame business' marquee event that draws more than 45,000 industry types, reporters and analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year's conference, running June 7-9, comes as the industry tries to cope with the rapid growth of online and mobile gaming. It is also expected to feature comeback attempts from two Japan-based videogame heavyweights, Sony and Nintendo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Later on Monday, Sony is expected to reveal more details about its new handheld games device, while Nintendo will be launching the first new video game home console on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares rose 0.4 percent to $24.01 on the Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A massive build-up in foreign reserves in emerging markets should snuff worries about the end of the Federal Reserve's bond-buying program, the global head of emerging market research at JPMorgan said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid accumulation of foreign reserves and the conservative stance central banks take when investing them means U.S. Treasuries are a major target for those funds, supporting the market as the Fed ends purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in foreign currency reserves last year was about $885 billion, of which 80 percent was held by emerging markets, said JPMorgan's Joyce Chang. By the end of the year, foreign currency reserves are expected to be close to $11 trillion, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you think about that number, that's almost 50 percent higher than all of QE2," Chang said. She was referring to the Fed's $600 billion bond-buying program slated to end June 30 that is known as quantitative easing, or QE2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pace of reserves accumulation has surprised on the upside, and has helped suppress bond yields in the U.S. Treasury market the past couple of years, Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasonal factors could cut foreign buying of U.S. Treasury debt by one-quarter this summer, but central banks have few options when buying assets with their reserves, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're accumulating that much in foreign exchange reserves there aren't many places it can be deployed," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth of foreign currency reserves in the developing world is just one factor that indicates the amazing strength of emerging market economies, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging markets are expected to grow 6.1 percent this year compared to 2.2 percent for the developed world, a rate that when combined with the level of their foreign reserves speaks volumes about the health of the developing world, Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any indicator that you look at, whether it is the fiscal or the debt indicators, still favors emerging markets," Chang told the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMERGING MARKET CORPORATE BOND MARKET BOOMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang remains bullish on emerging markets. JPMorgan's 6.1 percent growth rate was revised from an earlier forecast this year of 5.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record $125 billion in corporate bond issuance in emerging markets in the first five months of the year is another strong indicator for the developing world, Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth in emerging markets corporate issuance is so strong Chang predicts it will match the size of the U.S. high yield market by 2014. The market cap for JPMorgan's global high yield index right now is $860 billion. The outstanding size for dollar-denominated corporate debt is about $650 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have a lot of issuance over the last few months, but longer-term this is still a market where very much that growth story is still intact," Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You could have this be a market that is $800 billion to $1 trillion over the next couple of years quite easily," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strong fiscal policies of governments in emerging markets and their low debt profile suggest emerging markets will remain in good shape for the foreseeable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could be cyclical but it could be a much longer cycle than we have had in the past. You could be looking at a 25-year cycle," Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone says it is cyclical. Well the debt transformation and the fiscal transformation is one that developed countries will have to bear the burden of for years to come," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China, of course, is key to the emerging markets story. A misstep by authorities on social issues could prove worrisome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a high savings rate equal to more than 50 percent of gross domestic product, government control over the banking system, an undervalued currency and continued migration from rural areas to cities point to sustainable Chinese growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's why it has been very hard for me to buy into the China hard-landing scenario. I don't see how you can hard land in that much water," Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Herbert Lash; editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) agreed to sell its beleaguered mortgage servicing unit for just over $600 million, putting an end to its ill-timed 3-1/2 year foray into a controversial corner of the U.S. housing market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ocwen Financial Corp (OCN.N) said on Monday it would buy Goldman's Litton Loan Servicing unit for $263.7 million in cash. Ocwen also agreed to pay off $337.4 million in Litton debt to Goldman, helped by a new $575 million loan from Barclays (BARC.L), which advised Ocwen on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal gives Ocwen a mortgage servicing portfolio totaling $41.2 billion, mostly subprime mortgages made to U.S. borrowers with less than stellar credit. Mortgage service firms collect payments and handle foreclosures for mortgage owners or investors who hold securities backed by pools of mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement, Goldman said the sale price "does not reflect certain assets that Goldman Sachs will retain." The bank declined to specify those assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman bought Litton in 2007 for about $430 million, hoping to glean more information about the housing market to aid its mortgage-bond trading business. Shortly after the deal closed, the U.S. subprime housing market deteriorated to a far greater degree than most experts had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;High levels of delinquencies and foreclosures have cut into profits of many servicing businesses. In recent months, sloppy foreclosure practices also have attracted growing regulatory attention -- and reams of bad publicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Litton is among those companies being probed. The New York Fed said last month it was investigating whether the company failed to conduct proper reviews before denying borrowers the chance to reduce their payments under a government program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was the latest in a series of headaches for Goldman, which has found itself under fire on multiple fronts over its handling of mortgage operations and securitization practices,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;and is now being probed by several government authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SHARING THE PAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ocwen said Goldman had agreed to share responsibility for fines and penalties that could result from such probes before the deal closes. It also agreed to share certain losses that could result from claims by third parties, such as investors or borrowers, in connection with its servicing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe we have adequately reserved for any potential losses but continue to monitor the situation closely," a Goldman spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman began considering a sale of Litton late last year. After taking a $220 million writedown related to the business in the first quarter, Goldman said on Monday the deal should have no "material impact" on its second-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To smooth any potential deal, Goldman told interested parties it was willing to finance a big chunk of the transaction, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ocwen said on Monday it would get financing for $2.47 billion of Litton's advances, payments made to mortgage owners when loans go sour to cover items like principal and interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman can choose how much of these advances it will finance: either it takes on the bulk itself, or it takes the exposure that three other banks involved in the deal -- Barclays, Bank of America (BAC.N), and Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS.L) -- are unwilling to take on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares closed down 1.1 percent as the U.S. stock market closed lower.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan is recommending investors look for buying opportunities in Peruvian debt as local markets sell off following the victory of left-wing Ollanta Humala in the country's presidential elections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Peruvian markets have been weakening in very volatile trade since Humala, who has recently tried to distance himself from Venezuela's Hugo Chavez, won the first round of elections in April 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They fell further on Monday after he defeated right-wing Keiko Fujimori, seen as a more market-friendly candidate, at the run-off election on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and other research institutions said the selloff, at least in debt markets, looks exaggerated as Humala is unlikely to drastically change the macroeconomic policies that have steadily improved Peru's credit-worthiness in the past few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think that there's probably going to be at this stage of the game more positive than negative surprises. We would frankly look for opportunities to add exposure," Joyce Chang, global head of emerging markets research at JPMorgan, told the Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the market has probably overreacted a bit here," she added, arguing that Peru's economic fundamentals remain "very strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peru's dollar-denominated global bonds due 2033 fell 2.3 points in price to bid 133.500, yielding 6.011 percent, as investors feared Humala would increase state control over the economy and throw away fiscal discipline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peruvian debt spreads over U.S. Treasuries, a gauge of investors' aversion to the country's risk, widened 21 basis points to a near one-month high of 213 basis points, according to JPMorgan's EMBI+ index.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of insuring Peru's debt also rose, with 5-year credit default swaps jumping to more than 180 basis points but retreating later in the afternoon. They were trading at 170.167 basis points late in the afternoon, up 24.027 basis points on the day, according to MarkIt data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The selloff in CDS markets was not that acute, however, as investors were "buying on weakness," RBS Securities strategists Siobhan Morden and Felipe Hernandez said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It likely speaks to the institutional strengths of Peru that the selloff in credit risk was quite limited," they said, recommending investors remain long on Peru's local-currency denominated bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have consistently been biased toward long positions, on the view that the downside risks were limited in terms of economic policy management or loss of the investment grade rating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Peruvian bonds will likely recover gradually as Humala appoints trusted technocrats to lead his economic team, RBS said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At JPMorgan, most calls on Peru were from clients interested in buying Peruvian assets opportunistically, Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While investors still need to see who Humala will appoint to his economic team, his strategies "won't diverge very much from the existing set of policies," Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the economic advisers and market reaction will probably temper" Humala's policies, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Daniel Bases; Editing by Kenneth Barry)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Ocwen pays $263.7 mln cash for Litton Loan Servicing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman retains "certain assets"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Ocwen retires $337.4 mln in loans to Goldman
 (Adds details on Goldman and Ocwen, updates share prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Knut Engelmann&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N)
agreed to sell its beleaguered mortgage servicing unit for just
over $600 million, putting an end to its ill-timed 3-1/2 year
foray into a controversial corner of the U.S. housing market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ocwen Financial Corp (OCN.N) said on Monday it would buy
Goldman's Litton Loan Servicing unit for $263.7 million in
cash. Ocwen also agreed to pay off $337.4 million in Litton
debt to Goldman, helped by a new $575 million loan from
Barclays (BARC.L), which advised Ocwen on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal gives Ocwen a mortgage servicing portfolio
totaling $41.2 billion, mostly subprime mortgages made to U.S.
borrowers with less than stellar credit. Mortgage service firms
collect payments and handle foreclosures for mortgage owners or
investors who hold securities backed by pools of mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement, Goldman said the sale price "does not
reflect certain assets that Goldman Sachs will retain." The
bank declined to specify those assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman bought Litton in 2007 for about $430 million,
hoping to glean more information about the housing market to
aid its mortgage-bond trading business. Shortly after the deal
closed, the U.S. subprime housing market deteriorated to a far
greater degree than most experts had expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; High levels of delinquencies and foreclosures have cut into
profits of many servicing businesses. In recent months, sloppy
foreclosure practices also have attracted growing regulatory
attention -- and reams of bad publicity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Litton is among those companies being probed. The New York
Fed said last month it was investigating whether the company
failed to conduct proper reviews before denying borrowers the
chance to reduce their payments under a government program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was the latest in a series of headaches for Goldman,
which has found itself under fire on multiple fronts over its
handling of mortgage operations and securitization practices,
 and is now being probed by several government authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHARING THE PAIN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ocwen said Goldman had agreed to share responsibility for
fines and penalties that could result from such probes before
the deal closes. It also agreed to share certain losses that
could result from claims by third parties, such as investors or
borrowers, in connection with its servicing business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe we have adequately reserved for any potential
losses but continue to monitor the situation closely," a
Goldman spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman began considering a sale of Litton late last year.
After taking a $220 million writedown related to the business
in the first quarter, Goldman said on Monday the deal should
have no "material impact" on its second-quarter earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; To smooth any potential deal, Goldman told interested
parties it was willing to finance a big chunk of the
transaction, sources familiar with the situation told Reuters
in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ocwen said on Monday it would get financing for $2.47
billion of Litton's advances, payments made to mortgage owners
when loans go sour to cover items like principal and interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman can choose how much of these advances it will
finance: either it takes on the bulk itself, or it takes the
exposure that three other banks involved in the deal --
Barclays, Bank of America (BAC.N), and Royal Bank of Scotland
(RBS.L) -- are unwilling to take on themselves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares closed down 1.1 percent as the U.S. stock
market closed lower. Shares of Ocwen reversed earlier gains to
close down 1.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For its part, Ocwen wants to continue growing its mortgage
servicing business, a source familiar with the situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source told Reuters on Monday that the Florida-based
company also was likely to take a good look at Morgan Stanley's
(MS.N) Saxon Mortgage Services Inc as well as Lehman Brothers'
LEHMQ.PK Aurora Bank, which have similar assets.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A massive build-up in foreign reserves in emerging markets should snuff worries about the end of the Federal Reserve's bond-buying program, the global head of emerging market research at JPMorgan said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rapid accumulation of foreign reserves and the conservative stance central banks take when investing them means U.S. Treasuries are a major target for those funds, supporting the market as the Fed ends purchases.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increase in foreign currency reserves last year was about $885 billion, of which 80 percent was held by emerging markets, said JPMorgan's Joyce Chang. By the end of the year, foreign currency reserves are expected to be close to $11 trillion, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you think about that number, that's almost 50 percent higher than all of QE2," Chang said. She was referring to the Fed's $600 billion bond-buying program slated to end June 30 that is known as quantitative easing, or QE2.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pace of reserves accumulation has surprised on the upside, and has helped suppress bond yields in the U.S. Treasury market the past couple of years, Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Seasonal factors could cut foreign buying of U.S. Treasury debt by one-quarter this summer, but central banks have few options when buying assets with their reserves, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you're accumulating that much in foreign exchange reserves there aren't many places it can be deployed," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth of foreign currency reserves in the developing world is just one factor that indicates the amazing strength of emerging market economies, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Emerging markets are expected to grow 6.1 percent this year compared to 2.2 percent for the developed world, a rate that when combined with the level of their foreign reserves speaks volumes about the health of the developing world, Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Any indicator that you look at, whether it is the fiscal or the debt indicators, still favors emerging markets," Chang told the Reuters Investment Outlook Summit in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EMERGING MARKET CORPORATE BOND MARKET BOOMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chang remains bullish on emerging markets. JPMorgan's 6.1 percent growth rate was revised from an earlier forecast this year of 5.9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A record $125 billion in corporate bond issuance in emerging markets in the first five months of the year is another strong indicator for the developing world, Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Growth in emerging markets corporate issuance is so strong Chang predicts it will match the size of the U.S. high yield market by 2014. The market cap for JPMorgan's global high yield index right now is $860 billion. The outstanding size for dollar-denominated corporate debt is about $650 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You have a lot of issuance over the last few months, but longer-term this is still a market where very much that growth story is still intact," Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You could have this be a market that is $800 billion to $1 trillion over the next couple of years quite easily," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The strong fiscal policies of governments in emerging markets and their low debt profile suggest emerging markets will remain in good shape for the foreseeable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could be cyclical but it could be a much longer cycle than we have had in the past. You could be looking at a 25-year cycle," Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Everyone says it is cyclical. Well the debt transformation and the fiscal transformation is one that developed countries will have to bear the burden of for years to come," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China, of course, is key to the emerging markets story. A misstep by authorities on social issues could prove worrisome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, a high savings rate equal to more than 50 percent of gross domestic product, government control over the banking system, an undervalued currency and continued migration from rural areas to cities point to sustainable Chinese growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's why it has been very hard for me to buy into the China hard-landing scenario. I don't see how you can hard land in that much water," Chang said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Herbert Lash; editing by Andrew Hay))&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The biggest risk to a rally in the U.S. stock market is that economic growth could be weaker and energy and other raw material prices even higher than now expected, Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. equity strategist said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit in New York, Goldman's David Kostin said the firm continues to see the Standard and Poors 500 index ending 2011 at 1,450 points. He cut his forecast from 1,500 on May 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark stock index fell to 1,291 points on Monday, its lowest since March 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked about the biggest question mark for stocks, Kostin cited "a more significant slowdown in the U.S. economy or higher raw material prices than we are currently forecasting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm's SP forecast currently assumes U.S. GDP growth for 2011 at a relatively sluggish 2.6 percent, rising to 3.2 percent in 2012, and Brent crude oil prices ending the year at $120 per barrel, rising to $140 by the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against that backdrop, Goldman currently favors large-capitalization stocks over small-cap, although the strategy has not paid off so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kostin said consumer staple stocks could outperform for now, and that many such firms are having success passing higher materials costs onto their users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy stocks also look good. With oil prices high, "a little bit of profitability from every business" is siphoned off into windfall profits for energy companies, Kostin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SP 500 is poised to climb back this year above its previous earnings-per-share peak of $91 from 2007, Kostin said. EPS should rise to 14 percent to $96 in 2011 from $84 in 2010, and advance another 8 percent in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among institutional investors, a big debate at the moment is around margins, and whether or not corporate margins can continue to rise, Kostin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Goldman Sachs says no: it predicts that margins will peak in 2011 and decline slightly next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kostin noted that the Institute for Supply Management's closely-watched manufacturing index peaked in February, at 61.4, and is now barely holding in expansion mode. It was last reported at 53.5 for May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"History suggests that about one year after the ISM peaks, margins peak," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on the minds of major investors is the ongoing debate over the U.S. debt ceiling and whether and how the U.S. budget deficit will be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are still hopeful of a resolution," said Kostin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ros Krasny; Editing by Andrew Hay)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Editor at Large, International Financing Review, a Thomson
Reuters publication.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The views expressed are his own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, June 6 (IFR) - So the Manhattan DA has shown his
hand and issued Goldman with a subpoena relating to its
activities in sub-prime mortgage CDOs in the run-up to the
financial crisis. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's likely that Cyrus Vance's office will only seek
information from Goldman about the securities that were covered
in Senator Levin's April 2011 report, which itself only focused
on those that were discussed at his Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations' hearings a year earlier. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On that basis, all the information he could possibly require
has been in the public domain for some considerable time.
Even so, this saga could be interminable. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Department of Justice and the SEC are reviewing Levin's
report, and could spring into action at some point, as could the
New York State Attorney-General's office. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; All we'd need then is for the NYPD, CSI, and what the hell,
why not get the New York City Police Department Band all
involved in consecutive investigations, and Lloyd Blankfein will
have been cast as a modern-day Sisyphus, the mythological Greek
king who was condemned to roll a huge boulder all the way up a
hill, watch it roll back down, and repeat the process for
eternity. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MARTIN ACT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Actually, the prospect of a multitude of agencies issuing
subpoenas, poring over identical information and still not
getting CDOs or market-making may make the hill and the boulder
look like a less frustrating option. The one thing the Manhattan
DA has that federal prosecutors don't is the Martin Act,
enshrined under New York securities law. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While federal prosecutors have to prove ex-ante intent to
defraud in order to bring a criminal prosecution, under the
Martin Act state prosecutors only have to find material
misrepresentation in a securities offering, which has a much
lower burden of proof. This is a powerful weapon that, observers
say, could give state prosecutors grounds to bring individual
criminal actions against Goldman executives even where federal
actions have failed. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POTENTIAL OUTCOMES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That said, few people really believe the subpoena will lead
to criminal charges. Dick Bove, an analyst at Rochdale
Securities, said the government is looking for a bank to punish
for the financial crisis and has selected Goldman. "They want
Goldman Sachs to show some sort of contrition," he told Reuters.
"The blood is in the water and the sharks will all come." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brad Hintz, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, reckons
Goldman is too big to fail and that criminal proceedings would
not just threaten Goldman but the US financial system. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jacob Frenkel, a former SEC enforcement lawyer and now a
partner at law firm Shulman Rogers, is confident that Goldman
will not be charged in a criminal case and that the subpoena is
a fishing expedition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kian Abouhossein, an analyst at JP Morgan, has lifted his
rating on Goldman from 'neutral' to 'overweight' and believes
the market is over-reacting to headline risk. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeffery Harte, an analyst at Sandler O'Neill, also has a buy
on Goldman stock. In an interview with Bloomberg TV, he noted
that Goldman's current price-to-book implies an ROE of around 11
percent, whereas ROE has averaged north of 20 percent since the
firm's IPO in 1999. He says that at these levels, the market
believes Goldman's earnings power has been cut in half. Harte
doesn't think this is the case, which he says makes the stock a
buy. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Charles Peabody, an analyst at Portales Partners, who
likewise believes Goldman is too big to prosecute, reckons one
potential outcome is a negotiated settlement where the firm pays
a fine, (presumably without admitting guilt) and agrees to a
series of internal operating changes. That sounds like a plan.
Goldman's own worst-case estimate for litigation losses stands
at $2.7 billion. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the grand scheme of the firm's ability to generate
revenue, it's not a lot of money, equal in fact to the firm's
1Q11 net earnings. If I were Lloyd Blankfein, I'd be sorely
tempted to give up a couple of billion dollars now if I could
make it all go away in a multi-agency once-and-for-all
settlement. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has so far been very quiet in its public reaction to
the investigative vigour shown by the government and its
agencies. But that could be about to change. According to the
Wall Street Journal, Goldman plans to push back on the Senate
committee's findings, claiming "sloppy math and incomplete
analysis" This could be just what's needed to turn this one-way
barrage into an old-fashioned scrap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 6 (Reuters) - Nine European banks are likely to
fail this summer's industry health check and will need to raise
a combined 29 billion euros ($42.4 billion), according to a poll
of investors by Goldman Sachs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Banks in Spain, Germany and Greece will need to raise the
most fresh capital, the U.S. bank said in a research note
released on Monday detailing the poll.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thirty two percent of respondents expected 10-25 billion
euros to be raised as a result of the stress tests, Goldman
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A quarter expected 25-50 billion euros to be raised, 27
percent expected less than 10 billion euros would ne needed and
14 percent expected 50-100 billion euros to be raised.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The responses implied a mean of 29 billion euros would be
needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said 113 participants completed the survey, with 67
percent in Europe and 27 percent in the United States. Almost
half were long only investors and 30 percent were hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European regulators are demanding 90 top banks hold more,
better-quality capital in a test aimed at reassuring taxpayers
the sector can withstand a two-year recession, a collapse of
property prices and rising unemployment, &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks need to hold more than 5 percent of core Tier 1 capital
under the stress test scenario. Results are due out in early
July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report said 65 percent believed the amount of capital
raised would leave banks adequately or over-capitalized and 35
percent said there would be a capital deficit after the tests.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Steve Slater; Editing by David Cowell)

&lt;p&gt;  OTTAWA, Jun 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Protecode Inc., a leading provider of open source license management
solutions, today announced that it has successfully completed "Ready for
IBM Rational Software" technical validation for Build Analyzer(TM).

    Protecode Build Analyzer, a component of Protecode's System 4(TM)
complete license management solution, now seamlessly integrates with
Rational Team Concert. The easy-to-install integration provides IBM
Rational development teams with an efficient, user-friendly and automated
tool for managing open source and third party code throughout the
increasingly collaborative software development cycle enabled by the
Rational Collaborative Lifecycle Management Solution (CLM).

    "Development teams are evolving into workgroups. They are becoming more
decentralized and use multiple platforms. Protecode Build Analyzer
software license management capabilities, coupled with collaborative
capabilities of Rational Team Concert now allows development teams to
easily confirm compliance to open source licensing obligations before
shipping their products," said Kamal Hassin, Vice President of Product
Management, Protecode. 

    "Compliance with open source licensing obligations is becoming
increasingly important across industries," said Mike Loria, Vice
President, IBM Rational Business Development. "The Protecode Build
Analyzer extends the processes of Rational Collaborative Lifecycle
Management to include License management, which is an integral part of
software and systems development."

    Working closely with IBM Rational Team Concert, Build Analyzer ensures
that unwanted open source or other third party code is not included in
products that are shipped to customers. Build Analyzer monitors the build
process tool (such as Apache's Ant), and creates a list of files that are
used during the build (after the pre-processing stage). It then analyzes
the files that are used in the build process. Build Analyzer is light
weight, making it easy to integrate into an already existing software
development process.

			Wind River Achieves &#8216;Ready for IBM Rational Software&#8217; Validation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Wind 
      River, a world leader in embedded and mobile software, today 
      announced that it has achieved "Ready for IBM Rational Software" 
      technical validation for Wind River Test Management, a test automation 
      system for monitoring, executing and managing embedded device software 
      testing. This validation provides IBM Rational customers with assurance 
      that Wind River Test Management has met IBM Rational&#8217;s requirements for 
      safety, interoperability, and user experience, and integrates seamlessly 
      with IBM Rational Quality Manager.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Wind River integration enables bi-directional traceability between 
      requirements and tests as part of the overall software development 
      lifecycle in the Rational Software and Systems Engineering solution. 
      Wind River Test Management allows users to discover un-tested 
      requirements and automatically identify test suites that are impacted by 
      requirements changes. It then generates an optimized test suite 
      comprised of the minimum set of tests that are required to run based on 
      code changes. By focusing test time and resources on what really needs 
      testing, these features provide optimal balance between cost, time, 
      quality and risk, and increased quality of software embedded in complex 
      devices.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "We are very pleased to announce this formal validation between Wind 
      River and IBM Rational Quality Manager, which allows us to extend our 
      test automation specialization to Rational customers," said Ido Sarig, 
      vice president of product marketing at Wind River. &#8220;A lifecycle quality 
      management solution based on the integration will help companies improve 
      their ROI and collaboration across the development lifecycle, reduce 
      costs by increasing automation, and provide better visibility to project 
      status, leading to higher quality and on-time deliveries.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The integration of Wind River&#8217;s patented technology with Rational 
      Quality Manager will help product development teams manage business 
      risks using a lifecycle quality management approach,&#8221; said Michael 
      Loria, vice president, IBM Rational Business Development. &#8220;With this 
      integrated solution, users can provide quality management across the 
      whole development lifecycle through the Rational Software and Systems 
      Engineering solution, as well as execute testing where it matters most.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wind River will present and exhibit at IBM&#8217;s Innovate 2011 Conference in 
      Orlando, FL this week. Please visit Wind River Booth #524 to see a 
      demonstration of Wind River Test Management and the integration with IBM

			Palmer Square Capital Management Selects J.P. Morgan to Provide Prime 
      Custody Solutions for its First Mutual Fund &#8211; Palmer Square Absolute 
      Return Fund (PSQAX and PSQIX)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P.&#160;Morgan announced today that it has been selected by investment 
      management firm Palmer Square Capital Management, a manager of hedge 
      fund-of-funds partnerships and customized alternative investments, to 
      provide Prime Custody Solutions for their recently launched Absolute 
      Return Fund. This fund is Palmer Square&#8217;s first open-ended mutual fund, 
      a fund that, according to Palmer Square, seeks capital appreciation with 
      an emphasis on absolute (positive) returns and low correlation to the 
      broader equity and bond markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Palmer Square further indicates that the fund utilizes a concentrated 
      group of seven institutional managers who operate a broad range of hedge 
      fund-type strategies, including global macro, long/short and 
      event-driven credit, long/short international and domestic equity, and 
      convertible bond arbitrage. J.P. Morgan will provide a range of 
      capabilities: global custody, equity and FX prime brokerage, interest 
      rate derivatives, OTC, and futures and options.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Prime Custody Solutions combines prime brokerage, global custody and 
      other securities services through a single technology portal and 
      integrated client service model. The J.P. Morgan Prime Custody Solutions 
      platform leverages two market-leading J.P. Morgan franchises: 
      J.P.&#160;Morgan Worldwide Securities Services, a premier securities 
      servicing provider with approximately $17 trillion of assets under 
      custody and J.P. Morgan Prime Brokerage, a market-leading global prime 
      brokerage. Prime Custody Solutions provides tools to help mutual funds 
      comply with the &#8217;40 Act and SEC requirements regarding bank custody and 
      shorting and/or leveraging alternatives strategies provided by a broker 
      dealer. J.P. Morgan&#8217;s offering includes automated collateral management, 
      consolidated transaction and reporting technology utilizing a single 
      portal and integrated customer service across all products.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Angie K. Long, Chief Investment Officer of Palmer Square Capital 
      Management LLC, said &#8220;The ability to partner with J.P. Morgan across the 
      breadth of the Palmer Square Absolute Return Fund trading and custody 
      needs regardless of investment strategy and regulatory requirements is a 
      huge benefit to us &#8211; both from an ease of execution and operations 
      perspective. J.P. Morgan was able to structure a solution across the 
      firm in a seamless way that enabled our fund to get to market quickly.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Devon George-Eghdami, Managing Director and Head of Prime Custody 
      Solutions, said &#8220;We are seeing ever increasing demand from hedge fund 
      managers who are offering alternative strategy mutual funds. Our ability 
      to offer integrated capabilities across prime services, global custody 
      and other securities services to these complex fund structures that must 
      also meet &#8216;40 Act requirements is unique in the market. We are excited 
      to be able to work with Palmer Square as they launch this new fund.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc could release documents to counter a Senate subcommittee report that said the bank misled clients about mortgage-linked securities, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, facing probes by several government authorities into derivatives trades it executed in 2006 and 2007, could release documents about its mortgage bets to show the analysis by the subcommittee was inaccurate and incomplete, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The information could be released soon on Goldman's website, though a decision has not been made yet, the paper added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to requests seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The subcommittee, headed by Democrat Carl Levin, said Goldman offloaded much of its subprime mortgage exposure to unsuspecting clients when the market for such securities was starting to tank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, Goldman received a subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney, who joined the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission in examining Goldman's actions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Renju Jose in Bangalore; Editing by David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;

			Composite Software Releases Latest Data Virtualization Software 
      Highlighted by "Big Data" Integration Support for Apache Hadoop, IBM 
      Netezza and HP Vertica
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Composite 6 strengthens the company's enterprise scale data 
      virtualization leadership position with advanced performance 
      optimizations, cache enhancements and data governance features
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Composite Software, the data virtualization performance leader, today 
      introduced Composite 
      6, a new version of its flagship data 
      virtualization software that enriches the enterprise with &#8220;big data&#8221; 
      integration support for the Cloudera Distribution including Apache 
      Hadoop (CDH), IBM Netezza and HP Vertica data sources. Composite 6, the 
      culmination of nearly 10 years of Composite Software engineering 
      expertise, extends Composite Software's enterprise-scale data 
      virtualization leadership position with unsurpassed performance 
      optimizations, cache enhancements, new data governance capabilities and 
      ease-of-use features. Composite 6 is completing beta test and will be 
      commercially available in July.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Composite 6 provides a standardized SQL approach to augment specialized 
      MapReduce coding of Hadoop queries. This simplifies integration of 
      Hadoop data thereby extending an organization's enterprisewide 
      information analysis and business insight capabilities to include this 
      emerging &#8220;big data&#8221; source.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;The rapid proliferation of diverse data sources such as Hadoop has 
      compelled companies to seek alternatives such as data virtualization for 
      integrating these 'big data' sources for enterprisewide information 
      analysis and resulting business insights,&#8221; said Shawn Rogers, Vice 
      President Research, Business Intelligence at Enterprise Management 
      Associates.
			&#8220;Composite 6 provides significant features that not 
      only solidify Composite Software's position as the data virtualization 
      performance leader, but also other enterprise-class data governance and 
      usability features that make Composite Software's data virtualization 
      platform the most advanced and enterprise ready today.&#8221;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Adoption of Apache Hadoop-based solutions is accelerating as data 
      driven organizations discover the power of this open source technology 
      to extract value from large volumes of structured and unstructured data. 
      This increases the need to integrate data in Hadoop with traditional 
      enterprise data sources," said Ed Albanese, head of business development 
      at Cloudera. "Composite Software's SQL-based integration with Cloudera's 
      Distribution including Apache Hadoop (CDH) enables customers to benefit 
      from using the most comprehensive and widely adopted distribution of 
      Hadoop with a proven, enterprise data virtualization platform."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			High Performance Netezza, Sybase IQ and Vertica Access
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Composite 6 further improves the data virtualization performance for IBM 
      Netezza data warehouse appliances that Composite and Netezza initially 
      delivered in 2010. The new software enables Netezza as a cache target, 
      provides native support of all Netezza analytic functions during 
      queries, and extends the unique &#8220;data ship join&#8221; optimization pioneered 
      by Composite and Netezza to work heterogeneously with Oracle and Sybase 
      IQ. The
			Composite 
      Software Data Virtualization Platform is the 
      only data virtualization product offering optimized for and resold by 
      IBM Netezza.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Composite 6 now fully supports Sybase IQ and HP Vertica access and 
      federated query optimization, simplifying and accelerating 
      enterprisewide data virtualization of Sybase IQ and Vertica sources. The 
      new functionality extends Composite's existing JDBC integration approach 
      by adding intelligent use of source optimizers. Composite&#8217;s 
      PerformancePlus Adapters&#8482; represent the widest set of optimized source 
      adapters in the data virtualization market.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Since 2007, Nielsen has used Composite Software&#8217;s data virtualization 
      offerings to improve the value Nielsen provides to our customers,&#8221; said 
      John Boyer, Enablement Team Leader, Nielsen and co-author of Business 
      Intelligence Strategy; A Practical Guide to BI Excellence. &#8220;Composite 
      6&#8217;s big data and query optimization advancements, especially with 
      respect to Netezza, will enable even greater value delivery.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Further Performance Acceleration and Governance Enhancements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Composite 6 adds incremental and synchronized edge caching to enable 
      timely refreshing and wide-area distribution of persisted data. These 
      caching options&#8212;unique in the data virtualization market&#8212;allow 
      global organizations to achieve sub-second access to fast changing, 
      large data sets such as trades and financial reference data, anywhere in 
      the world around the clock. Additional performance acceleration features 
      enable the Composite 6 query engine to natively perform over 30 analytic 
      functions as well as dynamically rearrange joins when querying 
      star-schemas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Composite 6 also includes multiple new data governance capabilities 
      including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        More fine grain usage and lineage data for better auditing and control;
      
			
        Further automation of multi-source relationship discovery to 
        accelerate data modeling;
      
			
        A complete data virtualization implementation methodology and 
        supporting best practices to better govern data virtualization 
        implementations.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Data virtualization is emerging as an ideal solution for managing today's 
      complex data integration challenges,&#8221; said Jim Green, CEO for 
      Composite Software. &#8220;Composite 6 further extends our position as the 
      leading provider of production-ready, enterprise-scale, high performance 
      data virtualization solutions in use by more than 200 organizations 
      worldwide.&#8221;

			ADA-ES Announces $60 Million Equity Sale in Clean Coal Solutions, LLC 
      Joint Venture to an Affiliate of Goldman Sachs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Investor Will Receive An Effective 15% of the Joint Venture
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      ADA-ES, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADES) (&#8220;ADA&#8221;) today announced the sale of a 15.8% 
      equity interest in Clean Coal Solutions, LLC (&#8220;Clean Coal&#8221;), ADA&#8217;s 50:50 
      joint venture with an affiliate of NexGen Resources Corporation 
      (&#8220;NexGen&#8221;), by ADA and NexGen for $60 million to GSFS Investments I 
      Corp. (&#8220;GSFS&#8221;), an affiliate of The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (&#8220;Goldman 
      Sachs&#8221;). Closing of the transaction was simultaneous with signing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      GSFS&#8217;s 15.8% equity interest in Clean Coal is represented by Class B 
      Units, which are non-voting except as to approval rights on certain 
      matters. The Class B Units entitle the holder to a targeted return of at 
      least 15%. ADA and NexGen each received gross proceeds of $30 million at 
      closing and ADA will receive an additional $1.8 million payment from 
      NexGen to maintain NexGen&#8217;s interest in Clean Coal. Given the 2.5% 
      direct interest both ADA and NexGen retain in the individual entities 
      previously formed to lease the &#8220;Refined Coal&#8221; facilities, the effective 
      sharing ratio of net cash generated by all expected Refined Coal 
      operations is 15% to GSFS and 85% to ADA and NexGen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Clean Coal&#8217;s patented coal technology, CyClean, is a cost effective coal 
      technology to produce Refined Coal, which reduces emissions of NOx and 
      mercury. The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 included changes to 
      Section 45 of the Internal Revenue Code that incentivize the production 
      of Refined Coal through an annually escalating tax credit, which is 
      presently $6.33 per ton.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In conjunction with the equity purchase, Clean Coal granted Goldman 
      Sachs the exclusive right to lease Refined Coal facilities targeted to 
      produce up to 12 million tons of Refined Coal per year on terms that 
      will be economically more favorable to Clean Coal than those in effect 
      for the leases that Clean Coal entered into with another affiliate of 
      Goldman Sachs in June 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dr. Michael D. Durham, President and CEO of ADA, commented, &#8220;We are very 
      pleased to welcome this additional investment by Goldman Sachs. We 
      believe that their continued financial interest in Clean Coal further 
      validates the environmental and financial benefits of this proven 
      emissions control technology. As we continue to assess ADA's liabilities 
      resulting from the arbitration panel's recent interim award to Norit 
      Americas, Inc. and related indemnity obligations, this cash infusion 
      enhances our balance sheet and our ability to fulfill those obligations."
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional information regarding the transaction is available in ADA&#8217;s 
      Current Report on Form 8-K, which ADA filed with the United States 
      Securities and Exchange Commission on June 3, 2011.

&lt;p&gt;  BELMONT, CA, Jun 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Actiance (www.actiance.com), enablers of the safe and compliant use of
unified communications, collaboration and Web 2.0, and a nationally
managed Microsoft Gold Certified Partner, today introduced Vantage
Security for Microsoft Lync, a subscription to protect Lync environments
against malware and out of policy content.

    Microsoft Lync Server 2010 and Microsoft Lync 2010 deliver streamlined
communications so users can find and communicate with the right person,
right now, from the applications they use most, like Microsoft Outlook.

    Actiance's Vantage platform is already the de facto solution for
security, policy controls and compliance features for real-time and
unified communications (UC) and this new subscription, designed both for
Lync and its predecessor, Microsoft Office Communications Server 2007 R2,
includes file transfer controls, anti-virus and malware control, SpIM
blocking, blocking of conversations containing inappropriate content and
the ability to detect and block worm attacks. For Lync customers, as well
as those using or migrating from Microsoft Office Communications Server
2007 R2, Vantage Security for Lync provides support for both platforms. 

    "Microsoft is excited that Actiance is continuing to innovate and bring
solutions to market," said B.J. Haberkorn, Lync group product manager at
Microsoft Corp. "Vantage Security for Lync provides our mutual customers
strong support for ensuring the compliance and security of their
communications systems."

    "Unified communications has evolved significantly over the past few years
and the scope of requirements for vendors has also increased," said Blair
Pleasant, president and principal analyst of
 COMMfusion LLC. "Actiance
is the clear choice in bringing the most complete and up-to-date
solutions to market and has the vision needed to anticipate the next
challenge in the market."

    "At Actiance, we are committed to bring market leading solutions to the
unified communications space, and as part of this promise, ensure that
customers who upgrade to, or implement Lync, can increase the
efficiencies provided through the new platform, without compromising or
leaking any sensitive information or data," said Sarah Carter, vice
president of marketing at Actiance.

			BigLever Software Achieves &#8216;Ready for IBM Rational Software&#8217; 
      Validation for the IBM Rational Quality Manager / BigLever Software 
      Gears Bridge 2.0 Solution
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Working in tandem with IBM Rational Quality Manager, the BigLever 
      Bridge Solution enhances verification and validation capabilities to 
      support product line diversity, consistently with other phases of the 
      lifecycle
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BigLever Software&#8482;, the leading provider of systems and software product 
      line (SPL) engineering framework, tools and services, announced today 
      that the company has successfully completed &#8216;Ready for IBM Rational 
      Software&#8217; technical validation for its Rational Quality Manager / 
      BigLever Gears Bridge&#8482; 2.0 solution. By integrating IBM&#8217;s Jazz-based 
      Rational Quality Manager into BigLever's SPL Lifecycle Framework, this 
      solution enables product line engineering organizations to bring quality 
      assurance (QA) to complementary status with specification, design and 
      implementation &#8211; as a strategic element of the SPL development lifecycle.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the major productivity gains delivered by SPL approaches, it is 
      essential that companies address the QA end of the lifecycle in tandem 
      with design and development. Otherwise, the development bottleneck is 
      simply moved downstream to QA. By putting testing, verification and 
      validation 'on par' with other elements of the lifecycle, the Rational 
      Quality Manager/Gears Bridge eliminates bottlenecks and allows companies 
      to realize the full spectrum of benefits provided by SPL engineering. 
      The 2.0 version of this bridge solution offers usability and integration 
      enhancements for supporting IBM&#8217;s new Rational Quality Manager V3.0.1.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Working in concert with the IBM Rational solution for systems and 
      software engineering, the BigLever SPL Framework provides a consistent 
      and integrated approach that extends the ability of our mutual customers 
      to effectively manage product line diversity throughout each lifecycle 
      stage,&#8221; said Michael Loria, vice president, IBM Rational Business 
      Development. &#8220;This approach is epitomized by the integration of Rational 
      Quality Manager into the BigLever Framework, which allows test case 
      diversity to be defined and managed according to the product features 
      within a product line.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the new Rational Quality Manager release, IBM continues to 
      strengthen the impact of the Jazz-based lifecycle solutions with the 
      essential capabilities companies need to achieve new levels of test 
      management and quality assurance,&#8221; said Charles Krueger, BigLever CEO. 
      &#8220;By marrying IBM&#8217;s application lifecycle approach with BigLever&#8217;s SPL 
      Lifecycle Framework, BigLever is enabling development teams to much more 
      efficiently and effectively meet product line delivery objectives, which 
      can ultimately result in greater profitability for the business.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  FREMONT, CA, Jun 06 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Network Equipment Technologies, Inc. ("NET") (NASDAQ: NWK) announced
today the general availability of SmartSIP 2.0 for Microsoft Lync Server
2010. NET's SmartSIP 2.0 is a software application that provides Lync
voice interoperability for SIP devices, such as desktop phones, Wi-Fi
devices, and cordless phones operating under the DECT standard (for
Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications). SmartSIP 2.0 includes
functionality for determining presence for SIP devices inside of
Microsoft Lync environments. 

    The SmartSIP application is built using Microsoft Unified Communications
Managed API (UCMA) to address the interoperability of legacy SIP
endpoints and Microsoft unified communications. SmartSIP extends
enterprises' existing SIP endpoints and reduces operating expenses by
automatically provisioning the endpoints. In addition, SmartSIP 2.0's
unique architecture offers enhanced scalability and resiliency required
for enterprise deployments.

    SmartSIP 2.0 has been tested with both the standalone and the enterprise
edition of Microsoft Lync, which demonstrates its ability to be deployed
in small as well as in large installations. SmartSIP 2.0 was beta tested
with a number of NET partners before its general availability was
announced.

    "With the expanding use of unified communications in the enterprise,
businesses migrating to Microsoft Lync Server are seeking solutions to
extend the useful life of their existing SIP devices. They need their SIP
phones to work seamlessly with Lync," said Talbot Harty, Chief
Development Officer of NET. "SmartSIP 2.0 expands the Microsoft Lync
environment in the enterprise and increases the value and the capability
of our customers' existing telephony investment. Additionally, SmartSIP
2.0 adds 802.11 Wi-Fi and DECT wireless devices to Lync."

    Examples of supported endpoints:


--  Cisco 7960/7940
--  Polycom Soundpoint IP Phones
--  Polycom Spectralink 8020/8030
--  Aastra 6731i/6757i
--  Aastra DECT 610D/620D
--  Linksys SPA 942/962

&lt;p&gt;June 6 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) could
release documents to counter a Senate subcommittee report that
said the bank misled clients about mortgage-linked securities,
the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with
the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman, facing probes by several government authorities
into derivatives trades it executed in 2006 and 2007, could
release documents about its mortgage bets to show the analysis
by the subcommittee was inaccurate and incomplete, the paper
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The information could be released soon on Goldman's website,
though a decision has not been made yet, the paper added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to requests
seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The subcommittee, headed by Democrat Carl Levin, said
Goldman offloaded much of its subprime mortgage exposure to
unsuspecting clients when the market for such securities was
starting to tank. [ID:nN02257268]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, Goldman received a subpoena from the Manhattan
district attorney, who joined the Justice Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission in examining Goldman's
actions.

(XOM.N) said on Tuesday a fire was out after burning about 90

fire's cause or whether it affected production, but he said it
was isolated within a single tank and no injuries were
reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A dispatcher for the Beaumont Fire Department said city
firefighters were not called to the site, as the refinery's
on-site responders handled the fire on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allexon said in a statement that the fire broke out at
about 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT) on the tank that was being emptied
for maintenance. "The remaining volume in the tank was
minimal," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fire was out by 2:30 p.m. EDT, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gulf Coast cash products traders said markets shrugged off
the fire in the well-supplied region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "No big deal. No one cares," one Gulf trader said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Beaumont refinery is the eighth-largest in the United
States.

      l&#237;mites, resultar vencidos demasiadas veces, que alguien siempre llegue

      Eso es exactamente lo que los fan&#225;ticos hispanos del f&#250;tbol vieron en un

      El comercial titulado &#8220;Buscando Coca-Cola&#8221;, presenta el m&#225;gico poder

      desesperadamente unas botellas de Coca-Cola antes del inicio de un

      llega despu&#233;s que su molesto vecino, quien se lleva la &#250;ltima Coca-Cola 
      de cada tienda. Cuando el hombre regresa a su hogar con las manos 
      vac&#237;as, el vecino mira su paquete de seis botellas de Coca-Cola, cambia 
      de opini&#243;n y se acerca a su vecino para compartirlas. Conmovido por la 
      generosidad de su vecino, el hombre lo invita a unirse a una fiesta en

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer Conducts First &#8220;Virtual&#8221; Clinical Trial Allowing Patients to 
      Participate Regardless Of Geography
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pilot Study Will Compare Results to Previous Trial Data to Assess 
      Validity of New Approach
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. announced today that it is conducting the first-ever 
      randomized clinical trial under an investigational new drug (IND) 
      application that manages study participation entirely using electronic 
      tools and allows patients to participate in the clinical trial 
      regardless of their proximity to clinical sites. The pilot project, 
      initiated following review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
      (FDA), uses mobile phone and web-based technology to collect necessary 
      data for the trial without clinic visits.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Research on Electronic Monitoring of OAB Treatment Experience &#8211; 
      REMOTE &#8211; is a U.S.-based Participatory Patient-Centered (PPC) clinical 
      trial designed to assess the safety and efficacy of Detrol LA 
      (tolterodine tartrate), a treatment for overactive bladder (OAB). Pfizer 
      and its research partners hope to determine whether the results of the 
      pilot REMOTE &#8220;virtual trial&#8221; can replicate the results of a previously 
      completed Phase IV Detrol LA trial, and in this way begin to validate 
      virtual, patient-centered approaches to clinical research.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the REMOTE virtual trial pilot, for the first time we can make it 
      possible for patients to participate in clinical trials without having 
      to visit physical sites,&#8221; said Pfizer Executive Vice President and Chief 
      Medical Officer Freda Lewis-Hall, M.D., who announced the new trial 
      today during remarks at the National Library of Medicine (NLM) Clinical 
      Trials Conference in Bethesda, MD. &#8220;Studies like REMOTE could make 
      biomedical science much more accessible to people who have long been 
      excluded from or under-represented in clinical trials. Putting research 
      within reach of more diverse populations has the potential to advance 
      medical progress and lead to better outcomes for more patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The REMOTE trial is the first-ever randomized &#8220;virtual&#8221; clinical trial 
      under an IND application to secure patient consent online using 
      video/multimedia and online testing. Study investigators will ship all 
      blinded study medication to patients at home rather than dispensing it 
      at a clinic visit. Researchers will manage study conduct remotely, and 
      share clinical trial data and results with patients, enabling them to 
      add them to their own personal health records.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Investigators in the REMOTE trial plan to enroll about 600 patients from 
      about 10 states across the United States. Enrolled patients will 
      participate in the study screening process through the Internet, 
      actively manage their own trial activity and report results directly to 
      a trial investigator who keeps close oversight of patient eligibility 
      and safety. As a result, researchers expect to save time and obtain 
      better quality, more reliable data through increased patient compliance, 
      lower withdrawal rates and real-time data collection.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This approach, if proven successful, holds considerable promise in 
      speeding up clinical trials while improving their quality,&#8221; said Briggs 
      W. Morrison, M.D., Pfizer&#8217;s senior vice president of Worldwide Medical 
      Excellence. &#8220;This program and similar programs that may follow could 
      lead to an entirely new way for patients to participate in trials and 
      contribute to biomedical research.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The REMOTE clinical trial pilot is consistent with the mission of the 
      FDA&#8217;s Clinical Trials Transformation Initiative (CTTI) to improve the 
      quality and efficiency of clinical trials. Pfizer has been an active 
      participant in multiple CTTI projects.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Modernization of clinical trials is a key initiative of FDA. We commend 
      Pfizer&#8217;s progress on the REMOTE&#160;pilot and encourage all manufacturers 
      considering other novel ideas in advancing clinical trials to have 
      prospective discussions with the&#160;Agency regarding trial design and 
      oversight,"&#160;said Janet Woodcock, M.D., director, Center for Drug 
      Evaluation and Research at FDA. For more information about CTTI, visit www.trialstransformation.org.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This virtual method enables scientists to conduct trials more 
      efficiently. Additionally, as more people participate in trials 
      conveniently from home, the results of trials may apply to a broader 
      patient population,&#8221; said Dr. Steven Cummings, M.D., Emeritus Professor 
      of Medicine at the University of California San Francisco.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer has reviewed the study approach with the FDA and two 
      institutional review boards have approved the study. Physicians will 
      carefully monitor patient data and patient safety throughout the trial. 
      Patients will be able to interact with study physicians remotely 24 
      hours a day.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Forbes 
      Growth Investor,
				an online investment 
      newsletter focused on undervalued growth stocks, recommended four new 
      dividend stocks with strong price appreciation potential in the June 
      issue and published its updated outlook for Exxon Mobil Corporation 
      (XOM) and Jabil Circuit (JBL).
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Dividend Stocks:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In the June 2011 issue, Editor Taesik Yoon, CFA, discusses the 
      recent outperformance of dividend paying stocks, which he attributes to 
      the general perception among investors that dividend paying companies 
      tend to be less risky.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			This outperformance is clearly evident in his Income 
      Growth sub-portfolio, which has gained 21.7% since 
      the beginning of the year versus 7.0% for the SP 500 and nearly 33% 
      over the past six months.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8220;I think dividend paying stocks will continue to outperform for 
      the remainder of the year,&#8221; says Yoon.
			He also notes that 
      all four of the dividend stocks were selected based on their price 
      appreciation potential.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Using a proprietary quantitative-based fundamental and technical 
      model Forbes 
      Growth Investor, a publication owned by Steve 
      Forbes, has beaten the SP 500 since its inception in 2000. Since then FGI&#8217;s 
      BUY list
				has had a total return of 129.4% versus a 
      loss of 5.5% for the SP 500 during the same period.
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			In the June issue, Forbes Growth Investor also 
      provides detailed coverage of:

			Exxon Mobil (XOM)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Despite Exxon Mobil (XOM) declining 5.1% in May on falling

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Jabil Circuit (JBL)
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Jabil Circuit (JBL) is the rare technology company that 
      pays a steady dividend.
			It trades at a low valuation on a

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, June 7 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) on
Tuesday said a storage tank fire at its 344,500 barrel-per-day

department was notified about the fire around noon, but Exxon
was handling it, KIII-TV, a south Texas television station said

      Communications (CJP), a full-service public relations and financial 
      communications consultancy, has been named one of the 10 
      Great Entrepreneurial Places to Work in the New York tri-state area. 
      The designation was awarded by the New 
      York Enterprise Report, a leading magazine for small and 
      mid-sized business owners in the New York metro area.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Report highlighted CJP&#8217;s innovative &#8220;Army 
      of Entrepreneurs&#8482;&#8221; business model, which was the subject of a 2011 
      book of the same name by Jennifer Prosek, the firm&#8217;s founder and CEO. 
      CJP&#8217;s flat management structure and focus on developing an &#8220;owner&#8217;s 
      mindset&#8221; for all employees were also cited as reasons for the firm&#8217;s 
      inclusion in the list.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, Prosek will be a panelist at the publication&#8217;s upcoming 
      event, Beyond 
      Motivation: Ignite Your Employees and Watch Profits Grow.&#8221; This 
      unique event offers four successful business owners&#8217; real-world 
      strategies to help other business owners motivate and retain employees 
      in order to increase their bottom line. The event takes place on June 22 
      (8:00-10:30 a.m.) and interested parties can register 
      online for tickets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further showcased by the Report was CJP&#8217;s &#8220;Commission for Life&#8482;&#8221; 
      program. This initiative encourages new business development by 
      providing financial&#160;rewards to employees at all levels who contribute to 
      the&#160;growth of the firm.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The impact of CJP&#8217;s &#8216;Army of Entrepreneurs&#8217; model on the success of our 
      business cannot be overstated. Our employees &#8211; from senior management to 
      junior staffers &#8211; are actively involved in our new business leads, 
      recruiting efforts and company decisions,&#8221; said Prosek. &#8220;We&#8217;re delighted 
      to be recognized by the Report and the business community of New 
      York for the entrepreneurial culture we&#8217;ve worked so hard to create.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In early 2011, Prosek published Army of Entrepreneurs: A Breakthrough 
      Strategy to Grow Your Business (AMACOM, 2011), a book on the firm&#8217;s 
      unique business model to share insights and learnings with other 
      business owners. Entrepreneurs interested in deploying their own army

world's largest publicly traded oil company, plans to move its
workers in Houston to a new campus under construction about 25
miles north of the city.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Workers from Exxon's exploration and production unit and

occupancy expected by 2015, the company said in a statement on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's offices are currently scattered around Houston. The
new complex will have low-rise office buildings, training and
conference centers and laboratories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It will be large enough for 8,000 workers and can be
expanded, a company spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Employees from other locations may eventually be moved to
the Houston campus after studies are completed, Exxon said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's corporate headquarters are located in Irving,
Texas, and workers for the company's refining unit are in
Fairfax, Virginia. It also has employees in Fort Worth and New
Jersey.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon, which has more than 80,000 workers
worldwide, were up 0.6 percent to $80.76 in afternoon trading
on the New York Stock Exchange.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Planview&#174; today announced that Planview Enterprise&#174;, its market-leading 
      project portfolio management (PPM) application, now integrates directly 
      with IBM&#174; Rational Team Concert&#174;. Planview&#8217;s PPM integration solution

		&lt;p&gt;
      Planview&#8217;s connectivity has been validated as &#8216;Ready for Rational 
      Software,&#8217; which means Planview&#8217;s PPM enterprise solutions are 
      positioned to integrate approved projects with Rational Team Concert&#8217;s

      William Chilton FAIA, RIBA. &#8220;It is always rewarding to work with clients 
      that appreciate and value the impact that quality architecture can have

      process, we maintained the mindset of inspiring greatness - creating an 
      open and welcoming environment for the employees to enjoy within this 
      beautiful site."
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  REDWOOD SHORES, CA, Jun 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL)

    News Facts


--  Continuing to deliver hardware and software engineered to optimize
    performance and efficiency, Oracle today announced a new TPC-H 1TB
    benchmark, which showcases the superior scalability of Oracle(R)
    Database 11g Release 2 running on Oracle's SPARC Enterprise M8000
    server(1).
--  Today's result demonstrates Oracle's exceptional SPARC performance
    versus comparative platforms HP Superdome 2 and IBM Power 780(2,3).
--  Part of Oracle's SPARC server family, the SPARC Enterprise M8000
    server continues to deliver increased performance, unmatched
    reliability, availability and serviceability (RAS), and extensive
    expansion and virtualization capabilities.

    

Benchmark Details


--  The SPARC Enterprise M8000 server configured with SPARC64 VII+
    processors, Oracle's Sun Storage F5100 Flash arrays, Oracle Solaris --
    the #1 enterprise operating system -- and Oracle Database 11g Release
    2 achieved a TPC-H performance result of 209,533 QphH@1000GB with a
    price/performance of $10.13/QphH@1000GB.
--  The Sun Storage F5100 Flash Arrays used in this benchmark delivered
    measured I/O performance of over 16 GB/sec. They continue to provide
    world record performance(4) in a compact 1RU form factor that enables
    reduced power consumption and helps free up valuable data center floor
    space.
--  This result demonstrates that Oracle Database 11g Release 2 ran nearly
    50 percent faster on the SPARC Enterprise M8000 server than on the HP
    Superdome 2, while delivering 16 percent better price performance(2).
--  Additionally, Oracle's solution ran 27 percent faster than IBM's Power
    780-based configuration running Sybase IQ database, while executing
    refresh functions up to 3.8 times faster(1,3). Refresh functions
    insert or remove large amounts of data from the database and deliver
    better performance when running database software on a system with
    well-balanced I/O resources.
--  A recent study also demonstrates that Oracle's focus to deliver
    hardware and software engineered together provides better customer
    value than IBM in terms of real-world performance and lower TCO(5).
--  The benchmark underscores the ability of SPARC Enterprise M-series
    servers, running Oracle Solaris, to handle the increasingly large
    databases required for decision support and data warehousing systems.
    Neither IBM nor HP matched this level of performance in the 1TB scale
    factor category using a single system, further highlighting the
    performance capabilities of multi-processor SPARC systems and
    flash-based storage for the most demanding enterprise applications.

    

Supporting Quote


--  "Today's outstanding TPC-H result is another proof point to the
    excellent performance of Oracle Database 11g Release 2 running on
    Oracle Sparc Enterprise M8000," said Juan Loaiza, Senior Vice
    President, Systems Technology, Oracle. "Oracle running on Sun hardware
    continues to demonstrate much better performance than comparable
    offerings from IBM or HP."

			Sanuk in Downtown Disney&#174; Goes Live with New POS/Retail System by JDS 
      Solutions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JDS 
      Solutions (http://www.jdssc.com), 
      a premier provider of retail management software, today announced that 
      the new Sanuk footware store in Downtown Disney&#174; just went 'live' with 
      its Point of Sale/Retail Management System.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sanuk&#8217;s new flagship location will offer the largest selection of 
      products available outside of the company&#8217;s online store, including 
      flip-flops, surf sandals and other innovative beach footwear, such as 
      their signature yoga mat flip-flops. "We selected JDS Solutions because 
      we're located in a premier location in Downtown Disney&#174; and we have to 
      be at the top of our game," said Jessica Franks,&#160;Operations Manager.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Sanuk products have been twice recognized at the SIMA Image Awards as 
      the 2007 and 2010 Footwear Product of the Year. The brand is best known 
      for its Sidewalk Surfers (often referred to as &#8220;Not-A-Shoes&#8221; for their 
      patented sandal construction which allows the feet to bend and flex in 
      natural comfort). Sanuk also leads its industry by using innovative 
      materials in its footwear such as yoga mat and indoor-outdoor carpet.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JDS Solutions and Sanuk are a perfect fit. &#8220;Shoe stores need to maintain 
      constant insight into their inventory to satisfy a demanding 
      marketplace,&#8221; said Dan Friedman, Founder and President of JDS Solutions. 
      &#8220;Timely access to inventory reports is critical for store managers to 
      access what's selling, what's hot and what's not, and all by style, 
      color, size and width,&#8221; added Friedman.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JDS' Retail Management System, WinRetail, 
      provides shoe apparel managers with a true four grid system that is 
      backed by PowerReporter&#174;, the most advanced drop and drag reporting tool 
      in the retail industry. Store managers now have timely access to 
      trending information about their business. JDS takes the guess work out 
      of buying decisions by giving merchants more accurate and critical 
      information resulting in greater profit margins.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sanuk, founded by Southern California native Jeff Kelley, 
      provides creatively inspired yet distinctively designed footwear 
      products for the global outdoor community. Taking its name from the Thai 
      word for fun, Sanuk strives to make innovative products that are as much 
      about funk as they are about function.

      best-of-breed software solutions for mid-size retailers, from

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. corporate profits are poised to overtake the pre-recession record of 2007, but the rate of growth could tail off as margins compress in 2012, Goldman Sachs' chief U.S. equity strategist said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the Reuters 2011 Investment Outlook Summit in New York, Goldman's David Kostin said the firm continues to see the SP 500 index .SPX ending 2011 at 1,450 points. He cut his forecast from 1,500 on May 27.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest risk to that forecast is "a more significant slowdown in the U.S. economy or higher raw material prices than we are currently forecasting," Kostin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The benchmark stock index fell to 1,290 points on Monday, its lowest in more than two months, extending a five-week decline on worries about a slowing economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fears of weakening global economic growth reflect persistent headwinds: Europe's sovereign debt troubles, the tsunami in Japan, and in the United States, falling home prices, high jobless rates and rising energy and food prices that have sapped spending power.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors and economists' deep concerns also center on crucial policy decisions that will help determine the nation's economic health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of immediate issue is the end of the Federal Reserve's $600 billion asset-purchase program at the end of June, which has been one of the economy's major supports. As policymakers gradually rein in stimulus measures, investors fear the world's economies are still too weak to thrive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kostin said economic conditions, while not a barn-burner, do not warrant fresh Fed stimulus. "There is economic growth, with a lack of deflation risk," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs assumes U.S. GDP growth for 2011 at 2.6 percent, rising to 3.2 percent in 2012, and Brent crude oil prices ending the year at $120 per barrel, rising to $140 by the end of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Against that backdrop, the investment bank currently favors large-capitalization stocks over small-cap, although the strategy has not paid off so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kostin said consumer staple stocks could outperform for now and that many such firms are having success passing higher materials costs onto their users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Energy stocks also look promising. With oil prices high, "a little bit of profitability from every business" is siphoned off into windfall profits for energy companies, Kostin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's out of favor? "We're more neutral on some of the cyclical sectors," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kostin replaced Abby Joseph Cohen in 2008 as Goldman's chief forecaster of the U.S. stock market. He spent 17 years as a research analyst on Wall Street focusing on the real estate industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In making his market calls, Kostin draws in part from his background in applied mathematics, in which he earned a degree from Brown University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm a big believer in data," he said. "We try to keep our hands on as many micro data points as we can."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SP 500 earnings per share are poised to climb back this year above the previous peak of $91 from 2007, Kostin said. EPS should rise to 14 percent to $96 in 2011 from $84 in 2010, and advance another 8 percent in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among institutional investors, a big debate at the moment is around margins and whether they can continue to rise, Kostin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, Goldman Sachs says they won't. It predicts that margins will peak in 2011 and decline slightly next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kostin noted the Institute for Supply Management's closely-watched manufacturing index peaked in February, at 61.4, and is now barely holding in expansion mode, above 50. It was 53.5 for May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"History suggests that about one year after the ISM peaks, margins peak," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also on the minds of major investors is the ongoing debate over the U.S. debt ceiling and whether, and how, the U.S. budget deficit will be reduced.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"People are still hopeful of a resolution," said Kostin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Padraic Cassidy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  CAMPBELL, CA, Jun 07 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Cenzic Inc., the leading provider of Web application security assessment
and risk management solutions, today announced the release of its
ClickToSecure Cloud for the Windows Azure platform. This industry-praised
solution puts Web application security within reach of all Windows Azure
users, allowing them to test their websites for vulnerabilities and
conduct quick assessments entirely in the cloud.

    "Cenzic's ClickToSecure Cloud solution is a welcome addition to the
solutions available on the Windows Azure platform," said Prashant Ketkar,
Director of Product Marketing, Microsoft. "Web application security is an
important initiative for businesses. By making ClickToSecure Cloud
available for Windows Azure users, Cenzic is addressing Web application
security issues." 

    Windows Azure provides on-demand compute, storage, networking and content
delivery capabilities to host, scale and manage Web applications on the
Internet through Microsoft data centers. Windows Azure serves as the
development, service hosting and service management environment for the
Windows Azure platform. 

    "Web application security and compliance are critical initiatives for
many companies," said Wendy Nather, Senior Security Analyst at The 451
Group. "These issues are just as important in the cloud, particularly
when companies are using it for the first time. ClickToSecure Cloud for
the Windows Azure platform is one example of a tool to help with the
basics that might otherwise be overlooked in the rush to this new,
disruptive technology."

    With ClickToSecure Cloud, Windows Azure users have the ability to select
different types of Web application vulnerability options that will detect
"holes" or vulnerabilities in their website -- from a standard
"HealthCheck" to one that provides PCI 6.6 assurance. The offering is a
fast, cost-effective way to improve website security posture without
having to become a security expert. In May, the American Business Awards
named the solution a finalist for product of the year.

    "We are honored to bring ClickToSecure Cloud to the Microsoft Azure
platform," said John Weinschenk, president and CEO at Cenzic. "Web
security is a huge problem right now. Sony, Twitter, Facebook, and
hundreds of other sites are being hacked on a regular basis. Implementing
Web application security can be a daunting task for any business because
of the complexity of new threats, rules, and regulations that permeate
the industry. ClickToSecure Cloud was designed to take the guesswork
around these issues out of the equation, allowing businesses with zero
Web security expertise to ensure their websites are both protected from
hackers and compliant with industry regulations such as PCI 6.6."

Microsoft Azure, please visit: http://www.cenzic.com/resellers/azure. You

			Ceridian Joins Forces with Microsoft to Provide Health Insurance 
      Exchange Solutions
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Ceridian 
      Corporation, a leading provider of human 
      resource, benefits 
      administration, workforce 
      management, payroll 
      and health 
      insurance exchange solutions, announced today it has signed a letter 
      of intent with Microsoft to collaborate on providing small business 
      exchange solutions. The joint effort will involve a variety of health 
      insurance exchange marketing and selling efforts to governmental 
      entities within the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This agreement means Ceridian and Microsoft will be bringing to market 
      one of the most robust health insurance exchange solutions in the 
      industry,&#8221; explained John F. Hunter, president, Ceridian Exchange 
      Services. &#8220;Ceridian has industry-recognized experience and expertise in 
      the benefits marketplace, most recently demonstrated by Ceridian being 
      chosen the administrator of the Florida Health Choices small business 
      marketplace. We have award-winning customer service and payment 
      processing capabilities, and proven expertise in compliance and benefits 
      administration.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Ceridian has been a time tested Microsoft partner across multiple 
      implementations, and this relationship ensures that states will be 
      working with proven, reliable and dynamic technology experts,&#8221; added 
      Brian Russon, national practice leader for Health Insurance Exchange, 
      Microsoft. &#8220;Ceridian&#8217;s ability to adapt to the variances of specific 
      business needs will be pivotal as state governments build and define 
      their health exchange needs.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In October 2010, Ceridian was awarded the administration contract for 
      the Florida Health Choices (FHC) small business insurance marketplace. 
      For the FHC project, Ceridian will provide a full-range of 
      administrative services needed to connect small businesses and employees 
      through a web portal to evaluate and purchase insurance options that 
      best meet their needs. Those services involve online eligibility and 
      enrollment functions, payment processing, customer call centers, 
      educational and community outreach programs, and decision-support tools 
      to help employers and employees make informed health plan choices. The 
      FHC platform is enabled by Microsoft technologies including Microsoft 
      BizTalk Server, Microsoft SQL Server and the Microsoft .Net Framework to 
      create a flexible feature-rich solution for current and future needs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ceridian will continue with and expand the use of Microsoft technologies 
      for future exchange opportunities as their technology is scalable and 
      adaptable to a diverse technology landscape. For the health insurance 
      exchange collaboration, Microsoft will be providing technology and state 
      government expertise, while Ceridian will be providing Microsoft with 
      valuable health insurance exchange administrative knowledge and 
      experience.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      When properly designed and implemented, health insurance exchanges can 
      have a profound, positive and beneficial impact on businesses of all 
      types and sizes. When states provide businesses with tangible relief 
      from the high costs and administrative burdens of providing health care 
      coverage, they create a more positive economic environment in which 
      employers, employees and the states all win.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Combined, Ceridian and Microsoft will market and sell an exchange 
      application and/or platform to governmental entities across the United 
      States.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      papers detailing the latest legislative updates to health care reform as 
      well as the core components of what state exchanges should include,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A partnership between a biofuels company and Procter  Gamble (PG) could lead to more sustainable chemicals and the most effective refining process for cellulosic ethanol to date. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ZeaChem,  which is developing a process to make biofuels, signed a multi-year joint development agreement with Procter  Gamble, which wants to replace petroleum-based ingredients with bio-chemicals to make its products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Colorado-based ZeaChem is working on a process that could produce the highest yields and lowest carbon emissions of any known biorefining technology. The process turns renewable feedstocks such as poplar trees and agricultural residues into fuel.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new biorefining process builds on ZeaChem's earlier C2 process for cellulosic ethanol, which the company scaled up for DOE-supported demonstration in Oregon. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The process will allow ZeaChem to produce a range of biofuels and chemicals that can replace petroleum-based chemicals in PG products. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ZeaChem uses naturally occring bacteria, called an acetogen, to process sugars. Acetogens are highly robust and, unlike yeast, produce no carbon dioxide during the fermentation process.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; PG is following the example of major competitor Unilever (NYSE: UN), which invested in algae-to-biofuel company Solazyme for the purpose of developing renewably-sourced oils and chemicals. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The companies will use ZeaChem's existing lab in Menlo Park, CA, pilot facility at Hazen Research in Golden, CO, and demonstration-scale biorefinery in Boardman, OR. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Valero Energy Corp (NYSE: VLO), the largest petroleum refiner in the US, is among ZeaChem's investors. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo by polandeze/flickr/Creative Commons&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reprinted with permission from Sustainable Business&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc has agreed to suspend U.S. sales of a popular poultry drug after a study found the drug increased levels of a carcinogen in chickens, U.S. health officials said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A study from the Food and Drug Administration found that chickens treated with Pfizer's 3-Nitro drug had higher levels of inorganic arsenic, a known cancer-causing substance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The levels we detected were very low, but the fact that they represent an added source of human exposure to a carcinogen, and a source that's avoidable, led the FDA to take action," Bill Flynn, deputy director for science policy at FDA's Center for Veterinary Medicine, told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Arsenic is an odorless and tasteless element that occurs naturally in water, air, soil and food and comes in two types. Organic arsenic, which is present in 3-Nitro, is thought to be harmless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But recent scientific reports have indicated that organic arsenic could transform into inorganic arsenic, a known human carcinogen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following up on the reports, FDA scientists detected higher levels of inorganic arsenic in the livers of chickens treated with 3-Nitro compared to the livers of chickens not treated with the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the levels detected were low, and the FDA said eating chickens treated with 3-Nitro did not pose a health risk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The National Chicken Council, which represents companies that produce more than 95 percent of the chicken sold in the United States, urged consumers to "continue to buy and eat chicken as they always have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The amount of inorganic arsenic found in the chicken livers is equivalent to the amount in an eight-ounce glass of drinking water, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's right in line with other normal, natural occurrences&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;of inorganic arsenic," said Scott Brown, senior director of metabolism and safety at Pfizer Animal Health. "But it's an avoidable exposure, so we're doing the prudent thing by suspending sales while we examine the study in more detail."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3-Nitro, or roxarsone, is produced by Alpharma, a subsidiary of Pfizer, and has been used by poultry producers since the 1940s as a feed medicine to help control coccidiosis, an intestinal parasitic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpharma said it would suspend U.S. sales of 3-Nitro 30 days from today in order to give animal producers time to switch to other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;3-Nitro's biggest market is in the United States, the FDA said, but it is also used in poultry in other countries, including Canada, Mexico and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Israel-based Teva, the world's largest generic drugmaker, and Bulgarian private drug company Huvepharma are among other companies that make drugs to treat coccidiosis, the most common type of infection in poultry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alpharma also produces the only other feed medicine that contains arsenic, nitarsone, marketed in the United States, though the FDA said it is less widely used than roxarsone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Yukhananov; Editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds details on drug, company and industry reaction)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, June 8 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) has
agreed to suspend U.S. sales of a popular poultry drug after a

subsidiary of Pfizer, and has been used by poultry producers
since the 1940s as a feed medicine to help control coccidiosis,
an intestinal parasitic disease.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alpharma said it would suspend U.S. sales of 3-Nitro 30
days from today in order to give animal producers time to
switch to other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 3-Nitro's biggest market is in the United States, the FDA
said, but it is also used in poultry in other countries,
including Canada, Mexico and Australia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Israel-based Teva TEVA.O, the world's largest generic
drugmaker, and Bulgarian private drug company Huvepharma are
among other companies that make drugs to treat coccidiosis, the
most common type of infection in poultry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Alpharma also produces the only other feed medicine that
contains arsenic, nitarsone, marketed in the United States,
though the FDA said it is less widely used than roxarsone.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) has made two big new oil discoveries and a natural gas find in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, news that underscores the importance of the prolific basin to U.S. crude output.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oil and gas exploration in the Gulf was halted by the U.S. government last year after the blowout at BP Plc's (BP.L) (BP.N) Macondo well, and activity in the Gulf remains at levels far below those seen before the oil spill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon estimated the new wells could produce about 700 million barrels of oil equivalent (BOE).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Seven hundred million barrels doesn't happen very often," John White, an analyst at Houston-based Triple Double Advisors in Houston, said. "That's a lot of oil."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The lower tertiary geological formation which stretches across the deepwater Gulf, is thought to hold as much 15 billion barrels of oil. Recent large discoveries there include BP Plc's (BP.L) Kaskida, estimated to hold 3 billion barrels of oil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Irving, Texas-based Exxon had reserves of 24.8 billion barrels oil equivalent at the end of last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares were up 1 percent in afternoon trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The discoveries are the company's first in the Gulf since the government moratorium was lifted. The Irving, Texas, company was on the verge of drilling its Hadrian prospect when the government suspended deepwater activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(The discovery) speaks to the fact there are resources in the Gulf and if we have a tax and regulatory environment that will encourage us to find and produce our own domestic oil, the industry will respond," said Mark Routt, an energy industry consultant with KBC Advanced Technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has not finished its development plan yet, and more drilling will be needed to further appraise how much oil is in the reservoir. Production could be years away.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The wells are located in the Keathley Canyon at a water depth of about 7,000 feet, 250 miles southwest of New Orleans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other operators in Keathley Canyon include Anadarko Petroleum Corp (APC.N) and Chevron Corp (CVX.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, Noble Energy Inc (NBL.N) said it had made an oil discovery at its Santiago prospect in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Noble was the first company to receive a drilling permit from U.S. regulators after the drilling halt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon owns a 50 percent interest in the three new wells, which are part-owned by Eni Petroleum U.S., part of Italy's Eni SpA (ENI.MI), and Brazil's Petrobras (PETR4.SA).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon shares were up 83 cents at $80.83 in afternoon on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Syracuse University, JPMorgan Chase Partner to Establish National 
      Institute for Veterans and Military Families
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Institute is first of its kind in higher education
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Syracuse University and JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today 
      the creation of the Institute for Veterans and Military Families. The 
      Institute is the first of its kind and will serve as a national center 
      in higher education focused on the social, economic, education and 
      policy issues impacting veterans and their families post-service.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Through the pillars of educational programming, employment and 
      actionable research, the institute will provide in-depth analysis of the 
      challenges facing the veteran community, capture best practices and 
      serve as a forum to facilitate new partnerships and strong relationships 
      between the individuals and organizations committed to making a 
      difference for veterans and military families.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase has made an initial commitment of $7.5 million over the 
      next five years to support the launch and subsequent growth of the 
      Institute and its programs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We owe our nation&#8217;s veterans more than gratitude &#8211; we owe them the 
      opportunity to lead successful lives following their service,&#8221; said 
      Frank Bisignano, JPMorgan Chase chief administrative officer who is also 
      responsible for the firm&#8217;s Home Lending business. &#8220;We think the 
      Institute for Veterans and Military Families will help bring together 
      some of our country&#8217;s best minds to help veterans and their families in 
      their post-service lives.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The issues and challenges faced by this generation of veterans will be 
      part of public discourse for decades to come, and the Institute for 
      Veterans and Military Families at Syracuse University will serve as a 
      leading voice in that conversation in a way that extends the long and 
      proud history of Syracuse&#8217;s support for those who have served the 
      country in uniform,&#8221; said Mike Haynie, SU&#8217;s Barnes Professor of 
      Entrepreneurship at the Whitman School of Management and the founding 
      director of the Institute.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The creation of the Institute builds upon the successful and 
      groundbreaking technology collaboration launched by SU and JPMorgan 
      Chase in 2007. More recently, in February 2011 JPMorgan Chase and SU 
      announced the launch of a new online Technology Certificate for post 
      9/11 veterans who are pursuing a career in technology. The tuition-free 
      program is scheduled to begin in fall 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Universities can play a critical role in forging cross-sector 
      partnerships to support our veterans and their families,&#8221; said SU 
      Chancellor and President Nancy Cantor. &#8220;SU has a proud legacy of 
      national leadership in serving our veterans, reaching back to the wake 
      of World War II. Today we&#8217;re leading the way once again with our partner 
      JPMorgan Chase to create this first-of-its-kind institute in American 
      higher education. In today&#8217;s global knowledge economy, it&#8217;s critical for 
      higher education to help empower returning veterans to leverage their 
      talents and not only prosper, but spur economic opportunity with their 
      entrepreneurial spirit.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Syracuse University has a long tradition of educating military veterans 
      that includes tailored academic programs for veterans, the Yellow Ribbon 
      Education Enhancement Program and an on-campus Veterans Resource Center. 
      Additionally, the Entrepreneurship Bootcamp for Veterans with 
      Disabilities (EBV) is a groundbreaking and nationally recognized program 
      founded at SU&#8217;s Whitman School of Management in 2007 that trains 
      veterans in entrepreneurship and small business. The EBV and its 
      innovative approach to transitioning veterans from military to civilian 
      life has been named a national &#8220;Best Practice&#8221; for serving soldiers and 
      their families by the Secretary of the Army, and one of the &#8220;10 Best&#8221; 
      entrepreneurship training programs in the U.S. by the editors of Inc. 
      magazine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Support of the Institute for Veterans and Military Families is 
      demonstrative of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s long-standing commitment to the 
      military and veteran community. It is a key part of a comprehensive, 
      firm-wide strategy to understand and address the unique needs of 
      servicemembers, veterans and their families, including specific programs 
      in the areas of homes, employment and education.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We will look to the Institute to conduct actionable research into all 
      aspects of a veteran&#8217;s transition from the military to post service 
      life,&#8221; said Tom Higgins, head of Military and Veterans Affairs at 
      JPMorgan Chase. &#8220;Addressing the issues facing military families requires 
      us to understand all of the variables involved. Success will also 
      require partnership and collective action by leaders from industry, 
      government, education, and non-governmental organizations &#8211; and veterans 
      themselves.&#8221;

			Boston&#8217;s Top Academic Medical Centers Join Pfizer&#8217;s Centers For 
      Therapeutic Innovation
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Eight Institutions To Collaborate with Pfizer on Medicine 
      Development
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. today announced its network of translational research 
      partnerships, called the Centers for Therapeutic Innovation, has 
      launched in Boston with Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston 
      University School of Medicine, Children&#8217;s Hospital Boston, Harvard 
      University, Partners HealthCare, Tufts Medical Center, Tufts University, 
      as well as University of Massachusetts Medical School in Worcester. 
      These organizations follow on previously announced partnerships with 
      academic medical institutions in California and New York City.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additionally, Pfizer announced that it has signed a lease for laboratory 
      space at the Center for Life Science in the Longwood Medical Area, where 
      it will co-locate with its academic medical center partners. Pfizer will 
      develop the space inside the Center for Life Science Boston, which is 
      surrounded by top-tier life science research institutions. This space 
      will serve as the world headquarters of Pfizer&#8217;s Centers for Therapeutic 
      Innovation, complementing existing offices in Cambridge, Mass.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are thrilled that Pfizer has chosen Boston as the location for its 
      newest Center for Therapeutic Innovation -- which will also serve as the 
      program&#8217;s world headquarters,&#8221; said Mass. Governor Deval Patrick. 
      &#8220;Pfizer&#8217;s decision to increase its investments in Massachusetts is 
      further confirmation of the kind of world-class expertise our state can 
      offer the life sciences industry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer has chosen the perfect location for its new Center for 
      Therapeutic Innovation. Boston is leading the life sciences revolution 
      because of the collaboration that happens between our prestigious 
      medical, academic and research institutions,&#8221; Boston Mayor Thomas M. 
      Menino said. &#8220;The City is committed to supporting this industry because 
      of the critical role drug discovery plays in our society. We couldn&#8217;t be 
      happier that Pfizer is further expanding its presence in Massachusetts 
      to tap into all that Longwood Medical area has to offer.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Centers for Therapeutic Innovation is a network of partnerships 
      between Pfizer and academic medical centers that aims to accelerate and 
      transform drug discovery and development,&#8221; said Jose Carlos 
      Gutierrez-Ramos, Ph.D, senior vice president and head of BioTherapeutics 
      Research and Development for Pfizer. &#8220;These partnerships allow leading 
      medical and clinical experts to join with Pfizer&#8217;s highly-skilled 
      scientists and advanced drug development capabilities to speed the 
      translation of innovative science into medicines for patients. Our 
      ultimate goal is to bridge the gap between scientific discovery and the 
      delivery of promising candidates to the pipeline.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Academic medical centers play an integral role in the early discovery 
      process that leads to drug development,&#8221; said Eric Buehrens, Interim 
      president and chief executive officer of Boston&#8217;s Beth Israel Deaconess 
      Medical Center (BIDMC). &#8220;But moving these discoveries from the 
      laboratory into the clinic has proven to be exceptionally challenging 
      and costly. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re so pleased to be part of this unique 
      collaboration with Pfizer. Through the Centers for Therapeutic 
      Innovation, scientists at BIDMC and throughout Boston will be able to 
      see their research translated into potential therapies that can make a 
      difference to the lives of patients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer anticipates investing approximately $100 million in the Boston 
      Centers for Therapeutic Innovation over the next five years. This sum is 
      a total of the estimated support for research programs, potential 
      milestone payments to partners for successful projects, and the cost to 
      lease and operate the planned site in the Longwood Medical Area.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We believe the Centers for Therapeutic Innovation are an 
      industry-leading model of collaboration and innovation,&#8221; said Anthony 
      Coyle, Ph.D., vice president - Pfizer Centers for Therapeutic 
      Innovation. &#8220;Boston, with its wealth of scientific and medical 
      expertise, is well-suited to serve as headquarters for CTI. We are 
      excited to work with these outstanding academic medical institutions 
      with the objective of developing the next generation of medicines.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;Exxon, the largest U.S. refiner, had asked federal Judge David Hitner to throw out the lawsuit because the Baytown refinery is already subject to federal Clean Air Act enforcement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Sierra Club and Environment Texas brought the lawsuit in December under a provision of the Clean Air Act that allows private individuals to seek enforcement of federal pollution standards when the federal agency fails to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Congress specifically allowed for citizen enforcement suits because sometimes government agencies fall down on the job, and this case is a perfect example of that," said Luke Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing notices filed by Exxon with state and federal regulators, the groups said the Baytown refinery and adjoining chemical plant have released more than 8 million pounds (3.6million kilograms) of pollutants in the last five years beyond the levels permitted under the Clean Air Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon spokesman said the company would continue to defend itself in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The court's decision is not a comment on the merits of the suit," said Exxon's Kevin Allexon. "Over the last five years the Baytown refinery and chemical plant has produced total annual emissions that are nearly 40 percent below the federal permit limits set by EPA."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No date has been set for a trial of the suit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A similar lawsuit in 2008 against Royal Dutch Shell Plc for pollution at its joint-venture refinery in Deer Park, Texas, resulted in a settlement in which Shell agreed to further cut emissions and pay $5.8 million for pollution control programs in Houston area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Exxon Baytown refinery has refining capacity of 560,640 barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Erwin Seba; Editing by Marguerita Choy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Sierra Club seeks enforcement of federal pollution rules&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon says judge's ruling not comment on case's merits&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, June 8 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Tuesday said
two environmental groups' could sue for enforcement of federal
pollution standards at Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N) Baytown,
Texas, refinery, the nation's largest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon, the largest U.S. refiner, had asked federal Judge
David Hitner to throw out the lawsuit because the Baytown
refinery is already subject to federal Clean Air Act
enforcement by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Sierra Club and Environment Texas brought the lawsuit
in December under a provision of the Clean Air Act that allows
private individuals to seek enforcement of federal pollution
standards when the federal agency fails to do so.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Congress specifically allowed for citizen enforcement
suits because sometimes government agencies fall down on the
job, and this case is a perfect example of that," said Luke
Metzger, executive director of Environment Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citing notices filed by Exxon with state and federal
regulators, the groups said the Baytown refinery and adjoining
chemical plant have released more than 8 million pounds (3.6million kilograms) of pollutants in the last five years beyond
the levels permitted under the Clean Air Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokesman said the company would continue to
defend itself in court.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The court's decision is not a comment on the merits of the

(RDSa.L) for pollution at its joint-venture refinery in Deer
Park, Texas, resulted in a settlement in which Shell agreed to
further cut emissions and pay $5.8 million for pollution
control programs in Houston area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Exxon Baytown refinery has refining capacity of 560,640
barrels per day.

      As The Coca-Cola Company celebrates 125 years of sharing happiness 
      throughout 2011, its philanthropic arm continues the Company&#8217;s heritage 
      of giving back to the communities where it does business. During the

      delivered more than 28 truckloads of bottles and cans of water, juice, 
      sports drinks and sparkling beverages to residents and relief 
      organizations, in addition to assisting with community rebuilding 
      efforts.

      Research and Markets: 2011 Report on the US Investment Banking Industry 
      Featuring Companies such as Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/430abc/investment_banking) 
      has announced the addition of the "Investment 
      Banking " report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US investment banking industry includes about 3,000 companies with 
      combined annual revenue of about $200 billion. Major companies include 
      Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Jefferies, and Lazard. Investment banking 
      is highly concentrated: the largest 50 firms generate about 90 percent 
      of industry revenue.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand is driven by economic activity that results in company mergers, 
      acquisitions, or public financing. The profitability of an investment 
      bank depends on its ability to accurately assess both the value of a 
      business transaction and the readiness of the market to buy the 
      attendant debt or equity. Big firms have an advantage because large 
      customer transactions require firms with substantial financial 
      resources. Small investment banks can compete by participating in 
      syndications and operating in regional markets or specialized 
      industries. Although labor-intensive, the industry produces very high 
      value: average annual revenue per employee at large firms is over $1 
      million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The global financial crisis of 2008-2009 dramatically altered the 
      landscape of the investment banking industry. Morgan Stanley and Goldman 
      Sachs, the only large firms still intact, have changed their status from 
      investment banks to bank-holding companies. Both firms still engage 
      primarily in investment banking, but former industry leaders such as 
      Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, and Lehman Brothers have either been 
      acquired or have filed for bankruptcy protection. The demise of these 
      firms and the late 2000s recession have likely ushered in a new era in 
      which the creation of innovative but risky financial...

      Research and Markets: 2011 Report on the $3 Trillion Finance and 
      Insurance Sector with Companies such as AIG, JPMorgan and Wells Fargo
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/64a91b/finance_and_insura) 
      has announced the addition of the "Finance 
      and Insurance Sector" report to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The US finance and insurance sector consists of more than 230,000 
      companies with combined annual revenues of more than $3 trillion. Major 
      firms include AIG, Bank of America, Citigroup, Fidelity, Goldman Sachs, 
      JPMorgan Chase, MetLife, and Wells Fargo. Other major companies in the 
      sector include credit card processing firm First Data Corporation, 
      brokerage firm Charles Schwab, investment services firm Value Line, and 
      REITs such as Simon Property Group. The sector is concentrated: the 
      largest 50 companies account for nearly 50 percent of sales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      COMPETITIVE LANDSCAPE
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Demand is driven by business activity, returns on investments, and 
      consumer income. The profitability of individual companies depends on 
      marketing, efficient operations, and investment expertise. Large 
      companies often have advantages in access to cheaper capital, 
      participation in large-scale transactions, and name recognition. Small 
      companies can compete effectively through customer service, knowledge of 
      the local market, and specialization. The industry is capital-intensive 
      and highly automated: annual revenue per employee varies due to the 
      number of industry groups but averages around $550,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The finance and insurance sector has undergone significant change in the 
      past decade, and more changes are likely. The traditional lines between 
      business segments within the finance and insurance sector were blurred 
      by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999 (GLB Act), which permitted 
      commercial banks to sell securities and insurance and enabled insurance 
      firms to sell financial products. Deregulation led to the creation of 
      gigantic financial services firms covering multiple industries and wide 
      geographical...

&lt;p&gt;KOENIGSTEIN, Germany, June 8 (Reuters) - Private creditors
must participate in resolving Greece's debt crisis, the head of
the German division of banking group JP Morgan said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Banks and creditors must participate," said Karl-Georg
Altenburg, JP Morgan's senior country officer for Germany,
adding that an extension of debt maturities would not suffice on
its own but must be part of a broader programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That appeared to differ from the line taken by Germany's
banking association BDB, whose head said on Tuesday that private
creditors should only be involved in a solution as a last resort
and that such a point had not been reached yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Kathrin Jones; writing by Annika Breidthardt)

&lt;p&gt;  PLEASANTON, CA, Jun 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Spigit, the leader in social innovation management software, today
announced the availability of SpigitEngage for SharePoint v1.1. This is
the first of three feature-rich cycle releases scheduled to hit over the
next nine months that provides Enterprise SharePoint users with a series
of additional features and functionality that extend the benefits of
SharePoint and inspire innovative productivity. With v1.1, Spigit
SharePoint customers have access to more flexible web parts and web page
customizations, greater visibility into community activity and ideas, and
a further enhanced user experience, allowing for increased community
engagement. 

    "Our goal is to create the most powerful, easy-to-use, native, social
innovation solution for SharePoint users globally," stated Jeff Spencer,
General Manager, Microsoft Business Unit, Spigit. "With this additional
set of features aimed at enhancing collaboration and uncovering
actionable, value-generating ideas, we are providing our customers with
an effective, end-to-end social innovation solution that is both scalable
and results-oriented."

    In addition to providing increased flexibility and increased community
engagement, SpigitEngage for SharePoint's site navigation has been
further developed to provide a more innovative-centric method for finding
and interacting with ideas. Users can more quickly and easily submit an
idea via the platform's enhanced "Idea Submission Form," and also benefit
from a new "Idea Statistics" feature that indicates pertinent idea
graduation thresholds that need to be crossed in order for an idea to
move to the next stage.

    "Spigit has created a simple, clean design that integrates seamlessly
into the SharePoint 2010 environment," stated Corey Glickman, Global RDV
Lead &amp; Innovation Management, Capgemini. "These additional features
further augment the product's ability to fuel productivity and generate
results, and delivers the next generation social experience for
SharePoint users across the Enterprise."

    By combining Spigit's engaging social tools, game mechanics, and
analytics with SharePoint's powerful content management and enterprise
search capabilities, SpigitEngage for SharePoint allows customers to
capture and select ideas sourced from their idea communities using
collaboration tools in SharePoint 2010. SpigitEngage for SharePoint v1.1
features are now available to customers world-wide.

&lt;p&gt; (Adds details, background)	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; By Nidhi Verma	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI Jun 8 (Reuters) - Indian state-run gas firm GAIL
(India) and explorer Oil and Natural Gas Corp
 are interested in buying part of ExxonMobil Corp's
 stake in Kazakhstan's Kashagan oil field, GAIL Chairman
B. C. Tripathi said on Wednesday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are interested. In all such ventures abroad we are happy
to work with OVL (ONGC Videsh Ltd)," Tripathi told Reuters, when
asked to comment on a news report that the two Indian firms are
eyeing part of Exxon's stake in the giant Kashagan oil field for
about $5 billion.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tripathi refused to elaborate further.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Hindustan Times newspaper on Wednesday reported that
ONGC Videsh Ltd -- the overseas investment arm of ONGC -- and
GAIL are planning to acquire an 8.4 percent stake from Exxon in
the Kashagan field.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The consortium led by ONGC Videsh has submitted a
"non-binding but firm indicative bid" to Exxon for half of its
16.81 percent stake in the Kashagan oil field, the report said,
citing documents related to the deal.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ExxonMobil has never publicly stated its intention to sell
any of its stake.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kashagan, one of the world's largest oil finds in more than
40 years, is being developed by Eni , Total ,
Shell (RDSa.L), ConocoPhillips , ExxonMobil ,
Inpex and Kazakh state firm KazMunaiGas .	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan said in January it would not approve plans for
development of the second phase of the Kashagan field because of
prohibitive costs. Commercial production from the first phase is
slated to start by the end of 2012. [ID:nLDE70U1E4]	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; India is the world's fourth-largest oil importer, importing
about 80 percent of its crude needs. It is scouting for oil and
gas assets abroad to meet demand in an economy growing around
8.5 percent, and to feed its expanding refining capacity.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, ONGC  acquired 25 percent of the Satpayev oil
block in Kazakhstan.[ID:nLDE73F06T] 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; India has been less successful than its energy-hungry
economic and political rival China in tapping the huge energy
riches of former Soviet Central Asia.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; About a quarter of Kazakhstan's oil production is
Chinese-owned.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan, Central Asia's largest and most successful
economy, covers an area five times the size of France and holds
about three percent of the world's recoverable oil reserves.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp suffered a defeat on Thursday when the Supreme Court upheld a record $290 million jury verdict against the software giant for infringing a small Canadian company's patent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The justices unanimously agreed with a U.S. appeals court ruling that went against the world's largest software company in its legal battle with Toronto-based i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high court refused to adopt Microsoft's lower standard to replace the long-standing requirement that a defendant in a patent infringement case prove by clear and convincing evidence that a plaintiff's patent is invalid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft had argued that a lower standard of proof involving a "preponderance of the evidence" would make some "bad" patents easier to invalidate while promoting innovation and competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote the opinion, said the court rejected Microsoft's contention that a defendant need only persuade a jury of a patent's invalidity by a preponderance of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Congress has prescribed the governing standard of proof, its choice generally controls, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration and i4i opposed Microsoft's position and said Congress had accepted the standard in effect for the past 28 years and the Supreme Court should uphold it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal battle began in 2007 when i4i sued Microsoft. A federal jury awarded $290 million to i4i after finding that Microsoft, in 2003 and 2007 versions of Word, its word processing application, had infringed i4i's patent relating to text manipulation software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court upheld the award, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office upheld the validity of the i4i patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft continued to dispute those decisions, but removed the contested features from its current software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In appealing to the Supreme Court, Microsoft said it wanted a new trial. But the justices ruled against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is not entirely over, however, since Microsoft also has a challenge to the patent pending at the patent office and may have to pay other potential licensing fees, said Michel Vulpe, i4i's founder and chief technology officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're very pleased that the court did the right thing," and that the decision was unanimous, Vulpe told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS CASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loudon Owen, i4i's chairman, said in a statement, "This is one of the most significant business cases the court has decided in decades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it is the largest patent infringement verdict ever affirmed on appeal. It has also said it had set aside money for the verdict, so it was not material to its earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the outcome is not what we had hoped for, we will continue to advocate for changes to the law that will prevent abuse of the patent system and protect inventors who hold patents representing true innovation," Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz said in an email statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max Grant, a patent law attorney at Latham  Watkins, said that by upholding the status quo "the Supreme Court wisely left alone a complex area of the law that balances many competing interests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's share price dipped when the decision was announced but quickly recovered and was little changed at $23.93 in afternoon trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sotomayor wrote that any decision to change the standard in patent infringement cases would have to come from Congress. She noted that the standard of clear and convincing evidence was almost 30 years old and had been left untouched during previous congressional patent system reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Inc, Yahoo Inc and trade groups such as the Computer  Communications Industry Association supported Microsoft, while Bayer AG, 3M Co and groups representing biotechnology companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers backed i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was decided by eight of the nine Supreme Court members. Chief Justice John Roberts, who owns Microsoft stock, recused himself from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case is Microsoft Corp v. i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc, No. 10-290.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Gerald E. McCormick, Ted Kerr and John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story has been modified to correct the headline to say Microsoft loses U.S. Supreme Court case on patent, removes Canadian reference)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's "Cars" is poised to become the company's largest film licensing property with the upcoming release of the franchise's second installment, a top executive said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Cars 2" debuts in U.S. theaters June 24. Merchandise began hitting stores globally in mid-May and is on track to beat retail sales from mega-hit "Toy Story 3," said Andy Mooney, head of Disney's consumer products division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Cars" products will be offered "in every conceivable category that will enable it be the largest licensee program in history," Mooney told reporters during a webcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Oscar-nominated "Toy Story 3" brought in more than $2.4 billion in retail sales in 2011, according to License! Global, a publication that tracks licensing deals. Disney gets a portion of retail merchandise sales, but does not disclose how much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Miller Tabak analyst David Joyce said it was realistic for "Cars" to top "Toy Story 3."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're still selling Cars 1 (merchandise) that leads into 2," Joyce said. The original "Cars" was released in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney partners are producing a plehtora of "Cars"-themed products from toys and clothing to food. Mattel Inc, for example, is selling more than 150 "Cars 2" toys, while Williams-Sonoma Inc is launching aprons and mini cake-baking pans. Other partners include Nestle Ltd and Kimberly-Clark Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company plans to promote "Cars 2" into 2012 with a 12-acre "Cars Land" at a California theme park and a short-form "Cars Toons" shown as previews to animated films in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The "Toy Story" and "Cars" franchises were created by Pixar, the animation studio Disney bought in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's consumer products division sells toys, clothing and other merchandise featuring characters from new films and classics such as Mickey Mouse.

&lt;p&gt; * Cars seen as biggest single-film licensing property&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Merchandise projected to top "Toy Story 3"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Disney shares up 0.4 percent&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Lisa Richwine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, June 9 (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N)
"Cars" is poised to become the company's largest film licensing
property with the upcoming release of the franchise's second
installment, a top executive said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cars 2" debuts in U.S. theaters June 24. Merchandise began
hitting stores globally in mid-May and is on track to beat
retail sales from mega-hit "Toy Story 3," said Andy Mooney,
head of Disney's consumer products division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Cars" products will be offered "in every conceivable
category that will enable it be the largest licensee program in
history," Mooney told reporters during a webcast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Oscar-nominated "Toy Story 3" brought in more than $2.4
billion in retail sales in 2011, according to License! Global,
a publication that tracks licensing deals. Disney gets a
portion of retail merchandise sales, but does not disclose how
much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Miller Tabak analyst David Joyce said it was realistic for
"Cars" to top "Toy Story 3."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They're still selling Cars 1 (merchandise) that leads into
2," Joyce said. The original "Cars" was released in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney partners are producing a plehtora of "Cars"-themed
products from toys and clothing to food. Mattel Inc (MAT.O),
for example, is selling more than 150 "Cars 2" toys, while
Williams-Sonoma Inc (WSM.N) is launching aprons and mini
cake-baking pans. Other partners include Nestle Ltd (NESN.VX)
and Kimberly-Clark Corp (KMB.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company plans to promote "Cars 2" into 2012 with a
12-acre "Cars Land" at a California theme park and a short-form
"Cars Toons" shown as previews to animated films in theaters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The "Toy Story" and "Cars" franchises were created by
Pixar, the animation studio Disney bought in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's consumer products division sells toys, clothing
and other merchandise featuring characters from new films and
classics such as Mickey Mouse. It accounts for more than 5
percent of annual revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Products with Mickey Mouse and related characters remain
popular, on track to generate $9 billion in global retail sales
in fiscal 2011, Mooney also said. Mickey Mouse is the world's
largest licensed character, Disney said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney shares rose 0.4 percent to close at $39.37 on the
New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;The accord with Massachusetts' securities regulator resolves charges that Goldman analysts gave "priority" clients, including hedge funds that trade rapidly, short-term trading tips that might be at odds with the bank's published research, violating state law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The real issue is fairness in the marketplace," William Galvin, Massachusetts' Secretary of the Commonwealth, said in an interview.

&lt;p&gt; * Record $290 million jury verdict at issue&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft sought to make it easier to challenge patents&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Obama administration supported small Canadian firm i4i
 (Recasts first paragraph, adds more reaction from i4i and
expert)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By James Vicini&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, June 9 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
suffered a defeat on Thursday when the U.S. Supreme Court
upheld a record $290 million jury verdict against the software
giant for infringing a small Canadian company's patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The justices unanimously agreed with a U.S. appeals court
ruling that went against the world's largest software company
in its legal battle with Toronto-based i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The high court refused to adopt Microsoft's lower standard
to replace the long-standing requirement that a defendant in a
patent infringement case prove by clear and convincing evidence
that a plaintiff's patent is invalid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft had argued that a lower
standard of proof involving a "preponderance of the evidence"
would make some "bad" patents easier to invalidate while
promoting innovation and competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote the opinion, said the
court rejected Microsoft's contention that a defendant need
only persuade a jury of a patent's invalidity by a
preponderance of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When the U.S. Congress has prescribed the governing
standard of proof, its choice generally controls, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Obama administration and i4i opposed Microsoft's
position and said Congress had accepted the standard in effect
for the past 28 years and the Supreme Court should uphold it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The legal battle began in 2007 when i4i sued Microsoft. A
federal jury awarded $290 million to i4i after finding that
Microsoft, in 2003 and 2007 versions of Word, its word
processing application, had infringed i4i's patent relating to
text manipulation software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A U.S. appeals court upheld the award, and the U.S. Patent
and Trademark Office upheld the validity of the i4i patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft continued to dispute those decisions, but removed
the contested features from its current software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In appealing to the Supreme Court, Microsoft said it wanted
a new trial. But the justices ruled against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is not entirely over, however, since Microsoft
also has a challenge to the patent pending at the patent office
and may have to pay other potential licensing fees, said Michel
Vulpe, i4i's founder and chief technology officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're very pleased that the court did the right thing,"
and that the decision was unanimous, Vulpe told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS CASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Loudon Owen, i4i's chairman, said in a statement, "This is
one of the most significant business cases the court has
decided in decades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has said it is the largest patent infringement
verdict ever affirmed on appeal. It has also said it had set
aside money for the verdict, so it was not material to its
earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While the outcome is not what we had hoped for, we will
continue to advocate for changes to the law that will prevent
abuse of the patent system and protect inventors who hold
patents representing true innovation," Microsoft spokesman
Kevin Kutz said in an email statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Max Grant, a patent law attorney at Latham  Watkins, said
that by upholding the status quo "the Supreme Court wisely left
alone a complex area of the law that balances many competing
interests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's share price dipped when the decision was
announced but quickly recovered and was little changed at
$23.93 in afternoon trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sotomayor wrote that any decision to change the standard in
patent infringement cases would have to come from Congress. She
noted that the standard of clear and convincing evidence was
almost 30 years old and had been left untouched during previous
congressional patent system reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google Inc (GOOG.O), Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O) and trade groups
such as the Computer  Communications Industry Association
supported Microsoft, while Bayer AG (BAYGn.DE), 3M Co (MMM.N)
and groups representing biotechnology companies and
pharmaceutical manufacturers backed i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case was decided by eight of the nine Supreme Court
members. Chief Justice John Roberts, who owns Microsoft stock,
recused himself from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Supreme Court case is Microsoft Corp v. i4i Limited
Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc, No.
10-290.

&lt;p&gt; * BrightSource has booked losses of $40.2 mln for project&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cost overruns blamed on design and engineering changes
 (Adds filing details, background on BrightSource, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Nichola Groom&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, June 9 (Reuters) - Solar thermal company
BrightSource Energy Inc said it had experienced "significant
cost overruns" with its enhanced oil recovery project with
Chevron Corp (CVX.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BrightSource, which filed with U.S. securities regulators
for an initial public offering in April [ID:nN25219102], said
in an amended filing on Thursday that it had set aside $40.2
million to account for losses since the project's inception,
$29.7 million more than it originally anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Coalinga, California, project will use BrightSource's
solar thermal technology to create steam that is injected into
an oil well to improve the flow of heavy oil. It is expected to
start up in the second half of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the filing, Oakland, California-based BrightSource
blamed the cost overruns on design and engineering changes,
weather-related delays and efforts to speed up completion of
the project. Under the terms of the contract, those costs could
not be passed on to Chevron, BrightSource said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BrightSource has said previously that the contract for the
Chevron EOR project was entered into at a loss so that the
start-up could prove that its technology works at a commercial
scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We do not anticipate entering into another loss contract
similar to the Chevron agreement," BrightSource said in the
filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company added, however, that it was in talks with
Chevron regarding additional EOR projects "and other business
opportunities," and said EOR represents "a significant growth
opportunity" for its technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is an investor in BrightSource. The company's other
investors include Google Inc (GOOG.O), ALSTOM (ALSO.PA), BP
(BP.L), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and VantagePoint Capital
Partners, among others.

    The United States banking industry is still questionable even though we
have seen a sizeable recovery in recent quarters and several catalysts
are to blame: asset quality is in check, tight regulations and banks
tightening their belts, and worst of all the continued rise of
residential and commercial foreclosures and loan defaults.

    Better news is that while low liquidity, loan demand and revenues
continue to plague the financial system, help from the government has
kept the industry relatively stable. Banks are aggressively playing
"catch-up" concentrating on problem credits in residential and commercial
real estate and the government has raised the bar providing substantial
capital and debt guarantees.

    Equity Markets has reviewed Goldman Sachs as a global investment banking,
securities and investment management company providing a range of
financial services to a client base that includes corporations, financial
institutions, governments and high-net-worth individuals. Its United
States depository institution subsidiary, Goldman Sachs Bank USA (GS Bank
USA), is a New York State-chartered bank. It has been viewed that GS's
capital position will remain positive and earnings potential could rise.

    Equity Markets is covering JPMorgan Chase's principal bank subsidiaries
are JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Association (JPMorgan Chase Bank,
N.A.), a national bank with United States branches in 23 states, and
Chase Bank USA, National Association (Chase Bank USA, N.A.), a national
bank that is the Firm's credit card-issuing bank. JPM's first-quarter
2011 results showed strong trading and securities gains, which offset
industry-wide weak trends in loan growth and net interest income. JPM's
first quarter core net revenues were up 1.15% from fourth quarter results
which were above most peers. The full research report on JPMorgan Chase's

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, June 9 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court ruled
on Thursday against Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) in its appeal of a
record $290 million jury verdict for infringing a small
Canadian software firm's patent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The justices unanimously upheld a U.S. appeals court's
ruling that went against the world's largest software company
in its legal battle with Toronto-based i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The high court rejected Microsoft's argument to adopt a
lower standard to replace the long-standing requirement that a
defendant in a patent infringement case prove by clear and
convincing evidence that a plaintiff's patent is invalid.

      eCard is a fully integrated customer outreach program that can be 
      localized and adapted to meet the needs of individual markets and 
      customers around the world.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The eCard program utilizes a modular technology platform that provides 
      front-end flexibility to address specific customer needs and 
      opportunities,&#8221; said Jeff Keisling, senior vice president and chief 
      information officer. &#8220;The flexibility of the front-end is complemented 
      by a robust business intelligence platform and business rules engine to 
      support global scalability.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Patients are enrolled in the eCard program by their healthcare 
      professional. The eCard offers discounts on the retail price of Pfizer 
      medicines, and enables patients to enroll in patient support programs 
      which aim to increase adherence to therapy and appropriate use of 
      medicine.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;eCard allows Pfizer to extend the accessibility of high-value Pfizer 
      medicines to customers through discounts and loyalty programs, and reach 
      customers who in the past could not afford these medicines,&#8221; said David 
      Simmons, president and general manager, Emerging Markets and Established 
      Products. &#8220;This is especially impactful in the emerging markets where 
      patients often have to pay out of pocket for their own medicines. 
      Through this program, Pfizer also partners with governments to help 
      manage chronic diseases that dramatically impact their budgets.&#8221;

      potential for greater revenues in years 4 and 5 as key milestones are 
      achieved. The agreement is intended to enable&#160;Visa to mobilise existing 
      Visa account holders in the U.S. and in other key geographies creating 
      new mobile solutions that replicate the ease, reliability, and security 
      of traditional Visa payments, on mobile phones and in ecommerce stores 
      accessed via mobile phones.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Visa is the benchmark for trusted payments innovation on a global scale 
      and it is a huge honour for Monitise to be playing our part in their 
      mobile strategy. Mobile Money is an industry that will have a big 
      societal impact as the 5+ billion mobile phone users around the world 
      discover new ways to bank, pay, trade and shop. This agreement validates 
      Monitise's strategy of becoming the leading trusted enabler in the space 
      and cements our role in this ever growing ecosystem,&#8221; said Alastair 
      Lukies, Chief Executive of Monitise.

      Visa Acquires Fundamo, Signs New Agreement With Monitise
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Two investments accelerate delivery of mobile financial services to 
      consumers worldwide as part of Visa&#8217;s global strategy to enable the next 
      generation of payments solutions
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), a global leader in payments, today announced that it 
      is acquiring Fundamo, a leading platform provider of mobile financial 
      services for mobile network operators and financial institutions in 
      developing economies. It also announced a new, long-term commercial 
      agreement with Monitise plc (LSE:MONI.L), a leading provider of mobile 
      money solutions for financial institutions in more developed geographies.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The investments will accelerate the execution of Visa&#8217;s global strategy 
      announced last month to provide the next generation of payments 
      solutions, enabling consumers to transact wherever and whenever they 
      choose, using a card, a computer or a mobile device with Visa&#8217;s 
      reliability, security and global acceptance. The combination of 
      acquiring Fundamo and expanding the relationship with Monitise will 
      enable Visa to deliver best-in-class mobile financial services and 
      payments capabilities to consumers across the full spectrum of uses, 
      geographies and mobile environments from basic services on simple 
      handsets to more advanced services for smart phone owners.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Fundamo Acquisition
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While mobile financial services in developing markets are growing and 
      have become a core service offered by many mobile operators and 
      financial institutions, these services are often limited in scalability 
      and reach and are not interoperable with other regional payment services 
      or global payments networks.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fundamo&#8217;s platform enables the delivery of mobile financial services to 
      unbanked and under-banked consumers around the world&#8212;including 
      person-to-person payment, airtime top-up, bill payment and branchless 
      banking services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The combined Visa Fundamo platform will add enhanced functionality and 
      new services to existing mobile financial services subscribers across 
      Africa, Asia and Latin America for safe, reliable and globally accepted 
      payments solutions. It will expand the utility of closed-loop systems, 
      enable them to be interoperable, make financial services available to 
      more consumers and offer merchants access to new customers. This has the 
      potential to connect billions of unbanked and under-banked consumers to 
      each other and to the global economy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Combining Visa&#8217;s unparalleled network scale, global reach, extensive 
      product suite and established financial institution relationships with 
      Fundamo&#8217;s expertise in delivering mobile financial services in 
      developing economies presents us with an important long-term opportunity 
      to grow our business and drive financial inclusion in key geographic 
      markets,&#8221; said Joseph W. Saunders, chairman and chief executive officer 
      of Visa Inc.&#160;&#8220;We are pleased to add Fundamo&#8217;s industry leading 
      technology solutions to our portfolio.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Mobile network operators and financial institutions will now be able to 
      take advantage of Fundamo&#8217;s trusted mobile financial services platform 
      backed by Visa&#8217;s high standards for security, reliability and scale,&#8221; 
      said Hannes van Rensburg, CEO of Fundamo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hannes van Rensburg and the Fundamo management team will continue to 
      manage current and future Fundamo implementations as valuable members of 
      Visa&#8217;s mobile product organization.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Privately held, Cape Town, South Africa-based Fundamo has more than 50 
      active mobile financial services deployments across more than 40 
      countries, including 27 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. 
      Fundamo&#8217;s deployments currently have a base of more than five million 
      registered subscribers and the potential to reach more than 180 million 
      consumers with mobile financial services. Mobile prepaid payments 
      provide affordable, convenient and secure transaction capabilities that 
      are transformational to the lives of merchants and consumers in those 
      regions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa will pay approximately $110 million in cash. The acquisition is 
      expected to close today, and is slightly dilutive to Visa&#8217;s earnings per 
      share in its fiscal year 2011 ending September 30, 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			New Monitise Agreement
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, Visa also signed a new commercial agreement with Monitise to 
      expand delivery of mobile financial services to banked Visa account 
      holders in conjunction with Visa&#8217;s financial institution partners. 
      Monitise&#8217;s expertise in customizing mobile applications for a broad 
      range of phone models and operating systems enables Visa to virtualize 
      existing Visa accounts on mobile phones and offer Visa account holders 
      globally a new array of payment types.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      One key focus of this alliance is the introduction of new mobile 
      services to existing Visa account holders outside the U.S. that enable 
      electronic payments on the go to meet consumers&#8217; daily needs including 
      mobile top-up, utility payments, and transit ticketing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, Monitise and Visa will launch a mobile banking solution in 
      the U.S. for clients of Visa DPS, Visa&#8217;s debit and prepaid processing 
      platform. This new service is designed to enable Visa clients and 
      processing partners in the U.S. to quickly and efficiently offer their 
      customers a suite of services, such as mobile payments, person-to-person 
      payments, mobile transaction alerts and mobile marketing offers.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			Forward-Looking Statements
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This press release contains forward-looking statements within the 
      meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. 
      These statements can be identified by the term &#8220;potential&#8221;, &#8220;will&#8221;, 
      &#8220;expected&#8221; and similar references to the future. Examples of such 
      forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the pace of 
      implementation and potential for success of Visa&#8217;s mobile payments and 
      banking solutions, the number and scope of consumers reached, the 
      emergence of mobile as a channel for payments and the amounts of revenue 
      generated, the growth of Visa&#8217;s business in emerging markets, the 
      interoperability of Visa&#8217;s systems, the timing of the completion of the 
      acquisition and its prospective dilutive effect on Visa&#8217;s earnings per 
      share. By their nature, forward-looking statements: (i)&#160;speak only as of 
      the date they are made, (ii)&#160;are neither statements of historical fact 
      nor guarantees of future performance and (iii)&#160;are subject to risks, 
      uncertainties, assumptions and changes in circumstances that are 
      difficult to predict or quantify. Therefore, actual results could differ 
      materially and adversely from those forward-looking statements because 
      of a variety of factors, including the risk that the new business will 
      not be successfully integrated with Visa's, technical obstacles to 
      interoperability, the costs associated with the acquisition, slowed 
      growth of mobile payments, geo-political turmoil, particularly in 
      Africa, Asia and Latin America, failure to keep pace with competitors&#8217; 
      technological innovation, and the other factors discussed under the 
      heading "Risk Factors" in our most recent Annual Report on Form 10-K. 
      You should not place undue reliance on such statements. Unless required 
      to do so by law, we do not intend to update or revise any 
      forward-looking statement because of new information or future 
      developments or otherwise.

&lt;p&gt;IBM formally introduces its Intelligent Building Management software today -- an advanced solution that's being put to work at Tulane University's School of Architecture, The Cloisters of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and the company's 35-building facility in Minnesota.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The software is designed to be an analytics and automation powerhouse that can help ramp up the environmental performance of any building, even ones that are 100 years old or more.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The product is the latest in a steady stream of solutions that IBM has unleashed in recent months to make the management of buildings, the energy and resources they use, and the transportation and virtual networks that connect them more efficient, more effective and more intelligent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software and its applications, which are being detailed today in an IBM Smarter Buildings Forum in New York, also are the results of the company's steadily increasing collaborative projects, partnerships and acquisitions -- all of which are aimed at positioning IBM as a dominant player in a nascent field that brings together IT, the built environment, vehicles and energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GreenerBuildings.com Executive Editor Rob Watson is the kickoff speaker at the forum today and GreenBiz.com Senior Writer Adam Aston will provide on-scene coverage of the event.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is an early look at the projects that will be featured during the forum:&lt;/p&gt;

    Tulane University in New Orleans is using the software to transform the historic century-old Richardson Memorial Hall (pictured above), home of the Tulane School of Architecture, into what IBM is calling a smarter-building living laboratory. Johnson Controls is a partner in the project.
    The Cloisters, the branch of the Metropolitan Museum that houses 3,000 works of European medieval art, is using IBM software and its wireless environmental sensor network called the Lower-Power Mote to preserve the collection.
    IBM's facility in Rochester, Minn., is realizing further energy savings using the Intelligent Building Management system. The complex of 35 interconnected buildings that make up the 3.2-million-square-foot manufacturing and development facility has undergone several waves of efficiency improvements since the site opened in 1956 with a half million square feet of workspace. The company said it's achieving further year-over-year incremental energy savings and as well as saving in equipment operating costs with the software.
&lt;p&gt;Smarter buildings can help owners and operators cut energy use by as much as 40 percent and reduce maintenance costs by 10 to 30 percent, according to IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While technology advancements in building management systems have made it possible to cull an immense amount of data on structures, the challenge has been to organize, analyze and present it swiftly to building owners and operators so they can proactively manage their properties -- as IBM Smarter Buildings Vice President David Bartlett said at GreenBiz Group's State of Green Business Forum this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new software, which is supposed to be the most comprehensive product thus far in IBM's smarter buildings arsenal, is intended to address that need.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, IBM introduced its Intelligent Operations Center for Smarter Cities. The plug-and-play, smarter-cities-in-a-box solution is expected to deliver high-powered systems and network management capabilities to communities without the high price tag that usually affixed to such technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Image Credits -- Top photo, Richardson Memorial Hall at Tulane University, CC licensed by Wikimedia Commons user Tony Vanky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and other banks fighting for control of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEHMQ.PK bankruptcy have joined efforts to avoid sharing information about claims against the failed investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In court papers filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, units of Goldman, Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and others said a proposal by a group of Lehman bondholders would go "far beyond" bankruptcy rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks are part of a group proposing a plan to divvy up about $60 billion in the Lehman estate to pay back creditors of the company, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008. The bondholders, an ad hoc group led by hedge fund Paulson  Co, have filed a competing plan that would yield lower returns for the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bondholders in April were ordered by Judge James Peck, who oversees the bankruptcy, to disclose key points about their roughly $20 billion in claims, including the price paid for those claims. An analysis by the Wall Street Journal found that Paulson's fund, which bought its Lehman debt at a steep discount, could make profits of $350 million to $726 million from the bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bondholders said all parties should be required to meet the same disclosure requirements, a position supported by Lehman. The group in May proposed a uniform standard for anyone trying to influence Lehman's payback plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But creditors were quick to object, saying insolvency rules require broader disclosure from committees than individual creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the more than 15 parties who have opposed the disclosures are Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and the Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest objections may prove central to the dispute because the Goldman group is a direct competitor to the bondholders in efforts to control Lehman's restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group has argued that it is loosely affiliated and that its members have separate attorneys, barring it from committee status under disclosure rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if disclosure rules do not encompass the banks, other parts of the bankruptcy code should, the bondholders argue. For example, a statutory provision allowing judges broad power to issue orders should be liberally interpreted to give Peck the power to demand disclosures, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman group said "burdensome" disclosure is unnecessary and would discourage creditors from seeking a say in Lehman's reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if some minimal benefit could be articulated, it would be completely outweighed by the chilling effect," the banks said in Friday's filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other members of the group to sign on to the objection include Credit Agricole CIB, Credit Suisse International and the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC. Investment funds including Angelo Gordon  Co LP and Serengeti Asset Management LP filed court papers Friday supporting the banks' objection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman representative declined to comment Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank were not immediately available. A lawyer for Credit Suisse declined to comment, as did a spokesman for the bondholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The matter is set for hearing before Judge Peck on June 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-13555.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The top securities regulator can pursue its high-profile civil fraud lawsuit against a Goldman Sachs Group Inc vice president over a product linked to subprime mortgages, a federal judge ruled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;District Judge Barbara Jones rejected the request by the executive, Fabrice Tourre, to dismiss ecurities and Exchange Commission claims accusing him of violating a federal law designed to stop the fraudulent sale of securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She dismissed some SEC claims, citing a recent Supreme Court ruling limiting the reach of federal securities laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC sued Goldman and Tourre in April 2010, accusing them of failing to tell investors the Paulson  Co hedge fund, run by billionaire John Paulson, helped choose and bet against the subprime residential mortgage-backed securities underlying Abacus 2007-AC1, a collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman settled with the SEC last July for $550 million without admitting wrongdoing, but remains the subject of many lawsuits by investors who say the Wall Street bank's actions and the resulting negative publicity depressed its share price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tourre is the only individual sued in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased that Judge Jones has dismissed a substantial portion of the SEC's case and confident we will prevail on the merits on the remaining allegations at trial," said Pamela Chepiga, a lawyer for Tourre.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEC spokesman John Nester said: "We are pleased with the court's ruling and look forward to presenting our fraud charges against Mr. Tourre in court."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman spokesman David Wells declined to comment on the ruling. He said Tourre remains an employee, but is on leave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOURRE "PRINCIPALLY RESPONSIBLE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citing the June ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court in Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd, Jones said the SEC could not pursue a fraud claim related to Germany's IKB Deutsche Industriebank AG, which the regulator said lost nearly its entire $150 million investment in Abacus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also threw out a fraud claim related to ABN Amro Bank, later part of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, which had assumed some credit risk associated with Abacus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But she said that, by alleging Tourre was "principally responsible" for Abacus and its marketing materials, the SEC sufficiently alleged he violated the law barring fraudulent sales "when Goldman's structured product syndicate desk invited institutional investors to contact Goldman's sales representatives in New York regarding Abacus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She also said Tourre must face SEC claims he misled ACA Capital Holdings Inc, which helped Paulson choose securities backing Abacus and sold protection against their default, by failing to reveal Paulson was betting against the debt. ACA had also bought $42 million of Abacus notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman shares closed up $2.39, or 1.8 percent, at $135.92 on Friday. They have fallen 26.2 percent since April 15, 2010, the day before the SEC filed its lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is SEC v Goldman Sachs  Co et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03229.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool and Jonathan Stempel; editing by Robert MacMillan and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds background and details from ruling)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Grant McCool and Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - The top U.S. securities
regulator can pursue its high-profile civil fraud lawsuit
against a Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) vice president over a
product linked to subprime mortgages, a federal judge ruled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. District Judge Barbara Jones rejected the request by

the SEC could not pursue a fraud claim related to Germany's IKB
Deutsche Industriebank AG IKBG.DE, which the regulator said
lost nearly its entire $150 million investment in Abacus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She also threw out a fraud claim related to ABN Amro Bank,
later part of Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc (RBS.L), which
had assumed some credit risk associated with Abacus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But she said that, by alleging Tourre was "principally
responsible" for Abacus and its marketing materials, the SEC
sufficiently alleged he violated the law barring fraudulent
sales "when Goldman's structured product syndicate desk invited
institutional investors to contact Goldman's sales
representatives in New York regarding Abacus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She also said Tourre must face SEC claims he misled ACA
Capital Holdings Inc, which helped Paulson choose securities
backing Abacus and sold protection against their default, by
failing to reveal Paulson was betting against the debt. ACA had
also bought $42 million of Abacus notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman shares closed up $2.39, or 1.8 percent, at $135.92
on Friday. They have fallen 26.2 percent since April 15, 2010,
the day before the SEC filed its lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is SEC v Goldman Sachs  Co et al, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of New York, No. 10-03229.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and other banks fighting for control of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc's LEHMQ.PK bankruptcy have joined efforts to avoid sharing information about claims against the failed investment bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In court papers filed Friday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, units of Goldman, Morgan Stanley (MS.N), Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and others said a proposal by a group of Lehman bondholders would go "far beyond" bankruptcy rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The banks are part of a group proposing a plan to divvy up about $60 billion in the Lehman estate to pay back creditors of the company, which filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in September 2008. The bondholders, an ad hoc group led by hedge fund Paulson  Co, have filed a competing plan that would yield lower returns for the banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bondholders in April were ordered by Judge James Peck, who oversees the bankruptcy, to disclose key points about their roughly $20 billion in claims, including the price paid for those claims. An analysis by the Wall Street Journal found that Paulson's fund, which bought its Lehman debt at a steep discount, could make profits of $350 million to $726 million from the bankruptcy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bondholders said all parties should be required to meet the same disclosure requirements, proposing in May a uniform standard for anyone trying to influence Lehman's payback plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But creditors were quick to object, saying insolvency rules require broader disclosure from committees than individual creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the more than 15 parties who have opposed the disclosures are Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Barclays Plc (BARC.L) and the Royal Bank of Canada (RY.TO).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest objections may prove central to the dispute because the Goldman group is a direct competitor to the bondholders in efforts to control Lehman's restructuring.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group has argued that it is loosely affiliated and that its members have separate attorneys, barring it from committee status under disclosure rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But if disclosure rules do not encompass the banks, other parts of the bankruptcy code should, the bondholders argue. For example, a statutory provision allowing judges broad power to issue orders should be liberally interpreted to give Peck the power to demand disclosures, they say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman group said "burdensome" disclosure is unnecessary and would discourage creditors from seeking a say in Lehman's reorganization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Even if some minimal benefit could be articulated, it would be completely outweighed by the chilling effect," the banks said in Friday's filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other members of the group to sign on to the objection include Credit Agricole CIB, Credit Suisse International and the Royal Bank of Scotland PLC. Investment funds including Angelo Gordon  Co LP and Serengeti Asset Management LP filed court papers Friday supporting the banks' objection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Goldman representative and a company attorney were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Attorneys for Morgan Stanley and Deutsche Bank also were not immediately available.

&lt;p&gt; * Says should not be required to share details on claims&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Bondholders say everyone should follow uniform standards&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Nick Brown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc

&lt;p&gt;KRASNODAR, Russia, June 10 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major
Chevron (CVX.N) is likely to quit a $1 billion drilling project
with Rosneft (ROSN.MM) off Russia's Black Sea coast, Rosneft
chief executive Eduard Khudainatov said on Friday. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "It's obvious that they will exit," Khudainatov told a news
conference after the company's annual meeting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But Chevron will remain our partner and wants to continue
working on offshore projects with us," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Denis Pinchuk; writing by Melissa Akin;

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Jun 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
The Crowdsortium Meetup , co-hosted by Appswell and uTest, is pioneering
a new, local chapter of the Crowdsortium -- a group of crowdsourcing
thought leaders and pundits that have self-organized to advance the
concept of leveraging online communities to get work done through shared
research, education, public dialog and free food. After a brief keynote
from Harvard professor and leading academic expert on crowdsourcing,
Karim Lakhani, this meetup will feature a panel of local crowdsourcing
CEOs and VCs who will discuss the current state and coming evolution of
the crowdsourcing model. 

WHEN:
 Tuesday, June 21, 2011 @ 6:30pm to
8:30pm

WHERE:
 Microsoft's New England Research &amp; Development Center
(NERD), Cambridge, MA

HOW:
 RSVP to reserve your spot here (free to
attend)

WHO:
 Harvard Business School professor Karim Lakhani will open
the meetup with a brief keynote presentation. Lakhani is cited as a
leading academic expert on crowdsourcing, particularly for his research
on the companies Threadless and Innocentive. The feature panel -- "What's
New &amp; What's Next in Crowdsourcing" -- will be comprised of local VCs,
including Partner/Co-Founder of Longworth Ventures Jim Savage, and CEOs
of top crowdsourcing companies, including CEO of uTest Doron Reuveni and
CEO of Appswell Daniel Sullivan, that have had success advancing the
ever-changing and growing crowdsourcing industry. 

    These industry leaders will dispel some of the most common misconceptions
about crowdsourcing and reveal their secrets on how to make it work.
After the panel, there will be time for networking along with
complimentary pizza and beer. Register or learn more at

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, June 10 (Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Pfizer (PFE.N)
won EU regulatory clearance on Friday to acquire Danish medical
services company Ferrosan's consumer healthcare business from
Altor 2003 Fund Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The companies did not disclose financial terms when they

an examination of the impact of the merger on markets in

      m&#243;viles para operadores de redes m&#243;viles e instituciones financieras en 
      econom&#237;as en desarrollo. Tambi&#233;n anunci&#243; un nuevo contrato comercial a 
      largo plazo con Monitise plc (LSE:MONI.L), un proveedor l&#237;der de 
      soluciones de dinero m&#243;vil para instituciones financieras en geograf&#237;as

			La adquisici&#243;n de Fundamo
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Mientras que los servicios financieros m&#243;viles en mercados en desarrollo 
      crecen y se han convertido en un servicio principal ofrecido por muchos 
      operadores de telefon&#237;a m&#243;vil e instituciones financieras, estos 
      servicios est&#225;n a menudo limitados en su escalabilidad y alcance, y no 
      son interoperables con otros servicios de pago regionales o redes de 
      pago globales.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      La plataforma de Fundamo permite la entrega de servicios financieros 
      m&#243;viles a consumidores de todo el mundo con poco o ning&#250;n acceso a 
      servicios bancarios, incluyendo pagos persona a persona, recarga de 
      saldo, pago de facturas y servicios bancarios sin sucursales.

      los sistemas de circuito cerrado, permitiendo que sean interoperables, 
      har&#225; que los servicios financieros est&#233;n disponibles a m&#225;s consumidores 
      y ofrecer&#225; a los comerciantes acceso a nuevos clientes. Esto tiene el 
      potencial de conectar entre s&#237; y con la econom&#237;a global a miles de 
      millones de consumidores con poco o ning&#250;n acceso a servicios bancarios.

      servicios financieros m&#243;viles en econom&#237;as en desarrollo, nos ofrece una 
      importante oportunidad a largo plazo de incrementar nuestro negocio y

      consumidores en esas regiones.

      Visa pagar&#225; aproximadamente $110 millones en efectivo. Se espera que la 
      adquisici&#243;n se cierre el d&#237;a de hoy, y significar&#225; solo una ligera 
      diluci&#243;n para las ganancias por acci&#243;n de Visa en su a&#241;o fiscal de 2011, 
      que termina el 30 de setiembre de 2011.

      Monitise para expandir la entrega de servicios financieros m&#243;viles a 
      titulares de cuenta Visa con acceso a servicios bancarios en conjunto

      modelos de celulares y sistemas operativos permite a Visa llevar a cabo 
      la virtualizaci&#243;n de las cuentas de Visa existentes en tel&#233;fonos m&#243;viles 
      y ofrece a los propietarios de cuenta Visa a nivel mundial una nueva 
      gama de tipos de pago.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Uno de los enfoques centrales de esta alianza es la introducci&#243;n de 
      nuevos servicios m&#243;viles para los titulares de cuentas Visa existentes 
      fuera de los EE. UU., que permiten que los pagos electr&#243;nicos sobre la 
      marcha satisfagan las necesidades diarias de los consumidores, 
      incluyendo la recarga de saldo para celulares, pagos de servicios 
      b&#225;sicos, y compra de pasajes de &#243;mnibus.

      &#8220;esperado&#8221;, verbos en futuro y referencias similares al futuro. Ejemplos 
      de dichas declaraciones a futuro incluyen, pero no se limitan a, el 
      ritmo de la implementaci&#243;n y el potencial de &#233;xito de las soluciones de 
      pago y transacciones bancarias m&#243;viles de Visa, el n&#250;mero y el rango de 
      consumidores alcanzados, el surgimiento del celular como un canal para 
      los pagos y los montos de los ingresos generados, el crecimiento del 
      negocio de Visa en mercados emergentes, la interoperabilidad de los 
      sistemas de Visa, el tiempo de finalizaci&#243;n de la adquisici&#243;n y sus 
      efectos de diluci&#243;n potenciales sobre las ganancias por acci&#243;n de Visa. 
      Por su naturaleza, las declaraciones a futuro: (i) hablan solo a partir 
      del d&#237;a en que fueron hechas, (ii) no son ni declaraciones de hechos

      son dif&#237;ciles de predecir o cuantificar. Por lo tanto, los resultados 
      reales pueden diferir sustancial y adversamente de aquellas 
      declaraciones a futuro debido a una variedad de factores, incluido el 
      riesgo de que el nuevo negocio no se integre exitosamente a los negocios 
      de Visa, obst&#225;culos t&#233;cnicos para la interoperabilidad, los costos

      Visa &#252;bernimmt Fundamo und unterzeichnet neues Abkommen mit Monitise
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Zwei Investitionen zur rascheren Bereitstellung von mobilen 
      Finanzdienstleistungen f&#252;r Kunden auf der ganzen Welt im Rahmen der 
      globalen Strategie von Visa zur F&#246;rderung zuk&#252;nftiger Zahlungsl&#246;sungen
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), eines der f&#252;hrenden globalen Unternehmen f&#252;r 
      Zahlungsdienste, hat heute die &#220;bernahme von Fundamo, einem namhaften 
      Anbieter von Plattformen f&#252;r mobile Finanzdienstleistungen durch 
      Mobilfunkbetreiber und Finanzinstitute in Entwicklungsl&#228;ndern, 
      bekanntgegeben. Au&#223;erdem gab das Unternehmen ein neues langfristiges 
      Handelsabkommen mit Monitise plc (LSE: MONI.L), einem f&#252;hrenden Anbieter 
      mobiler Gelddienste f&#252;r Finanzinstitute in besser entwickelten Regionen, 
      bekannt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Die Investitionen beschleunigen die Umsetzung der vor einem Monat 
      bekanntgegebenen globalen Strategie von Visa zur Bereitstellung einer 
      neuen Generation von Zahlungsl&#246;sungen, mit denen Verbraucher mithilfe 
      einer Karte, eines Computers oder eines Mobilger&#228;ts verl&#228;ssliche, 
      sichere und weltweit akzeptierte Transaktionen mit Visa ausf&#252;hren k&#246;nnen 
      &#8211; wann und wo sie wollen. Die Kombination der &#220;bernahme von Fundamo und 
      der Verl&#228;nderung der Beziehung mit Monitise erm&#246;glicht Visa die 
      Bereitstellung der bestm&#246;glichen Finanzdienstleistungen und 
      Zahlungsm&#246;glichkeiten f&#252;r Verbraucher aus dem gesamten Spektrum von 
      Nutzungsarten, geografischen Gegenden und Mobilfunkumgebungen &#8211; von 
      grundlegenden Dienstleistungen auf einfacheren Ger&#228;ten bis hin zu 
      fortgeschritteneren Diensten f&#252;r Smartphone-Besitzer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#220;bernahme von Fundamo
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Obwohl mobile Finanzdienstleistungen in Entwicklungsl&#228;ndern ein Wachstum 
      aufweisen und bei vielen Mobilfunkbetreibern und Finanzinstituten zu 
      einem Kerngesch&#228;ft geworden sind, sind diese Dienstleistungen oft nur 
      beschr&#228;nkt in Bezug auf Skalierbarkeit und Reichweite und sind nicht 
      kompatibel mit anderen regionalen Zahlungsdiensten oder globalen 
      Zahlungsnetzwerken.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Die Plattform von Fundamo erm&#246;glicht die Bereitstellung von mobilen 
      Finanzdienstleistungen f&#252;r Verbraucher ohne nennenswerte Bankbeziehungen 
      auf der ganzen Welt &#8211; von Zahlungen von und an Privatpersonen &#252;ber das 
      Nachladen von Gespr&#228;chguthaben und das Bezahlen von Rechnungen bis hin 
      zu Bankdienstleistungen ohne Filialsystem.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Die gemeinsame Visa-Fundamo-Plattform bringt erweiterte Funktionen und 
      neue Dienstleistungen in Bezug auf sichere, verl&#228;ssliche und &#252;berall auf 
      der Welt akzeptierte Zahlungsl&#246;sungen f&#252;r bestehende Abonnenten von 
      mobilen Finanzdiensten in Afrika, Asien und Lateinamerika. Dadurch wird 
      die N&#252;tzlichkeit geschlossener Systeme erweitert, da sie mit anderen 
      Systemen kompatibel gemacht werden k&#246;nnen, wodurch die 
      Finanzdienstleistungen mehr Verbrauchern zur Verf&#252;gung stehen und 
      H&#228;ndler Zugang zu neuen Kunden bekommen. Dies birgt das Potenzial, 
      Milliarden von Verbrauchern ohne nennenswerte Bankbeziehungen 
      miteinander und mit der Weltwirtschaft in Verbindung zu bringen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Die Verbindung der beispiellosen Netzwerkgr&#246;&#223;e, der globalen 
      Ausdehnung, des umfangreichen Produktangebots und der bestehenden 
      Beziehungen zu Finanzinstituten von Visa mit der Fachkompetenz von 
      Fundamo bei der Bereitstellung mobiler Finanzdienstleistungen in 
      Entwicklungsl&#228;ndern bietet uns eine wichtige langfristige Chance zur 
      Wachstumssteigerung unseres Gesch&#228;fts und zur F&#246;rderung der finanziellen 
      Anbindung geografisch wichtiger M&#228;rkte&#8220;, sagte Joseph W. Saunders, 
      Vorsitzender und Chief Executive Offiver von Visa Inc. &#8222;Wir freuen uns, 
      die branchenf&#252;hrende Technologiel&#246;sung von Fundamo in unser Portfolio 
      aufnehmen zu d&#252;rfen.&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Mobilfunkbetreiber und Finanzinstitute k&#246;nnen jetzt die zuverl&#228;ssige 
      Plattform von Fundamo f&#252;r mobile Finanzdienstleistungen mit der 
      entsprechenden Absicherung durch die hohen Standards von Visa in Bezug 
      auf Sicherheit, Verl&#228;sslichkeit und Gr&#246;&#223;e nutzen&#8220;, sagte Hannes van 
      Rensburg, CEO von Fundamo.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hannes van Rensburg und die Gesch&#228;ftsleitung von Fundamo betreuen als 
      gesch&#228;tzte Mitglieder der Visa-Organisation f&#252;r Mobilprodukte weiterhin 
      die aktuellen und zuk&#252;nftigen Einrichtungen des Fundamo-Systems.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Das s&#252;dafrikanische Privatunternehmen Fundamo mit Sitz in Kapstadt 
      betreibt mehr als 50 aktive mobile Finanzdienstleistungen in &#252;ber 40 
      L&#228;ndern, darunter 27 L&#228;nder in Afrika, Asien und im Nahen und Mittleren 
      Osten. Die Einrichtungen von Fundamo werden zur Zeit von mehr als f&#252;nf 
      Millionen registrierten Abonnenten genutzt, und die mobilen 
      Finanzdienstleistungen weisen ein Potenzial von mehr als 180 Millionen 
      Verbrauchern auf. Mobile Prepaid-Zahlungen erm&#246;glichen erschwingliche, 
      bequeme und sichere Transaktionen mit umw&#228;lzenden Auswirkungen auf das 
      Leben von H&#228;ndlern und Verbrauchern in diesen Regionen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Die &#220;bernahme kostet Visa rund 110&#160;Millionen US-Dollar in bar. Die 
      &#220;bernahme soll heute abgeschlossen werden und wird den Gewinn je Aktie 
      von Visa im Gesch&#228;ftsjahr 2011, das am 30. September 2011 zu Ende geht, 
      leicht verw&#228;ssern.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Neues Abkommen mit Monitise
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Visa hat heute auch ein neues Handelsabkommen mit Monitise zur 
      Ausdehnung von mobilen Finanzdienstleistungen auf Visa-Kunden mit 
      Bankbeziehungen in Zusammenarbeit mit verb&#252;ndeten Finanzinstituten 
      unterzeichnet. Dank der Fachkompetenz von Monitise bei der Anpassung von 
      Mobilfunkanwendungen an diverse Telefonmodelle und Betriebssysteme kann 
      Visa bestehende Visa-Konten auf Mobiltelefonen virtualisieren und den 
      Inhabern dieser Konten so neuartige Zahlungsm&#246;glichkeiten auf der ganzen 
      Welt anbieten.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ein entscheidender Schwerpunkt dieses B&#252;ndnisses ist die Einf&#252;hrung 
      neuer mobiler Dienstleistungen f&#252;r bestehende Inhaber von Visa-Konten 
      au&#223;erhalb der USA, mit denen elektronische Zahlungen unterwegs 
      erm&#246;glicht werden, so dass Verbraucher allt&#228;gliche Bed&#252;rfnisse wie das 
      Nachladen von Gespr&#228;chsguthaben, das Bezahlen von Strom-, Wasser- und 
      Gasrechnungen oder das Kaufen von Fahrscheinen f&#252;r &#246;ffentliche 
      Verkehrsmittel decken k&#246;nnen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dar&#252;ber hinaus lancieren Monitise und Visa f&#252;r Kunden von Visa DPS, der 
      Verarbeitungsplattform von Visa f&#252;r Debit- und Prepaid-Karten, in den 
      USA eine Mobile-Banking-L&#246;sung. Dieser neue Dienst soll Visa-Kunden und 
      Verarbeitungspartnern in den USA die M&#246;glichkeit geben, ihren eigenen 
      Kunden rasch und auf wirksame Weise diverse Dienstleistungen, wie mobile 
      Zahlungen, Zahlungen von und an Privatpersonen, Benachrichtigungen bei 
      mobilen Transaktionen sowie mobile Marketingma&#223;nahmen, anzubieten.

      Visa ist ein im Zahlungsverkehr t&#228;tiges globales Technologieunternehmen, 
      das Verbrauchern, Gesch&#228;ften, Finanzinstituten und Beh&#246;rden in &#252;ber 200 
      L&#228;ndern und Territorien schnell, sicher und zuverl&#228;ssig Zugang zu 
      elektronischer W&#228;hrung gibt. Untermauert wird dieser Zugang durch 
      VisaNet, eines der fortschrittlichsten Verarbeitungsnetzwerke der Welt. 
      VisaNet kann &#252;ber 20.000 Transaktionen pro Sekunde bew&#228;ltigen, sch&#252;tzt 
      Verbraucher vor Betrugsf&#228;llen und garantiert H&#228;ndlern den 
      Zahlungseingang. Visa ist keine Bank, stellt keine Karten aus, gew&#228;hrt 
      keine Verl&#228;ngerungen der Zahlungsfrist und legt auch keine Tarife und 
      Geb&#252;hren f&#252;r Verbraucher fest. Die Innovationen von Visa machen es 
      jedoch m&#246;glich, dass Finanzinstitute den Verbrauchern eine gr&#246;&#223;ere 
      Auswahl bieten k&#246;nnen: Zahlungen k&#246;nnen gleich mit Debit-, im Voraus mit 
      Prepaid- oder im Nachhinein mit Kreditprodukten erledigt werden. Weitere

      Die Fundamo-Plattform Enterprise Mobile Financial Services ist so 
      konstruiert, dass sie im Einklang mit den Bed&#252;rfnissen von 
      Mobilfunkabonnenten konfiguriert und erweitert werden kann, damit diese 
      mit zunehmender Markts&#228;ttigung immer &#252;berzeugendere, ma&#223;geschneiderte 
      und differenzierte mobile Finanzdienstleistungen anbieten k&#246;nnen. Das 
      Unternehmen hat die Vision eines durchgehend verbundenen 
      Finanzdienstleistungsumfeldes, das die jederzeitige Verf&#252;gbarkeit und 
      Erreichbarkeit von Mobilger&#228;ten nutzt. Rund 50 Fundamo-Systeme befinden 
      sich in &#252;ber 40 L&#228;ndern im Einsatz, darunter 27 L&#228;nder in Afrika und im 
      Nahen und Mittleren Osten sowie weitere 10 auf der ganzen Welt.

      Beispiele f&#252;r solche zukunftsgerichteten Aussagen sind unter anderem das 
      Tempo der Einf&#252;hrung und das Erfolgspotenzial der mobilen Zahlungs- und 
      Banking-L&#246;sungen von Visa, die Anzahl und Gr&#246;&#223;enordnung der erreichbaren

      erzielten Ertr&#228;ge, das gesch&#228;ftliche Wachstum von Visa in

      Tats&#228;chliche Ergebnisse k&#246;nnen daher erheblich und auch auf ung&#252;nstige 
      Weise von solchen zukunftsgerichteten Aussagen abweichen, und zwar 
      aufgrund einer Vielzahl von Faktoren wie dem Risiko, dass das neue

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Today, ING CEO Jan Hommen will address the Goldman Sachs European Financials Conference in Paris, France. &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In his presentation, Jan Hommen will address ING's track record of delivery on the extensive restructuring of ING Group, including the actions that have been taken to separate Banking and Insurance in order to build strong businesses that are ready for the future. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;In this context, Jan Hommen will evaluate the substantial measures ING has taken since the peak of the crisis to derisk and deleverage the balance sheet while maintaining loan growth to service our clients. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Mr Hommen will also address the decisive actions ING has taken to further build its capital position, enabling repayment of the second tranche of state support in May 2011. He will reiterate ING's ambition to repay the remaining EUR 3 billion core Tier 1 securities from own resources from ING Bank. Proceeds from the divestment of the insurance businesses will be used to reduce leverage in both ING Group and Insurance. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Jan Hommen will also provide an update on the progress to meet the restructuring demands of the European Commission. ING is decisively yet prudently preparing the base case of two IPO's of the Insurance businesses while progress is being made to meet the other restructuring requirements of the EC. We continue to explore strategic options for our Latin American insurance, and we are taking steps towards the divestment of ING Direct USA.&#160;&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;Mr Hommen will finish his presentation by painting the picture of ING Bank post restructuring: a liability driven bank that is well positioned for the future, using its strong deposit gathering capability for future growth while managing its balance sheet efficiently through further integration. &#160;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp suffered a defeat on Thursday when the Supreme Court upheld a record $290 million jury verdict against the software giant for infringing a small Canadian company's patent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The justices unanimously agreed with a U.S. appeals court ruling that went against the world's largest software company in its legal battle with Toronto-based i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The high court refused to adopt Microsoft's lower standard to replace the long-standing requirement that a defendant in a patent infringement case prove by clear and convincing evidence that a plaintiff's patent is invalid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft had argued that a lower standard of proof involving a "preponderance of the evidence" would make some "bad" patents easier to invalidate while promoting innovation and competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who wrote the opinion, said the court rejected Microsoft's contention that a defendant need only persuade a jury of a patent's invalidity by a preponderance of the evidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Congress has prescribed the governing standard of proof, its choice generally controls, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Obama administration and i4i opposed Microsoft's position and said Congress had accepted the standard in effect for the past 28 years and the Supreme Court should uphold it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The legal battle began in 2007 when i4i sued Microsoft. A federal jury awarded $290 million to i4i after finding that Microsoft, in 2003 and 2007 versions of Word, its word processing application, had infringed i4i's patent relating to text manipulation software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A U.S. appeals court upheld the award, and the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office upheld the validity of the i4i patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft continued to dispute those decisions, but removed the contested features from its current software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In appealing to the Supreme Court, Microsoft said it wanted a new trial. But the justices ruled against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is not entirely over, however, since Microsoft also has a challenge to the patent pending at the patent office and may have to pay other potential licensing fees, said Michel Vulpe, i4i's founder and chief technology officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're very pleased that the court did the right thing," and that the decision was unanimous, Vulpe told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS CASE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Loudon Owen, i4i's chairman, said in a statement, "This is one of the most significant business cases the court has decided in decades."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it is the largest patent infringement verdict ever affirmed on appeal. It has also said it had set aside money for the verdict, so it was not material to its earnings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While the outcome is not what we had hoped for, we will continue to advocate for changes to the law that will prevent abuse of the patent system and protect inventors who hold patents representing true innovation," Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz said in an email statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Max Grant, a patent law attorney at Latham  Watkins, said that by upholding the status quo "the Supreme Court wisely left alone a complex area of the law that balances many competing interests."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's share price dipped when the decision was announced but quickly recovered and was little changed at $23.93 in afternoon trade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sotomayor wrote that any decision to change the standard in patent infringement cases would have to come from Congress. She noted that the standard of clear and convincing evidence was almost 30 years old and had been left untouched during previous congressional patent system reforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Inc, Yahoo Inc and trade groups such as the Computer  Communications Industry Association supported Microsoft, while Bayer AG, 3M Co and groups representing biotechnology companies and pharmaceutical manufacturers backed i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case was decided by eight of the nine Supreme Court members. Chief Justice John Roberts, who owns Microsoft stock, recused himself from the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Supreme Court case is Microsoft Corp v. i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc, No. 10-290.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt; * Costs of drilling higher than expected&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says future drilling programme would not be impacted
 (Adds Chevron comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HOUSTON, June 13 (Reuters) - Faroe Petroleum (FPM.L) said a
closely watched well it shared with Chevron Corp (CVX.N) in the UK
North Sea would be abandoned, citing the lack of a workable
reservoir system at the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Aberdeen-based oil and gas explorer, which operates in the
UK and Norwegian North Sea, also said drilling costs were higher
than expected, after bad weather and technical problems delayed
work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Faroe, which has a 10 percent stake in the Lagavulin licence,
said it found hydrocarbons and a working petroleum system at the
prospect west of Shetland region, but no reservoirs after drilling
1,567 metres (5,140 feet).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whilst the outcome of the well is a disappointment, the
presence of hydrocarbons has however now been proven and offers
encouragement to continue our deep water exploration plans in the
region," Chief Executive Graham Stewart said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company said it was well-funded, despite incurring
additional costs while drilling the Lagavulin well, and the result
would not impact its future drilling programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In November, Faroe said the Lagavulin well had a reserve
potential of 500 million barrels of oil equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron confirmed that it had completed drilling operations at
the Lagavulin well, which it started last October, in about 5,000
feet (1,520 m) of water 160 miles (257 km) north of the Shetland
Islands.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The well is now being plugged and abandoned," Chevron said in
a statement.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia's cushion of spare oil capacity would shrink to almost nothing if the kingdom quickly ramps up to 10 million barrels per day (bpd), Goldman Sachs' global head of commodities research said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week the kingdom said it would unilaterally produce as much oil as the market needed after the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries failed to reach agreement as a whole on output policy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Saudi newspaper al-Hayat reported Saudi Arabia would boost output to 10 million bpd in July, which Jeff Currie of Goldman Sachs said would leave only 500,000 bpd spare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you get up to (10 mln bpd) you start to really create a very tight market relative to spare capacity," he told the Reuters Global Energy and Climate Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But the question that's more appropriate is when do you get to 9.5, when do you get to 10? Because when you start to look out over the horizon, their ability to create more flexibility in spare capacity increases tremendously."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Extra output from Saudi Arabia would reflect increased refinery demand, said Currie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When you look at OPEC production, it's highly correlated to refinery runs in the key consuming regions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The ramp up in refining runs over the next six months will be very significant."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currie remained bullish on all the components of what he referred to as the "CCCP group" of commodities -- crude, copper, corn and soy beans and platinum -- because investment in them is subject to political and other constraints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the simple commodities story of the very end of the last century when the complex was driven by "decades of under-investment" had changed as high prices spurred investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Is the world a different place? Absolutely yes. It's no longer a structural bull market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the oil market, the strength has been concentrated on Brent, which on Monday traded at close to $120 a barrel and reached a record premium to U.S. crude of more than $20.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currie said the unusual spread between the two contracts reflected excess light, sweet crude in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a U.S. issue. There's a surplus of light, sweet crude in the U.S. Gulf Coast," Currie said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The distortion between the two benchmarks has been widely used as an argument for a third benchmark.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Currie said he saw the case for a sour market to complement Brent and U.S. crude futures, saying U.S. crude Mars, Middle Eastern grade Dubai and Russian Urals were all possible candidates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Emma Farge; editing by William Hardy)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The rebound in high corporate investment on capex is set to
continue, meaning companies producing capital goods will benefit, JPMorgan
Cazenove strategists say in a note.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The broker notes a sharp bounce in corporate spend from the lows of 2009,
and says capital good stocks have in aggregate outperformed the market by 30
percent. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "The capex upcycle is still in its early phase. In the past 11 cycles the
capex upswing tended to last for 16 quarters, and never shorter than five. We
have seen only four so far in the current cycle," the broker says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It says capex levels, as a percentage of GDP, are still below historical
averages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan says sector analysts advise positioning in names with end market
exposure to power, energy efficiency, oil  gas and metals  mining.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broker is "overweight" on ABB (ABBN.VX), Atlas Copco (ATCOa.ST),
Schneider (SCHN.PA), Weir Group (WEIR.L), Outotec (OTE1V.HE), Siemens

&lt;p&gt;NEW DELHI Jun 13 (Reuters) - Insurer and hospital operator
Max India on Monday said its board has allotted shares
to a unit of Goldman Sachs , sending its shares up by as
much as 10 percent. 	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Goldman Sachs unit picked up 9.1 percent stake in Max
India for about 5.22 billion rupees ($116 million) following
conversion of debentures, Mohit Talwar, director, corporate
development, told Reuters over the telephone.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board allotted about 24 million equity shares of 2 rupees
each at a premium of 214.75 rupees per equity share on
conversion of compulsorily convertible debentures to Xenok Ltd,
a unit of GS Capital Partners VI Fund, Max said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The investment by Goldman Sachs fund shows its long-term
commitment," Talwar said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 2.07 p.m., shares in Max India, valued at $866 million,
were trading up 8.1 percent at 180.15 rupees in a flat Mumbai
market .	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (1$=44.9 rupees)

&lt;p&gt;HELSINKI (Reuters) - Logitech expects a boost in its business from Microsoft's $8.5 billion acquisition of Skype as the deal should lift wider take-up of videocommunications, a senior executive told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Craig Malloy, co-founder and chief executive of Logitech's LifeSize unit, dismissed analysts' fears that Microsoft's acquisition of Skype created further risks to it and other video technology providers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is a good thing. I do not see it negatively impacting our business at all. It has increased awareness and demand for videoconferencing," Malloy told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft would have not paid $8.5 billion if they did not see a massive new market here. There is an enormous amount of growth left in this industry. There are many, many years of high growth left," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Logitech, maker of computer mice, speakers, webcams and keyboards, bought Lifesize for $405 million in 2009. Wider take-up of videoconferencing could also boost sales of its webcams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say companies such as Logitech's Lifesize were first in line to be hit if Microsoft succeeds in turning Skype more toward businesses, but Malloy said that was unlikely as Microsoft has its own strong enterprise videocommunications offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Skype was moving into enterprise and was a bit of the wildcard. It is likely going to be the consumer videoconferencing business of Microsoft," Malloy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cheaper end of the $3 billion videoconferencing equipment market is already suffering from inroads that Skype and other video applications are making in the market, historically controlled by stand-alone conferencing devices in offices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Malloy said the fast growth of desktop videoconferencing would not replace demand for dedicated equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A dedicated device will always do a better job," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say some replacement, especially in the lower end of dedicated videoconferencing equipment, will probably happen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month research firm Ovum forecast the market for videoconferencing gear to grow an average 6 percent a year through 2016, with the take-up of desktop applications hitting sales of cheaper conferencing room equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growing market has spurred a wave of acquisitions in the sector, with Cisco splashing more than $3 billion on Norwegian firm Tandberg, and Polycom buying HP's videoconferencing unit only this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Will Waterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) -- JPMorgan Chase  Co shuffled several retail banking executives, signaling Chief Executive Jamie Dimon's determination to rebuild the bank's profits and elevate in-house talent to high-profile roles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a statement released on Tuesday, the bank said retail banking chief Charlie Scharf was moving to the company's private equity arm and that other senior executives were taking on additional responsibilities in his former division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Todd Maclin, 55, chief executive of JPMorgan's commercial bank, will continue in that position and also have responsibilities for the company's branch network, consumer franchise, small-business banking and private banking business, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gordon Smith, 52, CEO of card services, will take on responsibility for the company's auto finance and student lending business, on top of his current role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, 55, talking to Reuters in an interview after the announcement, said the changes should contribute to his push to raise the bank's profits. "This should help us," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Sometimes it is good to have a fresh pair of eyes looking at things," Dimon added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said Scharf, 46, had told him a year ago that he wanted to do something different at the bank. "It was his decision to go, and when that happens I have to figure out who is going to do his job. It takes a while to get all of the ducks in a row."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The businesses that Scharf was responsible for will now be overseen by Maclin, Smith, and Frank Bisignano, Dimon's chief administrative officer whom he assigned in February to fix the retail bank's mortgage business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a memo to staff, Dimon said Scharf "will continue to work with our consumer team to help transition the business and assist in any way possible."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shifts come as JPMorgan tries to strengthen its retail banking arm, which is being hurt by low demand for loans and hit by growing regulatory demands that will squeeze profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The retail financial services segment fell the furthest short of its profit goals of any JPM segment in 2010, with a return on equity of 9 percent compared with a target of 30 percent, according to a report by analyst Christopher Mutascio of brokerage Stifel Nicolaus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank also said its investment banking head, Jes Staley, will assume oversight of its business outside of the United States, taking over from Heidi Miller, 58, who will retire early next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon said the moves were not an explicit part of the company's preparations for his eventual successor, but he added: "It is always good to cross-train people."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MORTGAGE CHIEF PUSHED OUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank said in a separate memo to staff on Tuesday that its chief of home lending, David Lowman, would be leaving. He had been pushed aside in February after the bank racked up billions of dollars in losses on mortgages and became mired in litigation over foreclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Dave Lowman and I have decided he will leave the firm," Bisignano said in the memo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowman joined JPMorgan from Citigroup in 2006. During his tenure at JPMorgan, the bank picked up bad mortgage assets through its acquisitions of investment bank Bear Stearns  Co and retail bank Washington Mutual.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Lowman, the home lending unit was so disorganized that the bank seized homes of at least 33 U.S. military servicemen on active duty, violating federal law and prompting Dimon to apologize at the company's annual shareholder meeting. The bank has said it is forgiving those loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowman could not immediately be reached for comment on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lowman appeared before congressional committees last year where he was chastised for his division's refusal to cooperate with borrowers and modify mortgages. Lowman said in a June 2010 hearing that the bank was understaffed but was adding employees to work on problem mortgages. In a hearing in November, Lowman acknowledged mistakes in foreclosure paperwork and said the bank was cleaning up errors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan and other large banks are in negotiations with the Department of Justice and state attorneys general to settle probes into mistakes in foreclosures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank recorded $1.1 billion in litigation expenses in the first quarter, primarily because of mortgage-related claims.

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects paragraphs 1-2 and removes paragraph 4 to clarify
that Goldman is interested in expanding private wealth
management but not in building a mass-market brokerage
business. Also removes reference to sale of mortgage
business.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N)
Chief Executive Lloyd Blankfein said on Tuesday he has no
interest in expanding the investment bank's wealth management
unit for wealthy investors into a broader retail brokerage
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As he was leaving a Reuters-sponsored discussion on China
between former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and former
Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, Blankfein said expanding into
brokerage for mass affluent investors is "not happening."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman, which has been in the eye of a regulatory and
Congressional storm over charges that it favored some clients
with trading information and the structuring of securitized
mortgages at the expense of others, has never focused on small
investors as a business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nevertheless, Goldman has an asset management business that
sells investment products to individual investors through
outside advisers and brokers, as well as a small group of
in-house brokers who offer very wealthy individuals access to
the equity offerings, alternative investments and other
products reserved primarily for institutional clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In November 2009, when Blankfein said at a Merrill Lynch
conference that he aimed to get Goldman's brokerage force into
the "high hundreds," the firm had about 350 advisers. A
recruiter who was working with Goldman at the time said the
firm was looking to hire relatively junior, malleable advisers
who had clients with about $10 million of assets to invest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the summer of 2007, Goldman tried to jump-start its
wealth management area by hiring Peter Scaturro, a private
banking veteran, but he left as head of the unit within two
years.

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) is taking advantage of low natural gas prices by acquiring acreage in shale basins around the United States as it leverages drilling expertise from its purchase of XTO Energy Inc, a senior company executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unrest in the Middle East and North Africa helped push crude oil prices over $100 per barrel while huge supplies of natural gas have depressed prices in that market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The price disparity has prompted many smaller energy companies to shift spending to oil drilling, paving the way deeper-pocketed Exxon to swoop in and strike good deals for natural gas assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think the market dynamics are set up to where you can potentially get good value, so we will continue to look," Jack Williams, president of Exxon's XTO unit, told the Reuters Global Energy and Climate Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon bought natural gas company XTO a year ago for $30 billion in a wager that demand for natural gas will rise in coming years as electricity consumption increases. The deal has been criticized by investors for creating earnings dilution, but Exxon is growing XTO through the purchase of hundreds of thousands of shale gas acres which were once too costly to drill.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XTO MARKS THE SPOT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the deal closed last June, Williams told Reuters that Exxon's XTO has added 13 trillion cubic feet of natural gas it expects to produce, bolstering the 60 trillion cubic feet of gas reserves already the unit already has on the books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon's appetite for gas assets has grown quickly. Earlier this month it completed a $1.7 billion purchase of acreage in the Marcellus Shale in the eastern United States. In that deal, the company purchased 317,000 acres for about $5,000 per acre, below the average price of about $6,000 per acre, according to Houston-based energy investment bank Simmons  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Irving, Texas company has also picked up other parcels ranging from 5,000 acres to 10,000 acres in basins including the Haynesville Shale in Louisiana and the Fayetteville Shale in Arkansas, Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expansion is fueling the need for workers. Exxon's XTO unit has  so far added about 400 jobs since the merger was completed, bringing the business' payroll to 3,700, Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other companies seeking to capitalize on higher crude prices are spending richly to acquire acreage in hot spots like the Eagle Ford Shale in South Texas. That activity has driven the price per acre up to $20,000 per acre, a price too rich for Exxon, Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When we see some reasonable value, we'll look harder," Williams said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Exxon has some rigs in drilling for oil and natural gas liquids in the Eagle Ford and Permian basin, Williams said, adding that the company is drilling profitably for gas in basins like the Barnett Shale in North Texas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll continue to look at liquids plays but we're not running from gas plays either," the executive said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon closed up $1.15, or nearly 1.5 percent, to $80.38 in afternoon New York Stock Exchange trading.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Braden Redall, Michael Erman, Chris Baltimore, Kristen Hays, Ernest Scheyder and Matt Robinson in Houston)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BETHESDA, Maryland (Reuters) - Robert Rock's preparations for this week's U.S. Open at Congressional Country Club have been hampered because of visa problems, causing him to miss Tuesday's deadline for registration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rock won his maiden European Tour title at the Italian Open in Turin on Sunday but was unable to travel directly from there to the United States for the year's second major.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, the 34-year-old Englishman flew from Italy to London where he was trying to obtain a U.S. visa at short notice, a European Tour official told Reuters at Congressional on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rock had booked his place in this week's U.S. Open via an international qualifying event at Walton Heath, England last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should he not make it to Congressional in time for Thursday's opening round, his spot would be offered to first alternate and fellow Briton Richie Ramsay, organizers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rock, who ended a nine-year wait for his first European Tour title with a one-shot victory in Turin, was one of just four players in the 156-strong field yet to register for this week's U.S. Open.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Frank Pingue)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today that Heidi Miller, 
      President of its International business, will retire from the firm in 
      early 2012. The company also announced new responsibilities for a number 
      of other senior leaders in its U.S. and consumer-related businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ms. Miller has played key roles throughout her 30+ year career in 
      banking and finance, including Chief Financial Officer of Citigroup and 
      Bank One, a member of the Bank One Board of Directors and other large 
      corporate boards, CEO of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Treasury  Securities Services 
      business, and most recently, President of International.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said: &#8220;Heidi has been a valued 
      member of our Operating Committee and a trusted advisor to me over the 
      years, and she has also served as a role model to countless others 
      inside and outside of our firm. We&#8217;ll miss her greatly and wish her all 
      the best in whatever she chooses to do next.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon added: &#8220;In her role as President of International, Heidi worked 
      closely with our key business leaders to help develop a comprehensive 
      and coordinated international business strategy, growth plan and 
      governance structure. She furthered our efforts in expanding the ranks 
      of our global corporate bankers, and she helped us do a better job 
      deepening and coordinating our client coverage efforts around the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jes Staley, CEO of the firm&#8217;s Investment Bank, will assume additional 
      responsibility for overseeing and coordinating the firm&#8217;s international 
      franchise across all of its businesses. This is consistent with Heidi 
      Miller&#8217;s recommendation that responsibilities for international 
      activities be embedded back into the businesses. Importantly, Jes will 
      partner closely with the CEOs of the firm&#8217;s other wholesale 
      international businesses &#8211; Mike Cavanagh in Treasury  Securities 
      Services and Mary Erdoes in Asset Management &#8211; ensuring that our 
      wholesale businesses and products, wherever they are based, are 
      receiving the investments, the people, the focus and the prioritization 
      they need to grow and be successful.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Separately, Charlie Scharf, CEO of Retail Financial Services, will 
      become a Partner in One Equity Partners, the firm&#8217;s private equity arm. 
      Mr. Scharf&#8217;s years of senior operating experience and his financial 
      expertise will be extremely valuable to the firm&#8217;s private equity 
      franchise. He will also continue to work with the consumer team to help 
      transition the business and assist in any way possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Charlie has played a critical role in building our Retail franchise 
      into one of the top players in the industry &#8211; successfully integrating 
      the Bank One, Chase, Bank of New York and Washington Mutual businesses 
      and helping expand our branch footprint across the United States,&#8221; said 
      Jamie Dimon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Todd Maclin, head of the Commercial Bank, will assume additional 
      responsibilities for the company&#8217;s Retail business, including the branch 
      network, consumer franchise, small business banking and the Chase 
      private client business. He will continue as CEO of the Commercial Bank. 
      Mr. Maclin has partnered closely with the Retail team and branch network 
      over the years as he has helped build the firm&#8217;s industry-leading 
      commercial bank. Doug Petno, Chief Operating Officer of the Commercial 
      Bank, will continue in his role reporting to Maclin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Frank Bisignano, Chief Administrative Officer and Head of Home Lending, 
      will continue in both of these roles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gordon Smith, CEO of Card Services, will take on responsibility for the 
      firm&#8217;s Auto Finance and Student Lending businesses, in addition to his 
      current role. To better leverage the power of the Chase brand and ensure 
      more consistency, Mr. Smith will take on a new role managing all 
      Chase-branded marketing across our Chase products and services. In this 
      role, he&#8217;ll partner closely with senior marketers across the firm&#8217;s 
      business and corporate functions.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			pSivida and Pfizer Amend Agreement to Focus Solely on Development of 
      Sustained-Release Implant to Deliver Latanoprost for Ocular Hypertension 
      and Glaucoma
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			pSivida to receive up to $168m plus royalties
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Drug delivery company pSivida Corp (NASDAQ:PSDV)(ASX:PVA) today 
      announced it amended and restated its Research and Development Agreement 
      with Pfizer Inc. (NYSE:PFE) to focus solely on the development of a 
      long-term, sustained-release implant to deliver latanoprost for patients 
      with ocular hypertension and glaucoma. The proposed implant is a 
      bioerodible version of pSivida&#8217;s proprietary Durasert&#8482; technology system 
      and is designed to be injected into the subconjunctival space of the eye.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under this revised agreement, Pfizer will make an initial payment of 
      $2.3 million. pSivida will, with technical assistance from Pfizer, have 
      the right to develop the glaucoma product candidate through Phase II 
      clinical trials. At that point, Pfizer may exercise its option for an 
      exclusive, worldwide license to develop and commercialize the product 
      candidate in return for a $20 million payment, double-digit royalty 
      payments on any sales of the product and additional development, 
      regulatory and sales performance milestone payments of up to $146.5 
      million. If Pfizer does not exercise its option, pSivida will retain the 
      right to develop and commercialize the glaucoma product on its own or 
      with a partner. As part of the amended agreement, pSivida regains all 
      rights to its intellectual property in ophthalmic applications 
      previously included in the original Research and Collaboration Agreement 
      other than that required for the latanoprost implant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Pfizer is an excellent partner, and we are pleased to be entering into 
      this new stage of our relationship involving development of a 
      potentially enhanced glaucoma product,&#8221; said Dr. Paul Ashton, President 
      and CEO of pSivida. &#8220;The $2.3 million payment from Pfizer comes on top 
      of the approximately $7.0 million in RD support we have already 
      received from Pfizer since we first started our partnership in 2007. We 
      believe that regaining rights to intellectual property in the ophthalmic 
      arena outside the scope of the amended agreement is a key step for our 
      Company.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Yvonne Greenstreet, Senior Vice President and Head of the Medicines 
      Development Group for Pfizer&#8217;s Specialty Care Business Unit, added, 
      &#8220;Latanoprost is the most commonly prescribed drug for reduction of 
      intraocular pressure in the treatment of ocular hypertension and 
      glaucoma. If successfully developed and approved by regulatory 
      authorities, using pSivida&#8217;s unique drug-delivery technology to deliver 
      latanoprost could play a significant role in addressing compliance 
      issues associated with a daily eye drop regimen for the treatment of 
      glaucoma.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About pSivida
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      pSivida partnered ILUVIEN&#174;, another product based on pSivida&#8217;s Durasert 
      technology system, with Alimera Sciences, Inc.. Alimera recently 
      resubmitted a New Drug Application to the U.S. Food  Drug 
      Administration for approval of ILUVIEN in the treatment of diabetic 
      macular edema, and a decision is expected in the fourth quarter of this 
      calendar year. Under the terms of this agreement, pSivida has received 
      approximately $30 million in license fees, milestones and other 
      payments. FDA approval would trigger a $25 million milestone payment, 
      and pSivida would be entitled to receive 20% of Alimera&#8217;s profits (as 
      defined) on sales of ILUVIEN for DME.

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Jun 14 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Seven Step Recruiting, a leading provider of outsourced recruitment
services, announced that General Motors (GM) has chosen Seven Step as
GM's exclusive recruitment services partner. The automotive giant
selected Seven Step to manage all salaried recruiting and hiring
activities in the company's North American operations. Seven Step will
create and deliver a custom recruitment process outsourcing (RPO)
solution for GM in conjunction with IBM, a key recruitment technology
partner. IBM formally named Seven Step as its preferred RPO partner in
February 2010. 

    "General Motors is in the midst of a vast reshaping of its product lines
and hiring practices in anticipation of the changing demands of the
increasingly high-technology auto industry," said Sean Vanderelzen,
senior manager of GM Global Talent Acquisition. "As an organization, we
have re-focused on designing, building, and selling cars -- and hiring
the very best talent with the right skills is hugely important. Seven
Step's recruitment process outsourcing will not only ensure we find and
hire the right staff, but also allow GM to move forward as a more
flexible and nimble organization."

    In 2009 and 2010, Seven Step worked with IBM Human-Capital Management to
eliminate a 1,000-position backlog in under six months, increase hiring
manager satisfaction from 17 to 95 percent, and fill more than 9,000 open
positions for a Fortune 100 insurance company. Seven Step and IBM have
built on this success in working with General Motors, as approximately
1,000 hires have already been made.

    Seven Step and IBM have also been instrumental in increasing GM's
diversity hiring. Seven Step led the recruiting efforts for the Society
of Hispanic Professional Engineers (SHPE) conference, where 153
candidates were sourced by the recruitment team within a 10-day period,
and of those candidates, 131 were selected for interviews.

    "Working with IBM to support GM's complex hiring needs has validated our
results-oriented approach to outsource recruitment," said Paul Harty,
president of Seven Step Recruiting. "We have implemented clear
measurement and accountability standards that have given GM great
confidence in our abilities."

			F5 Optimizes Microsoft Unified Communications for A.T. Kearney
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Global management consulting firm uses BIG-IP solutions to 
      maximize reliability and performance of Exchange, SharePoint, and Lync 
      Server 2010 applications
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			F5 
      Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:FFIV), the global leader in Application 
      Delivery Networking (ADN), today announced that A.T. 
      Kearney, a global management consulting firm, is using F5&#174;
			BIG-IP&#174; 
      solutions to maximize the value of its IT investments, mitigate 
      expansion costs for branch offices, and provide superior application 
      availability and reliability for users worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nearly 70 percent of A.T. Kearney&#8217;s 3,500 users work remotely. They 
      depend heavily on Microsoft Office Communications Server, Exchange 
      Server, SharePoint 
      Server, and other unified communications (UC) and collaboration 
      products to work with clients and colleagues on complex projects. 
      Because these applications are critical to the firm&#8217;s business, they 
      needed to be highly reliable and available to all users worldwide. A.T. 
      Kearney wanted to serve these applications from both of its Chicago-area 
      data centers, but the previous Cisco layer 
      4 switching infrastructure made it difficult to connect the two 
      sites and impossible to load balance traffic between them. As a result, 
      one data center was active while the other&#8212;used only for disaster 
      recovery capabilities&#8212;sat virtually dormant.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;F5&#8217;s close integration 
      with Microsoft&#8217;s UC platform played heavily into our decision,&#8221; said 
      Kevin Rice, Global Network Architect at A.T. Kearney. &#8220;We went with the 
      F5 solution because it gives us that crucial reliability we need for our 
      Office Communications Server and Lync Server 2010 deployments. In 
      addition, F5 was the only solution that enabled us to seamlessly connect 
      our two data centers and intelligently manage and steer traffic between 
      them. This enabled us to fully utilize our high-end data center 
      resources and avoid adding new infrastructure in our branch offices.&#8221; 
      With the F5 solution, A.T. Kearney was also able to repurpose many 
      high-end servers from its secondary data center and redeploy them in 
      branch locations to provide local file and print services.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A.T. Kearney chose F5&#8217;s BIG-IP 
      Local Traffic Manager&#8482; (LTM&#174;) and BIG-IP 
      Global Traffic Manager&#8482; (GTM&#8482;) to dynamically 
      manage traffic across the firm&#8217;s global network. In each data center, 
      BIG-IP LTM devices sit in front of the Microsoft application servers and 
      web servers, intelligently securing, load balancing, and accelerating 
      application traffic. BIG-IP GTM connects the two data centers and 
      automatically routes user requests&#8212;whether they originate in Tokyo, 
      Dubai, London, San Francisco, etc.&#8212;to the best performing site based on 
      network and data center conditions, business policies, user location, 
      and application performance.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;After deploying the F5 products, we immediately noticed the performance 
      of our application servers&#8212;especially SharePoint&#8212;just went through the 
      roof. And suddenly, files took seconds instead of minutes to download,&#8221; 
      noted Rice.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Rice&#8217;s team also used an F5 
      Application Ready Solution to upgrade existing servers from 
      Microsoft&#8217;s Office Communications Server 2007 to Lync Server 2010. &#8220;The 
      application-specific templates and configuration guide included in F5&#8217;s 
      Application Ready Solution greatly simplified the upgrade process and 
      the provisioning of new virtual servers for our Lync Server 2010 
      deployment,&#8221; he added.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As the mobile workforce continues to grow and workers rely more heavily 
      on their UC applications, it&#8217;s critical that enterprises have stable and 
      reliable unified communications infrastructures,&#8221; said Jason Needham, 
      Senior Director of Product Management at F5. &#8220;With F5&#8217;s Application 
      Ready Solution for Microsoft Lync Server 2010, organizations benefit 
      from integrated health monitoring, intelligent traffic management, and 
      network optimizations that result in a highly available and responsive 
      solution capable of supporting the demands of real-time communications.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt; * Technician burned while working on coker&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Exxon, union investigating injury&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON, June 15 (Reuters) - A technician was injured
Tuesday afternoon while working on a coking unit at Exxon Mobil
Corp's 560,640 barrel per day (bpd) Baytown, Texas, refinery, a
union official said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The technician, whose name was not released, was operating
a steam vent valve on the refinery's flexicoker, when he was
burned on the neck, shoulder and back, said Ricky Brooks,
president of United Steelworkers union local 13-2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The worker was flown by helicopter to a Houston hospital,
according to the Baytown police. He is expected to recover.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The flexicoker continued operating, Brooks said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon spokeswoman said the company was investigating the
incident.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We regret that an Exxon Mobil employee working in the
Baytown Complex was injured Tuesday afternoon," said Kristen
Hellmer. We are committed to conducting an immediate
investigation to better understand what happened."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brooks said the union welcomed the probe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's a very sad day for myself and our membership," he
said. "We're going to be actively involved in the
investigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon's Baytown refinery is the nation's largest.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Sly Stone, the reclusive funk legend whose career was crippled by rampant drug abuse, pleaded not guilty to possession of cocaine rocks on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 68-year-old frontman for Sly and the Family Stone was arrested April 1 when Los Angeles police pulled over a live-in van for a minor traffic violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocaine rocks were found in the clothing of both Stone, who was a passenger, and the driver, according to the singer's defense attorneys. Both men were arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of musicians hang out with people who have drugs. How are they supposed to know?" said Peter Knecht, one of his attorneys. He insisted the cocaine did not belong to Stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone, whose real name is Sylvester Stewart, is next scheduled to appear in court in the Los Angeles suburb of Van Nuys for a pretrial conference on July 19. His arraignment was originally scheduled for last Friday, but he was hospitalized for heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone, a veteran of the San Francisco power scene, revolutionized soul music with tunes such as "Don't Call me Nigger, Whitey" and "I Want to Take You Higher" that both fed on and fueled the political and social turmoil of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His career, however, was marred by decades of run-ins with the law. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, he was plagued by drug and gun possession charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't punish a guy for what he did 40 years ago, 30 years ago," said Knecht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone made his first major public appearance in almost 13 years at the Grammy Awards in 2006 when he was the object of an all-star tribute. Sporting a blond Mohawk and a shiny white jacket, he sauntered out on stage during a performance of "I Want to Take You Higher," but left before the song was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone just finished recording a new album that will be released on August 16, according to Tim Yasui, general manager for Cleopatra Records. It would mark his first album in almost 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dean Goodman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON (Reuters) - Chevron Corp plans to take a measured approach to shale gas development despite a flurry of deals in the past year and the industry's huge ambitions for the emerging resource.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. oil company added 228,000 acres in the Marcellus shale in May to follow up on its $3.2 billion acquisition of Atlas Energy, which gave Chevron its first big stake in the northeastern U.S. field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That followed the $30 billion purchase of leading gas producer XTO by larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp, which moved the discussion of shale development to center stage among both industry players and policymakers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You're not going to see Chevron -- I can't speak for others -- just shift the whole business into shale, and let other things go," Bobby Ryan, Chevron's vice president for global exploration, said at the Reuters Global Energy and Climate Summit in Houston on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;XTO President Jack Williams told the summit the previous day that his company was taking advantage of low natural gas prices to snap up acreage in shale basins around the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan reiterated that Chevron's focus areas remained the Gulf of Mexico, West Africa and Western Australia, which were all part of a "balanced portfolio" approach to exploration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Shale is just one more piece of that portfolio," he said. "Do we sit around the table, shuddering a bit reacting to headlines? No. I think you've seen from us a very measured approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POLAND CHALLENGE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Exxon and others, Chevron is exploring shale acreage in Eastern Europe, and will drill its first well in Poland this year. A recent trip there reminded Ryan of the project's scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You know how long it takes to drive a million acres?" Ryan said of his tour of Chevron's acreage there. "You can only look at Google Earth so much. You get a sense of the countryside and the people and the villages, and meet a lot of the officials."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that success in Eastern European shale would require massive infrastructure investments, since the region was not set up for it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's something we'll all have to address," he said. "I'd like to believe, from an industry perspective, we've done it before, we'll be able to do it again."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ryan declined to address comments last week from Russia's Rosneft on Chevron exiting their Black Sea project, except to say discussions continued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's really no different than what we've done in other places: get together, talk about opportunities. Sometimes they mesh, sometimes they don't," he said. "That's what happens everywhere from there to the Gulf of Mexico."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the U.S. Gulf, Chevron recently got clearance for a few wells already under development, and its program includes 10 development and exploration plans and 15 drilling permit applications in "various stages" of approval or preparation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Increased scrutiny from U.S. regulators after last year's massive Gulf oil spill led to delays in permit awards, which have started to pick up in the past few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's a combination of a set of new rules that not everybody understands on both sides," Ryan said. "It's not near the pace that we would like yet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for fluctuations in oil and gas prices, the executive said his 32 years of experience had taught him to plan on a far longer time scale when exploring for hydrocarbons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We pick up leases in times of high prices and times of low prices," Ryan said. "We have about a billion barrels a year produced, so exploration activity now may not come on production for 10, 15, 20 years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Braden Reddall, Matt Daily, Anna Driver, Bruce Nichols, Kristen Hays, Mike Erman and Ernest Scheyder, editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;   * Parties settle dispute over documents&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Settlement details not immediately unavailable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Judge gives Lehman green light to auction NYC building
 (Recasts first sentence, adds plans by Lehman to sell
property, mortgage portfolios)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Nick Brown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
LEHMQ.PK has resolved a document production dispute with
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) in an ongoing fight over whether
Goldman had a role in rumors Lehman believes exacerbated its
collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two sides announced the settlement at a hearing on
Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan before Judge
James Peck, but did not immediately give details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman asked Goldman in March to produce papers relating to
rumors that may have played a role in its collapse -- and that
it says may have originated from Goldman employees. Goldman has
said its trading records show it had no financial motive to
harm Lehman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May, Lehman accused Goldman of intentionally moving at a
"glacial" pace to run out the statute of limitations, and asked
a judge to impose a two-week time limit for Goldman to produce
the documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In court papers filed Monday evening, Goldman said it
should be reimbursed by Lehman for the cost of defending
against the failed bank's attempts to "harass" it with
unreasonable demands for speedy document production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said in the filings that it has worked "diligently"
to cooperate with the document request.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008. Goldman is part of a group of banks fighting
with Lehman and others for control of the roughly $60 billion
payback plan for creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman has said it wants to probe "rumor mongering" that it
says undermined its reputation and contributed to the
shortselling it contends had a role in its collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; REAL ESTATE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on Wednesday, Peck gave Lehman the green light to
auction a former office building in Manhattan, overruling an
objection from a group of Lehman bondholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman, which was forced to foreclose on the building after
a developer could not repay nearly $230 million in loans, has
reached a $161.5 million minimum or "stalking horse" agreement
with an entity called 1107 Broadway Owner LLC, and plans to
hold an auction June 29.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bondholders, an ad hoc group led by hedge fund Paulson
 Co, called the agreement a "bad business deal," saying it
supplies less than half of what creditors are owed on the
properties.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gerard Uzzi, an attorney for the bondholders, said the
proposed price does not represent a premium on the property's
market value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bill Fitts, a managing director at Alvarez  Marsal, the
firm in charge of Lehman during its bankruptcy, said at
Wednesday's hearing that he thought there was a "significant
chance" the ultimate auction price will exceed the stalking
horse figure. He said the deal will avoid costly litigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also Wednesday, Peck approved Lehman's plan to sell two
reverse mortgage portfolios to MetLife (MET.N) for $43.4
million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman said the proceeds will be used to pay off its Aurora
Bank unit, which took over payment obligations on the
portfolios in the wake of Lehman's financial troubles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-13555.

&lt;p&gt; * Cablecom denies media reports&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Reports come as broadcaster Televisa expands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, June 15 (Reuters) - Mexican cable company
Cablecom said on Wednesday it did not plan to sell a stake to
broadcaster Televisa, contrary to a report in the Excelsior
newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Excelsior columnist Dario Celis reported earlier this week
that Televisa (TV.N) (TLVACPO.MX)  reached a deal to buy 49
percent of Cablecom for an undisclosed amount, with an option
to purchase the rest at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They are only rumors, we have not had talks with them
(Televisa)," Carlos Bustamante, an executive in Cablecom's
finance department, told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa, the world's biggest producer of Spanish-language
shows, was not available for comment. Its shares gained 0.18
percent on Wednesday after gaining more than 3 percent the
previous session on the Excelsior report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The broadcaster has purchased cable companies in recent
years to expand outside the Mexico City area, where its
Cablevision (CABLECPO.MX) unit is the main provider of cable
television services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cablecom, which offers cable television service in 16
states mostly in central and southern Mexico, could be a good
addition to Televisa's portfolio. The Mexico City-headquartered
company also offers Internet and phone services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Santander said in a report on Wednesday that Cablecom had
around 800,000 clients. Televisa units Cablevision, Cablemas,
and TVI had a combined 2 million video subscribers as of the
end of March.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 15 (Reuters) - JPMorgan (JPM.N) has named
Daniel Pinto, one of its top European investment bankers, as the
head of its overall Europe, Middle East and Africa business, a
spokeswoman for the bank said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Pinto, co-head of European investment banking along with
Emilio Saracho, will remain in that role but also take on a much
broader remit, overseeing asset management and other businesses
within the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CEO job for EMEA is a newly created one, though former
co-head of investment banking Bill Winters, who left JPMorgan in
2009, held the role informally.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The appointment follows a big reshuffle among JPMorgan's top
ranks earlier this week, with retail banking chief Charlie
Scharf moving to the company's private equity arm and other
senior executives taking on additional responsibilities in his
former division.[ID:nN14197094]

&lt;p&gt;BETHESDA, Maryland (Reuters) - Robert Rock's desperate bid to make his U.S. Open debut this week at Congressional Country Club was back on track on Wednesday after he finally obtained a United States visa.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 34-year-old Briton had missed Tuesday's deadline for registration at Congressional because he was still in London arranging the necessary travel documentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, Rock managed to get his visa at the U.S. embassy despite the short notice and was expected to arrive later on Wednesday, a European Tour official told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Rock will be delighted to take up his place in the year's second major, he is likely to set off in Thursday's opening round without having seen much of the hosting par-71 Congressional layout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Englishman is scheduled to tee off at 2:19 p.m. EDT in the company of Kevin Chappell and South Korean Kim Do-hoon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rock, who won his maiden European Tour title at the Italian Open in Turin on Sunday, booked his place at the U.S. Open via an international qualifying event at Walton Heath, England last month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should he not make it to Congressional in time for the opening round, his spot would be offered to first alternate and fellow Briton Richie Ramsay, organizers said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ramsay also competed in the Walton Heath qualifier but opted to skip a playoff to decide the remaining U.S. Open berth in order to try to attend a friend's wedding reception.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After missing the flight to fellow professional Gareth Maybin's reception, Ramsay returned to the Walton Heath course on the outskirts of London but missed out on the playoff by a matter of minutes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Swede Johan Edfors won the playoff in near darkness when he beat Denmark's Andreas Harto at the first extra hole.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Julian Linden)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Parties settle dispute over documents - court hearing&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Settlement details still unavailable&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Nick Brown&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc
(LEHLQ.PK) has cleared up a document production dispute with
Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) in a fight over Goldman's role
in alleged rumors that may have exacerbated Lehman's collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two sides announced the settlement at a hearing on
Wednesday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan, but have not
yet revealed details. The hearing is ongoing before Judge James
Peck.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman asked Goldman in March to produce papers relating to
rumors that may have played a role in its collapse -- and that
may have originated from Goldman employees. In May, the company
accused Goldman of intentionally moving at a "glacial" pace to
run out the statute of limitations, and asked a judge to order
Goldman to impose a two-week time-limit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In court papers filed Monday evening, Goldman said it
should be reimbursed by Lehman for the cost of defending
against the failed bank's attempts to "harass" it with
unreasonable demands for speedy document production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it has worked "diligently" to cooperate with
the document request, a fact Lehman has chosen to ignore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lehman filed the biggest bankruptcy in U.S. history in
September 2008. Goldman is part of a group of banks fighting
with Lehman and other creditors for control of the roughly $60
billion payback plan for creditors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is In re Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-13555.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Some of us are born to be bad, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we have to like it. 
      Walt Disney Animation Studios and Emmy&#174;-winning director Rich Moore 
      (TV&#8217;s &#8220;The Simpsons,&#8221; &#8220;Futurama&#8221;) take moviegoers on a hilarious, 
      video-game-hopping journey in &#8220;Wreck-It Ralph,&#8221; the story of an arcade 
      game Bad Guy determined to prove he can be a Good Guy. Produced by Clark 
      Spencer (&#8220;Lilo  Stitch,&#8221; &#8220;Bolt&#8221;) and featuring the voices of John C. 
      Reilly, Sarah Silverman, Jack McBrayer and Jane Lynch, the CG comedy 
      adventure will hit theaters on Nov. 2, 2012, and will be presented in 
      Disney Digital 3D&#8482; in select theaters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Says Moore, &#8220;I love the idea of a very simple 8-bit video game character 
      struggling with the complex question: &#8216;isn't there more to life than the 
      role I've been assigned?&#8217; In his quest for the answer, we journey with 
      our hero through three visually distinct video game worlds. It's unlike 
      anything anyone's seen before, and I'm thrilled to be to creating it 
      here at Walt Disney Animation Studios.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wreck-It Ralph (voice of Reilly) longs to be as beloved as his game&#8217;s 
      perfect Good Guy, Fix-It Felix (voice of McBrayer). Problem is, nobody 
      loves a Bad Guy. But they do love heroes&#8230; so when a modern, first-person 
      shooter game arrives featuring tough-as-nails Sergeant Calhoun (voice of 
      Lynch), Ralph sees it as his ticket to heroism and happiness. He sneaks 
      into the game with a simple plan&#8212;win a medal&#8212;but soon wrecks everything, 
      and accidentally unleashes a deadly enemy that threatens every game in 
      the arcade. Ralph&#8217;s only hope? Vanellope von Schweetz (voice of 
      Silverman), a young troublemaking &#8220;glitch&#8221; from a candy-coated cart 
      racing game who might just be the one to teach Ralph what it means to be 
      a Good Guy. But will he realize he is good enough to become a hero 
      before it&#8217;s &#8220;Game Over&#8221; for the entire arcade?

 (Adds detail on settlement, background on products, bullet
points, statement from JPMorgan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 15 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N).
has agreed to pay $27 million to settle U.S. allegations that
the bank's auto lending unit used high-pressure sales tactics
and false statements to sell products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank will pay a $2 million fine to the Office of the
Comptroller of the Currency and distribute $25 million to
customers who were misled, the Comptroller's office said on
Wednesday in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; From January 2008 through May 2009, JPMorgan Chase sold
products that would allow a customer to cancel or suspend
payments on their auto loan if certain triggers were met.
Often, events like death or unemployment trigger these kinds of
products, and borrowers pay a monthly fee for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase's sales staff made false and misleading
statements when selling these products, often working off a
script that the bank provided them, the OCC alleged. The script
included rebuttals for when customers balked at the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In 2009, the bank stopped marketing these types of products
to customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The OCC, part of the U.S. Treasury, said its probe prompted
 JPMorgan Chase to also review sales practices for home lending
and credit card services, where the bank found additional
practices to correct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank neither admitted or denied wrongdoing in agreeing
to the settlement, the OCC's statement said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chase said in a statement that it was pleased to
resolve the matter, has reimbursed affected customers, and
revised its practices to ensure it is treating customers
fairly.

Wednesday to carry out shale gas exploration work at a
potentially huge field in northeastern Bulgaria.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, the Balkan country said Chevron had won a tender
for the work at the 4,400-square-kilometre Novi Pazar field over
Canada's BNK Petroleum (BKX.TO). [ID:nLDE74R050]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Economy and Energy Minister Traicho Traikov told reporters
that Chevron will prepare a five-year working programme worth 50
million euros ($71.87 million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company will pay 30 million euros to the state to start
exploring for shale gas in a field for which initial estimates,
based on similar rock formations, showed potential reserves of
between 300 billion and 1 trillion cubic metres of shale gas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traikov has said shale gas and hydraulic fracturing have the
potential to reduce harmful emissions, boost energy security and
cut Bulgaria's almost full reliance on imported gas from Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the drilling for the unconventional gas has raised
concerns throughout Europe that fracking, a process that
involves injecting water, sand and chemicals to extract trapped
gas, can contaminate water and harm the environment.
[ID:nN18229665]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week opposition Socialists called for a moratorium on
shale gas exploration in Bulgaria until reliable studies prove
the work will not harm environment and not trigger earthquakes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government said in a statement Chevron would invest 4
million euros over five years on environment protection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Tsvetelia Tsolova; editing by Jason Neely)

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Jun 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
In a fast-paced sales environment, hours spent toiling over complex admin
processes and pricing structures could mean a missed opportunity or
target. Hardly surprising then, that a leading drinks firm such as
Heineken should place a high priority on developing an effective,
user-friendly CRM system.

    Heineken UK operates as a wholesaler and distributor of alcoholic drinks
and has a significant portfolio of market-leading brands including
Heineken, Fosters, Strongbow, Kronenbourg 1664 and John Smiths. To
support its increasingly flexible business operating model, in 2006
Heineken instigated a large-scale business process change program to
review its existing sales processes and identify an IT solution that
would better support the organization.

    Evolving business needs
 "The biggest aim of the project was to reduce
the amount of forms and admin that was necessary for the sales force to
input just to complete one task," says Heineken UK business change lead,
Vicki Lowson.

    "Before the move to a unified SAP CRM system there were around 14 legacy
IT systems that the sales teams had to use to do their day job. The
biggest aim of the project was to get rid of all those and get the
information about the customer into one place. We also wanted the sales
teams to have a single login."

    In January 2009, as part of its ongoing business process change project,
Heineken UK contracted the expert SAP CRM team at De Villiers Walton to
work alongside its team, take a fresh look at its CRM system and provide
the firm with a more practical and efficient solution. "Our existing CRM
project had failed to deliver and had some fundamental usability issues,"
explains Heineken UK business solutions manager, Douglas Smith.

    "We needed to put a new solution in place that would support our field
sales teams as the existing mobile sales system had an overly-complex
architecture which couldn't deliver what the sales force required and
didn't fit with the way our business works. We brought De Villiers Walton
in to build a revitalized CRM system, improve its business performance
capabilities, and deliver a tailored user-interface that would address
the usability needs of the sales force.

    "A core aim of the project was mobility -- we wanted to bring the sales
force online and provide a more intuitive user experience. We knew that
De Villiers Walton had strong CRM experience and could deliver intuitive
and usable front-end capabilities."

    To overcome the usability issues and remove some of the complexities that
can be associated with SAP CRM, De Villiers Walton applied its unique ZUI
Interface Builder Framework. This was then custom developed to meet
Heineken's unique business requirements and branding, at the same time
bridging the gap between users and their process support requirements.

    "We implemented a ZUI-based sales force automation and commercial deal
modeling solution that was designed to meet the exact requirements of the
Heineken UK business," says De Villiers Walton managing director, Darron
Walton.

    "The solution took into account all of the company's key sales processes,
including commercial deal modeling, order taking, opportunity management,
customer visits, accounts management and marketing activities. The
deployment was given an intuitive and user-friendly interface and fully
integrates with SAP CRM and ERP, utilizing standard SAP objects and data.

    "SAP is a great technology but there are certain gaps in its usability
and functionality. To address this, we go back to basics, starting with
an understanding of how the users will access the system and what their
exact requirements, processes and business needs are." 

    To optimize usability, De Villiers Walton brought in its specialized user
interface designers to work alongside its consultants and developers.
"The fact that the De Villiers Walton software was designed by a
dedicated design team meant that the screens were laid out very logically
and based on the description that we provided of how the user would
actually use the screens," says Heineken UK business change lead, Vicki
Lowson. 

    "Our sales team is on the road all the time and expects a usable
solution," says Heineken UK commercial director, Chris Jowsey. "Since De
Villiers Walton got involved, the project has been running very
successfully."

    "Unlike other consultancy firms, the approach taken by De Villiers Walton
is to work closely with their clients as one project team," says Lowson.
"Everyone is focused on the same end-goal and everyone knows what that
end goal looks like. De Villiers Walton helped us to shape our thinking
into a set of business requirements that they could quickly deliver for
us."

    Gaining user acceptance
 Heineken has rolled-out the improved SAP CRM
system across the whole of its UK workforce and now has around 450 users
operating within the system. Feedback from both the frontline and the
back office has become increasingly positive as users realize the
benefits of the system, according to Heineken's Chris Jowsey.

    "There was some initial resistance from frontline staff which was
understandable when you consider that they have been working with the
same technology for around 10-15 years," he says. "Once we overcame that
the feedback was really positive.

    "Deal modeling, for example, was a core aim of the project and we have
had some fantastic feedback in terms of the improved quality of
information that the sales team can now see during the process. Their
ability to construct the model that best suits the needs of the customer
has also been enhanced." 

    Mobility was an integral part of the project and, if the sales teams had
refused to adopt the new way of working, it could have jeopardized its
success according to Heineken UK business solutions manager, Douglas
Smith. "It was a significant challenge to take a sales force that was
used to being mobile and off-line and give them a tool that they would
accept and want to use that could only be accessed online.

    "There was a big cultural change to address, which is why we put a
relentless focus on usability -- if the new online system was difficult
to use it would have failed. From a technology perspective, the hardest
part was making deal management work in SAP CRM and combining the
different elements in a way that would deliver a proactive view of the
commercial propositions we were presenting to customers. Doing this
successfully was a real commercial win for the business."

    Broader business benefits
 "Prior to the current system being implemented
there was a lack of integration in our systems," says Heineken UK
business project manager, Simon Cleary. "Since the De Villiers Walton
solution was implemented we have seen a big improvement.

    "For example, we can now look at the price we charge a customer and the
volume we sell to them and cross-reference that against the relevant
customer segment and make decisions on investment based on those
criteria. In the past, we didn't have all this information in one place
and it involved a big manual task to bring it together.

    "Our initial business case for the project was largely based on
time-saving, but the project has also given us additional capabilities
that we didn't plan for. As we got towards the roll-out, the opportunity
for process change and visibility of information became a key facet. We
moved our focus away from sales force time-saving and worked towards
solidifying our processes.

    "We now have a very clear new account process. Everybody knows what they
are doing and there is a real uniformity which in itself has driven the
time-saving that we sought both in the sales team and elsewhere in the
organization."

    As well as improving business processes, the implementation also helped
Heineken UK to re-prioritize some of its accountabilities, according to
Douglas Smith: "We are used to changes in brand, pricing and commercial
messaging, but our teams are not accustomed to changes in business
processes and technology change," he says. "The fact that the new ways of
working were accepted so readily is testament to the skill and hard work
of De Villiers Walton and our internal teams."

    Having a bespoke user-interface and CRM system that was designed to
increase user motivation and adherence to protocols has also yielded
significant benefits in terms of recruitment. "New recruits who do not
have the legacy of the old systems find the De Villiers Walton software
very easy to use and, as a result, there has been a significant reduction
in the time it takes to train a new employee," says Chris Jowsey.

    "This is really important in our business as it can be very damaging to
our customer-base and profitability if there is nobody working in a
particular patch for a while. Getting somebody in and getting them
trained-up and effective quickly makes a big difference to our
effectiveness and profitability."

    The improvements made to deal modeling have also yielded significant
results. "The deal management module provides the insight, information
and governance needed to provide the right commercial proposition for our
customers so that there is greater transparency over the whole commercial
agreement process and the deals that we are doing in the independent free
trade," adds Smith.

    "We have found that there are now fewer errors in deal modeling which has
enhanced our profitability because we are getting it right first time,"
says Jowsey. "There is also greater visibility in terms of the
profitability of a deal and, as a result, our sales teams are effectively
making better deals. We are also seeing real advantages in terms of cycle
times. In the past, it used to take us around 20 days to open a new
account and get it fully trading. Now that has been halved to just ten
days."

    A more productive future
 An overhaul of the size and scope of this
project inevitably highlighted issues within the organization that may
not previously have been noticed. "From a business intelligence
perspective, the new system has helped to identify problems within our
sales and managerial teams," says Cleary. "Having identified the
weaknesses and opportunities means we can now take action to fill any
capability gaps."

    While Heineken UK says that it is very satisfied with the SAP CRM
project, it has also identified further scope for future application.
"There are huge opportunities moving forward in terms of how we exploit
the functionality that we now have more effectively and how we tie the
sales and marketing processes more closely together to make them more
effective," says Jowsey.

    "Ultimately, we believe that the sales and marketing processes will allow
us to drive a greater return on our marketing investment. We are
delighted to have got to where we have got to but believe that, in the
future, the potential longer-term benefits are really significant."

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - A mist inhaler used to improve breathing in people with lung diseases including chronic bronchitis and emphysema may increase their risk of dying by 52 percent, U.S. and British researchers said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The increased risk occurred in patients who used the Spiriva Respimat inhaler, a newer device sold by privately held Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) and Pfizer. It delivers a soluble form of Spiriva, known generically as tiotropium.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The finding was contested by Pfizer and BI.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inhaler is used to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, the fourth-leading cause of death worldwide, which includes the chronic lung diseases emphysema and bronchitis. COPD is usually due to decades of smoking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we think is going on is that the mist inhaler is delivering a higher concentration of tiotropium than it should be and that may be increasing the risk of death," Dr. Sonal Singh of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, who led the study, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The inhaler is approved for use in Britain and Europe, but failed to win a nod from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which noted an excess number of deaths in a study of 17,000 patients. Instead, the FDA said it wanted more proof the inhaler was safe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;POOLED DATA&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new study, published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ), is based on an analysis of data from five clinical trials involving 6,500 people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It found that the risk of death in patients using the tiotropium Respimat inhaler was 52 percent higher than patients who used a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We estimate that there will be one additional death for every 124 patients treated for a year with tiotropium Respimat," Dr. Yoon Loke of Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia, who worked on the study, said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said some of the added risk stems from patients dying of heart trouble, especially for those with existing heart problems that may be made worse with use of the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and BI said in a statement they did not agree with the study authors' conclusion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When analyzing the clinical data, Boehringer Ingelheim and Pfizer, unlike the authors of the BMJ publication, have access to detailed patient level data. A thorough analysis of these data revealed a statistically non-significant, numerical imbalance in number of fatal events with Spiriva Respimat," the companies said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drugmakers added that all the studies included in the pooled analysis had been published and already shared with European regulatory authorities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Savvas Neophytou, an analyst at Panmure Gordon, said the possible negative impact on sales as a result of the report could benefit GlaxoSmithKline's rival product Advair.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That might offset the looming threat of generic competition to Advair in non-U.S. markets, Neophytou added. A copycat version of Advair was recently approved in Sweden.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most COPD sufferers use inhalers to help them breathe and more than half a million prescriptions for tiotropium inhalers were issued in Britain last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler in London; editing by Eric Walsh and Andrew Callus)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JAKARTA, June 15 (Reuters) - Indonesia's state energy firm Pertamina aims to buy overseas assets for 160,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boepd) by 2015 to meet its output goals and is in talks with Exxon Mobil (XOM.N) over an Angolan block.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pertamina CEO Karen Agustiawan said she expected to sign deals for overseas blocks this year, with funding not a problem to compete with other energy hungry Asian countries seeking assets from Southeast Asia to Africa to ensure supply security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When there is sugar, all ants will come," Agustiawan said in an interview for the Reuters Energy and Climate Summit. "Finance is the least problem that we have. It is more toward is there the opportunity, and how sweet is the opportunity, and how small is the risk."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pertamina raised $1.5 billion from issuing a global bond last month, which could go toward funding a deal for Exxon's 25 percent stake in an Angolan offshore oil block slated to produce around 150,000 barrels per day (bpd) from next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also eyeing stakes in 10 oil and gas blocks in countries such as Iraq, Libya, Algeria, Brazil and Vietnam, as it seeks to boost its oil and gas output from 440,000 boepd now to one million by 2015.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By optimizing what we have domestically, the gap will be about 160,000 boepd," she said. "There is some progress. There will be some signing this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Agustiawan said further capital raising to fund its plans could come from listing subsidiaries in the first half of 2011, to tap strong portfolio investor interest in a country on the verge of an investment grade sovereign rating.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The former OPEC member has struggled to attract new direct investment to increase energy production, given policy uncertainty and corruption, leading to declining output at aging fields that has derailed plans to reach output targets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Neil Chatterjee and Alfian in JAKARTA, Simon Webb and Florence Tan in SINGAPORE; Editing by Manash Goswami)&lt;/p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today that Heidi Miller, 
      President of its International business, will retire from the firm in 
      early 2012. The company also announced new responsibilities for a number 
      of other senior leaders in its U.S. and consumer-related businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ms. Miller has played key roles throughout her 30+ year career in 
      banking and finance, including Chief Financial Officer of Citigroup and 
      Bank One, a member of the Bank One Board of Directors and other large 
      corporate boards, CEO of JPMorgan Chase&#8217;s Treasury  Securities Services 
      business, and most recently, President of International.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, said: &#8220;Heidi has been a valued 
      member of our Operating Committee and a trusted advisor to me over the 
      years, and she has also served as a role model to countless others 
      inside and outside of our firm. We&#8217;ll miss her greatly and wish her all 
      the best in whatever she chooses to do next.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Dimon added: &#8220;In her role as President of International, Heidi worked 
      closely with our key business leaders to help develop a comprehensive 
      and coordinated international business strategy, growth plan and 
      governance structure. She furthered our efforts in expanding the ranks 
      of our global corporate bankers, and she helped us do a better job 
      deepening and coordinating our client coverage efforts around the world.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Jes Staley, CEO of the firm&#8217;s Investment Bank, will assume additional 
      responsibility for overseeing and coordinating the firm&#8217;s international 
      franchise across all of its businesses. This is consistent with Heidi 
      Miller&#8217;s recommendation that responsibilities for international 
      activities be embedded back into the businesses. Importantly, Jes will 
      partner closely with the CEOs of the firm&#8217;s other wholesale 
      international businesses &#8211; Mike Cavanagh in Treasury  Securities 
      Services and Mary Erdoes in Asset Management &#8211; ensuring that our 
      wholesale businesses and products, wherever they are based, are 
      receiving the investments, the people, the focus and the prioritization 
      they need to grow and be successful.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Separately, Charlie Scharf, CEO of Retail Financial Services, will 
      become a Partner in One Equity Partners, the firm&#8217;s private equity arm. 
      Mr. Scharf&#8217;s years of senior operating experience and his financial 
      expertise will be extremely valuable to the firm&#8217;s private equity 
      franchise. He will also continue to work with the consumer team to help 
      transition the business and assist in any way possible.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Charlie has played a critical role in building our Retail franchise 
      into one of the top players in the industry &#8211; successfully integrating 
      the Bank One, Chase, Bank of New York and Washington Mutual businesses 
      and helping expand our branch footprint across the United States,&#8221; said 
      Jamie Dimon.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Todd Maclin, head of the Commercial Bank, will assume additional 
      responsibilities for the company&#8217;s Retail business, including the branch 
      network, consumer franchise, small business banking and the Chase 
      private client business. He will continue as CEO of the Commercial Bank. 
      Mr. Maclin has partnered closely with the Retail team and branch network 
      over the years as he has helped build the firm&#8217;s industry-leading 
      commercial bank. Doug Petno, Chief Operating Officer of the Commercial 
      Bank, will continue in his role reporting to Maclin.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Frank Bisignano, Chief Administrative Officer and Head of Home Lending, 
      will continue in both of these roles.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gordon Smith, CEO of Card Services, will take on responsibility for the 
      firm&#8217;s Auto Finance and Student Lending businesses, in addition to his 
      current role. To better leverage the power of the Chase brand and ensure 
      more consistency, Mr. Smith will take on a new role managing all 
      Chase-branded marketing across our Chase products and services. In this 
      role, he&#8217;ll partner closely with senior marketers across the firm&#8217;s 
      business and corporate functions.

&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration is changing the Chantix label to identify the increased heart risk after reviewing the results of a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independent randomized trial of 700 smokers with cardiovascular disease who were treated with Chantix or a placebo showed that the Pfizer drug was effective in helping patients quit smoking for as long as one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, patients who took the pill were also slightly more likely to have a heart attack or other adverse cardiovascular event compared with patients who received a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the study cited by the FDA, 2 percent of patients taking Chantix had non-fatal heart attacks compared with 0.9 percent in the placebo group, while 2.3 percent of Chantix patients needed artery-clearing procedures versus 0.9 percent on placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many smokers who try to quit do so to prevent the risk of heart attacks, which may now be associated with Chantix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The known benefits of Chantix should be weighed against its potential risks when deciding to use the drug in smokers with cardiovascular disease," the FDA said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA said it is also requiring Pfizer to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of Chantix by conducting a large, combined analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said in a statement that it would be discussing details of such an analysis as well as the product's label with the FDA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said that in a Chantix clinical trial of smokers with certain types of heart disease reports of adverse cardiovascular problems were low.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's non-nicotine pill has already come under fire for psychiatric side effects and prompted the FDA to issue a restrictive "black box" warning on the drug's label.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors had high hopes for the drug -- called Champix in Europe -- when Pfizer first launched the smoking-cessation aid in 2006, but reports of psychiatric side effects have hampered strong sales growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual sales are now about $800 million, making the pill a moderate-sized product for the world's biggest drug maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chantix has been associated with agitation, depression and suicidal thoughts, and, in clinical trials, was linked with nightmares. Psychiatric symptoms have occurred in people without a history of mental illness and have worsened in people who already had mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares closed up 5 cents at $20.25 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Yukhananov; additional reporting by Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson in New York; editing by Dave Zimmerman, Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc could provide new data within days on an experimental blood thinner, revealing its potential in a highly lucrative market for millions of patients with dangerously irregular heart rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their pill, apixaban, if approved, will likely be the third entrant among a new crop of oral anti-coagulants meant to replace warfarin, the current standard for preventing stroke among patients with atrial fibrillation. Each of the medicines has the potential for topping $2 billion in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even if late to market, apixaban could catch up with rival newcomers thanks to Bristol-Myers' and Pfizer's vast sales networks for cardiovascular treatments -- but only if data from the highly-awaited Phase III trial measure up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Because this is the third entrant in, the data need to be pretty good," said Sanford Bernstein analyst Timothy Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other two are Boehringer Ingelheim's Pradaxa, or dabigatran, which is already on the market, and Xarelto, or rivaroxaban, a drug developed by Bayer AG and Johnson  Johnson that is awaiting U.S. approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Pfizer and Bristol are uniquely placed to make up that lost ground due to the relationships they have built with doctors in selling their respective cholesterol fighter Lipitor and blood clot preventer Plavix -- the world's two biggest selling medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer and Bristol both have so much more cardiovascular marketing muscle compared with Boehringer Ingelheim or JJ or Bayer," Bernstein's Anderson said. "When you're the third product in, but you're being sold by the two big cardiovascular gorillas ... it's a lot easier to go into (doctors') offices."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street expects the new drugs and a likely fourth entry from Daiichi Sankyo Co Ltd called edoxaban, collectively to fetch more than $10 billion a year. Atrial fibrillation will account for the lion's share of revenue, but they will also be used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing hip and knee replacements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many investors expect Bristol-Myers and Pfizer to unveil by month's end general findings from their study, called ARISTOTLE, with full results to be presented in late August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Phase III apixaban data could give Bristol-Myers stock a nice bump or send it reeling, JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Despite relatively high expectations reflected for the product already, any comment about a statistically significant improvement in efficacy or bleeding would be a positive catalyst for the stocks," Schott said in a research note, suggesting shares could rise 5 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the very unlikely event the study misses its primary endpoint, we would anticipate Bristol-Myers shares could be down 10 percent," Schott added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A LOW THRESHOLD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Warfarin has been used for more than half a century, but carries serious bleeding risk, requires frequent dose adjustments and imposes strict dietary restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bar for the apixaban trial's success is therefore not especially high, as the drug needs only to show it is as effective, or non-inferior, to warfarin to meet the main goal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors will also be looking for clues as to how it might stack up against Pradaxa and Xarelto.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If apixaban had much better efficacy than warfarin and also statistically significantly less bleeding, that would be the home run data, but to me that doesn't seem very likely," Anderson said. "The other two products had one or the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"All of these are going to have some good element and some not so good element and they are going to end up being fairly comparable in the eyes of prescribers," Anderson added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pradaxa reduced stroke risk 35 percent at its higher dose compared with warfarin in a pivotal Phase III trial, while Xarelto reduced risk 21 percent in its Phase III and greatly reduced risk for more serious hemorrhagic strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Leon Henderson-MacLennan, medical consultant with the inThought unit of Wolters Kluwer, said the apixaban stroke reduction rate could be lower than its rivals, but show a lower bleeding risk and still be seen as a success.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're looking for a nice, safe way of reducing risk and, if we can see that in a statistically significant fashion, even if the relative risk reduction was 15 percent, that would still indicate it will be an option on the market," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The devil is going to be in the details in terms of how we choose one versus another. Right now they all look like viable options and I don't see one clearly outshining the other," Henderson-MacLennan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer and Bristol both need new products to make up for the imminent U.S. patent expirations and steep sales declines of Lipitor and Plavix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apixaban will clearly have some hurdles to overcome, namely Pradaxa's healthy head start in the market and Xarelto's more convenient once-daily dosing. The Bristol drug and Xarelto are taken twice a day by atrial fibrillation patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jack Lawrence, Bristol's head of development for apixaban, suggested that twice daily dosing is superior as it allows for fewer peaks and valleys of the drug in the system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawrence also said apixaban demonstrated good tolerability with no gastrointestinal side effects. G.I. problems have been associated with Pradaxa use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Dr. Larry Chinitz, director of the Heart Rhythm Center at New York University Langone Medical Center, said a once-a-day drug would be preferable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If the drugs appear to be equally efficacious, then patients will prefer to take it once a day," Chinitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Anything that improves compliance, especially for one that is so important as a blood thinner for stroke prevention, that would be a significant issue."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ransdell Pierson and Bill Berkrot; editing by Michele Gershberg and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pfizer's stop-smoking drug Chantix can lead to a small increase in cardiovascular problems such as heart attacks for patients who already have cardiovascular disease, U.S. drug regulators said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Food and Drug Administration is changing the label for Chantix after reviewing the results of a clinical trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An independent randomized trial of 700 smokers with cardiovascular disease who were treated with Chantix or a placebo showed that Chantix was effective in helping patients quit smoking for as long as one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, patients who took the pill were also slightly more likely to have a heart attack or other adverse cardiovascular event versus patients on a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many smokers who try to quit do so to prevent the risk of heart attacks, which may now be associated with Chantix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The known benefits of Chantix should be weighed against its potential risks when deciding to use the drug in smokers with cardiovascular disease," the FDA said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA said it is also requiring Pfizer to evaluate the cardiovascular safety of Chantix by conducting a large, combined analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's non-nicotine pill has already come under fire for psychiatric side effects, which have crimped global sales and prompted the FDA to issue a restrictive "black box" warning label for the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors had high hopes for the drug -- called Champix in Europe -- when Pfizer first launched its smoking-cessation aid in 2006, but reports of serious side effects have prevented strong sales growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Annual sales are now about $800 million, making the pill a moderate-sized product for the world's biggest drug maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chantix has been associated with agitation, depression and suicidal thoughts, and, in clinical trials, linked with nightmares. Psychiatric symptoms have occurred in people without a history of mental illness and have worsened in people who already had mental illness.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Anna Yukhananov; editing by Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

stop-smoking drug Chantix can lead to a small increase in

on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Food and Drug Administration is changing the label for

cardiovascular disease who were treated with Chantix or a
placebo showed that Chantix was effective in helping paients
quit smoking for as long as one year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, patients who took the pill were also slightly more
likely to have a heart attack or other adverse cardiovascular
event versus patients on a placebo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many smokers who try to quit do so to prevent the risk of
heart attacks, which may now be associated with Chantix.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The known benefits of Chantix should be weighed against
its potential risks when deciding to use the drug in smokers
with cardiovascular disease," the FDA said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FDA said it is also requiring Pfizer to evaluate the
cardiovascular safety of Chantix by conducting a large,
combined analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's non-nicotine pill has already come under fire for
psychiatric side effects, which have crimped global sales and
prompted the FDA to issue a restrictive "black box" warning
label for the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investors had high hopes for the drug -- called Champix in
Europe -- when Pfizer first launched its smoking-cessation aid
in 2006, but reports of serious side effects have prevented
strong sales growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Annual sales are now about $800 million, making the pill a
moderate-sized product for the world's biggest drug maker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chantix has been associated with agitation, depression and
suicidal thoughts, and, in clinical trials, linked with
nightmares. Psychiatric symptoms have occurred in people
without a history of mental illness and have worsened in people
who already had mental illness.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Adds quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Raushan Nurshayeva&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ASTANA, June 16 (Reuters) - U.S. energy major Chevron Corp's
(CVX.N) Kazakh oil venture plans to invest up to $20 billion by
2016 to raise production by nearly 40 percent, a senior company
official said on Thursday.
 Tengizchevroil, Kazakhstan's largest oil producer, is
considering borrowing money to help finance its five-year plan
to increase annual crude output to 36 million tonnes, Deputy
General Director Anuarbek Dzhakiyev told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The numbers are preliminary and could be between $15
billion and $20 billion. This is a project for our future
growth," Dzhakiyev said on the sidelines of an oil conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are considering our options, which include borrowing,"
he said, without giving further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tengizchevroil (TCO) produced 25.9 million tonnes of crude
in 2010, or approximately 567,000 barrels per day. This was a 15
percent increase on the previous year. [ID:nLDE7190VN]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron is the largest single shareholder in the consortium,
which runs the field in western Kazakhstan. ExxonMobil Corp
(XOM.N), Kazakh state oil and gas company KazMunaiGas [KMG.UL]
and Russia's LUKOIL (LKOH.MM) are also shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan has doubled its oil output over the past decade
to become the second-biggest producer in the former Soviet Union
after Russia. The Central Asian country produced 79.5 million
tonnes of oil and gas condensate in 2010, up 4 percent on 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Kazakhstan has ambitions to raise production to 100 million
tonnes by 2015 and 130 million tonnes by 2020, the Oil and Gas
Ministry has said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As well as the TCO expansion, much of the growth is likely
to be supplied by the Kashagan field in the Caspian Sea, the
world's biggest oil find in more than 40 years, which is run by
another international consortium and is scheduled to begin
production by the end of 2012 or early 2013.

Gold Certified Partner in the Microsoft Partner Program.

    For customers, Certified for Microsoft Dynamics helps identify Microsoft
Dynamics solutions that have been tested for compatibility, meet high
quality standards, and are successfully used by existing customers. This
certification represents a significant step in elevating the standard for
partner-developed software solutions for industry-specific business
applications. By highlighting these solutions, Microsoft also creates new
opportunities for partners to expand their reseller channel and to better
promote their packaged Microsoft Dynamics solution for customers. 

    "This milestone demonstrates Tensoft's commitment to delivering leading
solutions and expertise for our customers," said Doug Kennedy, vice
president, Microsoft Dynamics Partners. "We congratulate Tensoft for
meeting Microsoft's highest standards of software quality and earning the
CFMD distinction."

    Tensoft RCM brings together the specific revenue recognition, recurring

&lt;p&gt;  BELMONT, CA, Jun 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Actiance (www.actiance.com), enablers of the safe and compliant use of
unified communications, collaboration and Web 2.0, announced today that
MacRoberts LLP, one of Scotland's preeminent commercial law firms, uses
Vantage from Actiance to protect its deployment of unified communications
(UC) platform Microsoft Lync. 

    With offices in both Glasgow and Edinburgh, MacRoberts provides a full
range of legal services to leading UK and international businesses,
financial institutions, public sector organisations and private
individuals.

    For solicitors such as MacRoberts, unified communications offers an
efficient and effective means of communication. However, the benefits of
UC can be quickly offset if care is not taken to meet the security,
management and compliance issues created when deploying a UC platform as
Robert Crichton, Director of IT Services at MacRoberts explains.

    "We have an extensive corporate data and IT infrastructure that is
critical to our business. Any organisation must take data leakage
seriously, but for a firm of solicitors it's more than a loss of
reputation at stake," says Crichton. "Lawyers exchange documents all the
time. In order to ensure compliance and fulfil our legal obligations we
need to be able to prove irrefutably what was exchanged, who with and
when, regardless of the medium used. If an investigation was launched
into a particular document and we couldn't easily demonstrate who had
access, it may weaken our client's position and that's simply not
acceptable."

    Whilst Microsoft Lync is extremely effective in delivering UC, it did not
natively provide the capabilities to meet all of today's security,
compliance and legislative requirements defined by MacRoberts. The law
firm needed to ensure that the implementation of a UC platform did not
open up its IT infrastructure to the threat of malware coming in or the
risk of data leaking out. In addition, MacRoberts wanted to be certain
that only authorised applications were used and that services such as
public IM (Yahoo, AOL etc) were blocked.

    Advised by Gradian, one of MacRoberts preferred technology suppliers, the
law firm deployed Vantage. Actiance's award winning security, management
and compliance platform that protects not just UC, but all real-time
communications used within an organisation -- from presence and instant
messaging to conferencing and voice. 

    "One of the reasons we wanted to introduce UC into the firm was to enable
us to federate with our clients, enabling a more productive and efficient
collaborative environment where meetings could take place without leaving
the desk. Vantage has enabled us to achieve this without exposing
ourselves to the risk of data leakage or inbound threats such as malware
and has also provided us with the reporting tools to ensure we are using
Microsoft OCS to its best advantage," concludes Crichton. "I'd go so far
as to say that we wouldn't have rolled out OCS or Lync without Vantage;
Vantage complements Microsoft Lync by providing us with the necessary
control to ensure that our data remains secure and that we have a full
audit trail of all conversations and files exchanged."

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Sly Stone, the reclusive funk legend whose career was crippled by rampant drug abuse, pleaded not guilty to possession of cocaine rocks on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 68-year-old frontman for Sly and the Family Stone was arrested April 1 when Los Angeles police pulled over a live-in van for a minor traffic violation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cocaine rocks were found in the clothing of both Stone, who was a passenger, and the driver, according to the singer's defense attorneys. Both men were arrested.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"A lot of musicians hang out with people who have drugs. How are they supposed to know?" said Peter Knecht, one of his attorneys. He insisted the cocaine did not belong to Stone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone, whose real name is Sylvester Stewart, is next scheduled to appear in court in the Los Angeles suburb of Van Nuys for a pretrial conference on July 19. His arraignment was originally scheduled for last Friday, but he was hospitalized for heart problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone, a veteran of the San Francisco power scene, revolutionized soul music with tunes such as "Don't Call me Nigger, Whitey" and "I Want to Take You Higher" that both fed on and fueled the political and social turmoil of the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His career, however, was marred by decades of run-ins with the law. Throughout the 1970s and 80s, he was plagued by drug and gun possession charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You can't punish a guy for what he did 40 years ago, 30 years ago," said Knecht.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone made his first major public appearance in almost 13 years at the Grammy Awards in 2006 when he was the object of an all-star tribute. Sporting a blond Mohawk and a shiny white jacket, he sauntered out on stage during a performance of "I Want to Take You Higher," but left before the song was over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stone just finished recording a new album that will be released on August 16, according to Tim Yasui, general manager for Cleopatra Records. It would mark his first album in almost 30 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Dean Goodman)&lt;/p&gt;

			Hagens Berman LLP Announces Investigation of The Coca-Cola Company
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hagens Berman today announced that it is investigating potential claims 
      against Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) after the company allegedly made 
      substantive changes to its employee pension plan, actions which may 
      violate federal law.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A recent US Supreme Court ruling calls into question the company&#8217;s 
      actions in converting its pension plan to a cash-balance plan, which 
      falls under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (&#8220;ERISA&#8221;), a law 
      that regulates private sector pension plans in the United States.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hagens Berman is investigating whether Coca-Cola fully disclosed the 
      possible disadvantages of the new plan to its employees.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hagens Berman is interested in talking to employees or former employees 
      of Coca-Cola who feel that the company did not fully disclose the risks 
      associated with the transition to a cash balance plan.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last week I attended IBM's launch event for their Intelligent Building Management software at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. IBM showcased the success of several key pilot projects that laid the framework for their new smart building software solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were three main take-aways from the meeting:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;1) It's crucial to truly understand the problem we face with the management of today's buildings,

2) buildings hold enormous opportunity for energy conservation and GHG mitigation if management is approached with a holistic solution, and

3) the evolution of a Smarter Building can only come if we enable radical transformation of today's building management paradigm.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dave Bartlett, VP of IBM Smarter Buildings, explained the need to understand the problem faced in building management today. He explained that the energy waste and inefficiencies of today's buildings come down to three main problems:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Buildings today are often managed with a collage of disparate systems -- building management systems, sensors, and digital networks -- that are often lacking effective integration;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; buildings generate a lot of data that can overwhelm the the implementation of efficiency policies (in the first third of IBM's pilot in their MN facility they gathered data from 80,000 points); and&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; transforming energy management in buildings will require a new skill set driven by technology integration.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM argues that it is ideally suited to help stakeholders overcome these hurdles, in collaboration with its partners, through instrumentation, interconnection, and intelligence. The Smarter Building will utilize networked sensors, high-speed, IP-based interconnection strategies with sophisticated analytics capable of streaming, sifting, sorting, and prioritizing building operational and energy data to improve building reliability -- as defined by the occupant's primary business mission.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A holistic vision: IBM's new solution proposes a three-pronged approach to building management: energy savings, space management, and building maintenance. The Intelligent Building Management software will be marketed as a pre-configured solution that will utilize the proven strengths of existing technologies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The solution aims to provide end-to-end visibility bringing forward data on asset performance, automation of service requests, and notification of critical events, all utilizing role-based and predictive analytics. These advanced analytics will utilize the tried and true technologies of IBM and its partners in a new networked approach in which data can be pulled from all systems to identify problems, manage operations, prioritize solutions, and predict outcomes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The goal is to create a Smarter Building that uses less energy, while optimizing the use of space and building management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Radical transformation of the building management paradigm: The afternoon Smarter Buildings panel discussed the major challenges in transforming the management of today's commercial and industrial buildings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There was debate over the role of the traditional facility manager in tomorrow's highly instrumented, finely tuned building system. IBM argues the launch of their Intelligence Building Management solution will facilitate a transition to sophisticate building management by providing a tool to bring information technology and building management professionals together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, the Smarter Building solution answers the call of a fundamental challenge in my mind -- bringing rationality and order to big data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As we evolve commercial buildings into fully networked systems, we need to have tools that translate the volumes of data into patterns and signals for operators and decision-makers to manage effectively for real optimization.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the goal is cost savings, sustainability, or climate mitigation, no data is useful unless decision-makers have the tools to use the data to drive operational and maintenance changes in their facilities. IBM Intelligent Building Management software is designed to aggregate data from building systems, and then run the kind of rules-based and predictive analytics stakeholders need to prioritize investment and conservation efforts in a completely new way that will bring IT professionals, facilities managers, and the C-Suite all into the proverbial driver's seat.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is yet to be seen how the market responds to the new IBM offering, but the focus of this IT giant certainly reiterates the value and future of the vision of the Smart Building.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Photo CC-licensed byJohn Brennan.&lt;/p&gt;

      Fitch Downgrades JPMCC 2001-CIBC2
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded three classes of J.P. Morgan Chase 
      Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp. (JPMCC), commercial mortgage 
      pass-through certificates, series 2001-CIBC2. A detailed list of rating 
      actions follows the end of the release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrades are the result of an increase in Fitch expected losses of 
      the remaining pool. Fitch modeled losses of 18.9% of the remaining pool; 
      expected losses of the original pool are at 5.7%, including losses 
      already incurred to date. The losses are expected to deplete class K 
      through class H and impair class G. Fitch has identified 13 loans 
      (34.4%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes nine specially 
      serviced loans (30%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the June 2011 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been paid down by approximately 72.2% to $207.7 million from 
      $961.7 billion at issuance. Interest shortfalls are affecting the non 
      rated class NR through class G, with cumulative unpaid interest totaling 
      $2.3 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining loans by applying a 5% 
      reduction to 2009 or 2010 fiscal year-end net operating income, and 
      applying an adjusted market cap rate between 8.10% and 11.00 % to 
      determine value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All the loans also underwent a refinance test by applying an 8% interest 
      rate and 30-year amortization schedule based on the stressed cash flow. 
      All of the loans are considered to pay off at maturity, and could 
      refinance to a debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) above 1.25 times (x). 
      The current weighted average DSCR is 1.41x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributors to modeled losses are Gateway Executive Park 
      (7.2%), Oakpointe Business Centre (2.7%) and Wright Point Office Complex 
      (4.6%) loans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Gateway Executive Park is a 231,256 square foot (sf) office property in 
      Schaumburg, IL, a northwest Chicago suburb. The property became a real 
      estate owned asset (REO) in March 2011 and is currently 73% leased. The 
      property will be listed for sale in the next 30 days. The most recent 
      servicer valuation of the property indicates losses upon liquidation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Oakpointe Business Centre is a 96,213 sf office property in Arlington 
      Heights, IL. The special servicer foreclosed on the property in August 
      2010 via a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure. Settlement proceeds collected 
      from the borrower have been applied to repay the outstanding balance of 
      the loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wright Point Office Complex is secured by a 162,568 sf office property 
      in Riverside, OH and transferred to the special servicer in January 2010 
      due to imminent default. The special servicer has initiated foreclosure 
      and the most recent property valuation indicates losses upon the 
      liquidation of the property.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Private equity firm Carlyle Group CYL.UL is expected to pick JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) Citigroup Inc (C.N) and Credit Suisse Group Ltd (CSGN.VX) to lead its initial public offering, two sources familiar with the process said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Private equity firms are major clients for Wall Street banks, paying them millions of dollars in fees for underwriting IPOs of their portfolio companies and in securing financing for leveraged buyout deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting underwriting business to take buyout firms public is a prestigious mandate for banks and can reveal which Wall Street firms have the closest relationships with buyout shops.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winning underwriting business for large IPOs is also lucrative for banks, which compete hard to take the lead position on an offering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citi and Credit Suisse were among the banks that worked on Blackstone Group's (BX.N) offering in 2007, while JPMorgan (JPM.N) also had a role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apollo Global Management LLC's (APO.N) listing, earlier this year, was led by Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N), JPMorgan and Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman Sachs is currently at the top of the U.S. Equity Capital Markets league table, with JP Morgan in second place and Citi third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlyle, based in Washington, D.C., could raise about $1 billion based on what banks are pitching, two of the sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlyle hopes to file its IPO prospectus with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in the third quarter, sources previously told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carlyle will join rivals Blackstone Group LP (BX.N), Kohlberg Kravis Roberts  Co (KKR.N) and Apollo Global Management as publicly traded private equity companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Private equity firms saw the value of their portfolio companies diminish and their ability to strike new deals evaporate after the credit crisis. However, the outlook for selling portfolio companies and making deals has improved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Publicly traded shares can help a company give incentives to employees and provide a currency for acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan, Carlyle, Credit Suisse and Citi declined comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(By Paritosh Bansal, Megan Davies and Michael Erman; editing by Derek Caney, Andre Grenon, Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
SAN DIEGO, June 17, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Dr. Bassam Damaj, the Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Apricus Biosciences, Inc. ("Apricus
Bio") (Nasdaq:APRI) (http://www.apricusbio.com) noted today his belief that the
specialty biopharmaceutical company could see higher revenues should Pfizer,
Inc. ("Pfizer") be successful in its patent litigation battle against the
introduction of generic versions of its Viagra(R) product for the treatment of
erectile dysfunction ("ED").

"If the recent global litigation effort by Pfizer is successful in extending the
life of its Viagra(R) patents in certain markets, then Apricus Bio and its
partners could expect to see the projected per unit price of its Vitaros(R)
product for ED increase an average of $1.00 to $2.00 over the next several years
in those geographic areas," said Dr. Damaj. "This could result in higher
projected revenues for our product in the future in those markets where Pfizer
is successful."

To the Company's knowledge, Pfizer introduced patent litigation in 2010 and
recently in May and June 2011, filed additional suits against generic
manufacturers of its Viagra(R) product for ED such as Teva Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
("Teva") and Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("Watson"). The Pfizer patent
litigation mainly seeks to extend the patent life of its Viagra(R) product in
the United States, Canada and in certain other countries and to keep generic
versions of Viagra(R) made by companies, such as Teva and Watson, from being
introduced.

Apricus Bio, a specialty biopharmaceutical company that develops and
commercializes products using its proprietary NexACT(R) drug delivery
technology, previously announced that its first product, Vitaros(R), was
approved by Health Canada in November 2010 for the treatment of patients with ED
in that country. The Company has commercialization relationships with partners
in the U.S. (Warner Chilcott Company, Inc.), Italy (Bracco SpA), the Gulf
Region, and parts of the Middle East (Elis Pharmaceuticals, Inc.) and Israel
(Neopharm Scientific, Ltd) for the future introduction of its product in those
countries and regions, and is attempting to develop additional partnerships
internationally.

About Apricus Biosciences, Inc.

Apricus Bio, a San Diego based revenue-generating specialty biopharmaceutical
company, has leveraged the flexibility of its clinically-validated NexACT(R)
drug delivery technology to enable multi-route administration of new and
improved compounds across numerous therapeutic classes.

Revenues and growth are driven from out-licensing of this technology for the
development and commercialization of such compounds to pharmaceutical and
biotechnology companies worldwide. In addition, the Company is seeking to
monetize its existing product pipeline, including its first product, Vitaros(R),
approved in Canada for the treatment of erectile dysfunction, which is currently
expected to be available on the Canadian market in 2011, as well as compounds in
development from pre-clinical through Phase III, currently focused on Sexual
Dysfunction, Oncology, Dermatology, Autoimmune, Pain, Anti-Infectives, Diabetes
and Cosmeceuticals among others.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 17 (Reuters) - The London Metal Exchange
declined to comment on Friday on a report that Coca-Cola Co.
(KO.N) had complained that warehouses the exchange monitors were
restricting the amount of metal they release to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "There has been a lot of debate within the committees
meeting at the LME," Chris Evans, LME's head of business
development, said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(There has been) big debate about aluminium in Detroit...
certainly a discussion about the situation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evans declined to comment on a report in the Wall Street
Journal on Friday quoting a Coca-Cola official in Atlanta saying
that a backlog of metal deliveries from LME warehouses was
causing high prices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The situation has been organized artificially to drive
premiums up," the official told the newspaper, which also said
the company had complained to the LME.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following consumer complaints about difficulty in accessing
metal, an independent report commissioned by the LME into
delivery bottlenecks advised that large warehouses should be
required to increase the minimum tonnage flowing out each day.
[ID:nLDE74Q12P] [ID:nLDE74P0UA]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The LME said on Thursday it had accepted recommendations to
increase the minimum load-out rates. [ID:nLDE75F1ZM]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent years, several large warehouses have been
purchased by banks and trading groups also active in LME
futures, raising concerns about possible conflicts of interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These include Goldman Sachs (GS.N), which controls Metro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs spokesperson said: "Metro has followed and
will continue to follow the LME's rules."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Evans said Coca-Cola and other large consumers buy their
metal directly from mills, and do not buy from LME warehouses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "So the suggestion that because there are queues in Detroit
consumers are not getting their metal is somewhat misleading,"
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Aluminium for three-month delivery on the London Metal
Exchange last month hit $2,803 per tonne, its highest since

&lt;p&gt;ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - Concerns about China and Russia are overblown and offer investors a chance to buy into booming growth stories, Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;O'Neill, who coined the BRIC term in 2001 to describe how the clout of Brazil, Russia, India and China would challenge the West's economic dominance, said jitters about such markets were overblown given such swift growth forecasts for the next decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For those who have a little bit of foresight, it gives them the chance to get in at sensible levels," O'Neill, who helps oversee $677 billion in assets at Goldman, told Reuters Insider television at the St Petersburg Economic Forum in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China and Russia are both looking quite interesting because they are cheap," he said. "Contrary to the email I get every two hours about why I should drop the R from BRIC, I quite like Russia."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anxiety about a U.S. slowdown and inflation in China have prompted the likes of U.S. market strategist Richard Bernstein to talk of "monstrous" risks to emerging markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill said the short-term worries about the BRICs did not undermine the attractive long-term growth story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The long-term trend is for the BRIC economies and the BRIC investment theme to continue to be the dominant themes of our generation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said that apart from Russia, his other top pick was financial stocks in developed countries, though he declined to name specific stocks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But O'Neill did say the future of China -- and inflation in particular -- was the one issue that kept him awake at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this view that is growing, particularly in the (United) States, that China is already going down the hard landing path, that would be a big deal ... I think China is slowing because the authorities are deliberately trying to slow it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As soon as we see the slightest sign of inflation starting to turn around, the markets will stop worrying about more tightening," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill said China, Russia, Brazil and India would collectively have economies bigger than the U.S. economy by the end of this decade and this would have a big impact on who runs financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he thought the slowdown in U.S. growth was temporary but, if it was not, investors should expect a third round of quantitative easing, or QE3 -- a term that describes treasury bond purchases by the central bank to stimulate the flow of credit and investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am a bit surprised and confused by the evidence that the U.S. has slowed so much. I still suspect it is only temporary and might have something to do with the Japanese supply disruption. If I am wrong then we will get QE3, though it might not be described that way," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Guy Faulconbridge, editing by Timothy Heritage)&lt;/p&gt;

			Chase Card Services Adds EMV Chip Technology to Its J.P. Morgan 
      Select Visa Signature Card
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			First Major U.S. Bank to Offer EMV Chip Technology Expands 
      Security Innovation to a Second Card for International Travelers
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Chase 
      Card Services announced today that EMV chip technology is now 
      available on a second credit card in the company&#8217;s portfolio, the J.P. 
      Morgan Select Visa Signature&#174; card. In April, Chase became the first 
      major U.S. bank to produce EMV technology featuring chip-and-signature 
      on its J.P. Morgan Palladium credit card. Both cards provide consumers 
      with better ease-of-use and stronger security while traveling abroad.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The J.P. Morgan Select credit card with chip-and-signature technology 
      features both an embedded encrypted chip and traditional magnetic strip 
      to accommodate merchants in the United States. The embedded microchip of 
      chip-and-signature makes the card extremely difficult to copy because 
      the encrypted chip enables the safer processing and storing of data. 
      European financial institutions and merchants have been using chip cards 
      and terminals, so cards with chip-and-signature technology offer more 
      streamlined credit card purchases while traveling in Europe, Asia, 
      Canada and elsewhere abroad.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We&#8217;re continuously evolving our offerings with our customers&#8217; best 
      interest in mind,&#8221; said David Porter, general manager, Chase Card 
      Services, a division of JPMorgan Chase  Co. [NYSE: JPM]. &#8221;Offering EMV 
      chip technology on the J.P. Morgan Select credit card is an expansion of 
      our ongoing commitment to offer customers the highest level of security 
      and convenience when traveling abroad. EMV also enhances this premium 
      credit card that features robust point accrual and redemption rewards on 
      the Ultimate 
      Rewards platform.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to EMV chip technology, the J.P. Morgan Select credit card 
      also includes the following benefits:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Smoother transactions during international travel: Many other 
        countries, especially in Europe, are switching to chip cards &#8211; Chase&#8217;s 
        chip-and-signature cards will simplify transactions for travelers 
        while abroad in the 130+ countries where chip technology is in use.
      
			
				Enhanced security: Chip-and-signature credit cards are embedded 
        with an encrypted microchip that safely processes and stores data and 
        makes the card much more difficult to counterfeit.
      
			
				No foreign exchange fees: Travelers will save up to three 
        percent in foreign transaction fees on purchases made abroad using the 
        J.P. Morgan Select credit card.
      
			
				Ultimate Rewards platform: Customers earn two points for every 
        $1 spent on travel and entertainment and one point per $1 spent on all 
        other purchases. There are no earning limits and points do not expire.
      
			
				Visa Signature Concierge: J.P. Morgan Select cardmembers have 
        access to a concierge 24/7 for assistance with travel planning, hotel 
        accommodations and dining reservations.
      
			
				Visa Signature Luxury Hotel Collection: Access to exclusive 
        benefits at more than 800 luxury hotels around the world.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chase&#8217;s cards with chip-and-signature technology can be used everywhere 
      traditional magnetic strip cards are accepted in the U.S. and in more 
      than 130 countries abroad where chip technology is implemented.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The annual fee for the J.P. Morgan Select credit card is $95 and is 
      waived the first year. For more information or to apply for the J.P. 
      Morgan Select credit card please visit www.jpmorgancards.com

&lt;p&gt;ST PETERSBURG, Russia, June 17 (Reuters) - State-controlled
Russian oil major Rosneft (ROSN.MM) is talking to Chevron
(CVX.N) about possible cooperation in the search for Arctic oil,
CEO Eduard Khudainatov said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The discussions follow the collapse of a deal between
Rosneft and British oil major BP (BP.L) to launch an Arctic
offshore exploration venture and conduct a $16 billion share
swap.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Khudainatov also said that Rosneft's large Vankor field
would produce 14.8 million tonnes of oil this year, and forecast
a significant increase in production for the company as a whole
in 2012.

			Shaw Awarded Contract to Operate Sediment Processing Facility for 
      General Electric
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Shaw Group Inc. (NYSE: SHAW) today announced that its Environmental 
       Infrastructure Group has been awarded a contract to operate the 
      sediment processing facility for the second phase of the General 
      Electric Company&#8217;s (NYSE: GE) Hudson River dredging project.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The facility is located in Fort Edward, N.Y., and includes a barge 
      terminal, dewatering building, water treatment plant and railroad 
      staging area. Shaw provided similar operations and maintenance services 
      for the project&#8217;s first phase, which was conducted in 2009.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;For decades, Shaw has provided advanced services that help restore and 
      maintain the quality of our nation&#8217;s air, water and soil,&#8221; said George 
      Bevan, president of Shaw&#8217;s Environmental  Infrastructure Group. &#8220;This 
      award builds on our successful history with GE and this important 
      sediment remediation project undertaken for the benefit of the 
      environment and the community.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2002 GE committed to working with the U.S. Environmental Protection 
      Agency to remove sediment containing polychlorinated biphenyls from the 
      Upper Hudson River. Dredging began in 2009 following years of analysis, 
      planning and the design and construction of a processing facility to 
      support remediation efforts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Hudson River dredging project is considered one of the largest and 
      most logistically complex environmental cleanup efforts in U.S. history. 
      GE estimates 2.4 million cubic yards of sediment will be dredged from a 
      40-mile stretch of the river throughout the project&#8217;s lifespan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Shaw demonstrated through its work during the first phase of this 
      project that it shares GE&#8217;s commitment to excellence,&#8221; said Tim 
      Kruppenbacher, GE&#8217;s operations manager for the Hudson River dredging 
      project. &#8220;It is our collective goal to ensure that the project is 
      performed as safely and efficiently as possible.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Shaw plans to use local contractors and manpower from Washington County 
      and New York&#8217;s Capital District to help execute the contract.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The undisclosed value of the contract will be included in Shaw&#8217;s 
      Environmental  Infrastructure segment&#8217;s backlog of unfilled orders in 
      the third quarter of fiscal year 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Shaw Group Inc. (NYSE:SHAW) is a leading global provider of 
      engineering, construction, technology, fabrication, remediation and 
      support services for clients in the energy, chemicals, environmental,

&lt;p&gt;ST PETERSBURG, Russia (Reuters) - Concerns about China and Russia are overblown and they offer investors a chance to buy into booming growth stories, Jim O'Neill, chairman of Goldman Sachs Asset Management, said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Contrary to the email I get every two hours about why I should drop the R from BRIC, I quite like Russia," O'Neill told Reuters Insider television in an interview at the St Petersburg International Economic Forum in Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I also like Chinese equities. As soon as we see the slightest sign of inflation starting to turn around, the markets will stop worrying about more tightening and then, highly controversial, I find myself thinking developed country financials are quite interesting," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Neill declined to specify which banking stocks he liked, but did say the future of China -- and inflation in particular -- was the one issue that kept him awake at night.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this view that is growing, particularly in the (United) States, that China is already going down the hard landing path, that would be a big deal ... I think China is slowing because the authorities are deliberately trying to slow it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said China, Russia, Brazil and India would collectively have economies bigger than the U.S. economy by the end of this decade and this would have a big impact on who runs financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said he thought the slowdown in U.S. growth was temporary but, if it was not, investors should expect a third round of quantitative easing, or QE3 -- a term that describes treasury bond purchases by the central bank to stimulate the flow of credit and investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I am a bit surprised and confused by the evidence that the U.S. has slowed so much. I still suspect it is only temporary and might have something to do with the Japanese supply disruption. If I am wrong then we will get QE3, though it might not be described that way," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Guy Faulconbridge, editing by Timothy Heritage)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question:What does a rack of high-performance, network blade-servers have in common with the 15th century Flemish tapestry  The Hunt for the Unicorn?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Answer: Both are being watched over by some of IBM's most advanced smart building systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, as part of a roll-out of a broader suite of  smart building technologies, I got to enjoy a dose of high culture and high technology, catching Big Blue's announcement of novel collaboration with New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is supplying a suite of hardware and software as part of its Intelligent Building Management system to help the Met fine-tune the maintenance and preservation of its one-of-a-kind collection of medieval artwork.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The move adapts technology developed originally to monitor and manage energy-intensive data centers -- cutting-edge technology of the 21st century -- to help care or for some of the most priceless, hand-made religious and secular artifacts dating back to 800 AD.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the announcement, Dr. Paolo DionisiVici, an Associate Research Scientist at the Met, made clear why doing the latter represents the greater challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Met's main medieval collection is housed in  The Cloisters Museum  Gardens, an assemblage of medieval French abbey structures, transplanted nearly a century ago (more on that below).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Authentic as the setting is, the challenges of managing temperature, humidity, and other variables are daunting: castle-like thick rock walls define a space that sees tens of thousands of visitors each year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The artwork itself also offers up material preservation challenges of a stupefying variety.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The tapestries, like the most-famous-of-all Unicorn hanging, are made of a combination of wool, linen, metal threads, vegetable dyes and other delicate materials. After 600 years, they remain remarkably vivid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nearby in the museum are painted wooded religious artifacts that require different preservation conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Every object is unique, DionisiVici said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's where IBM comes in. To monitor this menagerie, IBM is deploying a network of low-power motes -- small electronics packages fitted with sensors and antennae for communication. [An example of a type of mote IBM has developed, the MEMSIC IRIS mote, is pictured at left.]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The motes can sense temperature, humidity, corrosion, contamination, light levels, air flow, pressure and more, said Dr. Hendrik F. Hamann, one of IBM's research scientists working on the project. The motes are also very energy-efficient and self-configure into a mesh network, he explained, by independently figuring out how to route data from one to the next.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, the technology covers seven rooms, a portion of the Cloisters' overall layout, but including the famous Unicorn tapestries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can motes do when overseeing a vaulted-ceiling room filled with priceless art? In a way the museum cannot today, the sensors and analytic software can tap into real-time data to observe and model microclimates, revealing with greater precision areas of higher heat, or dryness, or other variables that can conventional sensor systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's analytical models can even guide how to place particular works of art, given better understanding of a room's thermal dynamics. Wooden materials, for example, need steady humidity for optimal preservation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is the first large-scale deployment of a smart sensing infrastructure coupled with deep analytics in a museum environment, said Hamann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's pairing with The Cloisters continues a century-old tradition of one-of-a-kinds that define the site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About a century ago, craftsmen in France painstakingly dismantled five cloisters -- essentially, abandoned convents or monasteries designed for secluded, contemplative living -- packed the pieces in boxes, and shipped them via boat across the Atlantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once landed, the crates were hauled up to the highest promontory of Manhattan, to land owned by John D. Rockefeller --  the wealthiest man in U.S. history. Through the years of the Great Depression, some of those same craftsmen methodically reassembled the stones into a meticulous recreation of an abbey complex.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To complete the setting, Rockefeller bought up scores of acres of Manhattan land around the Cloisters and -- just for good measure -- also acquired the ridge of land immediately across the Hudson River, so as to protect the view from his creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rockefeller had no interest in living in the transplanted abbey. In fact, he died a year before the complex was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was built strictly as a home for the more than 5,000 pieces of medieval art he collected in his twilight years, with the intention of donating the entire complex -- building, land and artwork -- to the Met.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If visiting New York City, The Cloisters is a must see -- one of the best and least-known treasures the city has to offer. With IBM's help, the masterworks there will be around to enjoy for a long time to come.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Interior Cloisters photo CC-licensed by respres.

&lt;p&gt;SAN JUAN (Reuters) - Puerto Rico officials on Monday picked a consortium including Goldman Sachs Infrastructure Partners II LP (GS.N) for a $1.08 billion public-private partnership to operate two of the Caribbean island's main roads for 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Autopistas Metropolitanas de Puerto Rico LLC group also included the Spanish infrastructure group Abertis Infraestructuras (ABE.MC) and offered an upfront payment 12.5 percent more than a competing bid placed by a consortium comprised of Morgan Stanley Infrastructure (MS.N) and OHL Concesiones to operate the PR-22 and PR- 5 roadways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bid was 20 percent more than the government's internal estimate of $902 million, according to David Alvarez, executive director of the Puerto Rico Public Private Partnership Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the Autopistas group will invest $56.1 million during the contract's first three years to repair lighting, signage, toll plazas and other infrastructure, plus an estimated $300 million over the life of the contract in basic maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The group will also pay $450,000 annually, plus an additional $450,000 every seven years, to the Puerto Rico Police Department to ensure current levels of service are maintained over the life of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The highway concession is one of several private-public partnership deals that government officials are working to bring to market. Governor Luis Fortuno is banking on such deals with the private sector to finance infrastructure projects and help lift Puerto Rico out of its five-year recession and ease high unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Reuters in San Juan; additional reporting and writing by Michael Connor in Miami; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN JUAN, June 20 (Reuters) - Puerto Rico officials on
Monday picked a consortium including Goldman Sachs
Infrastructure Partners II LP (GS.N) for a $1.08 billion
public-private partnership to operate two of the Caribbean
island's main roads for 40 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Autopistas Metropolitanas de Puerto Rico LLC group also
included the Spanish infrastructure group Abertis
Infraestructuras (ABE.MC) and offered an upfront payment 12.5
percent more than a competing bid placed by a consortium
comprised of Morgan Stanley Infrastructure (MS.N) and OHL
Concesiones to operate the PR-22 and PR- 5 roadways.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bid was 20 percent more than the government's internal
estimate of $902 million, according to David Alvarez, executive
director of the Puerto Rico Public Private Partnership
Authority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, the Autopistas group will invest $56.1 million
during the contract's first three years to repair lighting,
signage, toll plazas and other infrastructure, plus an
estimated $300 million over the life of the contract in basic
maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The group will also pay $450,000 annually, plus an
additional $450,000 every seven years, to the Puerto Rico
Police Department to ensure current levels of service are
maintained over the life of the contract.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The highway concession is one of several private-public
partnership deals that government officials are working to
bring to market. Governor Luis Fortuno is banking on such deals
with the private sector to finance infrastructure projects and
help lift Puerto Rico out of its five-year recession and ease
high unemployment.

 (Adds case numbers, RBS declining to comment, NCUA comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Dave Clarke&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WASHINGTON, June 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. credit union
regulator filed lawsuits on Monday against JPMorgan Chase 
Co's (JPM.N) JPMorgan Securities and Royal Bank of Scotland
Group Plc's (RBS.L) RBS Securities, alleging misrepresentation
of investment vehicles backed by mortgages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The National Credit Union Administration said the lawsuits
seek damages in excess of $800 million and are related to the
failure of five corporate credit unions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The agency said in a statement on Monday that it may file
more lawsuits in an effort to recover billions of dollars in
losses related to the failure of these institutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "NCUA's legal actions are based on ongoing investigations
of individuals and entities responsible for selling these
securities to the failed institutions," said NCUA Board
Chairman Debbie Matz. "By these actions we intend to hold
responsible parties accountable."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan and RBS declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuits, filed in U.S. District Court in Kansas,
allege that the firms made "numerous misrepresentations" in the
offering documents for the securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "These misrepresentations caused the corporate credit
unions that bought the notes to believe the risk of loss
associated with the investment was minimal, when in fact the
risk was substantial," NCUA said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corporate credit unions provide services to retail credit
unions including lending, as well as check and payment
clearance services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The wholesale credit unions have experienced more troubles
than their retail counterparts because they did not face the
same restrictions on permitted investments, leading to big
losses during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The NCUA seized three large corporate credit unions in 2010
after seizing two in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The five institutions are Members United Corporate Federal
Credit Union of Warrenville, Illinois; Southwest Corporate
Federal Credit Union of Plano, Texas; Constitution Corporate
Federal Credit Union of Wallingford, Connecticut; U.S. Central
Corporate Federal Credit Union of Kansas; and Western Corporate
Federal Credit Union of California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The NCUA said in September last year that the five had $50
billion in troubled assets on their books that the agency would
try to sell.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Matz said then the seizure will ultimately cost the
industry between $7 billion and $9 billion and NCUA will
collect this amount from credit unions over the next 10 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit against RBS involves about $565 million in
claims while the lawsuit against JPMorgan involves about $278
million in claims, the agency spokesman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Any money recovered by the lawsuits would go toward
reducing the cost to credit unions of covering the failure of
the five institutions, the regulator said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cases are National Credit Union Administration v. JP

No. 11-cv-2341 and National Credit Union Administration v. RBS

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and Acura Pharmaceuticals Inc said U.S. health regulators approved their pain drug, designed to combat the widespread abuse of opioid-based painkillers, sending Acura's shares up by nearly a third.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The tablet, Oxecta, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of acute and chronic moderate to severe pain in cases where use of an opioid painkiller is suitable.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The drug's active ingredient is the popular painkiller oxycodone -- called "Hillbilly heroin" or "poor man's heroin" -- a narcotic derived from morphine that has resulted in its rampant abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Between 2002 and 2009, the number of Americans aged 12 and older abusing pain relievers increased by 20 percent, according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, which said unintentional drug overdose was the leading cause of injury death in 17 states.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, the Obama administration unveiled a plan to fight what it called a prescription drug abuse epidemic that aims for a 15 percent reduction over five years in non-medical use of prescription-type psychotherapeutic drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup analyst John Boris said in a note to clients that he expects Oxecta's abuse resistant technology to provide an incremental opportunity for Pfizer, estimating peak sales of about $100 million for the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oxecta uses Acura's Aversion technology, which deters abuse by intravenous injection or nasal snorting, Acura Chief Financial Officer Peter Clemens told Reuters by phone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If crushed and snorted, the drug discourages abuse by burning and irritating the nasal passage. If dissolved in water, alcohol or other solvent, the drug turns into a gel, making it difficult to draw through an intravenous needle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But a third method to discourage oral abuse was not included in the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companies dropped that provision in Oxecta after an FDA advisory panel rejected an earlier version of the drug, Acurox, last year, on insufficient data to show that addition of the vitamin niacin would deter excess oral intake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a regulatory filing, Acura said the FDA asked Pfizer to conduct a post-approval study to determine whether Oxecta usage resulted in a decrease in the consequences of misuse and abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which will pay Acura $20 million in milestones, acquired rights to the drug when it bought King Pharmaceuticals in January.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer has indicated that it plans to launch the drug in the third quarter," Acura's CFO said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acura's stock jumped as much as 75 percent to a year-high of $6.80. It was up 27 percent at $4.90 in mid-day trade, making it one of the top percentage gainers on Monday on Nasdaq.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were down slightly at $20.22 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Shravya Jain in Bangalore; Editing by Roshni Menon and Anthony Kurian)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Says drug designed to deter abuse by injection or snorting&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Acura shares soar 75 percent to year high

 (Adds details, analyst and Acura CFO comments, updates share
movement)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Shravya Jain	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; June 20 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and Acura
Pharmaceuticals Inc said their pain drug, designed to
deter abuse, was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug
Administration.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Acura's stock jumped 75 percent to a year-high of $6.80,
making it one of the top percentage gainers on Monday on Nasdaq.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The tablet, Oxecta, was approved for the treatment of acute
and chronic moderate to severe pain in cases where use of an
opioid painkiller is suitable.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oxecta uses Acura's Aversion technology, which deters drug
abuse by intravenous injection or nasal snorting, Acura Chief
Financial Officer Peter Clemens told Reuters over phone. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, it does not contain niacin, which the company
claimed would have reduced abuse by excessive oral intake.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oxecta is a version of the drug Acurox that was rejected by
an FDA advisory panel last year on insufficient data to show
niacin would deter excess dosage.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's subsidiary King Pharmaceuticals had applied for
marketing approval for Acurox.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Pfizer has indicated that it plans to launch the drug in
the third quarter," Acura's CFO said. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Citigroup analyst John Boris said in a note to clients that
he expects Oxecta to be an incremental opportunity for Pfizer
with peak sales of about $100 million.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer shares were down slightly at $20.13 on Monday on the
New York Stock Exchange.

			J.P. Morgan Pledges &#163;1.5 Million to GAVI Alliance
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Firm&#8217;s donation to be matched by U.K. programme for total 
      contribution of &#163;3 million
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan has today announced that it will donate &#163;1.5 million to the 
      GAVI Alliance, a public-private partnership dedicated to saving 
      children&#8217;s lives and protecting people&#8217;s health by increasing access to 
      immunisation in the world&#8217;s poorest countries. The firm&#8217;s donation will 
      be matched by the U.K. government&#8217;s newly created matching fund bringing 
      the total to &#163;3 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased to play our part in funding this global initiative, 
      which is vital to the health of millions of children around the world,&#8221; 
      said Daniel Pinto, J.P. Morgan&#8217;s CEO of Europe, the Middle East and 
      Africa. &#8220;This effort is a great example of private and public sector 
      partnership and we applaud the Prime Minister, Chancellor Osborne, 
      Development Secretary Mitchell, Bill Gates and the countless workers who 
      have helped create awareness for such a critical issue.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan remains committed to social entrepreneurs and underserved 
      communities across the globe even in the most challenging times. Last 
      year alone, the firm pledged more than $150 million through grants and 
      sponsorships to thousands of not-for-profit organisations in more than 
      25 countries.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Chancellor George Osborne said of J.P. Morgan&#8217;s donation: &#8220;It is to 
      their credit that J.P. Morgan are joining the fight to immunise children 
      against preventable diseases and I&#8217;m delighted that they are making this 
      contribution to GAVI. It is a great example of a public private 
      partnership that will literally save millions of lives. The overwhelming 
      support to GAVI at the conference on 13&#160;June illustrates the world&#8217;s 
      commitment to tackling vaccine-preventable disease and is a massive vote 
      of confidence for GAVI&#8217;s approach.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are delighted to welcome J.P. Morgan as a Matching Fund partner,&#8221; 
      said GAVI Alliance Board Chair Dagfinn Hoybraten. &#8220;We recognise J.P.

&lt;p&gt;  SUNNYVALE, CA, Jun 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Narus, Inc., the leader in dynamic network traffic intelligence and
analytics, announced today that Narus is an IBM Netezza-certified cyber
security solution provider for all IBM Netezza's appliances. Narus has
been an IBM Netezza Complementary Technology Partner since 2010. The two
companies have started strategically selling together in the federal
market. The partnership yields a powerful combined solution, leveraging
the unique strengths of both companies' cyber security technology to
deliver unmatched protection against today's most sophisticated and
malicious cyber attacks. Narus executives will be on hand to walk
attendees through this latest innovation at the IBM Netezza 2011 user
conference, Enzee Universe. 

    Advanced persistent threats, zero-day attacks and other sophisticated
cyber threats are causing significant disruptions to today's business
environment, requiring organizations to evaluate their existing security
solutions to determine if they provide adequate protection. Many have
concluded that responding quickly to imminent cyber attacks requires
maintaining situational awareness of their networks, predicting and
detecting anomalous and malicious network traffic, and executing
deep-dive forensics on large volumes of data captured over an extended
period of time. Until the Narus-IBM Netezza partnership and introduction
of a combined cyber security solution, these endeavors were considered
nearly impossible.

    As complementary technology partners, IBM Netezza and Narus bring to
market a collaborative solution that easily meets today's cyber security
requirements. With this partnership, the two companies deliver a solution
that combines Narus' powerful real-time network traffic monitoring and
analytics with IBM Netezza's large-scale data analytics and data
warehousing capabilities to identify malicious activities and determine
the entire history of the cyber threat. The combined capability enables
network and security operators to take appropriate corrective actions
quickly, thus drastically improving protection against cyber attacks.

    When the output from NarusInsight analytics is stored in an IBM Netezza
data warehouse technology, the combined solution enables users to:


--  Conduct quick, efficient and accelerated search or dynamic query
    through huge volumes of data
    
    
--  Take corrective actions quickly by easily digesting and analyzing the
    large volume of detailed information captured and analyzed by
    NarusInsight(TM) on every flow in the network
    
    
--  Perform complex forensics analysis on data stored over extended
    periods of time to address questions such as: "When in the last year
    did each DNS server in my network appear?" "How many queries did each
    of them answer?" and "Who talked to each of these DNS servers?"
    


    

"Protection of networks and infrastructures is becoming more and
more difficult as cyber attacks increase in frequency and stealth. This
is where strong partnerships and complementary solutions can level the
playing field," said Chee Tan, director of business development, Narus.
"Our partnership with Netezza leverages our respective expertise to
ensure a unique cyber security solution that will undoubtedly set a high
bar in the cyber security industry."

    Narus will showcase the new solution in Booth No. 9 at Enzee Universe,
the IBM Netezza 2011 user conference, held June 20-22, 2011 at The Westin
Boston Waterfront in Boston. To register for the event, please visit

&lt;p&gt;  SAN FRANCISCO, CA, Jun 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Riverbed Technology (NASDAQ: RVBD), the IT performance company, today
announced that the company has been named by Microsoft as an application
acceleration hardware partner in the worldwide network of Microsoft
Technology Centers (MTCs). This partnership enables joint customers to
interact with solutions experts and test joint Riverbed(R)-Microsoft
solutions in a high-performance environment. Riverbed and Microsoft have
partnered on several key product areas, allowing enterprises to
drastically improve collaboration by leveraging Microsoft enterprise
software solutions over the wide area network (WAN) and in the cloud. 

    "Microsoft Technology Centers include hardware and software from industry
leading partners -- including Riverbed -- that our joint customers are
able to access during their engagements. Customers will now have the
opportunity to test drive Riverbed WAN optimization solutions to
accelerate application traffic over the WAN and get the most out of their
Microsoft deployments," said Chuck McCann, Worldwide MTC alliances
program director, Microsoft. 

    Microsoft Technology Centers are collaborative environments that provide
access to innovative technologies and world-class expertise, enabling
organizations to envision, design and deploy enterprise IT solutions to
meet their specific needs. With 22 MTCs around the world, prospective
Riverbed-Microsoft customers will be able to participate in architecture
design sessions and proof of concept workshops, enabling them to design
cutting edge enterprise IT solutions.

    "Riverbed has worked closely with Microsoft to help ensure that joint
customers realize the best possible performance for their Microsoft
enterprise applications," said Venugopal Pai, vice president of global
alliances, Riverbed. "This partnership is further proof of the deep
relationship between Riverbed and Microsoft, which enables organizations
to confidently leverage Microsoft software solutions over the WAN and in
the cloud." 

    Accelerating Microsoft Enterprise Applications Over the WAN

    Businesses worldwide rely on Microsoft's enterprise software products
such as SharePoint and Exchange, and are turning to Riverbed for WAN
optimization solutions to accelerate business agility and improve
productivity while reducing costs. As a result, Microsoft customers
adopting Riverbed WAN optimization solutions are enabling their
businesses to take advantage of application acceleration, cloud
infrastructures, virtualization, faster WAN data backups and bandwidth
optimization technologies, and local area network (LAN)-like performance
for business-critical Microsoft applications over the WAN.

    More than 13,000 organizations worldwide, across a wide range of markets,
depend on Riverbed to understand, optimize and consolidate their IT
infrastructure. Riverbed delivers hardware, software and virtualized
solutions that overcome performance issues caused by distance,
distributed computing, and ever increasing amounts of data.
Virtualization, consolidation and cloud computing promise huge cost
savings and improved efficiencies, but as users move farther from their
data, slow applications and file transfers can stall these strategic
initiatives. Riverbed delivers to the remote office and mobile workers
the same "local area network (LAN)-like" performance, no matter where the
private data center or public cloud may be. Riverbed continues building
on its success in the WAN optimization and application aware network
performance management (NPM) markets with new and innovative solutions
for accelerating cloud storage and access to applications and data
deployed in public, private and hybrid clouds.

&lt;p&gt;
RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., June 20, 2011 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Icagen, Inc.
(Nasdaq:ICGN) today provided an update on its sodium channel program for pain
and related disorders which is being conducted in collaboration with Pfizer.
Icagen and Pfizer have initiated a multiple ascending dose study of the lead
compound in the collaboration, which targets the ion channel Nav 1.7.

The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and
pharmacokinetics of multiple doses of this novel drug candidate in a placebo
controlled study in healthy volunteers. Up to four cohorts of healthy volunteers
will receive escalating doses of the drug candidate for a period of fourteen
days.

P. Kay Wagoner, CEO of Icagen, stated, "We are delighted that, in collaboration
with Pfizer, we continue the clinical development of our potent and
subtype-selective Nav 1.7 blocker.  This marks another important step in our
joint development of subtype-selective sodium channel blockers, which we believe
represent a promising approach for the treatment of pain and related disorders."

Pfizer will continue to fund all aspects of the collaboration, including all
clinical studies and the continuing research and preclinical development efforts
at Icagen on collaboration sodium channel targets. Pfizer has exclusive
worldwide rights to commercialize any products that result from the
collaboration. Icagen is eligible to receive milestones and tiered royalties
based upon any product sales for each product under the collaboration.

			News Facts
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        During a migration or to integrate disparate environments, 
        organizations traditionally relied on native tools that required 
        Exchange Server 2003, were difficult to install, lacked the necessary 
        level of functionality, and involved considerable risk.
      
			
        Quest Coexistence Manager for GroupWise ensures interoperability 
        between GroupWise and Exchange (on-premises or hosted) - including Microsoft 
        Office 365 - enabling organizations to maintain productivity 
        throughout a migration or coexistence period.
      
			
        Quest Coexistence Manager for GroupWise includes the following product 
        features:

        
					
						Free/Busy Connector &#8211; Enables free/busy queries between 
            GroupWise and Exchange, enabling users to view availability and 
            schedule meetings with other users no matter where their mailbox 
            resides.
          
					
						Directory Connector &#8211; Provides complete directories in both 
            GroupWise and Exchange, allowing users on both platforms to view a 
            common list of users, groups and resources.
          
					
						Calendar Guard &#8211; Ensures accuracy of calendar appointments, 
            including custom recurring meetings, reschedules and cancellations 
            sent between platforms. GroupWise and Exchange users can 
            collaborate and schedule meetings with each other throughout the 
            coexistence period.

        GroupWise is the latest in Quest&#8217;s award-winning

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer and Acura Announce FDA Approval of Oxectatm (Oxycodone 
      HCL, USP) CII
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and Acura Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ACUR) 
      announce the marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug 
      Administration (FDA) of OXECTATM (oxycodone HCl, USP) Tablets 
      CII. OXECTA is indicated for the management of acute and chronic 
      moderate to severe pain where the use of an opioid analgesic is 
      appropriate.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OXECTA is the first immediate-release oxycodone HCl medicine that 
      applies technology designed to discourage common methods of tampering 
      associated with opioid abuse and misuse. This AVERSION&#174;&#160;Technology 
      is a unique composition of commonly used pharmaceutical ingredients. 
      Pfizer is licensing the technology in OXECTA from Acura.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Opioid medications are an important treatment option for patients with 
      moderate to severe pain who are not adequately managed by other pain 
      treatments. However, abuse and misuse of opioids is a serious public 
      health issue that is the focus of a number of recent United States 
      government initiatives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We recognize our responsibility to physicians and patients and remain 
      committed to appropriate access to pain treatment and developing 
      medicines to potentially address this important public health and safety 
      issue,&#8221; said Olivier Brandicourt, Pfizer president and general manager, 
      Primary Care. &#8220;OXECTA will further expand Pfizer&#8217;s presence in pain 
      management and complements our growing, robust portfolio of treatments 
      and medicines in development for pain relief, one of our strategic, 
      high-priority disease areas. We are pleased to bring OXECTA to patients 
      and physicians with our partner Acura.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are excited to be partnered with Pfizer to bring OXECTA to patients 
      who need opioids to manage their pain,&#8221; said Robert Jones, interim 
      president and chief executive officer of Acura Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
      &#8221;Acura is focused on developing technologies that are intended to 
      potentially deter abuse and misuse.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Important Safety Information
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OXECTA is contraindicated in patients with respiratory depression in 
      unmonitored settings and in the absence of resuscitative equipment, in 
      any patient who has or is suspected of having paralytic ileus, in 
      patients with acute or severe bronchial asthma or hypercarbia, and in 
      patients with known hypersensitivity to oxycodone, oxycodone salts, or 
      any components of the product.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Respiratory depression is the primary risk of OXECTA. This is more 
      common in elderly or debilitated patients, in those suffering from 
      conditions such as COPD, severe asthma, or upper airway obstruction, or 
      following large initial doses of opioids given to non-tolerant patients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      OXECTA contains oxycodone HCl, an opioid agonist and a Schedule II 
      controlled substance. Such drugs are sought by drug abusers and people 
      with addictions. OXECTA can be abused in a manner similar to other 
      opioids and narcotics. This should be considered when prescribing or 
      dispensing oxycodone HCl in situations where the physician or pharmacist 
      is concerned about an increased risk of misuse or abuse. OXECTA may be 
      abused by crushing, chewing, snorting or injecting the product. These 
      practices pose a significant risk to the abuser that could result in 
      overdose and death. OXECTA should not be given to anyone other than the 
      individual for whom it was prescribed. Keep OXECTA in a locked cabinet, 
      drawer or medicine safe so that it will not be stolen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is no evidence that OXECTA has a reduced abuse liability compared 
      to immediate-release oxycodone.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Take each OXECTA tablet with enough water to ensure complete swallowing 
      immediately after placing in the mouth, and OXECTA must be swallowed 
      whole. As OXECTA is not amenable to crushing and dissolution, do not use 
      OXECTA in nasogastric, gastric or other feeding tubes as it may cause 
      obstruction of feeding tubes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Patients who have not been receiving opioid analgesics should start on 
      OXECTA in a dosing range of 5&#160;to 15 mg every 4&#160;to 6 hours as needed for 
      pain. The dose should be titrated based upon the individual patient&#8217;s 
      response to their first dose of OXECTA. Patients with chronic pain may 
      need to be dosed at the lowest dosage level that will achieve acceptable 
      pain relief and tolerable adverse reactions, on an around-the-clock 
      basis rather than on an as needed basis. When a patient no longer needs 
      treatment with OXECTA after long-term use, it is important to gradually 
      taper OXECTA over time to prevent withdrawal symptoms.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Patients taking OXECTA in combination with other medicines like 
      sedatives, anesthetics or narcotics may have serious problems such as 
      respiratory depression, low blood pressure, profound sedation, or coma. 
      Do not drink alcoholic beverages or take any medicines containing 
      alcohol while taking OXECTA.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Use OXECTA with caution in patients with head injuries or other 
      conditions that increase pressure in the brain, shock with low blood 
      volume, severe undiagnosed abdominal conditions, history of seizures, 
      severe kidney or liver disease, gall bladder disease, Addison&#8217;s disease, 
      hypothyroidism, enlarged prostate or other illnesses that make urination 
      difficult and elderly or debilitated patients. Do not use OXECTA in 
      patients with intestinal obstruction especially paralytic ileus.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Patients taking OXECTA should use caution when driving a car, operating 
      heavy machinery or doing similar, potentially dangerous tasks as OXECTA 
      may impair abilities needed to drive or perform potentially dangerous 
      activities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The most common adverse reactions are nausea, constipation, vomiting, 
      headache, itchiness, trouble sleeping, dizziness, loss of 
      strength/energy, and sleepiness.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Keep OXECTA out of the reach of children. If a child accidently takes 
      OXECTA, seek emergency medical help immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      For additional information on the prescribing information for OXECTA, 
      please call 1 (800) 776-3637.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, June 20 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp will
delay  the start-up of its 1 million tonnes-per-year (tpy)
ethylene cracker on Jurong Island in Singapore into next year
instead of the end of 2011 due to longer-than-expected safety
checks needed for its petrochemical projects, a company official
said on Monday.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The cracker will be the last of the projects to be started
up. This will take place sometime in 2012," said Georges
Grosliere, Singapore-based venture director, declining to name
the specified quarter next year. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cracker was part of a host of projects which include two
new polyethylene units which have a combined capacity of 1.2
million tpy and a 300,000 tpy specialty elastomers unit. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The (petrochemical) site is very integrated. There are new
units in the midst of existing facilities," said Grosliere.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you start up new units in existing facilities, we need
to be extremely careful and safety is our top priority."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;p&gt;
      Middleware is computer software that connects software components or 
      some people and their applications. The software consists of a set of 
      services that allows multiple processes running on one or more machines 
      to interact. This technology evolved to provide for interoperability in 
      support of the move to coherent distributed architectures, which are 
      most often used to support and simplify complex distributed 
      applications. It includes web servers, application servers, and similar 
      tools that support application development and delivery. Middleware is 
      especially integral to modern information technology based on XML, SOAP, 
      Web services, and service-oriented architecture.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It has been reported the total market size for middleware software at 
      $25 billion plus for year 2008. The middleware software includes 
      business process platforms and legacy transaction servers (e.g IBM CICS, 
      Oracle Tuxedo, Natural/Adabas etc). As per the report, IBM is market 
      leader with 18.7% market share. It is followed by Microsoft (16.3%), 
      Oracle (13.8%) and SAP (5.4%). These top four vendors cover 54.2% market

      an industry-leading range of products which enables Microsoft partners, 
      whether they already provide Software Asset Management&#160;(http://www.licencedashboard.co.uk/) 
      services or not, to increase the value of the services they offer to 
      customers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "Microsoft partners have a unique place in the IT supplier ecosystem and 
      are perfectly-placed to deliver effective Software Asset Management 
      solutions and services to organizations. The License Dashboard partner 
      program is designed to help partners capitalize on this opportunity 
      quickly, providing a flexible combination of expert support together 
      with incentives for those partners who can create significant revenue 
      streams quickly." License Dashboard has a range of packages available 
      for resale, designed to suit all sizes of businesses as well as both 
      managed and hosted service providers.&#160;To learn more about License

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NEW YORK AND LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA AND SAN
MATEO, CALIFORNIA AND TORONTO, CANADA, Jun 20 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Intertainment Media Inc. ("Intertainment" or the "Company") (TSX VENTURE:
INT)(OTCQX: ITMTF)(FRANKFURT: I4T) announces that Ortsbo
(www.ortsbo.com), the real time experiential translation platform, has
begun the full rollout of its multi-language application for the world's
most popular email platform, Microsoft Outlook. Users who register at
Ortsbo.com for the free trial of Ortsbo for Outlook, or "O4O" will
receive the ability to send and receive emails in over 50 languages.
Later this year, Ortsbo will release Ortsbo 2.0 expanding the entire
platform of services with 80 languages and enhanced email, online,
mobile, portable, translation and learning based language services.

    All currently registered and new O4O users who register by early August
2011 will be eligible to participate in Ortsbo's Cruise Into Translation
promotion and have the opportunity to win 1 of 5 trips on the KISS KRUISE
in October 2011. Ortsbo is making available up to 10 Million copies of
O4O beta for initial free trials and users who choose to convert to the
full version of O4O will be entitled to initial introductory pricing of
as low as $29.95 US for the application.

    Ortsbo has also begun to ramp up its activation of users on its cloud
computing based Windows Azure Platform, providing global users of Ortsbo
the ability to connect through any desktop, mobile or portable computer
browser. Ortsbo for Azure is a HTML based platform and does not require
any downloading, allowing users in both consumer and commercial settings
to use the program. Recent tests of the updated platform have seen the
daily traffic accelerate by up to 150% over the previous records set for
Ortsbo engagement and without the time delays experienced with the
Silverlight version of Ortsbo. The Company is confident that Windows
Azure will allow virtually unlimited global connections and immediate
response for the Ortsbo platform. Ortsbo plans to release additional user
statistics as it completes testing of the new platform.

    When initially launched in July 2010, Ortsbo's social media translation
platform conventional infrastructure was designed to handle the expected
first 2 to 3 years of operations and/or an expected 12 Million monthly
users. Ortsbo exceeded all growth projections in its first 9 months,
growing to over 16 Million monthly users by the end of its first 10
months, which required the Company to accelerate development of its 2nd
generation platform. Ortsbo has chosen to move its continuing and future
technical operations to the Microsoft's Window Azure platform providing a
virtually unlimited operational environment to service user needs
globally.

    The time spent over the past 2 months to initially re-engineer Ortsbo for
cloud computing and the switch to Windows Azure has saved Ortsbo and
Intertainment considerable capital costs as the Company had initially
planned to install up to 7 data centers around the globe at an expected
cost of well over $10 Million with increased ongoing infrastructure and
manpower services. With the move to the cloud with Windows Azure, those
capital costs have effectively disappeared allowing the Company to focus
its capital on growth, revenue acceleration, increasing its intellectual
property suite and merger and acquisition opportunities.

    During Summer 2011, the Company is expected to debut its Ortsbo mobile
platform form many of the world's most popular platforms and several apps
for Apple and Android based devices.

    Upcoming Events:

    June 22, 2011 - Steve Nash Foundation Showdown In Chinatown 

    Ortsbo presents, two-time NBA MVP Steve Nash's Showdown in Chinatown
charity soccer match event in New York City. The event will consist of a
competitive soccer game featuring NBA and professional soccer athletes
and Ortsbo will provide a global, real-time chat environment at 11 am
Eastern allowing Steve Nash and the Showdown athletes to interact
seamlessly over social media platforms with fans in over 50 languages. To
participate, register at www.showdownliveandglobal.com. 

    Through August 2011 Ortsbo 040 - With the launch of Ortsbo's email plug
in for Microsoft Outlook, or "O4O", Ortsbo is launching a unique
promotion: Ortsbo Cruise Into Translation. Users who register and install
O4O through August 2011 will have the opportunity to win 1 of 5 trips on
the KISS KRUISE in October as well as other VIP prizes. Additional
contest ballots will be available for people who refer friends that
register and install O4O. To register, please visit www.ortsbo.com.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co agreed to pay $153.6 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it defrauded investors who bought mortgage securities sold just before the nation's housing market collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulator's complaint against the banking giant was larded with excerpts from internal JPMorgan communications that indicated bankers sold a collateralized mortgage obligation in 2007 to ensure that it could get credit-scarred mortgage securities off its books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are soooo pregnant with this deal, we need a wheel-barrel to move around," the head of CDO distribution wrote in a March 22, 2007 email to the sales staff. "Let's schedule the cesarian, please!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement with JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, echoes on a smaller scale the $550 million accord that Goldman Sachs Group Inc reached last July over its Abacus collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both cases involved charges that banks let hedge fund clients structure complex securities -- and then bet against them -- without disclosing their involvement to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC on Tuesday also filed civil charges against Edward Steffelin, 41, a former managing director at the now bankrupt GSC Capital Corp, which served as collateral agent for the JPMorgan CDO marketed as Squared CDO 2007-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It alleged that he hoped to get a job with the Magnetar Capital LLC hedge fund, while helping to create marketing materials that failed to disclose that Magnetar chose some securities in the CDO and had a nearly $600 million bet that they would lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold $150 million of Squared CDO notes to pension funds and investors worldwide that lost most of their value in just 10 months, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is deja vu all over again," said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University, recalling the Goldman case with a quote from baseball legend Yogi Berra. "If Goldman and JPMorgan were doing this, it wouldn't surprise me if others were as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FULL PIPELINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No individual bankers were charged in the JPMorgan case, but SEC enforcement chief Robert Khuzami told reporters the agency continues to pursue individuals and has charged roughly 50 people in cases related to the credit crisis of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro also addressed criticism that about the lack of charges against individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not for lack of will and desire that we are not seeing as many senior people being named in these cases," Schapiro said. "If we could, we would be naming them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman vice president whose case is ongoing, was the only individual charged by the SEC over Abacus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Schapiro said the SEC will continue to bring charges against banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a pretty full pipeline of post-crisis cases," she said. "They relate to disclosure failures, particularly around structured products, accounting issues and so forth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXACERBATING A CRISIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say CDOs such as Squared and Abacus allowed banks and mortgage lenders to dump credit-deficient loans and then make more, further inflating the subprime mortgage bubble even as signs of excess were apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to pay a $133 million fine, plus $20.6 million of improper profits and interest. About $125.9 million will go to investors in the Squared CDO, and $27.7 million will go to the U.S. Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accord also requires JPMorgan to change its policies for reviewing and approving offerings of mortgage securities. It must be approved by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan. Steffelin's case was assigned to a different judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan did not admit wrongdoing, but said it lost nearly $900 million on the Squared transaction. It also said the SEC's penalty reflected in part its voluntary decision to pay $56.8 million to investors in a separate CDO, Tahoma CDO I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Goldman, which settled a fraud charge indicating it acted with intent or recklessness, JPMorgan was charged in a way that suggests its activity may have been negligent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Lipman, a partner at Nixon Peabody who represents Steffelin, criticized the SEC's claims, and denied that his client had been pursuing a job with Magnetar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are baffled by the SEC's decision to proceed against an individual in a contested proceeding on a negligence theory," he said. Steffelin "did not work for the underwriter and had no responsibility for the contents of the offering memorandum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnetar in a statement said SEC staff advised it not to expect any enforcement action by the regulator. "We did not control the asset selection process and our mortgage CDO investment strategy was designed and implemented to maintain a market-neutral portfolio," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Squared sales materials indicated that the underlying investments in the CDO were chosen by a GSC affiliate, but failed to reveal that Magnetar played a significant role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC earlier this year sent a "Wells notice" indicating possible civil charges to both Steffelin and Michael Llodra, JPMorgan's former global head of structured product CDOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Llodra was not charged on Tuesday. He could not immediately be reached for comment. Walton Securities Inc, which according to regulatory records now employs Steffelin, did not return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed up 43 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $40.91 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are SEC v. JPMorgan Securities LLC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-04206; and SEC v. Steffelin in the same court, No. 11-04204.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sarah N.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's settlement with regulators on Tuesday could be just a small taste of the losses it faces from mortgage-linked securities and the damage they did to its storied reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank agreed to pay just $154 million to settle charges it omitted key information when marketing complex instruments linked to home loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the case is a reminder that, although JPMorgan backed away from the mortgage fiasco early, it built mortgage-related securities that could result in some $30 billion of claims against the bank, according to an analysis by Chris Whalen, co-founder of research firm Institutional Risk Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Street is worried about this big-time litigation," said Whalen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares rose on Tuesday as investors shrugged off the long been expected settlement, but the bank's shares have fallen more than 15 percent from their 52-week high in mid-February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of that $30 billion, about $18 billion comes from the dealings of Bear Stearns, Whalen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's outspoken chief executive, is often feted in financial circles as a shining example for the industry. He successfully avoided many of the losses that hurt his rivals during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Magnetar case is a reminder that, while JPMorgan might have been smarter than some of its rivals, it was not always kinder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the bank sold exposure to a portfolio of weak assets without telling clients that a hedge fund had helped pick many of those assets and would profit when they failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan was earlier to recognize the problems and protect their book than their peers. It wasn't that they didn't do many of the same things prior to that point," said Josh Rosner, an independent financial analyst at Graham Fisher  Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONG MEMORIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon recently complained publicly to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke about the overall burden of regulation on his bank, a mark of how confident the executive is about his stature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Magnetar case could mark a turning point in the bank's reputation, said Charles Geisst, a Wall Street historian and professor at Manhattan College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan has tried over the years, and very successfully, to portray themselves as the good guys," said Geisst, listing the bank's role in bailing out the U.S. Treasury in the 1890s, attempting to stop panics in 1907 and the 1930s and restructuring Mexican debt a couple of decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a long tradition of them at least appearing to do the right thing, until now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the bank's story includes allegations of misleading investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is exactly the opposite," Geisst added. "People have long memories for this type of thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - A sizable bearish options play on Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) transacted on Tuesday suggests the energy company's stock could drop 10 percent ahead of August expiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, ended 1.07 percent higher to $80.57. The stock is down 8 percent from this year's closing high of $88 on April 29, but is up more than 10 percent year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early option trades included an August $72.50-$77.50 put ratio spread that is apparently looking for shares to head lower once again, said OptionMonster analyst Chris McKhann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could be a protective position against a long equity holding or a play on the price of crude oil," said Patrick Mortimer, director of options trading at stock and options block execution firm Pipeline Trading Systems in New Hope, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Exxon's shares mirroring the fluctuation in crude oil prices, this trade could be a play on an increase in supply over the summer months with some political stability coming to oil producing counties," Mortimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Option analysts and traders said the strategist purchased 7,500 August $77.5 XOM strike puts for a premium of $1.79 each and simultaneously sold 15,000 lower August $72.50 XOM strike puts at 78 cents apiece. The net cost of the ratio spread was 23 cents per contract for the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investor may be taking an outright bearish stance on the stock or could be hedging a long stock position ahead of Exxon Mobil's July 28 second-quarter earnings report, said Interactive Brokers Group options strategist Caitlin Duffy in a note on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of existing positions held by investors at both strikes was less than 200 contracts, so it was a new opening spread, OptionMonster's McKhann said on the firm's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread cost 23 cents.

&lt;p&gt; * Investor opens large bearish August XOM ratio put spread&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Trade yields maximum payout if shares fall to $72.50&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Block of Aug $85 calls apparently sold, a bearish sign&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Doris Frankel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHICAGO, June 21 (Reuters) - A sizable bearish options play
on Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) transacted on Tuesday suggests the
energy company's stock could drop 10 percent ahead of August
expiration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded
oil company, ended 1.07 percent higher to $80.57. The stock is
down 8 percent from this year's closing high of $88 on April
29, but is up more than 10 percent year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early option trades included an August $72.50-$77.50 put
ratio spread that is apparently looking for shares to head
lower once again, said OptionMonster analyst Chris McKhann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This could be a protective position against a long equity
holding or a play on the price of crude oil," said Patrick
Mortimer, director of options trading at stock and options
block execution firm Pipeline Trading Systems in New Hope,
Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With Exxon's shares mirroring the fluctuation in crude oil
prices, this trade could be a play on an increase in supply
over the summer months with some political stability coming to
oil producing counties," Mortimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Option analysts and traders said the strategist purchased
7,500 August $77.5 XOM strike puts for a premium of $1.79 each
and simultaneously sold 15,000 lower August $72.50 XOM strike
puts at 78 cents apiece. The net cost of the ratio spread was
23 cents per contract for the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investor may be taking an outright bearish stance on
the stock or could be hedging a long stock position ahead of
Exxon Mobil's July 28 second-quarter earnings report, said
Interactive Brokers Group options strategist Caitlin Duffy in a
note on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The number of existing positions held by investors at both
strikes was less than 200 contracts, so it was a new opening
spread, OptionMonster's McKhann said on the firm's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The spread cost 23 cents. The trade would yield a maximum
profit of $4.77 per contract if Exxon shares fall to $72.50 at
Aug. 19 expiration, which represents a 10 percent decline over
the next 59 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The risk is that the trader may be required to buy a net
quantity of 750,000 shares of Exxon stock if the August $72.5
puts land in the money. Losses would start to build if shares
fall below the lower break-even point of $67.73, Duffy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A bearish ratio put spread is when an investor buys a
near-the-money put and sells two out-of-the-money put options.
The premium received for the two puts dramatically offsets the
cost of the single put but it exposes the trader to full stock
risk below the break-even point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other signs of investor pessimism on Exxon cropped up in
the August $85 strike call where it appears some 2,600
contracts were sold for an average premium of 70 cents apiece,
Duffy said.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft&#8217;s proposed $8.5 billion deal to purchase Skype has won antitrust approval, the Federal Trade Commission announced today.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The news means that Microsoft is one step closer to finalizing its Skype purchase, barring any other unforeseen difficulties. Microsoft previously said that it expects to close the Skype deal by the end of the year. Given Skype&#8217;s recent string of outages, the sooner Microsoft can help out the video chat company, the better.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And once Microsoft gets Skype&#8217;s architecture problems worked out, it can begin working on integrating the service into the Xbox 360, Windows Phone, and Office programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As I&#8217;ve written previously, there&#8217;s no doubt that the video chat company has a lot to gain from Microsoft. For one, it won&#8217;t have to worry much about its revenue problems anymore. Plus, Skype will finally be able to bring on more developers to polish its software &#8212; recent updates have added some cool features like group video chat, but the software has also gotten slower and more difficult to use in the process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Via Reuters&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Filed under: deals, Mergers and Acquisitions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VENICE, Italy (Reuters) - Caution caused by the Greek crisis and sluggish consumer spending has led JPMorgan Private Bank's Europe, Middle East and Africa unit to be underweight on equities and bonds, its chief investment strategist said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EMEA unit recommends diversifying into hedge funds. Five percent of the model portfolio is in commodities, with 2 to 3 percentage points of that in gold, strategist Cesar Perez told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say that given valuations, our models should have much more risk and much more equities," he said on the margins of an investment conference with clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to be constructive, but we continue to be cautious in our underweight equities at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co's Private Bank has about $770 billion in assets under management, making it one of the biggest private banks in the world. Perez declined to give details about his unit's assets under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perez said he was cautious on equities and bonds because the European Union and Athens have failed to resolve Greece's crushing debt problem a year after the crisis first erupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Europe still faces nagging questions about the capital health of its banks -- worries that the United States eased about its own lenders through stress tests and capital injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still need more capital to be at rest," he said."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the economic recovery will be consumer spending around the world, he said, with key numbers for a turnaround including U.S. payrolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumer confidence is going to make the recovery sustainable or not sustainable," Perez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His unit is "very, very underweight" on European equities, he said. Most of its exposure is through Germany's shares index with mid-sized companies that prospered through an export boom and are likely to see an upturn as German consumer spending picks up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His biggest overweight pick is U.S. equities, since U.S. companies are flush with cash, meaning dividends, acquisitions and capital spending could pick up, he said. Perez likes big U.S. technology companies such as computer and phone maker Apple Inc and chip maker Intel Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The corporate sector is the thing that can maintain the situation as we see it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perez is neutral on emerging market equities, with most exposure in that sector in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perez is underweight on government bonds, a position offset by high-yield corporate bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ian Simpson, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)&lt;/p&gt;

			J.P. Morgan Securities Reaches Settlement with SEC Regarding CDOs
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMorgan Chase  Co. (NYSE: JPM) announced today that one of its U.S. 
      broker-dealer affiliates, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, has agreed to a 
      settlement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission resolving 
      the SEC&#8217;s inquiry regarding certain collateralized debt obligations 
      (CDOs) the firm sold over four years ago. The agreement is subject to 
      court approval.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of the agreement, J.P. Morgan Securities consented to the filing 
      of a complaint by the Commission, without admitting or denying the 
      allegations in the complaint, and will pay disgorgement and penalties 
      totaling $153.6 million related to the sale of Squared CDO 2007-1. J.P. 
      Morgan Securities is pleased to have reached agreement with the SEC to 
      put this matter concerning certain 2007 disclosures behind us. The SEC 
      has not charged the firm with intentional or reckless misconduct.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      At the time of the sale of the Squared notes, the firm took risk of loss 
      on 85 percent of all the notes issued by Squared and the firm ultimately 
      sustained losses of nearly $900 million in connection with those notes. 
      The Commission&#8217;s complaint alleges that J.P. Morgan Securities 
      negligently failed to disclose in the offering documents for Squared 
      that Magnetar Capital LLC, which purchased the subordinated notes (or 
      &#8220;equity&#8217;) in Squared and purchased the credit protection on a 
      substantial portion of the collateral, played a significant role in the 
      collateral selection process. The complaint notes, however, that the 
      offering documents for Squared did disclose that a noteholder in Squared 
      may hold a short position with respect to the collateral or buy credit 
      protection with respect to the collateral, and that a noteholder may act 
      with respect to those positions &#8220;without regard to whether any such 
      action might have an adverse effect on the Issuer, the Noteholders, 
      related Reference Entity or any Reference Obligation.&#8221; The complaint 
      also acknowledges that the third-party collateral manager for Squared, 
      GSC, was aware that Magnetar was both an investor in the transaction and 
      purchased the credit protection on a substantial portion of the 
      collateral.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Separately, J.P. Morgan Securities conducted a review of the CDO 
      transactions that were the subject of the Commission&#8217;s investigation 
      and, based upon that review, voluntarily made payments of approximately 
      $56 million to certain investors in connection with a CDO unrelated to 
      Squared known as Tahoma I. While the Commission has not asserted any 
      claims with respect to that transaction, these voluntary payments by 
      J.P. Morgan Securities were taken into account by the Commission in 
      connection with this settlement.

&lt;p&gt;  VANCOUVER, BRITISH COLUMBIA, Jun 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Simba Technologies Inc., the industry expert in standards-based
relational and multi-dimensional data connectivity, announced today that
it will be speaking at the ODTUG Kscope11 conference on June 27, 2011 in
Long Beach, CA. Simba's session, entitled "Use New BI Features in Excel
2010 with Oracle OLAP," will provide an in-depth look at new Business
Intelligence (BI) functionality built into Microsoft Excel 2010 for
analytics, ad hoc data query and dashboard reporting. Simba will also be
exhibiting and providing Excel connectivity demonstrations at the show.

    Simba's MDX Provider for Oracle OLAP Enables Direct Connectivity between
Microsoft Excel and Oracle Database OLAP Option 

    Simba's MDX Provider for Oracle OLAP product enables the direct
connection from popular BI applications - such as Microsoft Excel
PivotTables - to Oracle Database 11g OLAP Option. The product is based
upon Simba's widely deployed MDX 2005 Query Language technology.

    MDX Provider for Oracle OLAP enables users to take advantage of native
Excel PivotTable and PivotChart functionality to analyze data stored
within their Oracle OLAP database. The solution securely gives users
control over their own BI reporting using Excel's extensive, easy-to-use
formatting options and dashboard presentation capabilities. Users are
able to perform self-service BI to quickly find and present answers to
their important, ad hoc business questions. The direct Excel to Oracle
connection provided by the solution also ensures accurate and timely
reporting by always accessing the most current data. The user interface

    Kscope11 SESSION ABSTRACT 

    "Use New BI Features in Excel 2010 with Oracle OLAP" (Abstract ID:
236468), June 27, 2011 from 2:30pm-3:30pm 

    Microsoft has invested heavily in Office features for enabling BI on the
desktop, and many enterprises have embraced Excel for BI. This session
provides an overview of new and popular functionality built into Excel
2010. You'll see how to create a PivotTable with a live connection to
Oracle Database OLAP Option. This session will then demonstrate how to
use Excel to drill down into a dimension, then filter and analyze data
with trend icon sets, conditional formatting, and Excel 2010 slicers and
sparklines. You can even drill 'through' to the underlying relational
data from the fact table, or create insightful PivotCharts hot connected
to Oracle OLAP.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Rates Corporacion Andina de Fomento's JPY Bonds 'A+'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has assigned an 'A+' Long-term debt rating to the 
      JPY10billion bonds due June 30, 2015, under Corporacion Andina de 
      Fomento's (CAF)USD100billion Retail Target Samurai Bond Program.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CAF will use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including 
      but not limited to funding its lending operations. Following the 
      settlement of this offering, the total amount of bonds outstanding under 
      the Retail Target Samurai Bond Program will reach JPY24.4billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CAF's ratings reflect the privileges conferred on it by its member 
      countries, its adequate capital base and its solid track record in terms 
      of asset quality and self-sustainable profitability. The ratings are 
      limited by economic volatility in some of the countries in which the 
      institution operates, the member countries' creditworthiness relative to 
      higher rated multinational development banks (MDBs) and, although 
      decreasing, relevant loan concentrations. CAF has been able to operate 
      without difficulty in successive periods of instability in the region 
      due to a conservative operating policy and the member countries' support.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CAF's shareholders are mostly governments and public agencies. The 
      shareholders have demonstrated strong support with continuous capital 
      contributions to sustain CAF's expansion, while regular privileges and 
      immunities are provided similar to other MDBs. As CAF is one of the few 
      providers of long- and medium-term financing to the region, Fitch 
      considers that its shareholders have a vested interest in supporting it 
      should it be required. However, some doubts remain concerning their 
      ability to provide such support given the mostly sub-investment grade 
      ratings of its shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      CAF is an MDB established in 1968 to assist in the economic development 
      of its member countries. CAF is headquartered in Caracas, Venezuela. It 
      focuses on providing medium- and long-term project loans and trade 
      finance. At YE 2010 CAF was 85% owned by the Andean countries (Bolivia, 
      Colombia, Ecuador, Peru and Venezuela), Brazil, Panama and Uruguay. The 
      remaining stake belongs to a number of non-regional member states and 14 
      private-sector banks.

&lt;p&gt;  LAKE BUENA VISTA, FL, Jun 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
This July, Santa Claus might just earn the nickname "Sandy Claus" as he
ventures to the white sandy beach at the Walt Disney World Swan and
Dolphin Hotel for a summer getaway with Mrs. Claus. Guests will have the
opportunity to meet the couple decked out in their warm-weather attire
and get a taste of Christmas this summer. 

    Santa and Mrs. Claus will make public appearances at the hotel the
evenings of July 16-17 and 23-24. Guests and the public can visit with
the pair and take advantage of a unique opportunity to get a family photo
with the big guy himself, well enough in time for this year's holiday
cards. 

    Last November and December, the Clauses left their humble North Pole
abode for a vacation at the Orlando hotel before Santa's big night. They
enjoyed themselves so much, they decided to return for the summer as well.

    "We had a blast last holiday season relaxing at our Tiki hut and driving
around in our customized golf cart," said Santa. "Mrs. Claus and I can't
wait to return. We're looking forward to swimming, enjoying a steak at
Shula's Steak House and meeting all of the wonderful families at the Walt
Disney World Swan and Dolphin Hotel." 

    Guests who would like to vacation with Santa at the Walt Disney World
Swan and Dolphin Hotel can take advantage of a special summer offer with
rates starting at $139 per night. For details or to book, guests can
visit www.santasfavoriteresort.com or call 1-800-227-1500 and ask for
rate code "SANTA".

    This winter, Santa and Mrs. Claus plan on returning for their pre
Christmas Eve vacation when the hotel will roll out a full array of
holiday activities. They will include a life-sized sculpture of Santa
constructed of 1,200 lbs. of chocolate, an elf bedtime tuck-in service
and personal Christmas tree guest room delivery.

    In the heart of the Walt Disney World Resort, the award-winning Walt
Disney World Swan and Dolphin Hotel is the gateway to Central Florida's
greatest theme parks and attractions. www.swandolphin.com

&lt;p&gt;  OAKLAND, CA, Jun 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Jitterbit, the leading provider of powerful, flexible and easy-to-use
application and data integration solutions, today announced the extension
of its successful "Cast Out The Iron" swap-out incentive program to help
existing IBM Cast Iron customers avoid the big blues by seamlessly
upgrading to Jitterbit.

    As companies transition from an on-premise to a hybrid cloud
infrastructure, reliable integration is the key to recognizing value from
these investments. The "Cast Out The Iron" swap-out program for Cast Iron
customers provides a worry-free migration path to Jitterbit 4.0. In
addition, Jitterbit is offering "Guaranteed TCO Reduction" for Cast Iron
customers making the switch. Previous swap-out customers have reported up
to an 80 percent savings and more than 300 percent return on investment
after moving from Cast Iron to Jitterbit. Enrollees in the program will
also benefit from Jitterbit's straightforward annual subscriptions,
superior reliability, and responsive, hands-on customer support. To take
advantage of this program, current Cast Iron customers can register at
www.jitterbit.com/castout.

    "IBM's acquisition of Cast Iron has left a void for cost-effective
integration solutions in the mid-market. As contracts come up for renewal
many Cast Iron customers are feeling the sting of increased prices," said
George Gallegos, CEO of Jitterbit. "Organizations that have already
upgraded to Jitterbit have reported significantly lower TCO, better
product reliability and outstanding customer support. We welcome every
Cast Iron user to try our 30-day trial and discover why so many customers
have made the switch."

    With Jitterbit, we can offer our clients a more mature and dependable
integration platform than IBM Cast Iron," said Kurt Neubauer, CEO of
JAUST Consulting Partners, "Jitterbit also provides more responsive
support and maintenance at a lower total cost of ownership. We are
excited to offer Cast Iron clients the opportunity to make the switch."

			Coca-Cola Consolidated Pioneering Green Power Hydrogen Fuel Cell 
      Technology in Charlotte Plant
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Forklifts in Coca-Cola Bottling Co. Consolidated&#8217;s (CCBCC) Charlotte 
      production center are now being run on green power hydrogen fuel cells. 
      Further enhancing its environmental sustainability efforts, the company 
      is pioneering hydrogen fuel cell technology for its materials handling 
      equipment.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Beginning in June, the nation&#8217;s largest independent Coca-Cola bottler 
      began using forklift trucks that run on green hydrogen. CCBCC is the 
      first in the beverage industry to use hydrogen fuel cell technology. The 
      fleet of 35 Crown and five Yale counterbalanced class one lift trucks 
      are powered by hydrogen fuel cells from Plug Power and are being 
      refueled at three indoor fueling stations with hydrogen from Linde North 
      America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is another major step in making our production and warehouse 
      operations world-class examples of environmental sustainability,&#8221; said 
      CCBCC VP Lauren Steele. &#8220;The hydrogen fuel cell technology follows major 
      strides in environmental stewardship, including aggressive recycling 
      programs, high-efficiency lighting and one of the best water usage 
      ratios in the world at our Charlotte plant.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The hydrogen fuel cell solution has allowed us to achieve the high 
      level of environmental sustainability that we&#8217;ve been looking for in our 
      operations,&#8221; said Bo Calloway, director of fleet operations at CCBCC. 
      &#8220;Due to the high efficiency of the hydrogen fuel cells and the 
      convenient location of the refueling stations in our plant, we expect to 
      improve both our operating costs and our productivity. This innovative 
      solution may serve as a model for industries seeking to improve 
      productivity and environmental sustainability.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The hydrogen technology requires only a three minute fuel time and 
      allows for six to eight hours of use. Unlike the standard battery 
      powered electric trucks, the fuel cell powered equipment will operate at 
      100 percent power through the entire fill of hydrogen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Charlotte-based Coca-Cola Consolidated is the nation&#8217;s largest 
      independent Coca-Cola bottler with franchise territories in 11 
      Southeastern states. For more information on CCBCC please call

&lt;p&gt;  WALTHAM, MA, Jun 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
MetraTech Corp., the leading provider of agreements-based billing and
compensation solutions, today announced the launch of Metanga, its
multi-tenant software-as-a-service (SaaS)-based billing solution, on
Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) Windows Azure. The launch highlights Metanga's
relationship with Windows Azure and continues MetraTech's longstanding
engagement with Microsoft. The Metanga solution is a key component to
help Microsoft's customers monetize their Windows Azure offerings.
Metanga catalyzes and facilitates the adoption of Windows Azure to broad
new audiences while making Microsoft's cloud platform increasingly
relevant. 

    As a native Windows Azure building block solution, Metanga is immediately
available and provides Microsoft's 78,000 independent software vendor
(ISV) customers with the shortest path to cloud-based enrollment, billing
and customer care. 

    Metanga presented its solution to a worldwide audience at a Microsoft
Academy Live presentation, "Monetizing ISV Applications on Windows Azure"
webinar, on June 3, and will also lead a discussion on "Monetizing the
Cloud" at Microsoft's 2011 World Partner Conference in July.

    The Metanga solution enables the management of customer enrollment,
product catalogs, pricing, promotions, invoicing, customer self-care and
payment capture for industry verticals including cloud,
business-to-business (B2B), consumptive media, telepresence, broadband
and smart grid. It facilitates consumption-based billing for online
applications that require more than simplistic recurring credit card
billing. 

    Metanga is unique among SaaS billing offerings in its ability to draw
upon MetraTech's many years of experience developing and operating
billing systems for world leaders in service innovation. Metanga's
service reflects a deep understanding of the challenges inherent in
billing operations and workflow. The Metanga service has been designed to:


--  Guide Users by interactively leading customers through best practices
    and billing processes
--  Offer Scale by supporting additional requirements as ISVs change
    business models and diversify
--  Define Usability by an inductive vs. deductive user experience
--  Deliver Support via integrated video and text based contextual help
--  Provide Security &amp; Compliance using PCI Level I compliance and SAS
    70 Type II certification

    

The end result is an intuitive operational experience coupled with a
complete, end-to-end billing solution that empowers faster, easier and
more effective service monetization.

    According to Prashant Ketkar, director, product marketing for Windows
Azure, "The Windows Azure platform offers significant opportunities for
ISVs to gain first-mover advantage in new markets. Microsoft is working
closely with technology partners -- such as Metanga in the area of
billing -- to ensure that our ISV customers can effectively monetize
their Windows Azure offerings."

    "Billing management is one of the automation functions for the cloud that
our ISV partners request most often, and we are pleased to be working
with Metanga as a native billing solution on Windows and SQL Azure," said
Jeff Lear, director, national ISV sales at Microsoft.

    "We are excited to be working with Microsoft to enable ISVs to build
native Azure cloud applications," said Mark Dudman, general manager of
Metanga. "Throughout our deployment collaboration on Azure, Microsoft's
support of Metanga has been outstanding. In our position as a
foundational Azure building block, we look forward to working with the
Microsoft field sales team in accelerating Windows Azure platform
adoption." 

    The Metanga solution will be showcased at Microsoft's 2011 Worldwide
Partner Conference (WPC), July 10-14, in Los Angeles. The WPC is the
premier event for Microsoft partners worldwide. It provides a forum for
connecting with other partners and with Microsoft, and to learn about the
latest Microsoft programs, strategies and cutting-edge technologies.

			Procter  Gamble Veteran Bernhard Glock Joins Modiv Media Board of 
      Directors
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Senior Partner at MediaLink and Former PG Executive Brings Over 25 
      Years Experience to Mobile Shopping Technology Company
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Modiv 
      Media, the leading mobile shopper marketing company, today announced 
      the addition of Bernhard Glock to its board 
      of directors. Mr. Glock recently joined MediaLink 
      as a senior partner, was the former president of the World 
      Federation of Advertisers and served as former vice president of 
      global media and communications and vice president of global media 
      purchases at Procter 
       Gamble (PG). As a member of the Board, Mr. Glock will play a 
      pivotal role as the company pushes forward with its recently launched Modiv 
      Mobile application, an in-store mobile shopping solution that 
      provides a valuable, personalized experience for consumers in the store, 
      at home or on the go.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Bernhard brings unparalleled retail and media expertise to the Modiv 
      Media board of directors,&#8221; said Paul 
      Schaut, Modiv Media chairman and CEO. &#8220;He is an active proponent of 
      leveraging innovative technologies to improve shopper marketing for the 
      benefit of manufacturers, retailers and consumers, and his insights into 
      how we can use our technology to maximize marketing capabilities and 
      deliver a personalized shopping experience will be invaluable.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While at PG, Mr. Glock established numerous best practices that 
      directly changed how the consumer packaged goods industry conducted 
      marketing communications. He was a champion of &#8216;moment of truth&#8217; 
      marketing activities to influence customer purchases in the aisles, a 
      practice that is integral to the Modiv 
      Shopper and Modiv 
      Mobile solutions. Following his retirement from PG in 2009, Mr. 
      Glock founded the Bernhard 
      Glock Media Leadership Company LLC in 2009 before joining MediaLink 
      in February 2011. His role at MediaLink encompasses running the media 
      practice and providing clients with strategic council to bring them 
      business success via the intersection of media and technology.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;From my perspective, mobile is an underutilized strategy and I&#8217;m 
      joining the board at an exciting time as retailers finally start to 
      realize the full potential of mobile commerce,&#8221; added Mr. Glock. 
      &#8220;Retailers and manufacturers alike must be much more proactive about 
      mobile commerce and provide a valuable, personalized experience in order 
      to increase incremental sales and customer loyalty. I know how 
      advertisers think and spend money, as well as how retailers test and 
      pilot technology, and will bring that expertise to bear on the board. I 
      firmly believe the in-store mobile marketing platforms Modiv Media 
      offers will shape the future of marketing in the retail industry, and I 
      am looking forward to working with such a forward-thinking company.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SUNNYVALE, CA, Jun 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR) today announced a multi-million dollar
contract from Hess Corporation, a leading global energy company. Together
with IBM, Juniper Networks will deliver, energy-efficient networking
services to Hess enabling a simplified, automated and secure environment. 

    After outgrowing its current Houston office space, Hess erected a new
office tower in Houston and, at the same time was looking to upgrade its
worldwide network to prepare for future needs and space restrictions.
Hess requested an energy-efficient solution that could help simplify and
power its operations, while keeping pace with business requirements and
continuing to function with operational excellence to deliver quality
solutions and outstanding customer service. 

    Juniper Networks and IBM teamed to offer Hess a customized, secure and
energy-efficient solution. Hess will incorporate IBM's implementation and
staging services coupled with Juniper's integrated switching and security
solutions. The Hess offering from IBM and Juniper Networks includes:


--  IBM Implementation Services: Skilled technical specialists and
    experienced project management resources help reduce the risk of
    business disruption and accelerate return on investment (ROI) with IBM

&lt;p&gt;Last week's launch of the IBM Intelligent Operations Center for Smarter Cities marks a significant development in the market for smart city solutions. This is arguably the first major product to be aimed specifically at the integration of multiple service areas of a city from an operational perspective.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has drawn on its experience of over 2,000 engagements with cities around the world to develop an integrated platform based on IBM software for data management, analytics, and event management amongst other components. IBM is also developing 25 'uses cases' for some of the most important and difficult issues facing city authorities. These uses cases will be built into a series of pre-packaged software offerings. The focus is on critical, city-wide issues that can be better addressed through the integration and analysis of data from multiple domains. The first packages will be for public safety, transport and traffic management, and water management. These offerings communicate with the Intelligent Operations Center as the underlying platform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's work with the city authority in Rio de Janeiro is a good example of the type of solution that the Intelligent Operations Center will support. The Rio de Janeiro Operations Center provides a citywide monitoring and response management system and was initially instigated to help the city improve its response to emergencies, such as the floods and mudslides that hit part of the city in 2010. It incorporates an advanced meteorological warning system and also helps orchestrate the logistics of emergency response in the case of floods, including ambulance scheduling and medical supply coordination. In the long term, the Rio Operations Center will expand beyond flood management into other city services such as transportation, public works, and utilities. IBM has taken its experience from projects like that in Rio de Janeiro and embedded it in the analytical capabilities and rules engine built into the Intelligent Operations Center. The platform is, however, customizable to address any operational management issues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is offering the Intelligent Operations Center as an in-house deployment, a shared service (for multiple authorities or for cross-agency applications) and as a cloud service (particularly for smaller authorities). Shared services and cloud-based applications will be the natural route for many public sector organizations in the future, particularly for dynamic, cross-domain application areas such as those the Intelligent Operations Center is addressing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To get the best out of applications like IBM's Intelligent Operations Center, a city will need to have clear project goals, a good business case, and buy-in at the executive level and across agencies. This is particularly important if cities are to see the benefits from the data analytics at the heart of the IBM proposition. Despite the investment in e-government systems over the last decade, government generally has lagged the private sector in the use of business intelligence and analytics. However, cities need to be able to capture, manage, and analyze the new information flows made possible by smart energy, transport, and building systems, along with other innovations in communications and embedded intelligence. As we increase the number of smart devices in the city, more benefits will accrue from the integration of these data feeds. A clear need exists for a framework that can guide the deployments of more and more sophisticated tools for monitoring, managing, and reporting on the urban environment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In my view, any adequate model for the smart city must be multi-dimensional, encompassing different aspects of "smartness" and stressing the importance of integration and interaction across multiple domains. A city is a system of systems, and any models that attempt to define its dynamic nature must be able to represent the diversity of those elements. IBM is taking this approach with the Intelligent Operations Center for Smarter Cities. However, city authorities will need to be sure they can quickly and cheaply integrate new data sources into their operation center. IBM has adopted the CAP (Common Alert Protocol) standard for public warnings and has a general commitment to open standards but city managers will need to be sure they have the skills and the budget to make the on-going adjustments to the system to meet their evolving needs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Woods is a senior analyst at Pike Research.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pfizer&#8217;s Lyrica Top-Line Results Positive In Global Phase 3 Study Of 
      Central Neuropathic Pain Following Spinal Cord Injury
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) announced today that top-line results for Lyrica 
      Study A0081107 &#8211; Central Neuropathic Pain Following Spinal Cord Injury &#8211; 
      demonstrated that the study met its primary endpoint: positive efficacy 
      in reducing Central Neuropathic Pain following Spinal Cord Injury with 
      Lyrica (pregabalin) compared to placebo. Further analysis will be 
      conducted on these initial results.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Central Neuropathic Pain is a heterogeneous group of pain conditions 
      initiated or caused by a primary lesion in the central nervous system 
      and occurs often following spinal cord injury.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are pleased with the top-line results of this study and look forward 
      to more fully understanding the benefit that Lyrica may bring to these 
      patients,&#8221; said Steven J. Romano, M.D., senior vice president, Head, 
      Medicines Development Group, Global Primary Care Business Unit, Pfizer, 
      Inc.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Study A0081107 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
      parallel group, multi-center study comparing pregabalin flexibly dosed 
      (150-600mg/day, dosed twice-daily) and placebo in subjects with chronic 
      Central Neuropathic Pain following traumatic spinal cord injury. A total 
      of 220 subjects were enrolled in the study (112 pregabalin and 108 
      placebo) in 66 investigative sites in 10 countries. The primary endpoint 
      was the duration adjusted average change (DAAC), which is a weighted 
      average of change in pain scores based on the duration a subject 
      participated in the study. The preliminary results of the study indicate 
      that the most common adverse events in Lyrica-treated patients were 
      somnolence, dizziness, edema, fatigue, dry mouth, insomnia and blurred 
      vision.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			About Lyrica
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Lyrica&#174; is currently approved in 110 countries and regions 
      globally. In the United States, Lyrica (pregabalin) capsules CV is 
      approved to treat Diabetic Nerve Pain, Pain after Shingles, Fibromyalgia 
      and partial onset seizures in adults with epilepsy who take one or more 
      drugs for seizures. Lyrica is not approved to treat Central Neuropathic 
      Pain in the U.S. Treatment with Lyrica may cause dizziness, somnolence, 
      peripheral edema or blurred vision. Other most common adverse reactions 
      include dry mouth, weight gain, constipation, euphoric mood, balance 
      disorder, increased appetite and thinking abnormally. There have been 
      post-marketing reports of angioedema and hypersensitivity. Like other 
      anti-epileptic drugs, Lyrica may cause suicidal thoughts or actions in a 
      very small number of people.

&lt;p&gt;  POWAY, CA, Jun 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
BridgeSTOR, LLC, redefining the cost per terabyte equation through
advanced data reduction appliances, today released an analysis describing
the financial impact of adding data deduplication, compression and thin
provisioning to Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager (DPM
2010). BridgeSTOR Application Optimized Storage (AOS) appliances for DPM
enable storage managers to simply and affordably implement advanced data
reduction technology in their DPM data protection deployments.

    Available now from the BridgeSTOR website, the analysis titled "The
Economic Impact of Data Deduplication, Compression and Thin Provisioning
on Microsoft System Center Data Protection Manager 2010 (DPM 2010)"
provides detailed information about the capital and operating expense
savings that are now achievable by reducing DPM storage capacity
requirements using the same technology that transformed backup data
storage and retention. 

    The full URL for the free download is:
http://www.bridgestor.com/microsoft-dpm-economic-impact

    "Microsoft's DPM 2010 is a highly effective tool for protecting data on
Windows servers, workstations and laptops. Just as VMware and Hyper-V are
helping businesses replace racks of physical servers with a handful of
virtual servers, BridgeSTOR replaces racks of disk drives with 2U
appliances, each holding up to 80TB," said John Matze, BridgeSTOR founder
and CEO. "Microsoft recommends that DPM users install from 2 1/2 to 3
times the capacity of the protected data for their DPM storage. It is not
a surprise that data reduction for DPM 2010 produces cost savings
immediately, at the time of capacity acquisition, with on-going savings
in power, cooling, rack space, management time and annual maintenance
charges producing savings year after year. This analysis explains exactly
how those savings are achieved." 

    By combining data deduplication, compression and thin provisioning to
reduce DPM 2010 storage requirements, BridgeSTOR's AOS for DPM saves disk
capacity, reduces storage management time and complexity, minimizes power
consumption, cooling, annual hardware maintenance fees and floor and rack
space requirements. Depending on the data, deduplication reduces file and
application data by 10 to 80 percent. Compression works on the
deduplicated data, as well as on blocks that do not deduplicate,
shrinking the amount of capacity DPM 2010 stores by as much as an
additional 50 percent.

    BridgeSTOR VS-ADR appliances are available through select channel
partners. Please see www.bridgestor.com to locate a partner or for more
information.

&lt;p&gt;MUMBAI, June 21 (Reuters) - Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs
 has hired Keshav Sanghi from rival Citigroup as
managing director and head of equities in India, according to an
internal memo obtained by Reuters on Tuesday.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs has been building up its equities business in
the fiercely competitive Indian market, and recently hired P.V.
Krishna from rival Morgan Stanley to be managing director
and head of capital markets in India, IFR reported last month.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sanghi was previously head of Indian equities at Citigroup,
and before that was chief executive officer of Reliance Equities
International. He also headed Indian equities at Deutsche Bank
(DBKGn.DE) for five years, the memo said.

&lt;p&gt; * Shows superior efficacy to warfarin in Phase III study&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Bristol-Myers shares up 7.3 pct, Pfizer up 3.9 pct
 (Adds analysts' comment, background, updates share prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 22 (Reuters) - A blood thinner developed by
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co(BMY.N) and Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) proved
superior to and safer than warfarin in preventing strokes in
patients with dangerously irregular heart rhythms in a key
clinical trial, greatly boosting its sales potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of both companies rose on the highly anticipated
data from the late-stage study of apixaban, a pill the
drugmakers hope to sell under the brand name Eliquis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apixaban needed to show only non-inferiority to warfarin in
stroke prevention to meet the primary goal of the Phase III
trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Instead, it showed superior efficacy to warfarin in
patients with atrial fibrillation, according to initial data
from the study released on Wednesday by the companies. This
should help the drug compete with a pair of new rival oral
treatments in the highly lucrative market for millions of
patients with the heart disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "At first blush, it's a home run for apixaban. It looks
better than the other two drugs," said Barclays Capital analyst
Tony Butler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apixaban will compete with Pradaxa, an already approved
drug from Boehringer Ingelheim, and Xarelto, a drug developed
by Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson  Johnson (JNJ.N) that is
awaiting U.S. approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bristol-Myers drug also showed superiority on a key
safety measure by causing fewer incidents of major bleeding
than warfarin. But the companies did not reveal important
overall bleeding data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I was optimistic on superior bleeding, which they got. To
add to that superior efficacy is stunning," said Trevor
Polischuk, a partner at New York investment firm OrbiMed
Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This sets this drug up to be market leader, in what has
been a massive race to get the best drug to market," Polischuk
added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Each of the new medicines had been deemed to have annual
sales potential of more than $2 billion, analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Potential sales of apixaban have at least doubled. My new
number is $5 billion a year," Polischuk said, adding that
details of the study were needed to understand its full
potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Full details of the study will be presented on Aug. 28 at a
major medical meeting in Europe. The companies said they expect
to submit applications seeking U.S. and European approval in
the third or fourth quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bristol-Myers shares rose 7.3 percent to $29.78 in extended
trading from their New York Stock Exchange close at $27.74,
while Pfizer shares rose 3.9 percent to $21.06 from a close at
$20.28 on the NYSE.

But the companies did not reveal important overall bleeding data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full details of the study will be presented on August 28 at a major medical meeting in Europe. The companies expect to submit applications seeking U.S. and European approval in the third or fourth quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers shares rose 5 percent in extended trading, while Pfizer shares rose 2.3 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan rolls out prime broker services in Europe&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Plans to bring in as many as 15 clients this year&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Has an eye on Asia as well&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Svea Herbst-Bayliss&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BOSTON, June 22 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
took a big step in expanding its footprint in the global prime
brokerage business on Wednesday by launching complete prime
services for European hedge funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the financial crisis three years ago when hedge funds
began reevaluating relationships with prime brokers, JPMorgan
Chase has worked hard to build its business in this lucrative
but crowded field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thanks to its brand and ability to lend money and stocks to
large hedge funds, JPMorgan is now generally ranked in industry
league tables as one of the biggest prime brokers, along with
long-time leaders Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But industry analysts say the company still has a way to go
before it is truly global in an industry that generated roughly
$10 billion in revenue in 2010 and is poised to grow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first quarter of 2011 alone, some 254 new hedge
funds opened for business at a time when pension funds and
endowments are sending billions in new money into these funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Europe, JPMorgan hopes to add between 10 and 15 new
clients this year, Lou Lebedin, co-head of the bank's prime
brokerage business said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are bringing clients on in a disciplined pace," he
said, noting the bank already deals with managers who oversee
about 70 percent of the hedge fund industry's $2 trillion in
assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But even as the industry grows, the field of prime brokers
is becoming more crowded with new players all promising a host
of services from clearing trades, to delivering industry
research, to making introductions to wealthy investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is increasingly hard for one top prime broker to
differentiate itself from the others because most offer a full
range of services and most operate across asset classes," said
John Feng, managing director at research firm Greenwich
Associates. "In a way, the difference is going to be in the
degree of excellence."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For JPMorgan, which entered the business in earnest after
it bought Bear Stearns' U.S. prime brokerage operation in 2008,
one often cited weakness has been Asia, where it has
historically not had a big presence, industry analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While JPMorgan does not break out its numbers, industry
magazine AR has calculated it services $93.3 billion in assets,
a 10 percent increase from the previous year, which makes it
the prime broker with the most hedge fund assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, with nearly three quarters of its prime broking
business in the United States, JPMorgan has made no secret
about plans to expand its business in Europe and Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Up until this point we've been primarily focused on
building out a leading platform in Europe," Lebedin said. "As
we continue to build out globally, we're now focusing on
providing a more robust prime brokerage offering to clients in
Asia."

      Fitch Upgrades JPMorgan 2006-FL2; Outlooks Revised to Positive
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has upgraded three and affirmed nine classes from J.P. 
      Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage Securities Corp., Series 2006-FL2, 
      reflecting Fitch's base case loss expectation of 1.5% for the pooled 
      classes. Fitch's performance expectation incorporates prospective views 
      regarding commercial real estate market value and cash flow declines. 
      The revision to a Positive Rating Outlook from Stable reflects some 
      positive performance; assuming performance continues to stabilize or 
      improve, upgrades are likely. A detailed list of rating actions follows 
      at the end of this release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under Fitch's methodology, approximately 45% of the pool is expected to 
      default in the base case stress scenario, defined as the 'B' stress. In 
      this scenario, the average cash flow decline is 12.3% from generally 
      year-end 2010 cash flows. In its review, Fitch analyzed servicer 
      reported operating statements and rent rolls, updated property 
      valuations, and recent lease and sales comparisons. Given that the loan 
      positions within the pooled portion of the commercial mortgage backed 
      securities (CMBS) are the lower leveraged A-notes, Fitch estimates the 
      average recoveries on the pooled loans will be approximately 96.8% in 
      the base case. The defaults are determined considering the total 
      leverage of each asset, including additional B-notes and mezzanine debt. 
      However, a default may not result in a loss to the pooled portion given 
      its lower leverage position.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction is collateralized by eight loans, five of which are 
      secured by office properties (70.2%) and three secured by hotels 
      (29.8%). The transaction faces near-term maturity risk with all of the 
      final extension options on the loans within the next three years, as 
      follows: 10.9% matured, 58% in 2011, 3.4% in 2012, and 27.7% in 2013.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Currently, three loans are specially serviced: Marina Village (19.1%), 
      The Menlo Oaks Corporate Center (10.9%), and Hilton Los Cabos Beach  
      Golf Resort (8.6%). Marina Village and Hilton Los Cabos were modified to 
      include new final maturities in 2013 and new terms which generally 
      include a minor principal curtailment, cash flow sweep, and 
      establishment of reserves. Fitch's analysis resulted in loss 
      expectations for one of the three specially serviced loans and one loan 
      in the 'B' stress scenario. The contributors to loss are the Marina 
      Village loan and the RREEF Silicon Valley Office Portfolio loan. Hilton 
      Los Cabos and Menlo Oaks, the other specially serviced loans, were not 
      modeled with losses to the trust in the base case.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Marina Village loan is collateralized by 34 office buildings 
      totaling 1.1 million square feet (sf) on 73 acres, and located in a 
      205-acre master-planned development located in Alameda, CA, within the 
      San Francisco Bay Area. The property consists of low-rise and mid-rise 
      office buildings (collateral), a shopping center, a hotel, 178-unit 
      residential town-home community, and open space along the waterfront 
      (with a 990-berth marina). As of December 2010, the occupancy at the 
      property was 68.1%, a significant drop since issuance when occupancy was 
      79.6%. Average rental rate at the property was approximately $20.38 per 
      square foot (psf), compared to $24.22 psf at issuance. Fitch modeled 
      losses of approximately 4% in the base case reflecting a decline in 
      value since issuance and continued rollover risk over the next several 
      years.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The RREEF Silicon Valley Office Portfolio loan is collateralized by 18 
      office properties, totaling 5.3 million sf, located in Silicon Valley in 
      Northern California. Approximately 40% of the square footage is located 
      in San Jose/Milpitas; 31% in Santa Clara; 18% in Sunnyvale; and 11% in 
      Mountain View. The modeled loss for this loan is approximately 3% in the 
      base case.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Menlo Oaks Corporate Center loan is secured by a class 'B' office 
      park totaling 374,139 sf located in Silicon Valley in the city of Menlo 
      Park, CA. The sponsor recently signed a new lease for 29% at the 
      property bringing the occupancy to 75%. As a result, no losses are 
      modeled to the trust portion of the A-note. The special servicer is 
      currently negotiating a forbearance agreement.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction follows a prorata pay structure which may revert to 
      sequential pay under two conditions: a) specially serviced assets in the 
      deal account for more than 20% of the outstanding deal balance, or b) 
      80% of the original pool balance has been paid down. In addition, any 
      principal distribution received from a loan in special servicing will be 
      applied sequentially. Also, the transaction is structured so principal 
      disbursements and interest from the underlying mortgages are combined 
      into one account which then is used for principal and interest 
      distributions to the bonds. The pro rata nature of the transaction 
      combined with the commingling of principal and interest remittances have 
      resulted in interest shortfalls, stemming from servicing fees, to result 
      in a principal loss to the junior-most class L. The principal loss may 
      be recoverable in future periods, similarly to an interest shortfall, if 
      excess interest becomes available.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This transaction was analyzed according to the 'Surveillance Criteria 
      for U.S. CREL CDOs and CMBS Large Loan Floating-Rate Transactions' (Dec. 
      2, 2010). It applies stresses to property cash flows and uses debt 
      service coverage ratio (DSCR) tests to project future default levels for 
      the underlying portfolio. Recoveries are based on stressed cash flows 
      and Fitch's long-term capitalization rates.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Severity (LS) ratings, and Recovery Ratings (RR), as indicated:

      Research and Markets: Wal-Mart Stores - SWOT Analysis of the Largest 
      Company in the United States - Beating it's Closest Rival Exxon Mobil
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/fabd26/walmart_stores) 
      has announced the addition of the "Wal-Mart 
      Stores - SWOT Analysis" company profile to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Wal-Mart Stores Inc is the largest company in the United States. For the 
      last two years, the company has been topping the Fortune 500, beating 
      its closest rival Exxon Mobil.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      However, in spite of topping the Fortune 500 list, the company has been 
      battling a drop in sales at its US stores for the last seven quarters 
      and in spite of profits and increase in revenues at its global 
      operations, Wal-Mart Stores has been struggling in the US.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This multinational corporation operates in 15 countries under 55 
      different brand names and has over 8,000 stores worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Taiyou Research analyzes Wal-Mart Stores in a SWOT analysis, analyzing 
      the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that the company 
      faces. With the group emerging from a rebranding in the recent years, 
      the brand has emerged with a strong identity and is a market leader in 
      its segments.

&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Wall Street investors are a bit more pessimistic than they should be despite a host of negative factors such as a weak U.S. economy and high energy costs, Goldman Sachs strategist Abby Joseph Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. stock market right now is priced about 15 percent below where it should be," Cohen told Reuters on the sidelines of the President's Conference in Jerusalem on Wednesday. "Our feeling is the likely scenario is better than what investors are expecting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman projects the SP 500 index .SPX will reach 1,450 by year end and 1,500 in the next 12 months, from 1,295.52 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors, she said, were rightly concerned about the economy, the European debt crisis, supply chain disruptions from the Japan earthquake, U.S. tornadoes, and higher energy prices, which act as a tax on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market is not pricing in the happiest of scenarios," Cohen said. "Investors are climbing the proverbial wall of worry. But it is good for investors to be nervous. When investors are no longer nervous about anything that's when you have to be worried."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such nervousness has led to good buying opportunities in the market -- mainly in areas where the United States offers value added products such as technology and biotech, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Highly cyclical areas look interesting right now," Cohen said. "We have great strength in investment in business equipment -- technology, telecommunications, computer software and applications and also aircraft and avionics. U.S. companies are generating very good revenues in these categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen, believes the U.S. economy will not head back into recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That doesn't mean the economy isn't slowing. Of course it is slowing," said Cohen, noting economic growth has eased to 2 to 2.5 percent due to higher energy costs, supply disruptions from Japan and the end to government stimulus spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longer term outlook is for U.S. growth of 3 percent, which Cohen said was faster than Europe and Japan. The United States, she noted, was structurally in good shape in part due to a productive workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy could grow faster if not for weakness in Europe, the United States' largest trading partner after Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason the U.S. will avoid a double-dip recession is the rebound in the banking sector, Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Banks are beginning to lend again," she said. "Small and mid-size businesses were having a hard time borrowing money but over the last three to six months that's gotten much easier. It's these small and mid-size companies that are responsible for much of the job creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen said one change to the U.S. economy will be the end to a 30-year stretch of disinflation. "The big trend in prices is flat to up," she said, noting that in the short run headline inflation will move lower because energy prices have fallen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, energy prices should rise again, with oil hitting $100 a barrel "and moving higher from there," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the time being, U.S. bond yields and the shape of the yield curve should not move much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will take quite a while before rates rise notably," Cohen said.

&lt;p&gt;JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Wall Street investors are a bit more pessimistic than they should be despite a host of negative factors such as a weak U.S. economy and high energy costs, Goldman Sachs strategist Abby Joseph Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"The U.S. stock market right now is priced about 15 percent below where it should be," Cohen told Reuters on the sidelines of the President's Conference in Jerusalem on Wednesday. "Our feeling is the likely scenario is better than what investors are expecting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman projects the SP 500 index .SPX will reach 1,450 by year end and 1,500 in the next 12 months, from 1,295.52 on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investors, she said, were rightly concerned about the economy, the European debt crisis, supply chain disruptions from the Japan earthquake, U.S. tornadoes, and higher energy prices, which act as a tax on the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The market is not pricing in the happiest of scenarios," Cohen said. "Investors are climbing the proverbial wall of worry. But it is good for investors to be nervous. When investors are no longer nervous about anything that's when you have to be worried."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Such nervousness has led to good buying opportunities in the market -- mainly in areas where the United States offers value added products such as technology and biotech, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Highly cyclical areas look interesting right now," Cohen said. "We have great strength in investment in business equipment -- technology, telecommunications, computer software and applications and also aircraft and avionics. U.S. companies are generating very good revenues in these categories.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen, believes the U.S. economy will not head back into recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That doesn't mean the economy isn't slowing. Of course it is slowing," said Cohen, noting economic growth has eased to 2 to 2.5 percent due to higher energy costs, supply disruptions from Japan and the end to government stimulus spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The longer term outlook is for U.S. growth of 3 percent, which Cohen said was faster than Europe and Japan. The United States, she noted, was structurally in good shape in part due to a productive workforce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The economy could grow faster if not for weakness in Europe, the United States' largest trading partner after Canada and Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason the U.S. will avoid a double-dip recession is the rebound in the banking sector, Cohen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Banks are beginning to lend again," she said. "Small and mid-size businesses were having a hard time borrowing money but over the last three to six months that's gotten much easier. It's these small and mid-size companies that are responsible for much of the job creation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohen said one change to the U.S. economy will be the end to a 30-year stretch of disinflation. "The big trend in prices is flat to up," she said, noting that in the short run headline inflation will move lower because energy prices have fallen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2012, energy prices should rise again, with oil hitting $100 a barrel "and moving higher from there," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For the time being, U.S. bond yields and the shape of the yield curve should not move much.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It will take quite a while before rates rise notably," Cohen said. "The Federal Reserve is not in any hurry to raise rates, there is spare capacity in the U.S. economy and unemployment rate is too high."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  BAY HARBOR, FL, Jun 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SmartMetric, Inc. (OTCBB: SMME) President &amp; CEO C. Hendrick announced
today that the company will pursue its infringers of its Patent based on
the recent court ruling on definitions handed down one month ago in the
United States District Court.

    Wells Fargo Bank, J P Morgan Chase Bank, US Bank and Silicon Valley Bank
have all announced within the past months the issuance of EMV standard
"contact" chip Banking Cards.

    SmartMetric, Inc. alleges some of the largest Banks along with Visa are
directly infringing the SmartMetric Patent that is already subject to
Patent Infringement litigation against Visa and MasterCard.

    Last month a ruling was handed down by U.S. District Judge Jacqueline H.
Nguyen siding with SmartMetric, Inc. on the most important definitions in
its Patent. One definition out of the seven that were in dispute between
the defendants, Visa and MasterCard and SmartMetric, was dealing with the
use of contactless chip cards. 

    SmartMetric has decided to appeal this one definition interpretation in
order for it to move forward with its claims of infringement regarding
contactless chip cards. However the President and CEO of SmartMetric, C.
Hendrick, says the rulings of the court on the other disputed definitions
leave no doubt that the newly issued "contact" chip cards by some of the
biggest Banks in the United States clearly fall within the definitions of
its Patent and the company will pursue all infringements by all parties
including Visa and MasterCard.

    American Banks have to adopt the "contact" EMV chip cards since many of
the retail credit card machines and ATM machines in most parts of the
World no longer accept magnetic strip Credit Cards. This has been
admitted by Wells Fargo and Chase as the reason it is now being forced to
issue EMV contact chip cards to its customers in the United State.
SmartMetric will enforce its rights and will demand either a license fee
or seek relief from the courts to stop these Banks and the major card
labels, Visa &amp; MasterCard from issuing these cards.

    The courts recent ruling last month on key definitions in the SmartMetric
Patent re-enforces what SmartMetric has said all along. The company has a
valid Patent and it is being infringed. The company will force its rights
in the courts against even the most powerful of infringers. The company
President , C. Hendrick said, after all, this is the great thing
about America. It has a court system that protects the small inventor or
technology company against arrogance and hubris of large corporations who
ignore the ownership rights of smaller persons or corporations. Hendrick
further said the Courts have a duty and they regularly fulfill this duty
of protecting the rights of the small against the abuse by the powerful. 

    About the SmartMetric:

    The SmartMetric, Biometric Card Computer provides powerful computing with
large memory capacity in a revolutionary size that has taken more than 10
years of research and development. Using the latest in sub micro
technology electronics, the company has achieved a level of
miniaturization that allows it to release a solution of portable
computing power that combined with SmartMetric's biometric fingerprint
in-card scanning technology, is so revolutionary it will change the way
business is done and information is handled across a broad range of
industries. For further information please go to the company website:

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Jun 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
InVisage Inc., a Silicon Valley-based startup revolutionizing the image
sensor market, today announced that its technology -- QuantumFilm(TM) --
has received the International Imaging Industry Association's (I3A)
VISION 2020 Imaging Innovation's top gold award. QuantumFilm is the
world's first quantum dot-based material for image sensors and enables
four times the amount of light to be captured. This allows camera phones
and other small form factors to take photographs of unprecedented quality.

    This award is particularly important because the VISION 2020 judges are
the world's top imaging experts who have an intimate understanding of the
technology and the market. The announcement was made during the 6Sight
Mobile Imaging Summit event taking place in San Jose this week.

    "We are thrilled and proud to be recognized by our peers in the industry
with the gold award from the I3A," said Jess Lee, CEO of InVisage. "Our
amazing team of innovators at InVisage have been working hard to create
QuantumFilm and we are very pleased to be acknowledged for our efforts." 

    "The QuantumFilm technology is clearly a technological advance that will
have significant impact on the industry for many years to come," said I3A
President Lisa Walker. "I3A is pleased to recognize and reward InVisage
Technologies' unique approach to the issues of capturing light in small
mobile devices."

    The VISION 2020 entries were evaluated by an independent panel of judges,
made up of industry experts, venture capitalists, entrepreneurs and
analysts. The judges ranked each entry according to the submission's
relevance to the imaging industry, its potential market impact (does it
solve a significant market problem?), the method of impact (how does it
bring change to the market?), its uniqueness and its implementation
status (how real is it? are there patents, beta programs or proof of
concept?). 

    InVisage developed QuantumFilm for the digital world. Today's digital
image sensors are made with silicon, an inherently inefficient medium for
light capture. QuantumFilm transcends silicon's limitations with a spin
coating of quantum-dot material on top of the silicon wafer, while
employing the silicon to do what it does best -- read out data. Just
nanometers in size, the quantum dot material enables unprecedented light
capture, and can be made using a standard CMOS manufacturing process. As
a result, InVisage is able to offer an image sensor with 4X better
performance than anything available on the market, at a market standard
price. 

    I3A (the International Imaging Industry Association; http://www.i3a.org)
is the leading global association for the imaging industry. The VISION
2020 Imaging Innovation Awards program seeks to energize, recognize and
celebrate innovators whose ideas will drive the industry toward a vision
of the future of intelligent imaging. Details about the VISION 2020
Initiative and Awards can be found at

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - A sizable bearish options play on Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) transacted on Tuesday suggests the energy company's stock could drop 10 percent ahead of August expiration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Exxon Mobil, the world's largest publicly traded oil company, ended 1.07 percent higher to $80.57. The stock is down 8 percent from this year's closing high of $88 on April 29, but is up more than 10 percent year-to-date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early option trades included an August $72.50-$77.50 put ratio spread that is apparently looking for shares to head lower once again, said OptionMonster analyst Chris McKhann.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This could be a protective position against a long equity holding or a play on the price of crude oil," said Patrick Mortimer, director of options trading at stock and options block execution firm Pipeline Trading Systems in New Hope, Pennsylvania.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"With Exxon's shares mirroring the fluctuation in crude oil prices, this trade could be a play on an increase in supply over the summer months with some political stability coming to oil producing counties," Mortimer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Option analysts and traders said the strategist purchased 7,500 August $77.5 XOM strike puts for a premium of $1.79 each and simultaneously sold 15,000 lower August $72.50 XOM strike puts at 78 cents apiece. The net cost of the ratio spread was 23 cents per contract for the position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investor may be taking an outright bearish stance on the stock or could be hedging a long stock position ahead of Exxon Mobil's July 28 second-quarter earnings report, said Interactive Brokers Group options strategist Caitlin Duffy in a note on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The number of existing positions held by investors at both strikes was less than 200 contracts, so it was a new opening spread, OptionMonster's McKhann said on the firm's website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spread cost 23 cents. The trade would yield a maximum profit of $4.77 per contract if Exxon shares fall to $72.50 at August 19 expiration, which represents a 10 percent decline over the next 59 days.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The risk is that the trader may be required to buy a net quantity of 750,000 shares of Exxon stock if the August $72.5 puts land in the money. Losses would start to build if shares fall below the lower break-even point of $67.73, Duffy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A bearish ratio put spread is when an investor buys a near-the-money put and sells two out-of-the-money put options. The premium received for the two puts dramatically offsets the cost of the single put but it exposes the trader to full stock risk below the break-even point.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other signs of investor pessimism on Exxon cropped up in the August $85 strike call where it appears some 2,600 contracts were sold for an average premium of 70 cents apiece, Duffy said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Doris Frankel; Editing by Leslie Adler)&lt;/p&gt;

      distributed to the local Feeding America food banks in Pinellas and 
      Hillsborough Counties. Charlotte International launched its donation 
      program in March 2011 and in three months has contributed more than 
      15,000 pounds of food to Second Harvest Food of Metrolina. At HMSHost&#8217;s 
      three travel plazas&#8212;Maryland House, Chesapeake House, and Delaware 
      Welcome Center&#8212;an ongoing fundraising campaign of providing canisters to

      Think you are a pretty harsh book critic? Try setting a sub-par eBook in 
      front of a three year old and see how long it holds their attention! 
      Microsoft knows it &#8211; and instead of allowing any old scanned pdf version 
      of books for kids into the Window 
      Phone 7 Marketplace has starting hand picking some of the best 
      content available and porting them over to their mobile platform. With 
      that in mind, they have reached out to leading children&#8217;s eBook 
      publisher Touchybooks 
      to bring over 300 interactive childrens titles over by the end of June. 
      The first 150 have already appeared in the store, with twenty more 
      appearing each day to fit the tight schedule.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      We are all aware that digital books are on a gargantuan rise. Amazon has 
      declared that their digital books are outselling their print books only 
      four years after the format launch. This may or may not be a shock to 
      the established publishing industry but it is no surprise to many in the 
      world of technology. eBooks are a multimillion dollar business, a fact 
      not lost to the team at Microsoft looking to increase the children&#8217;s 
      book app content on their mobile Windows Phone 7 platform. &#8220;&#8220;The 
      interactive books for Kids by Touchybooks 
      are amazing experiences that really add value to Windows 
      Phone 7 Marketplace. Microsoft and Windows Phone really back these 
      types of projects&#8221;, said Isabel G&#243;mez Miragaya, Applications and Games

          Encryption and key management are proven weapons in the security 
          arsenal for data stored in databases, files and applications and for 
          &#8220;data in transit.&#8221; Now there is data tokenization, a new data 
          security model that is gaining traction with CISOs to protect all 
          types of sensitive and confidential information&#8212;credit card numbers, 
          PII and PHI&#8212;in extended environments. This presentation will 
          introduce IT security professionals to the benefits of implementing 
          tokenization in the IBM Z-centric environment to better protect 
          sensitive business and customer information in heterogeneous IT 
          environments that include AIX, IBM i, Linux and other platforms 
          while reducing scope for Payment Card Industry (PCI) audits.

          in these environments is no exception. In this presentation, 
          attendees will learn how IBM shops implement tokenization on the IBM 
          Z and with IBM WebSphere MQ. Payment Card Industry Data Security 
          Standard (PCI DSS) compliance, PCI DSS scope reduction, and how to 
          apply tokenization to protect Personally Identifiable Information 
          (PII) and Protected Health Information (PHI) will also be covered. 
          PCI best practices using tokenization will be illustrated through 
          use cases of successful implementations.

 (Adds executive comment)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BEIJING, June 22 (Reuters) - One Equity Partners (OEP), a
global private equity investment arm of JPMorgan Chase  Co
 said on Wednesday that it plans to invest $200 million
in China over the next two to three years and has partnered with
Chinese conglomerate Beijing Capital Group in identifying
investment opportunities.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The capital would come from a $3 billion global fund OEP
currently manages, and the tie-up with Beijing Capital would
allow the two companies to invest in each other's portfolios,
OEP partner Ryan Shih told Reuters on the sidelines of a
conference in Beijing.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Separately, a Beijing Capital executive said it has launched
a yuan-denominated private equity fund worth $150 million, with
half of its committed capital from foreign investors including
Lexington and a Middle Eastern sovereign wealth fund.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreign private equity investors including Blackstone
 , TPG Capital and Carlyle Group are
rushing to invest in China or launch yuan funds in China,
seeking exposure to the world's fastest-growing major economy.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today, renminbi PE is a dominant force in China, and China
is the No.1 market for IPOs in the world," Omer Ozden, partner
of the private equity unit of Beijing Capital, said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shanghai has recently allowed qualified foreign private
equity investors to convert hard currencies into the yuan for
investment under the so-called Qualified Foreign Limited Partner
(QFLP) scheme, and Beijing is expected to follow suit soon.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Foreign investment will account for half of Beijing
Capital's new yuan fund, with the remainder coming from domestic
investors, Ozden said.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, June 22 (Reuters) - Libyan crude exports could
hit 355,000 barrels a day in the short term from the
rebel-controlled east, and that level is unlikely to prevent
prices from heading higher in the second half of the year, U.S.
bank Goldman Sachs said in a report.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Exports from the North African producer could touch 585,000
bpd from additional shipments from fields in the west if there
was a change in the government, the report dated Tuesday said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Libyan oil production fell from 1.58 million bpd in January
to just 100,000 bpd in May, while exports have stopped entirely,
according to the International Energy Agency.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The opposition forces could resume about 200,000 bpd of
crude exports as some fields and their related export terminals
are largely intact. A further 155,000 bpd could potentially be
exported at a later stage from a second loading port under their
control," Goldman Sachs said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, bringing back the remaining 1 million barrels of
lost production will be challenging as some export terminals
remain under government control, while several oil installations
have also been severely damaged.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Supply disruptions in Libya and unrest in other oil
producers in the region have put a premium of around $10-$20 a
barrel to prices, traders and analysts have said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs said the recent slump in crude is temporary,
and expects trading to remain volatile in the near-term before
strong demand from China and India drives prices higher in the
second half of 2011.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect upward pressure on oil prices to increase in 2H11
as slower, but sustained, oil demand growth draws on inventory
and OPEC spare capacity."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil prices suffered their biggest weekly losses since early
May last week on concerns over weaker economic outlook and the
European debt crisis.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, June 22 (Reuters) - The European Financial
Stability Facility (EFSF) said on Wednesday it had mandated BNP
Paribas (BNPP.PA), Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and Royal Bank of
Scotland (RBS.L) as joint lead managers for its second bond
issue for Portugal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; It said the 3 billion euro ($4.3 billion), 5-year issue
would be launched shortly, depending on market conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The issue will be the third placed by the EFSF, following
last week's 5 billion euro, 10-year bond in support of the
financial assistance programme for Portugal and its inaugural
issue in January for Ireland.

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co agreed to pay $153.6 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charges that it defrauded investors who bought mortgage securities sold just before the nation's housing market collapsed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The regulator's complaint against the banking giant was larded with excerpts from internal JPMorgan communications that indicated bankers sold a collateralized mortgage obligation in 2007 to ensure that it could get credit-scarred mortgage securities off its books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are soooo pregnant with this deal, we need a wheel-barrel to move around," the head of CDO distribution wrote in a March 22, 2007 email to the sales staff. "Let's schedule the cesarian, please!"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement with JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, echoes on a smaller scale the $550 million accord that Goldman Sachs Group Inc reached last July over its Abacus collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both cases involved charges that banks let hedge fund clients structure complex securities -- and then bet against them -- without disclosing their involvement to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC on Tuesday also filed civil charges against Edward Steffelin, 41, a former managing director at the now bankrupt GSC Capital Corp, which served as collateral agent for the JPMorgan CDO marketed as Squared CDO 2007-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It alleged that he hoped to get a job with the Magnetar Capital LLC hedge fund, while helping to create marketing materials that failed to disclose that Magnetar chose some securities in the CDO and had a nearly $600 million bet that they would lose value.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold $150 million of Squared CDO notes to pension funds and investors worldwide that lost most of their value in just 10 months, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is deja vu all over again," said John Coffee, a securities law professor at Columbia University, recalling the Goldman case with a quote from baseball legend Yogi Berra. "If Goldman and JPMorgan were doing this, it wouldn't surprise me if others were as well."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FULL PIPELINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No individual bankers were charged in the JPMorgan case, but SEC enforcement chief Robert Khuzami told reporters the agency continues to pursue individuals and has charged roughly 50 people in cases related to the credit crisis of 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro also addressed criticism that about the lack of charges against individuals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is not for lack of will and desire that we are not seeing as many senior people being named in these cases," Schapiro said. "If we could, we would be naming them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fabrice Tourre, a Goldman vice president whose case is ongoing, was the only individual charged by the SEC over Abacus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ms. Schapiro said the SEC will continue to bring charges against banks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a pretty full pipeline of post-crisis cases," she said. "They relate to disclosure failures, particularly around structured products, accounting issues and so forth."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EXACERBATING A CRISIS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Critics say CDOs such as Squared and Abacus allowed banks and mortgage lenders to dump credit-deficient loans and then make more, further inflating the subprime mortgage bubble even as signs of excess were apparent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan agreed to pay a $133 million fine, plus $20.6 million of improper profits and interest. About $125.9 million will go to investors in the Squared CDO, and $27.7 million will go to the U.S. Treasury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The accord also requires JPMorgan to change its policies for reviewing and approving offerings of mortgage securities. It must be approved by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman in Manhattan. Steffelin's case was assigned to a different judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan did not admit wrongdoing, but said it lost nearly $900 million on the Squared transaction. It also said the SEC's penalty reflected in part its voluntary decision to pay $56.8 million to investors in a separate CDO, Tahoma CDO I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Goldman, which settled a fraud charge indicating it acted with intent or recklessness, JPMorgan was charged in a way that suggests its activity may have been negligent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alex Lipman, a partner at Nixon Peabody who represents Steffelin, criticized the SEC's claims, and denied that his client had been pursuing a job with Magnetar.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are baffled by the SEC's decision to proceed against an individual in a contested proceeding on a negligence theory," he said. Steffelin "did not work for the underwriter and had no responsibility for the contents of the offering memorandum."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Magnetar in a statement said SEC staff advised it not to expect any enforcement action by the regulator. "We did not control the asset selection process and our mortgage CDO investment strategy was designed and implemented to maintain a market-neutral portfolio," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC said Squared sales materials indicated that the underlying investments in the CDO were chosen by a GSC affiliate, but failed to reveal that Magnetar played a significant role.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC earlier this year sent a "Wells notice" indicating possible civil charges to both Steffelin and Michael Llodra, JPMorgan's former global head of structured product CDOs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Llodra was not charged on Tuesday. He could not immediately be reached for comment. Walton Securities Inc, which according to regulatory records now employs Steffelin, did not return a call seeking comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares closed up 43 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $40.91 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are SEC v. JPMorgan Securities LLC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-04206; and SEC v. Steffelin in the same court, No. 11-04204.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Sarah N.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co's settlement with regulators on Tuesday could be just a small taste of the losses it faces from mortgage-linked securities and the damage they did to its storied reputation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The bank agreed to pay just $154 million to settle charges it omitted key information when marketing complex instruments linked to home loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the case is a reminder that, although JPMorgan backed away from the mortgage fiasco early, it built mortgage-related securities that could result in some $30 billion of claims against the bank, according to an analysis by Chris Whalen, co-founder of research firm Institutional Risk Analytics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Street is worried about this big-time litigation," said Whalen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan shares rose on Tuesday as investors shrugged off the long been expected settlement, but the bank's shares have fallen more than 15 percent from their 52-week high in mid-February.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of that $30 billion, about $18 billion comes from the dealings of Bear Stearns, Whalen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A JPMorgan spokesman declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan's outspoken chief executive, is often feted in financial circles as a shining example for the industry. He successfully avoided many of the losses that hurt his rivals during the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Magnetar case is a reminder that, while JPMorgan might have been smarter than some of its rivals, it was not always kinder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, the bank sold exposure to a portfolio of weak assets without telling clients that a hedge fund had helped pick many of those assets and would profit when they failed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan was earlier to recognize the problems and protect their book than their peers. It wasn't that they didn't do many of the same things prior to that point," said Josh Rosner, an independent financial analyst at Graham Fisher  Co in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LONG MEMORIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon recently complained publicly to Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke about the overall burden of regulation on his bank, a mark of how confident the executive is about his stature.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the Magnetar case could mark a turning point in the bank's reputation, said Charles Geisst, a Wall Street historian and professor at Manhattan College.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan has tried over the years, and very successfully, to portray themselves as the good guys," said Geisst, listing the bank's role in bailing out the U.S. Treasury in the 1890s, attempting to stop panics in 1907 and the 1930s and restructuring Mexican debt a couple of decades ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's a long tradition of them at least appearing to do the right thing, until now."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, the bank's story includes allegations of misleading investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This is exactly the opposite," Geisst added. "People have long memories for this type of thing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Henry; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;VENICE, Italy (Reuters) - Caution caused by the Greek crisis and sluggish consumer spending has led JPMorgan Private Bank's Europe, Middle East and Africa unit to be underweight on equities and bonds, its chief investment strategist said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EMEA unit recommends diversifying into hedge funds. Five percent of the model portfolio is in commodities, with 2 to 3 percentage points of that in gold, strategist Cesar Perez told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say that given valuations, our models should have much more risk and much more equities," he said on the margins of an investment conference with clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We continue to be constructive, but we continue to be cautious in our underweight equities at the moment."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan Chase  Co's Private Bank has about $770 billion in assets under management, making it one of the biggest private banks in the world. Perez declined to give details about his unit's assets under management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perez said he was cautious on equities and bonds because the European Union and Athens have failed to resolve Greece's crushing debt problem a year after the crisis first erupted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He added that Europe still faces nagging questions about the capital health of its banks -- worries that the United States eased about its own lenders through stress tests and capital injections.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We still need more capital to be at rest," he said."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the economic recovery will be consumer spending around the world, he said, with key numbers for a turnaround including U.S. payrolls.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Consumer confidence is going to make the recovery sustainable or not sustainable," Perez said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His unit is "very, very underweight" on European equities, he said. Most of its exposure is through Germany's shares index with mid-sized companies that prospered through an export boom and are likely to see an upturn as German consumer spending picks up.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His biggest overweight pick is U.S. equities, since U.S. companies are flush with cash, meaning dividends, acquisitions and capital spending could pick up, he said. Perez likes big U.S. technology companies such as computer and phone maker Apple Inc and chip maker Intel Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The corporate sector is the thing that can maintain the situation as we see it," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perez is neutral on emerging market equities, with most exposure in that sector in Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Perez is underweight on government bonds, a position offset by high-yield corporate bonds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ian Simpson, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)&lt;/p&gt;

			J.P. Morgan Launches Full Prime Brokerage Offering in Europe
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan has today launched a full prime brokerage offering for 
      clients in Europe, the Middle East and Africa. The investment bank now 
      has the local infrastructure in place to serve international and 
      regional clients across the entire spectrum of both cash and synthetic 
      products for the first time.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The build-out of the European platform reflects the firm&#8217;s wider 
      strategy to invest in Prime Services and offer a full suite of products 
      for hedge fund clients globally.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This is a key milestone for our international business,&#8221; said Sandie 
      O&#8217;Connor, Global head of Prime Services at J.P. Morgan. &#8220;These local 
      capabilities will allow our international clients to have integrated 
      access to the broader J.P. Morgan franchise across asset classes, 
      alongside services including equity financing, securities lending, 
      clearing, and settlement.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan has a dedicated team rolling out the new platform to clients 
      from across its Prime Brokerage business. In addition, the firm 
      continues to invest in experienced new hires including Christian 
      Erickson who heads a new Client Experience unit globally, having 
      recently joined from UBS where he was Chief Operating Officer of Prime 
      Brokerage. His appointment follows other strategic hires made in Europe 
      last year, including Brian Bisesi, formerly of Barclays Capital, who 
      heads Sales for prime brokerage in the region; and Kumar Panja, 
      previously with Goldman Sachs, who heads Strategic Consulting.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Whether clients are based in Europe or simply operating in the region, 
      our aim is to deliver the high level of service that they have come to 
      expect from J.P. Morgan,&#8221; said Andrea Angelone, Global co-head of Prime 
      Brokerage. &#8220;We have a pipeline of new and existing clients ready to come 
      on board, ranging from large, pedigree start-ups to the more established 
      institutional funds in the industry.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan boosted its prime brokerage capability when it acquired Bear 
      Stearns in 2008. This complemented the firm&#8217;s existing financing, cash 
      management and custodial services worldwide. Since then, it has invested 
      heavily in integrating its platform, and continued to gain clients and 
      market share. Consequently, in both 2010 and 2011, Absolute Return 
      magazine ranked J.P. Morgan as the number one Prime Broker in the 
      Americas by hedge fund assets, and Global Custodian magazine gave 
      the firm 51 &#8220;Best in class&#8221; awards in its 2010 Prime Brokerage survey.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Bankers J.P. Morgan and Goldman Sachs slashed forecasts for crude prices in the third quarter after the International Energy Agency announced the release of 60 million barrels of oil next month to shore up the economic recovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan cut its average forecast for Brent crude to $100 a barrel in the third quarter, down from its previous projection of $130. Goldman Sachs (GS.N), one of the most influential banks in commodities, expects Brent prices to fall to $105-$107 a barrel by the end of July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If pursued rigorously, the 60 million-barrel sale over 30 days is a sufficient volume to cause a very substantial drop in the oil price," J.P. Morgan analysts led by Lawrence Eagles said in a note to clients late on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Oil bounced back a dollar on Friday after tumbling to a four-month low in the previous session on news the world's top consumers planned to release emergency oil reserves for only the third time ever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By 0111 GMT, Brent crude rose 84 cents to $108.10 a barrel, after settling at its lowest since February on Thursday. U.S. crude gained $1.06 to $92.08 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a note to clients, Goldman's energy team, led by David Greely in New York, said, "We estimate that a 60 million barrel release by the end of July has the potential to reduce our three-month Brent crude oil price target by $10-$12 a barrel, to $105-$107 a barrel."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would expect the release to have less of an impact on prices further out the curve, as the oil would be absorbed to meet current demand. Net, we would expect that the potential impact on Brent crude oil prices in 2012 to be closer to $5-$7 a barrel on average."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst team stopped short of an official price revision, saying they wanted to know whether the release would be through a direct sale of crude and oil products from IEA member countries or whether they would operate an exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would expect that if the emergency release is implemented through an exchange program there will be less of an impact on crude oil prices for 2012 and beyond than if it is implemented through a direct sale, which would leave more uncertainty over when the government would choose to refill the SPR (U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve)," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan analysts said the offer of strategic oil inventory "should be seen not only as a stop-gap due to insufficient global supply, but also as an injection of stimulus into the world economy, and result in a significant shift in world oil pricing dynamics in the third quarter."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;J.P. Morgan said the new forecast was the same it had before the disruption to Libyan supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"IEA countries have replaced OPEC as the supplier of the marginal barrel to the market, with significant pricing power conferred to the U.S. by virtue of its large contribution to the release pool," J.P. Morgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN IN COMMODITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman rocked commodity markets in April when the long-term price bull suddenly turned cautious on the outlook, saying speculators had pushed prices ahead of fundamentals as Brent crested a post-2008 peak near $125 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After oil prices fell in May, the bank again turned bullish and said the large correction provided a good buying opportunity, raising its year-end Brent forecast to $120 a barrel. Its current three-month forecast is $117 a barrel and its forecast for 2012 is $130 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is a long-term bull on oil and has said the 2008 peak of more than $147 a barrel could be surpassed in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greely told Reuters on Wednesday that while a large production increase from Saudi Arabia could limit the size of any global stock draw in the second half of this year, they expected spare production capacity in OPEC to be "effectively exhausted" by rising demand in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plan to tap U.S. emergency oil reserves had been under way for nearly two months, but President Barack Obama held off in order to consult with other consuming nations and key OPEC producers, an administration official told Reuters on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Alejandro Barbajosa and Manolo Serapio Jr in Singapore; Reporting by David Sheppard; Writing by Clarence Fernandez; Editing by Lisa Shumaker and Simon Webb)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, June 24 (Reuters) -     Bankers J.P. Morgan and
Goldman Sachs slashed forecasts for crude prices in the third
quarter after the International Energy Agency announced the
release of 60 million barrels of oil next month to shore up the
economic recovery.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan cut its average forecast for Brent crude to $100
a barrel in the third quarter, down from its previous projection
of $130. Goldman Sachs , one of the most influential banks
in commodities, expects Brent prices to fall to $105-$107 a

days is a sufficient volume to cause a very substantial drop in
the oil price," J.P. Morgan analysts led by Lawrence Eagles said
in a note to clients late on Thursday.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil bounced back a dollar on Friday after tumbling to a
four-month low in the previous session on news the world's top
consumers planned to release emergency oil reserves for only the
third time ever.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By 0111 GMT, Brent crude LCOc1 rose 84 cents to $108.10 a
barrel, after settling at its lowest since February on Thursday.
U.S. crude CLc1 gained $1.06 to $92.08 a barrel.  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a note to clients, Goldman's energy team, led by David
Greely in New York, said, "We estimate that a 60 million barrel

barrel on average." 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst team stopped short of an official price
revision, saying they wanted to know whether the release would
be through a direct sale of crude and oil products from IEA
member countries or whether they would operate an exchange. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We would expect that if the emergency release is
implemented through an exchange program there will be less of an
impact on crude oil prices for 2012 and beyond than if it is
implemented through a direct sale, which would leave more
uncertainty over when the government would choose to refill the
SPR (U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve)," the note said. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; J.P. Morgan analysts said the offer of strategic oil

price bull suddenly turned cautious on the outlook, saying
speculators had pushed prices ahead of fundamentals as Brent
crested a post-2008 peak near $125 a barrel. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After oil prices fell in May, the bank again turned bullish
and said the large correction provided a good buying
opportunity, raising its year-end Brent forecast to $120 a
barrel. Its current three-month forecast is $117 a barrel and
its forecast for 2012 is $130 a barrel. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman is a long-term bull on oil and has said the 2008
peak of more than $147 a barrel could be surpassed in the coming
years. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Greely told Reuters on Wednesday that while a large
production increase from Saudi Arabia could limit the size of
any global stock draw in the second half of this year, they
expected spare production capacity in OPEC to be "effectively
exhausted" by rising demand in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plan to tap U.S. emergency oil reserves had been under
way for nearly two months, but President Barack Obama held off
in order to consult with other consuming nations and key OPEC
producers, an administration official told Reuters on Thursday.

			Verm&#246;gensverwaltungsfirmen sollten laut dem 15. j&#228;hrlichen World 
      Wealth Report eine integrierte unternehmensweite Antwort auf die 
      komplexen Bed&#252;rfnisse von Dollar-Million&#228;ren nach der Krise suchen
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			&#8222;Enterprise Value&#8220;1-Ansatz 
      ist ein wichtiges Unterscheidungsmerkmal f&#252;r Verm&#246;gensverwaltungsfirmen 
      in einem &#228;u&#223;erst konkurrenzbetonten Markt
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Verm&#246;gensverwaltungsfirmen und -berater m&#252;ssen breitere und besser 
      integrierte M&#246;glichkeiten bereitstellen, um auf die komplexen 
      Bed&#252;rfnisse der sogenannten High Net Worth Individuals (HNWI)2 
      von heute eingehen zu k&#246;nnen, wie der 15. j&#228;hrliche World Wealth Report 
      nahelegt, der heute von Merrill Lynch Global Wealth Management und 
      Capgemini ver&#246;ffentlicht wurde. Ein sogenannter Enterprise-Value-Ansatz 
      ist im heutigen Umfeld besonders wichtig, da reiche Kunden erwarten, 
      dass ihre Gesch&#228;ftsbeziehungen zu Firmen und Beratern einen 
      nachhaltigeren und breiteren Nutzen abwerfen als in den Jahren vor der 
      Krise, als die Dollar-Million&#228;re sich st&#228;rker auf Renditen 
      konzentrierten. Das Gebot der Stunde lautet, dass Firmen und Berater 
      ihren reichen Kunden dabei behilflich sein sollten, die komplexe 
      Mischung aus Zielen, Bedenken und Priorit&#228;ten zu handhaben, mit denen 
      diese sich nun auseinandersetzen m&#252;ssen.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;W&#228;hrend auf den globalen Finanzm&#228;rkten der Anschein von Normalit&#228;t 
      zur&#252;ckkehrt, sind die HNWI von den Auswirkungen der Krise schwer 
      getroffen worden&#8220;, sagte John Thiel, Leiter der Verm&#246;gensverwaltung in 
      den USA und der Private Banking  Investment Group bei Merrill Lynch 
      Global Wealth Management. &#8222;Viele reiche Kunden haben ihre Investitions- 
      und Lebensziele ganz klar neu durchdacht und gewichten das Risiko neu, 
      das sie &#252;bernehmen wollen, um jene Ziele zu erreichen. Firmen m&#252;ssen 
      ihre Kapazit&#228;ten voll aussch&#246;pfen, um eine integrierte Antwort auf die 
      komplexen Bed&#252;rfnisse der Dollar-Million&#228;re nach der Krise zu finden.&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Dollar-Million&#228;re haben erneut Vertrauen in Firmen und Berater 
      gewonnen, sind aber immer noch vorsichtig
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Als sich im Jahr 2010 die Finanzm&#228;rkte und Volkswirtschaften rund um den 
      Globus erholten, gab eine klare Mehrheit der HNWI-Kunden an, dass sie 
      Vertrauen in ihre Verm&#246;gensverwaltungsberater und -firmen haben. Diese 
      Anerkennung steht in krassem Gegensatz zum Jahr 2008, als fast die 
      H&#228;lfte der Dollar-Million&#228;re das Vertrauen in ihre Berater und Firmen 
      verloren hatten.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Die Krise hat jedoch nachhaltig auf die Psyche der Investoren 
      geschlagen, was sich in den nach wie vor relativ vorsichtigen 
      Verm&#246;gensanlagen der Dollar-Million&#228;re widerspiegelt.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Obwohl die HNWI Ende 2010 auf der Suche nach besseren Renditen wieder 
      kalkulierte Risiken eingingen, hielten sie weltweit nach wie vor 
      erhebliche Betr&#228;ge in konservativeren Instrumenten wie festverzinslichen 
      Anlagen oder Bargeld- und Geldmarktanlagen&#8220;, sagte Jean Lassignardie, 
      globaler Verkaufs- und Marketingleiter bei Capgemini Global Financial 
      Services. &#8222;Inmitten dieser Mischung aus Vertrauen und Bef&#252;rchtungen bei 
      reichen Investoren m&#252;ssen Firmen und Berater ihren Wert und ihre 
      Relevanz stets aufs Neue beweisen und den HNWI dabei helfen, ihre sich 
      wandelnden und komplexen Bed&#252;rfnisse zu decken.&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Bedenken und Anspr&#252;che von Dollar-Million&#228;ren sind nach der Krise 
      komplexer geworden
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nachdem sie erhebliche Marktschwankungen mitansehen mussten, sagten 42 
      Prozent der Dollar-Million&#228;re, dass Kapitalerhaltung &#8222;enorm wichtig&#8220; 
      sei, w&#228;hrend eine noch gr&#246;&#223;ere Zahl (46 Prozent) sagte, dies sei 
      &#8222;wichtig&#8220;. Dar&#252;ber hinaus halten 49 Prozent der HNWI ein effektives 
      Portfolio-Management f&#252;r &#8222;wichtig&#8220; und 30 Prozent f&#252;r &#8222;enorm wichtig&#8220;. 
      Die Krise versch&#228;rfte diese Sichtweise und brachte auch neue Priorit&#228;ten 
      hervor, wie spezialisierte Beratung (f&#252;r 48 Prozent &#8222;wichtig&#8220; und f&#252;r 25 
      Prozent &#8222;enorm wichtig&#8220;) und Transparenz bei Ausz&#252;gen und Geb&#252;hren (f&#252;r 
      42 Prozent &#8222;wichtig&#8220; und f&#252;r 34 Prozent &#8222;enorm wichtig&#8220;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Enterprise Value bietet eine relevante und komplette Antwort f&#252;r 
      Kunden
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Das Umfeld nach der Krise erfordert mehr Reaktionsfreudigkeit und 
      Flexibilit&#228;t als in der Vergangenheit, so auch die bessere Nutzung oder 
      Kombination verschiedener unternehmens&#252;bergreifender Kapazit&#228;ten, die 
      sich m&#246;glicherweise in anderen Gesch&#228;ftseinheiten wie dem Firmen-, 
      Privatkunden- oder Investmentgesch&#228;ft befinden. Firmen k&#246;nnen die 
      Kundenzufriedenheit von Dollar-Million&#228;ren erheblich steigern, indem sie 
      Enterprise Value zur Bereitstellung einer integrierten Antwort auf deren 
      komplexe Bed&#252;rfnisse nutzen &#8211; besonders in Bereichen, wo die HNWI einen 
      betr&#228;chtlichen Nutzen erkennen, bisher aber alles andere als zufrieden 
      sind.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      HNWI verlangen bereits nach gewissen unternehmens&#252;bergreifenden Punkten, 
      die zur Zeit noch nicht gut ausgebildet sind, darunter 
      unternehmens&#252;bergreifende Teams aus Fachberatern, einzigartige 
      Investitionsm&#246;glichkeiten &#252;ber die Investmentbank, Vorzugsfinanzierungen 
      f&#252;r Unternehmer und Beratung/Fachwissen von Privat- und Investmentbank 
      bei der Verm&#246;gensbildung. Enterprise Value stellt ein Mittel zur 
      Abdeckung dieser Anforderungen dar und kann f&#252;r Firmen, die im &#228;u&#223;erst 
      konkurrenzbetonten Marktumfeld von heute reaktionsfreudiger werden 
      m&#252;ssen, ein wichtiges Unterscheidungsmerkmal sein.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Das Paradigma von heute mit Betonung auf Enterprise Value hebt sich von 
      der unternehmensgesteuerten Suche nach Synergien von gestern stark ab. 
      Zukunftsgerichtete Firmen m&#252;ssen Strategien und Investitionsprogramme 
      mit Enterprise Value aus der Perspektive zum Wohle des Kunden aufbauen,

      &#8222;Reichen Kunden wichtige Vorz&#252;ge wie besser abgestimmte und 
      einheitlichere Serviceangebote, Zugang zu einer breiteren Auswahl an 
      Ressourcen oder Kapazit&#228;ten und neue Investitionsm&#246;glichkeiten 
      bereitzustellen, das sind wichtige Unterscheidungsmerkmale&#8220;, so Thiel. 
      &#8222;Dies erfordert ein Ausma&#223; an Flexibilit&#228;t und Reaktionsf&#228;higkeit, das 
      f&#252;r viele Firmen eine wesentliche Ver&#228;nderung bedeutet. Doch es kann f&#252;r 
      wachsame Firmen auch eine hervorragende Chance darstellen, ihr 
      Engagement und ihren Nutzen zu beweisen, indem sie ihren HNWI-Kunden ein 
      ganz eigenes Wertversprechen abgeben.&#8220;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8222;Obwohl das Erstellen von Enterprise-Value-Ans&#228;tzen f&#252;r Kunden eine 
      Herausforderung ist, besteht darin auch das Potenzial, dass Firmen 
      finanzielle Vorz&#252;ge wie tiefere Fondskosten, gr&#246;&#223;ere Handelsstr&#246;me und 
      internalisierte Margen sowie sekund&#228;re Synergien wie Kosteneinsparungen 
      daraus ziehen k&#246;nnen&#8220;, so Lassignardie.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Letztlich bedeutet Enterprise Value eine langfristige Weiterentwicklung 
      und ein Engagement und ist kein kurzfristiges Notpflaster, sondern 
      ben&#246;tigt ein Auge f&#252;r l&#228;ngerfristige Kapitalrenditema&#223;nahmen. 
      Kontinuit&#228;t ist ganz entscheidend, denn die HNWI-Kunden wollen sicher 
      sein, dass die angebotenen Wertversprechen auch &#252;ber ganze Gesch&#228;fts- 
      und Investitionszyklen hinweg bestehen bleiben.

      Walton Big Lake Development L.P.Reports Q1 2011 Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Big Lake Development L.P. (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;), and its 
      general partner Walton Big Lake Development Corporation, announced today 
      the Partnership&#8217;s results for the period ended March 31, 20111.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Business Overview
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership was established on September 13, 2010, to allow 
      investors to participate in the development of the 136.5 acre Big Lake 
      property located in Edmonton, Alberta (the &#8220;Property&#8221;). The 
      Partnership&#8217;s investment objectives are to preserve limited partners&#8217; 
      capital and to provide annual cash distributions to the limited partners 
      beginning in 2011 until the completion of the development project, which 
      is anticipated in 2015.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The Partnership&#8217;s strategy to meet its investment objectives is as 
      follows:
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      a. acquire the Property without the use of leverage;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      b. obtain contractual commitments from homebuilders to purchase lots to 
      be serviced in each of the three planned phases of the development of 
      the Property before construction commences on that phase;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      c. construct municipal services infrastructure on the Property in phases 
      to provide a controlled supply of serviced lots to the marketplace; and
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      d. use the revenue from the sale of the serviced lots to repay 
      construction loans and other obligations of the Partnership and then 
      make distributions to the limited partners.
		&lt;/p&gt;

      income/loss.Review of Operations
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter of 2011, the Partnership continued to take 
      steps toward fulfillment of its project plan as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        letters of intent were obtained from four builders, Beattie Homes, 
        Montorio Homes, Sabal Homes and ReidBuilt Homes, representing 67% of 
        Phase 1&#8217;s anticipated single-family and semi-detached lot inventory; 
        and
      
			
        financing of $27.4 million to complete Phase 1 was obtained from Sun 
        Life Financial consisting of $25.2 million in construction financing 
        and $2.2 million in letters of credit
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Overall, the project is proceeding as anticipated, as described in its 
      prospectus dated October 28, 2010 and its subsequent offering memorandum 
      (collectively the &#8220;Offering Documents&#8221;), and in line with the 
      Partnership&#8217;s investment objectives.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Project Milestones
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Until project lot sales commence, the amount of income generated by the 
      Partnership is not expected to be significant. As a result, the 
      financial statements alone are not a good indicator of the progress of 
      the Partnership toward its investment objectives. The Partnership makes 
      use of key non-financial indicators in evaluating the performance of the 
      Partnership.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For Phase 1 of the project, key indicators used by management include 
      those presented in the Offering Documents and summarized in the table 
      below.

      Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 Reports Q1 2011 Results
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Walton Ontario Land L.P. 1 (the &#8220;Partnership&#8221;), and its general 
      partner Walton Ontario Land 1 Corporation, announced today the 
      Partnership&#8217;s results for the period ended March 31, 20111.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Business Overview
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership was established on October 2, 2009 for the purpose of 
      acquiring and syndicating undeveloped strategically-located land within 
      Ontario growth corridors. The Partnership&#8217;s investment objective is to 
      maximize returns to its limited partners through the acquisition, 
      management, concept planning and eventual sale of two properties, 
      consisting of an aggregate of 455 acres of undeveloped land in southern 
      Ontario (the &#8220;Properties&#8221;). During the first half of 2010, the 
      Partnership secured financing through an initial public offering (&#8220;IPO&#8221;) 
      and a private placement (the &#8220;Private Placement&#8221;). The Properties 
      were acquired in June 2010, and consist of the following:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Toronto Area: About 45% of the net proceeds were used for the purpose of 
      purchasing and managing two parcels of land, comprised of 155 acres, 
      located near Toronto, in Alliston, Ontario (the &#8220;Alliston Property&#8221;). 
      These parcels were designated as &#8220;Urban Industrial Holding (UM*H)&#8221;, and 
      are adjacent to the Honda Canada manufacturing facility; and
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      City of Ottawa: Approximately 55% of the net proceeds were used for the 
      purpose of purchasing and managing 300 acres of land located in the 
      southwest quadrant of the City of Ottawa (the &#8220;Ottawa Property&#8221;). 
      This land was designated as &#8220;Agriculture Resource Area&#8221;. It is adjacent 
      to an existing residential subdivision, and is immediately south of 
      Ottawa&#8217;s current urban area boundary.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Partnership is managed by Walton International Group Inc. (&#8220;WIGI&#8221;), 
      which is part of the Walton Group of Companies. The project manager is 
      Walton Development and Management L.P. (&#8220;WDM&#8221;), whose team, 
      including its affiliates, is comprised of 39 real estate development 
      professionals bringing over 430 years of combined experience in 
      engineering, land development, land planning, project management, 
      finance, marketing and municipal affairs.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      It is the current intention of the Partnership to hold its interest in 
      the Properties as an investment and to eventually dispose of its 
      interest prior to physical development of the Properties. If the 
      partners determine that the Partnership should participate in the 
      development of the Properties (other than pre-development concept 
      planning), the activities of the Partnership also may include the 
      partial or full development of the Properties prior to their sale.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As described in the Partnership&#8217;s offering documents, net income, if 
      any, earned from the Properties prior to their eventual sale has not 
      been and is not anticipated to be significant. As a result, the 
      Partnership is not expected to distribute a significant amount of cash 
      to unitholders until such time as either of the Properties is sold.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Review of Operations
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      During the first quarter of 2011, the Partnership continued to execute 
      the concept planning phase of its overall investment strategy which 
      began in the third quarter of 2010. During the concept planning phase, 
      engineering, planning and legal professionals prepare the land for 
      development by obtaining municipal approvals. To obtain such approvals, 
      the Partnership works with regional and municipal planning authorities 
      to conceptually plan the Properties for build-out in order to achieve 
      the highest and best development potential. These approvals generally 
      attract an expanded audience of potential buyers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Key planning activities underway as at March 31, 2011 for the each of 
      the Properties are as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				Alliston Property &#8211; Walton submitted a Draft Plan of 
        Subdivision application to the Town of New Tecumseth in February 2011 
        for the Alliston lands to accommodate industrial and other employment 
        uses. Walton anticipates a statutory public (open house) meeting in 
        July 2011 for the Draft Plan of Subdivision, followed by presentation 
        to Council for approval in August 2011.
      
			
				Ottawa Property &#8211; Two major planning processes are underway in 
        Ottawa which may significantly influence the direction of Ottawa&#8217;s 
        planning and development activity: the &#8220;Choosing Our Future&#8221; long-term 
        planning initiative and an Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) hearing 
        regarding multiple appeals to the Official Plan Amendment adopted by 
        Ottawa in 2009. The first stage of the OMB hearing, which dealt with 
        how much land was included in Ottawa&#8217;s Urban Boundary, was a 7-week 
        process that concluded on April 7, 2011. The OMB reached a decision on 
        Stage 1 of the hearing on June 3, 2011. The decision was to expand the 
        Urban Boundary to 2,100 acres. The second stage of the OMB hearing can 
        now proceed to determine where additional lands within the Urban 
        Boundary will be located. The conclusion of Stage 2 of the OMB hearing 
        is not anticipated until the summer of 2012. The Choosing our Future 
        planning initiative deals with the long term growth projections and 
        land needs for the City of Ottawa, City of Gatineau and the National 
        Capital Commission. The conclusion of this planning initiative is 
        anticipated in late 2011.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The basic and diluted net loss incurred by the Partnership during the 
      period ended March 31, 2011 was $0.07/unit. This loss is in line with 
      management&#8217;s expectations. During this concept planning phase, the 
      ongoing expenses of the Partnership are expected to exceed the revenues 
      earned.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Overall, the Partnership is proceeding as anticipated, as described in 
      its offering documents, and in line with the Partnership&#8217;s plan to 
      acquire and hold interests in the Properties for appreciation in value.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs, widely seen as one of the most influential banks in commodities, said Brent crude oil prices could fall by $10 to $12 a barrel by the end of July after the International Energy Agency (IEA) announced a surprise release of 60 million barrels of oil from member countries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We estimate that a 60 million barrel release by the end of July has the potential to reduce our three-month Brent crude oil price target by $10-$12 a barrel, to $105-$107 a barrel," Goldman's energy team, led by David Greely in New York, said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would expect the release to have less of an impact on prices further out the curve, as the oil would be absorbed to meet current demand. Net, we would expect that the potential impact on Brent crude oil prices in 2012 to be closer to $5-$7 a barrel on average."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst team stopped short of an official price revision, saying they wanted to know whether the release would be through a direct sale of crude and oil products from IEA member countries or whether they would operate an exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We would expect that if the emergency release is implemented through an exchange program there will be less of an impact on crude oil prices for 2012 and beyond than if it is implemented through a direct sale, which would leave more uncertainty over when the government would choose to refill the SPR (U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve)," the note said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 1:40 p.m. EDT Brent crude oil prices were already down $5.86 at $108.35 a barrel, but were well above an earlier intraday low of $105.72.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prices were largely unchanged from before the publication of the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDMAN IN COMMODITIES&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The investment bank rocked commodity markets in April when the long-term price bull suddenly turned cautious on the outlook, saying speculators had pushed prices ahead of fundamentals as Brent crested a post-2008 peak near $125 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman was one of the first banks to predict $100 oil last decade, in March 2005 when prices were closer to $50 a barrel, and traders frequently say the bank's recommendation can have an outsize influence on the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late May, the bank said the large correction in prices that month provided a good buying opportunity, and raised its year-end Brent forecast to $120 a barrel, reaffirming its bullish medium-term view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Its current three-month forecast is $117 a barrel and its forecast for 2012 is $130 a barrel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bank has remained long-term bullish of oil and said the 2008 peak of more than $147 a barrel could be surpassed in the coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Greely told Reuters on Wednesday that while a large production increase from Saudi Arabia could limit the size of any global stock draw in the second half of this year, they expected spare production capacity in OPEC to be "effectively exhausted" by rising demand in 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by David Sheppard; Editing by Lisa Shumaker)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Adds background, rewrites first paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
will return more than $800 million of cash and securities to
the trustee winding down the brokerage unit of Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc LEHMQ.PK after Federal bankruptcy court approved
a settlement deal on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage, Lehman Brothers Inc, is being liquidated by
trustee James Giddens, who is collecting assets to return to
customers who held accounts at Lehman when it filed for
bankruptcy in September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The trustee had announced the settlement in April. JPMorgan
was the brokerage's "clearing" bank, acting as a go-between in
Lehman dealings with other parties and, in that role, holding
various Lehman assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This is a significant and positive result from two years
of investigation and close cooperation with JPMorgan," Giddens
said in an emailed statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The settlement includes $755 million in cash and $106
million in securities, based on values as of Sept. 19, 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said in April when the settlement was announced
that it would not have a material financial impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Lehman Brothers brokerage estate had assets of $22.78
billion, including $14.35 billion in securities, as of Aprill
22, 2011, according to a recent report by the trustee.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is In re: Lehman Brothers Inc, U.S. Bankruptcy
Court, Southern District of New York, No. 08-01420.

 (Updates shares)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ben Hirschler and Lewis Krauskopf&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON/NEW YORK, June 23 (Reuters) - Strong data for a new
blood thinner from Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer has upended
investor assumptions of which global drugmaker will take the
lead in one of the most promising new classes of medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The drug apixaban, to be marketed as Eliquis if approved,
is one of three new candidates to replace the decades-old, and
potentially dangerous, stroke preventer warfarin. Analysts
estimate the total annual market for such oral drugs as high as
$20 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bristol (BMY.N) and Pfizer (PFE.N) said late on Wednesday
that apixaban proved superior to and safer than warfarin in
preventing strokes in patients with dangerously irregular heart
rhythms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The clinical trial results bested Wall Street expectations
that the drug would prove to be just as good as, but not better
than, warfarin. They also undermined confidence in prospects
for rival medicine Xarelto, from Bayer (BAYGn.DE) and Johnson 
Johnson (JNJ.N). A third drug, Pradaxa, is sold by privately
held Boehringer Ingelheim.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Thursday, investors were changing their bets on the main
players. Bristol shares were up 5.5 percent and Pfizer gained
2.1 percent. Bayer shares were down 6.3 percent and JJ slipped
1.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Drug development has proven so perilous that this is
refreshing," said Mike Krensavage, principal with Krensavage
Asset Management. "Bristol-Myers has had some success lately
with some of its drugs, but Pfizer has been having a drought so
it's certainly a needed success for both companies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prior to the latest clinical data, the consensus forecast
called for 2015 Xarelto sales of $3.5 billion and apixaban
sales of $1.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters Pharma.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Leerink Swann analyst Seamus Fernandez lifted his revenue
estimate for apixaban by $850 million to $3.1 billion in 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe apixaban could become the leader in the
warfarin-replacement market," Fernandez said in a research
note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apixaban will likely be the third medicine to hit the
market. But the new data showed the drug could quickly overtake
its rivals. [ID:nN1E75L273]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Xarelto, which is awaiting U.S. approval, and Pradaxa have
shown to be more effective than warfarin, but not safer in
terms of overall bleeding risk, at their approved or expected
doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Apixaban would also benefit from Bristol and Pfizer's
formidable sales teams for heart drugs, based on their success
in past years selling multibillion-dollar drugs like blood-clot
preventer Plavix and cholesterol-lowering treatment Lipitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; XARELTO NOW AN UNDERDOG?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Germany's Bayer said its forecast for more than 2 billion
euros ($2.9 billion) a year in sales from Xarelto would not
change in light of the apixaban data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race said Xarelto was still on
track to be a major product, but long-term consensus forecasts
-- currently around 3 billion euros -- were likely to be cut by
around 1 billion euros. That would translate into a fall of
around 6 percent in 2015 earnings per share forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Xarelto, which has been submitted for approval as a
treatment for stroke prevention in both the United States and
Europe, does still have a potentially important edge over its
rivals because it is meant to be taken once a day. Apixaban and
Pradaxa are taken twice a day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That could be a particularly important consideration for
doctors treating elderly patients with atrial fibrillation,
many of whom already take several other pills. Other factors
being equal, doctors often prefer a more convenient regimen to
make sure patients keep up with their medicines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Xarelto's own impressive safety and effectiveness could
also make it a tough contender and first choice for many
patients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Bayer medicine proved more effective than warfarin by
one measure, among patients who remained on treatment for the
duration of a key late-stage trial. Moreover, Xarelto was
tested in older and sicker patients who are representative of
patients with atrial fibrillation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jeffrey Holford, an analyst at Jefferies, said the latest
data suggested Pradaxa was the weakest of the three products,
although a full picture of apixaban's profile would emerge only
when all results from the latest trial are presented at the
European Society of Cardiology meeting in Paris on Aug. 28.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He expects eventual peak annual sales of $4.8 billion, $4.7
billion and $3.5 billion for Xarelto, apixaban and Pradaxa
respectively, with $3.5 billion, $3 billion and $2.8 billion
for each coming from stroke prevention. The drugs will also be
used to prevent blood clots in patients undergoing hip and knee
replacements.

      The Wall Street Journal has reported that United States regulators are 
      investigating whether some of the world&#8217;s largest banks colluded to 
      manipulate reported LIBOR rates downward during the recent financial 
      crisis. If true, this manipulation may have caused significant harm to 
      purchasers of financial products tied to LIBOR rates. Those purchasers 
      may be entitled to compensation under the federal antitrust and 
      commodities laws. Finkelstein Thompson is a law firm specializing in 
      representing defrauded investors, and welcomes inquiries from those 
      potentially affected by this conduct.

      An April 19, 2011 Financial Times article identifies the following banks 
      as defendants in actions filed based on the government investigation: 
      Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), Barclays Plc (BARC.L), Citigroup Inc 
      (C.N), Credit Suisse Group AG (CSGN.VX), Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE), 
      HSBC Holdings Plc (HSBA.L), JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), Lloyds Banking 
      Group Plc (LLOY.L) and UBS AG (UBSN.VX). Affected parties could include 
      those purchasing notes or other types of securities that paid floating 
      or variable rate interest based on reported LIBOR rates from any of 
      these banks.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Upgrades One Class of JPMCFC 1999-C7
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has upgraded one class of J.P. Morgan Commercial Finance 
      Corp.'s (JPMCFC) commercial mortgage pass-through certificates, series 
      1999-C7. A detailed list of rating actions follows the end of the press 
      release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upgrade is due to increased credit enhancement as a result of 
      principal paydown since last review. Fitch modeled losses of 19.6% of 
      the remaining pool; expected losses of the original pool are at 2.2%, 
      including losses already incurred to date. The losses are expected to be 
      absorbed by the non-rated class NR. Fitch has identified four loans 
      (47.8%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, which includes one specially serviced 
      loan (17.3%).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the June 2011 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been paid down by approximately 97.6% to $19.3 million from 
      $801.4 million at issuance. Interest shortfalls are only affecting the 
      non-rated class NR with cumulative unpaid interest totaling $1.3 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining loans by applying a 5% 
      reduction to 2009 or 2010 fiscal year-end net operating income, and 
      applying an adjusted market cap rate between 8.10% and 9.5 % to 
      determine value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All the loans also underwent a refinance test by applying an 8% interest 
      rate and 30-year amortization schedule based on the stressed cash flow. 
      All of the loans are modeled to pay off at maturity, and could refinance 
      to a debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) above 1.25 times (x). The 
      current weighted average DSCR is 1.49x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The largest contributor to modeled losses is a 114-room hotel in Coon 
      Rapids, MN. It became a real estate owned (REO) asset on June 4, 2010. 
      The property was scheduled to be sold on June 17, 2011 with expected 
      losses upon liquidation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second largest contributor to modeled losses is a 57,770 square foot 
      (sf) office property in Woodland Hills, CA. Third-quarter 2010 DSCR was 
      1.58x with a 75% occupancy rate. The property is currently 55.9% 
      occupied, as a large tenant occupying 19.18% of the property did not 
      renew its lease upon its Dec. 31, 2010 expiration. The borrower is 
      actively marketing the vacant space for lease.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The third largest contributor to modeled losses is a 165-unit 
      multifamily property located in Phoenix, AZ. Year-end (YE) 2010 DSCR was 
      0.37x with an 82% occupancy rate. The low DSCR was due to high operating 
      expenses and low property occupancy as repairs were made to down units. 
      Rents have been lowered and concessions have been offered to increase 
      occupancy.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has upgraded the following class, as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$26 million class G to 'BBB/LS5' from 'BB/LS5'; Outlook to Stable from 
      Positive.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed the following class, as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$4 million class H at 'BB-/LS5'; Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Classes A-1 through F have paid in full. Fitch does not rate NR class 
      certificates. Fitch has withdrawn the ratings on the Interest-only class 
      X (For additional information on the withdrawal of the rating on Class 
      X, see 'Fitch Revises Practice for Rating IO  Pre-Payment Related 
      Structured Finance Securities', dated June 23, 2010).
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A blood thinner developed by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Pfizer Inc proved superior to and safer than warfarin in preventing strokes in patients with dangerously irregular heart rhythms in a key clinical trial, greatly boosting its sales potential.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of both companies rose on the highly anticipated data from the late-stage study of apixaban, a pill the drugmakers hope to sell under the brand name Eliquis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apixaban needed to show only non-inferiority to warfarin in stroke prevention to meet the primary goal of the Phase III trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Instead, it showed superior efficacy to warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation, according to initial data from the study released on Wednesday by the companies. This should help the drug compete with a pair of new rival oral treatments in the highly lucrative market for millions of patients with the heart disorder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"At first blush, it's a home run for apixaban. It looks better than the other two drugs," said Barclays Capital analyst Tony Butler.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apixaban will compete with Pradaxa, an already approved drug from Boehringer Ingelheim, and Xarelto, a drug developed by Bayer and Johnson  Johnson that is awaiting U.S. approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Bristol-Myers drug also showed superiority on a key safety measure by causing fewer incidents of major bleeding than warfarin. But the companies did not reveal important overall bleeding data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was optimistic on superior bleeding, which they got. To add to that superior efficacy is stunning," said Trevor Polischuk, a partner at New York investment firm OrbiMed Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This sets this drug up to be market leader, in what has been a massive race to get the best drug to market," Polischuk added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each of the new medicines had been deemed to have annual sales potential of more than $2 billion, analysts have said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Potential sales of apixaban have at least doubled. My new number is $5 billion a year," Polischuk said, adding that details of the study were needed to understand its full potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Full details of the study will be presented on August 28 at a major medical meeting in Europe. The companies said they expect to submit applications seeking U.S. and European approval in the third or fourth quarter of this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bristol-Myers shares rose 7.3 percent to $29.78 in extended trading from their New York Stock Exchange close at $27.74, while Pfizer shares rose 3.9 percent to $21.06 from a close at $20.28 on the NYSE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot and Ransdell Pierson)&lt;/p&gt;

			Shop with Points
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Today, Chase 
      Card Services, a division of JPMorgan Chase  Co. [NYSE: JPM], and Amazon.com, 
      Inc. [NASDAQ: AMZN] launched a feature on the Amazon.com 
      Rewards Visa&#174; Card that provides cardmembers the opportunity to use 
      rewards points to pay on Amazon.com. Cardmembers may now use Amazon Shop 
      with Points to redeem rewards points at checkout. Each point cardmembers 
      earn can be redeemed for one cent, meaning 100 points can be redeemed 
      for one dollar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Amazon.com cardmembers have enjoyed combining a great rewards program 
      with the convenience, selection, and value of Amazon,&#8221; said Chris 
      Conrad, general manager at Chase Card Services. &#8220;This new feature 
      delivers terrific value with fast and easy access to rewards points 
      instantly redeemable for millions of items on Amazon.com.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Amazon.com Rewards Card from Chase offers an exceptional value on 
      Amazon.com and has no annual fee. Cardmembers can earn points for 
      everyday purchases made with the Card, including:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Three points for every $1 spent on Amazon.com purchases.
      
			
        Two points for every eligible $1 spent on gas, restaurants, drug 
        stores and office supply stores.
      
			
        One point for every $1 spent everywhere else.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      Three points for every $1 spent on Amazon.com purchases means 
      cardmembers earn and redeem points quickly. For example, cardmembers who 
      spend $1,500 on Amazon.com using the Card earn 4,500 points, which can 
      be used towards $45 in purchases. As a result, after their next billing 
      statement, cardmembers can use Shop with Points to instantly redeem that 
      $45 towards items they purchase at checkout. It&#8217;s 3 percent in cash back.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With the new Amazon Shop with Points feature, cardmembers may also 
      combine any amount of points with their Amazon.com Visa card, Amazon.com 
      Gift Cards, or Amazon Payments account balance to pay for their 
      purchases &#8211; as many or as few as they want. There is no minimum and no 
      specified amount of points to use.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Amazon Shop with Points is a great enhancement to the Amazon.com 
      Rewards Visa Card,&#8221; said Matt Swann, vice president of Global Payments, 
      Amazon.com. &#8220;Amazon&#8217;s broad selection of low priced products and the 
      convenience of paying with Amazon Reward points provide our cardmembers 
      with an exceptional shopping experience.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      There is no expiration date on points and no cap on the number of points 
      earned. For more information on the Amazon.com

&lt;p&gt; (Corrects quote to trillion from billion)	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jun 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan said on Thursday it
recommended cutting exposure to Hungarian bonds because
Hungary's plans to use private pension fund assets to cut its
debt would likely lead to a fall in the country's weighting in
one of the bank's flagship indices.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Tuesday's announced debt cancellation of around HUF 1.4
trillion of mandatory private pension fund holdings of local
currency government bonds will, when confirmed in law, mean that
the weight of Hungary within the GBI-EM-Global Diversifed Index
falls by around 1.1 percentage points," JPMorgan said in a
client note.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This will reduce demand from funds who do not wish to
change their relative exposure to Hungary. Assuming $100 billion
of offshore money tracks the widely followed GBI-EM-Global
Diversifed index, this reduces demand by US$1.2 billion or
HUF224 billion."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan said it recommended selling across the curve, but
told clients to focus on the short end.

&lt;p&gt;IBM has saved $50 million in the past two years through thousands of energy and efficiency projects around the world, the company says in its 2010 Corporate Responsibility Report.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient lighting, better operating schedules for building systems and cloud computing are among the efforts that pushed IBM over a couple of its energy goals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM is aiming to eliminate 1.1. million megawatt hours (MWh) of energy use by 2012, a goal set in 2009. By the end of last year, IBM exceeded its interim goal of cutting out 496,000 MWh by eliminating 523,000 MWh.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the mid-2000s, IBM set a goal to reduce carbon dioxide emissions related to energy use by 12 percent, from 2005 to 2012. It has now surpassed that goal by reducing emissions 16.7 percent, more than doubling the 5.7 percent reduction it was at by the end of 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those savings came from a variety of efforts around the world. Last year, 299 IBM locations completed some 2,100 energy conservation projects, such as installing occupancy sensors lighting systems that are more efficient in 208 locations and modifying HVAC systems at 165 locations. The company's actions last year alone accounted for nearly $30 million of the $50 million saved since 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of building controls, IBM also undertook data center projects to use less energy, less equipment and monitor facilities better. Turning more to cloud computing, IBM deployed 55 servers with cloud software, which would have equalled 488 physical servers, saving $1.3 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM has also been using technology developed by its IBM Research arm that shows heat sinks and cooling leaks in data centers with real-time, 3D images. The company also continues to use analytics software to manage energy use in data centers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM's energy conservation program, which now involves more than 3,000 projects, has since 1990 avoided almost $400 million in energy expenses and 5.4 million megawatt hours of energy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Outside of energy, IBM's latest report also looks at water, recycling, employee volunteerism and corporate donations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, IBM recycled 79 percent of the nonhazardous waste it created, reduced manufacturing water use by almost 2 percent, and remanufactured or refurbished 88 percent of products it processed for recycling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM sign CC-licensed by Patrick H~/Flickr&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The trustee seeking money for Bernard Madoff's victims is now demanding $19 billion in damages from JPMorgan Chase  Co, more than tripling what he hopes to recover from what had been the main bank for the now-imprisoned Ponzi schemer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The amended complaint by the trustee Irving Picard adds new charges and was filed three days after the second-largest U.S. bank agreed to pay $153.6 million to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission fraud charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard maintained that JPMorgan was "thoroughly complicit" in Madoff's fraud and ignored red flags. In his original complaint, made public in February, he had sought $6.4 billion, including $5.4 billion of damages and $1 billion for fraudulent transfers and claims.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan Chase chose to enable Madoff's fraud, not just through the various ways it participated in its activity, but by helping to cover Madoff's naked theft with the imprimatur of a globally recognized financial institution," the 155-page amended complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The higher damage request reflects "life-to-date damages," or what the trustee considers the minimum losses over the entirety of Madoff's Ponzi scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard is also seeking at least $500 million that JPMorgan made "off the backs of Madoff's victims," and more than $400 million of alleged fraudulent transfers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, repeated in an email the bank's earlier statement that Picard's lawsuit is meritless and distorts the facts and law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"JPMorgan did not know about or in any way become a party to the fraud orchestrated by Bernard Madoff," she said. "At all times, JPMorgan complied fully with all laws and regulations governing bank accounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Picard has filed roughly 1,050 lawsuits seeking more than $100 billion for former investors at Bernard L.

&lt;p&gt; * Damages request rises to $19 billion from $5.4 billion&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Trustee Irving Picard seeks additional $900 million&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan, Madoff's main bank, calls lawsuit meritless
 (Adds details from complaint, JPMorgan statement)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel and Jochelle Mendonca&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - The trustee seeking money for
Bernard Madoff's victims is now demanding $19 billion in
damages from JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N), more than tripling
what he hopes to recover from what had been the main bank for
the now-imprisoned Ponzi schemer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The amended complaint by the trustee Irving Picard adds new
charges and was filed three days after the second-largest U.S.
bank agreed to pay $153.6 million to settle U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission fraud charges. [ID:nN1E75K13Z]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Picard maintained that JPMorgan was "thoroughly complicit"
in Madoff's fraud and ignored red flags. In his original
complaint, made public in February, he had sought $6.4 billion,
including $5.4 billion of damages and $1 billion for fraudulent
transfers and claims.  [ID:nN16236764]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan Chase chose to enable Madoff's fraud, not just
through the various ways it participated in its activity, but
by helping to cover Madoff's naked theft with the imprimatur of
a globally recognized financial institution," the 155-page
amended complaint said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The higher damage request reflects "life-to-date damages,"
or what the trustee considers the minimum losses over the
entirety of Madoff's Ponzi scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Picard is also seeking at least $500 million that JPMorgan
made "off the backs of Madoff's victims," and more than $400
million of alleged fraudulent transfers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tasha Pelio, a JPMorgan spokeswoman, repeated in an email
the bank's earlier statement that Picard's lawsuit is meritless
and distorts the facts and law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "JPMorgan did not know about or in any way become a party
to the fraud orchestrated by Bernard Madoff," she said. "At all
times, JPMorgan complied fully with all laws and regulations
governing bank accounts."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Picard has filed roughly 1,050 lawsuits seeking more than
$100 billion for former investors at Bernard L. Madoff
Investment Securities LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The amended JPMorgan complaint adds new allegations that
another financial services company around 1997 investigated

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and Pain Therapeutics Inc said U.S. health regulators declined to approve their abuse-resistant painkiller Remoxy, less than a week after a similar Pfizer drug was cleared for sale, sending Pain's stock crashing Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Neither company specified the issues raised by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in its complete response letter, but said they were evaluating the issues and plan to have further talks with the regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When contacted, Pfizer said it could not discuss the contents of the letter. Pain Therapeutics could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remoxy contains the active ingredient oxycodone -- also called "Hillbilly heroin" or "poor man's heroin" -- a narcotic derived from morphine, which has led to its rampant abuse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the FDA approved another oxycodone-based abuse-resistant painkiller, Oxecta, made by Pfizer and Acura Pharmaceuticals Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remoxy uses Durect Corp's Oradur technology to deliver the drug in a gelatin capsule, which is less prone to abuse through intravenous injection or snorting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acura's Oxecta, which is in tablet form, discourages abuse by turning into a gel when mixed with water and causing irritation in the nasal passages when snorted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But, while Remoxy is a controlled-release form of oxycodone, Oxecta is an immediate-release version.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pain Therapeutics shares fell 40 percent to $5.56 on Nasdaq Friday, while Durect shares slumped 31 percent to $2.12.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Acura shares rose as much as 18 percent, and were trading up 8 percent at $4.02 on Nasdaq, while Pfizer shares were down about a percent to $20.36 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PRESCRIPTION CRACKDOWN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a first-quarter conference call earlier this year, Pfizer CEO Ian Read said the FDA'S recent class-wide risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS)announcement for extended-release opioids could delay the timing of approval or the launch of Remoxy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA has come down strongly on the use of opioids as the drugs are extensively misused and recent guidelines require educating doctors and patients in order to create more awareness about how to use these drugs safely.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Remoxy was billed as a possible competitor to OxyContin, manufactured by privately-held Purdue Pharma, which clocked annual sales of nearly $3 billion before generics of the original formulation came into the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FDA has already declined Pain's application for Remoxy in 2008, and had sought additional non-clinical data to support the painkiller's approval. Pfizer unit King Pharmaceuticals assumed full responsibility for the drug's development in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, Acura had also faced regulatory roadblocks when its marketing application for Acurox -- an earlier version of Oxecta.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company then filed a fresh marketing application, which did not contain the additional benefit of preventing oral abuse, but eventually got the FDA's nod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Shravya Jain and Esha Dey in Bangalore, additional reporting by Anand Basu and Ransdell Pierson in New York; Editing by Savio D'Souza, Anthony Kurian)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story was corrected to fix the spelling of the company name in paragraph 13 and to remove reference to OxyContin losing patent protection)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Provides details about talks between drugmakers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) said on
Friday it is considering a "strategic transaction" with Icagen
Inc ICGN.O, a tiny biotechnology company in which Pfizer
holds a 14.2 cent stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icagen shares jumped $1.61, or 67 percent, to $4.01 in
after hours trading, following the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Icagen representatives and Pfizer employees have engaged
in preliminary discussions regarding a potential strategic
transaction," Pfizer said in a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest drugmaker, which owns almost 1.1
million common shares of Icagen, said the company had given it
access to due diligence materials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer forged in 2007 a research and licensing deal with
Icagen, relating to medicines to treat pain and related
disorders. The biotech is based in Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer said ongoing talks with Icagen could lead to an
extension or amendment of their longstanding agreement. The
drugmaker said a strategic transaction could influence or
change control of Icagen "by means of a stock or asset
acquisition or merger."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Icagen, in a release late on Friday, acknowledged it is
engaged in preliminary discussions with Pfizer regarding a
potential strategic transaction. But it noted there can be no
assurance any agreement will be reached.

			Trustee for Liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities 
      Announces Filing of Amended Complaint Against JPMorgan Chase
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Trustee Expands Allegations against JPMC, Seeks Jury Trial; Increases 
      Minimum Damages Sought from $5.4 Billion to at least $19 Billion
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Irving H. Picard, the Trustee for the liquidation of Bernard L. Madoff 
      Investment Securities LLC (&#8220;BLMIS&#8221;), today announced the filing of an 
      amended complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern 
      District of New York against JPMorgan Chase  Co., JPMorgan Chase Bank, 
      N.A., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities Ltd. 
      (collectively &#8220;JPMC&#8221;).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The&#160;amended complaint, based on expanded allegations,&#160;includes&#160;a jury 
      demand&#160;and&#160;now seeks life-to-date damages. It states that the Trustee 
      seeks to recover a minimum of $19 billion in damages &#8211; up from $5.4 
      billion in damages previously sought &#8211; in addition to&#160;approximately&#160;$1 
      billion in fraudulent transfers and equitable claims. All recovered 
      monies will be placed in the BLMIS Customer Fund and distributed, pro 
      rata, to BLMIS customers with allowed claims.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The Trustee&#8217;s amended complaint adds new evidence and expands our 
      previous allegations that JPMC was an active enabler of the Madoff Ponzi 
      scheme,&#8221;&#160;said David J. Sheehan, counsel for the Trustee and a partner at 
      Baker  Hostetler LLP, the court-appointed counsel for the Trustee.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As alleged in the amended complaint, JPMC not only should have known 
      that a fraud was being perpetrated, they did know,&#8221; said Mr. 
      Sheehan.&#160;&#8220;We look forward to our day in court, when we can present our 
      arguments and evidence against JMPC before a judge and jury.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our amended complaint shows that JPMC&#8217;s bankers literally watched the 
      fraud unfold&#160;before their very eyes,&#8221; said&#160;Deborah H. Renner, a partner 
      at Baker  Hostetler. &#8220;They could see that money customers deposited 
      into BLMIS&#8217;s main account was not used to buy or sell securities. They 
      could see that it was merely transferred to other customers, in patterns 
      serving no legitimate business purpose. They could see&#160;millions of 
      dollars&#160;routinely&#160;bouncing back and forth&#160;between Madoff and JPMC 
      Private Banking customers. They could see that Madoff&#8217;s regulatory 
      filings were materially inconsistent with BLMIS&#8217;s actual finances. Yet, 
      as alleged, they allowed the fraud to continue.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Further suspicious banking activity which evidenced a fraud is alleged 
      in the amended complaint with the addition of information from two 
      former employees of an unnamed financial institution who in 1997 
      observed and investigated Madoff&#8217;s nearly daily circular transactions 
      between an account Madoff controlled at that particular financial 
      institution and Madoff&#8217; s JPMC account (then The Chase Manhattan Bank). 
      The amended complaint alleges that an investigator from the 
      aforementioned financial institution questioned Madoff&#8217;s staff about the 
      transactions and failed to receive a satisfactory explanation from them. 
      The financial institution, seeing no legitimate business purpose for the 
      circular transactions, closed Madoff&#8217;s account.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Ponzi schemes can&#8217;t survive without cash, and JPMC&#8217;s banking activities 
      on behalf of Madoff included the provision of loans which proved 
      essential to Madoff and directly contributed to the ongoing success of 
      his fraud,&#8221; said Keith R. Murphy, a partner at Baker  Hostetler.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The original complaint against JPMC was initially filed under seal on 
      December 2, 2010 in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern 
      District of New York. That complaint was unsealed on February 3, 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      JPMC filed a motion to dismiss the Trustee&#8217;s&#160;original complaint&#160;on 
      June&#160;3, 2011. Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, the Trustee 
      then had up to 21 days to submit an amended version of his complaint, 
      and today&#8217;s filing meets that deadline. JPMC now has until August 1, 
      2011 to respond to the amended complaint.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      A copy of the filing will be made available on the Trustee's website at www.madofftrustee.com. 
      It can also be found on the Bankruptcy Court&#8217;s website as Case No. 
      10-4932 (BRL) or on the District Court&#8217;s website as Case No. 
      11-CV-00913(CM)(MHD) at www.nysb.uscourts.gov.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition to Mr. Sheehan, Ms. Renner and Mr. Murphy, the Trustee 
      acknowledges the contributions of Baker  Hostetler attorneys who worked 
      on the JPMC complaints: Thomas D. Warren,&#160;Tracy L. Cole,&#160;Jessie

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron also extends lease on nearby property&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO, June 24 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) is
buying the former Houston headquarters of failed energy company
Enron, securing ownership of a 50-story tower that the
second-largest U.S. oil company has leased for five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The building at 1400 Smith Street, with a shiny
mirrored-glass exterior that stands out in its corner of
downtown Houston, sold for $340 million, owner Brookfield
Office Properties Inc BPO.N said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Brookfield, which paid $120 million for the
1.3-million-square-foot (121,000-sq-meter) building in 2006,
also said Chevron signed a seven-year lease renewal for 311,000
square feet at neighboring Continental Center I.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, with its headquarters in San Ramon, California,
employs about 10,000 people in Houston out of a worldwide
workforce of about 62,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Before Chevron moved in to 1400 Smith, it was empty for
three years. The oil company owns another former Enron
building, 1500 Louisiana Street, a 40-story tower connected to
1400 Smith by a pedestrian bridge that was completed in 2002,
shortly after Enron's collapse.

&lt;p&gt; * DC Circuit says lower court erred in dismissing case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * JPMorgan, FDIC decline to comment
 (Adds comment from lawyer for insurers, updated stock price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Stempel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court revived
a lawsuit by bondholders of the failed Washington Mutual Bank
who accused JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) of causing them losses
when it bought the thrift's assets at a "fire sale" price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Friday's ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals lets
five insurers renew claims accusing JPMorgan of having
pressured the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corp to force a
$1.9 billion sale of what was once the largest U.S. savings and
loan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These insurers said the terms "drastically undervalued" the
banking unit of Washington Mutual Inc WAMUQ.PK and let
JPMorgan cherry-pick its best assets at their expense, causing
their bond investments to become worthless.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Writing for a three-judge appeals court panel, Chief Judge
David Sentelle reversed the April 2010 dismissal of the case by
a federal district judge, who concluded the bondholders should
have pursued all administrative remedies before suing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The panel returned the case to the lower court for further
proceedings. The FDIC agreed with JPMorgan, the nation's
second-largest bank, that the case was properly dismissed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan spokeswoman Christine Holevas and FDIC spokesman
David Barr declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; James Roquemore, a lawyer for the insurers, said he was
pleased with the ruling, and his clients plan to proceed with
discovery in anticipation of an eventual trial.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit is among those arising from the FDIC's Sept.
25, 2008 seizure of Seattle-based WaMu, as the company is
known.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WaMu's holding company filed for bankruptcy protection the
next day. It is still seeking permission from a Delaware
bankruptcy judge to distribute $7 billion to creditors.
[ID:nN1E75L1U6]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WaMu remains the largest U.S. bank or savings and loan to
fail, with $307 billion of assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; AVOIDING POINTLESS BUREAUCRACY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The five plaintiff insurers are American National Insurance
Co, American National Property and Casualty Insurance Co, Farm
Family Life Insurance Co, Farm Family Casualty Insurance Co and
National Western Life Insurance Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They argued that the lower court erred in requiring them to
first pursue administrative remedies and in finding that they
did not properly allege that JPMorgan's actions were a
"substantial" cause of their losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Sentelle found that "the plain language" of the federal
Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act, a
1989 law passed following that decade's savings-and-loan
crisis, meant the insurers' case should go forward.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Where, as here, neither the failed depository institution
nor the FDIC-as-receiver bears any legal responsibility for
claimant's injuries, the claims process offers only a pointless
bureaucratic exercise," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "And we doubt Congress intended to force claimants into a
process incapable of resolving their claims."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In afternoon trading, JPMorgan shares were down 49 cents at
$39.58 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is American National Insurance Co et al v. FDIC et
al, D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals, No. 09-01743.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co plans to raise prices on its soft drinks by 3 percent to 4 percent in July, in addition to a 2 percent increase taken earlier this year, a company spokesman said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;News of the increases -- to be implemented on July 31 -- was first reported by industry newsletter Beverage Digest, which quoted retail customer pricing letters as saying the increases were due to higher-than-anticipated commodity costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like many food and drink companies, Coca-Cola is facing higher costs for goods like corn, oil and packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drink maker, said earlier this year that it expected to raise prices in that range, but the timing was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Credit Suisse analyst Carlos Laboy said in a research note that there were concerns the company would wait until after Labor Day, at the end of the summer. That would make it more difficult for other soft drink makers, like PepsiCo Inc and Dr Pepper Snapple, to raise prices on their products during the key summer selling season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's news should provide some relief for all players in the industry in North America," Laboy wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beverage Digest reported earlier this month that Pepsi was notifying retailers of price increases of 3 percent to 5 percent between July 10 and around Labor Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coke shares were up 0.2 percent at $65.09 in afternoon trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Pepsi shares were up 0.8 percent at $68.54.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Martinne Geller; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Increase coming sooner than expected - analyst&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 24 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (KO.N) plans to
raise prices on its soft drinks by 3 percent to 4 percent in
July, in addition to a 2 percent increase taken earlier this
year, a company spokesman said on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; News of the increases -- to be implemented on July 31 --
was first reported by industry newsletter Beverage Digest,
which quoted retail customer pricing letters as saying the
increases were due to higher-than-anticipated commodity costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like many food and drink companies, Coca-Cola is facing
higher costs for goods like corn, oil and packaging.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drink maker, said
earlier this year that it expected to raise prices in that
range, but the timing was unknown.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Credit Suisse analyst Carlos Laboy said in a research note
that there were concerns the company would wait until after
Labor Day, at the end of the summer. That would make it more
difficult for other soft drink makers, like PepsiCo Inc (PEP.N)
and Dr Pepper Snapple (DPS.N), to raise prices on their
products during the key summer selling season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Today's news should provide some relief for all players in
the industry in North America," Laboy wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Beverage Digest reported earlier this month that Pepsi was
notifying retailers of price increases of 3 percent to 5
percent between July 10 and around Labor Day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coke shares were up 0.2 percent at $65.09 in afternoon
trade on the New York Stock Exchange. Pepsi shares were up 0.8
percent at $68.54.

      Full-Building Tenant Chevron

			311,000-Square-Foot Renewal Inked with Chevron at Continental Center I
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brookfield Office Properties Inc. (BPO: NYSE, TSX) today announced the 
      sale of the office tower at 1400 Smith Street in Houston to Chevron, 
      1400 Smith&#8217;s full-building tenant, and a 311,000-square-foot lease 
      renewal with Chevron for seven years at neighboring Continental Center I 
      (1600 Smith Street). The sale price of 1400 Smith was $340 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This sale is reflective of our ongoing strategy of recycling capital 
      from mature assets into more accretive opportunities,&#8221; said Ric Clark, 
      chief executive officer of Brookfield Office Properties.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We have created significant value through the sale of this stabilized 
      asset concurrent with Chevron&#8217;s sizeable lease extension at our adjacent 
      property,&#8221; said Dennis Friedrich, president and global chief investment 
      officer of Brookfield Office Properties. &#8220;Chevron represents the type of 
      top-flight corporate tenant we seek to partner with in our global 
      energy-sector markets.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Brookfield Office Properties acquired the 50-story, 
      1.3-million-square-foot office tower, also known as Four Allen Center, 
      in 2006 for approximately $120 million. Soon after acquisition, 
      Brookfield leased the entire building to Chevron in what at the time was 
      the largest lease transaction in North America in more than five years.

      Research and Markets: Cloud Middleware Market Shares, Strategies, and 
      Forecasts, Worldwide, 2011 to 2017 - Middleware software market 
      dominated by IBM
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Research and Markets (http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/08b0c6/cloud_middleware_m) 
      has announced the addition of WinterGreen Research, Inc.'s new report "Cloud 
      Middleware Market Shares, Strategies, and Forecasts, Worldwide, 2011 to 
      2017" to their offering.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      WinterGreen Research announces that it has a new study on Cloud 
      Middleware Market Strategies, Market Shares, and Market Forecasts, 
      2011-2017. IBM middleware has set the standard for cloud architecture. 
      IBM SOA services oriented architecture is the base for enterprise cloud 
      initiatives leveraging middleware to implement the cloud.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The 2011 study has 928 pages and 274 tables and figures. Worldwide 
      markets are poised to achieve significant growth as globally integrated 
      enterprises worldwide move to implement more cost efficient IT systems. 
      Transaction process and Internet workload computer processing delivery 
      modalities depend on the efficiencies of scale achievable using cloud 
      computing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Vendors are building out localized distribution networks that support a 
      cloud computing systems in a local environment, leveraging cloud 
      middleware, providing remote control of systems and implementation of 
      self-provisioned architecture. SOA, services oriented architecture 
      becomes a core capability of cloud middleware, permitting rapid response 
      to changing market conditions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The market for cloud computing middleware software is dominated by IBM 
      which has managed to develop a dominant presence in cloud computing 
      middleware. The IBM Websphere SOA, services oriented architecture is a 
      defacto industry standard for cloud computing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      While cloud computing markets overall are intensely competitive, 
      middleware markets have been captured by IBM. Cloud computing is 
      characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry 
      standards and frequent new product and service installations. 
      Competition for cloud services is increasing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Existing competitors and new market entrants dominate the market for 
      cloud computing. Cloud computing middleware software companies compete 
      primarily on the basis of performance and robust feature sets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hybrid computing challenges relate to achieving breakthroughs that 
      reduce costs of IT infrastructure. Next generation application server 
      solutions implement new technologies. These challenge traditional 
      architectural approaches, and depend on virtualization of the large 
      enterprise servers.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM zEnterprise solution implementation of zOS, zVM, and zBX represent 
      breakthrough technologies for Cloud middleware line of business (LoB) 
      application server development and test markets. The IBM zEnterprise 
      solution represents a quantum improvement in data center computing. 
      Companies that have adopted virtualized systems have achieved 
      significant competitive advantage. The server that automates services in 
      the cloud is a technological breakthrough, depending on cloud middleware 
      to achieve integration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The systems leverage virtualized technology that has been around for 50 
      years, is fully vetted. Cloud middleware adds a new dimension to the 
      virtualized hardware, creating low cost systems implementations ready 
      for prime time. Now that the virtual systems cost structures are more 
      approachable, due to economies of scale, there are many more uses for 
      cloud middleware than has been true in the past.

      collections of comics, short stories and graphic novels ever created,

      new comics from Toy Story and Cars 2.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The launch collection includes more than 50 comics for readers of all 
      ages and features Disney classic characters like Donald Duck; 
      Disney-Pixar comics featuring Toy Story&#8217;s Buzz and Woody; Disney

      Disney Publishing will release two new titles each week following the 
      launch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

      available on the App Store in over 80 countries across the Americas, 
      Europe, Asia, Africa, and Australia. Additional markets will launch Disney 
      Comics later this year.

      &#8220;Comics are a tremendous part of our heritage and we see great potential 
      and interest in bringing our extensive catalog of Disney Comics 
      to mobile devices,&#8221; said Russell Hampton, President, Disney Publishing 
      Worldwide. &#8220;We create over 25,000 original comic pages each year and 
      it&#8217;s critical that we deliver this content to our readers around the 
      world. We have over 1 billion Disney comic readers today, and our Disney 
      Comics App will further broaden that audience.&#8221;

      The Disney Comics App offers a new, director-style reading 
      experience; readers can choose portrait or landscape mode, automatic or 
      manual smart paneling, and can view double spreads. Disney Comics 
      also enables readers to preview comics before making a purchase, share 
      their stories with Facebook friends, and save all content to their iPad, 
      iPhone or iPod touch for offline reading. An added feature lets readers 
      receive automatic updates when stories relating to a favorite Disney 
      character become available.
    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL, June 24 (Reuters) - South Korea's National Pension
Service said on Friday that it had bought 230 Park Avenue, a
landmark Manhattan office tower, jointly with a unit of global
money manager Investco from a Goldman Sachs Group Inc 
real estate fund.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; NPS, the world's No.4 pension fund with about $300 billion
in assets, holds 49 percent and Investco Core Real Estate Fund
owns 51 percent of the 14 million square foot building, which is
leased to companies including ING Investment Management and
Swiss Re .	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The contract was signed on June 9, NPS said in a statement
on Friday. It did not disclose terms of the transaction for the
34-storey building, which Goldman Sachs bought for $1.15 billion
in 2007.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Built in 1929 and formerly known as New York Central
Building, it was named the Helmsley Building after New York real
estate investor Harry Hemlsley acquired it. Monday Properties
will continue to manage the building.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The purchase is part of NPS's efforts to diversify its
investments from stocks and fixed-income and adds to a series of
acquisitions in recent years of overseas landmark properties.
NPS invested in Sony Center in Berlin, HSBC Holdings Plc's
  European headquarters in London's Canary
Wharf financial district, Gatwick airport in London and
O'Parinor shopping mall near Paris.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fund aims to increase investments in alternative assets
to more than 10 percent by the end of 2016, from 2010's 5.8
percent, to meet its 6.5 percent investment return target for
the next five years.

&lt;p&gt;EUGENE, Oregon (Reuters) - America's newly-crowned 100 meters champion Walter Dix does not plan to be intimidated by Jamaica's sprint machine at August's world championships in South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dix, who won bronze medals in both the 100 and 200m at the 2008 Beijing Olympics where Jamaican Usain Bolt ripped up the record books, was oozing with confidence after his win over Justin Gatlin in Friday's U.S. world trials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jamaicans, they're fast. They are just about as good as us," Dix told reporters after he pipped Gatlin by a hundredth of a second in Friday's race. "So it will be like competing against us, just more of us."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bolt, former world record holder Asafa Powell, young Yohan Blake and impressive Steve Mullings will line up for Jamaica against the American trio of Dix, Gatlin and former U.S. champion Mike Rodgers in Daegu, South Korea.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Tyson Gay, the world's second fastest man behind Bolt, did not make the U.S. team after withdrawing from the semi-finals with hip problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dix admitted the Americans would have to step up without Gay, but said, "It's not going to be anything different than what happened at this meet. I'm just going to get ready to run faster."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Frank Pingue)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO, June 25 (Reuters) - U.S. bank Goldman Sachs (GS.N)
lacked the standard documents it needed to protect itself in a
series of options trades it made for the Libyan Investment
Authority in 2008, the Wall Street Journal reported on
Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The contracts, which are standard for the industry when
structuring international deals in murky markets such as credit
default swaps, would have defined the exact terms of the
relationship between Goldman and the sovereign wealth fund
controlled by Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, the Journal said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A lack of such contracts, while not illegal, deepened the
crisis between the two parties when the $1.3 billion in
investments lost nearly all their value during the financial
market meltdown in 2008, the paper said. [ID:nL3E7GV0HW]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It was unclear why the contracts were not signed and
Goldman Sachs could not be immediately reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some Libyan officials have said that the fund's managers
did not understand the investments and were not authorized to
approve them, the paper said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman disputed the claims, citing money transfer records
and recorded communications with Libyan officials as evidence
that officials were fully aware of the trades that were being
conducted, it said.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON Jun 27 (Reuters) - Facebook overtook Microsoft
 websites in Britain for the first time last month,
becoming the UK's second-most popular after Google as
people aged over 50 flocked to social networks, online
measurement body UKOM/Nielsen said.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Facebook attracted a record 26.8 million visitors in Britain
in May, up 7 percent year on year, beating the 26.2 million who
visited Microsoft's MSN/WindowsLive/Bing sites combined, the
organisation said on Monday. Google had 33.9 million.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twitter's UK audience jumped by a third to 6.1 million,
after thousands of users retweeted allegations of celebrity
scandals in defiance of gagging orders, including an
extra-marital affair by Manchester United soccer star Ryan
Giggs.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UKOM/Nielsen said the number of women pensioners visiting
the site doubled after "Giggsgate". 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The growth in audiences to these social networks is now
primarily being driven by the 50-plus age group. Just a few
years ago, this group may have found itself out of place on
these sites," UKOM general manager James Smythe said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He said over-50 year-olds accounted for more new adults
visiting Facebook in the last two years than under-50s,
resulting in an age profile far more closely reflecting that of
the UK online population as a whole than previously.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Older age groups were also more likely to visit Twitter than
in the past, but under-18s were less likely to visit the site
than two years ago -- which was not the case for Facebook.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Business network LinkedIn , whose market value has
risen 58 percent to $6.65 billion since its New York stock
market debut last month, registered 3.6 million UK visitors in
May, up 57 percent from a year earlier.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Elsewhere, Facebook attracted 140 million visitors in the
United States, up 12 percent. In Spain its numbers were up 7
percent, in France 18 percent, in Italy 26 percent and in
Germany 72 percent.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Twitter's visitor numbers rose 22 percent in the United
States, 48 percent in France, 58 percent in Italy and more than
doubled in Spain. But in Germany they fell by 11 percent.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UKOM/Nielsen monitored the online behaviour of about 50,000
people in Britain and similar numbers in the other countries.
The panel was recruited both online and offline.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - David Solomon isn't your typical master of the universe, but he might have what it takes to lead Wall Street's most powerful bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 49-year-old co-head of Goldman Sachs' investment banking unit is an unassuming banker who moved into junk bonds early in his career and stayed in underwriting, even as other Wall Street businesses grew hotter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has been promoted into ever-more senior roles, and now works mostly behind the scenes, making sure that investment banking clients get what they need, that employees are happy and that Goldman's deal-making machinery operates smoothly. He has been behind some spectacular deals, even if he is not famous for them, and some clients view him as one of the best bankers in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Goldman insiders believe that his low-key personality may be just the thing for a firm that has spent two years dodging charges of greed, conflicts of interest and fraud. With Goldman having recently named a third "co-head" of investment banking, these insiders believe that Solomon could be elevated to a more prominent position, putting him in the race for the chief executive job one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people see Solomon as being in line for a promotion soon and as a CEO candidate down the line," said a banker who works closely with him. "Clients love him, we love him -- he's actually a really good guy. Competitors don't love him necessarily, but they respect him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street veterans are loath to handicap any race to succeed CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Goldman is swarming with smart and ambitious people eager to run the show, and insiders familiar with Blankfein's thinking say he has no plans to step down any time soon, leaving plenty of time for a race to sort itself out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting a banker like Solomon to CEO would be a departure for Goldman, which has been led by traders in recent years and still earns most of its profit from trading. Less than 10 percent of Goldman's $4.04 billion of pre-tax earnings in the first quarter came from banking activities such as underwriting securities and advising companies on acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But changes to U.S. financial law likely will lower trading profits, and the bank's reputation has been dented by government investigations into its derivatives dealings during the subprime crisis. The steady fees that underwriting and advising can generate look unimpeachable by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than three dozen friends, clients and current and former colleagues described Solomon as a consummate dealmaker who plays well inside and outside the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's very technically capable and he's also really good with clients," says Alan Schwartz, the former CEO of Bear Stearns who is now executive chairman at investment bank Guggenheim Partners. "But what differentiates David from a lot of bankers is he's a great leader and manager. A lot of people are just practitioners, but he knows how to inspire, manage and lead other professionals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon, through a Goldman spokesman, declined to comment. Many sources for this article spoke on condition of anonymity to protect their jobs and business relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CROWDED FIELD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least three other senior Goldman executives could be successors to the 56-year-old Blankfein, who just entered his sixth year as chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Cohn, Goldman's president and chief operating officer, is Blankfein's right-hand man and has long been considered his heir apparent. But Cohn came from the trading side of the business, and his leadership during a time of controversy could be a handicap, insiders say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Senate panel in April released a lengthy report that described Goldman unloading subprime exposure onto unsuspecting clients in 2006 and 2007, among other practices that look unsavory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohn's name appears often in the report, in communications with senior traders. Cohn was not accused of any wrongdoing and Goldman said it disagreed with many of the findings of the report. Government investigations have ensued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Sherwood, a British native who is also thought to be a candidate, took over a powerful position from Cohn in March, as head of the bank's partnership committee. Sherwood was one of the top revenue generators in Goldman's London office. As former co-head of the international division, he also brings valuable overseas experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another potential contender is J. Michael Evans, a vice chairman who oversees Asia and growth markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Evans irked some colleagues last year as co-chairman of an internal committee that analyzed Goldman's missteps during the financial crisis, sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans angled for a more prominent role after the committee's work was done, they said, and other top executives were not pleased with the publicity surrounding him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TURNING ON THE CHARM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon avoids the spotlight. Bald and paunchy, with a gravelly voice and a casual demeanor, he hardly radiates power. Described by friends as a family man close to his wife and two daughters, Salomon lives in an apartment on tony Central Park West in Manhattan, and is not known to flaunt his wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon's candor on a topic of great sensitivity, Wall Street pay, appears to set him apart from some colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The incentive systems have gotten out of whack," the alumnus told Hamilton College students last year. Short-term incentives producing outsize pay have not been productive for the financial system, he said, and need to be "rebalanced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associates who describe Solomon frequently use words like "modest" and "humble," but they also paint him as tenacious, hard-working and shrewd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guggenheim's Schwartz said the two speak often about their personal lives and current events, but avoid talking business because they're too competitive. "We'd kill each other," he joked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Bear Stearns Co-president Warren Spector said in an interview that he was sorry to see Solomon leave the bank for Goldman: "It was their gain and our loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon's sometimes bland exterior masks a savvy negotiator who can turn on his charm as readily as he can pound fists on the table, say coworkers and competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"David has always been a very large presence in meetings and rooms, even when he wasn't maybe the most senior guy in the room," said a former colleague. "But you also wouldn't mind hanging out with David after the meeting's over. That's a pretty unique combination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon entered Wall Street in 1984 armed with a B-plus average and a degree in political science from Hamilton College, a liberal arts school in Clinton, New York, more than 200 miles northwest of lower Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After beginning his career as a commercial paper salesman, he moved into junk bonds and leveraged finance at Salomon Brothers, Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear Stearns. They were hot and scrappy in his day, but today evoke memories of fantastic implosions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein plucked Solomon away from Bear Stearns in 1999 and gave him the coveted title of partner. He climbed the management ladder fast at a bank that typically promotes people at a glacial pace, and in 2006 -- soon after Blankfein became CEO -- was tapped as a co-head of investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients describe Solomon as one of a handful of top Wall Street bankers who can deliver what they need in a crunch -- whether that means funding, connections or advice on the wisdom of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clients feel he's a smart guy who's going to be very responsive to their needs," said Ted Virtue, chief executive of private-equity firm MidOcean Partners, who hired Solomon at Drexel and occasionally consults with him on deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon has the pull of Jimmy Lee, a vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase  Co who made his mark selling buyout loans, Virtue said. "Those are guys people like to know, who can speak for their organization," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Solomon was recently spotted having lunch at the Four Seasons Restaurant in midtown Manhattan in a room full of Wall Street heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee was chatting nearby with billionaire Home Depot founder Ken Langone. At another table sat prominent financiers Steve Rattner and Damon Mezzacappa, both of whom were once top executives at Lazard Ltd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon was dining with Glenn Hutchins, a co-founder of the private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners, who is a longtime friend and occasional client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 10 days before their get-together on May 19, Hutchins announced the biggest deal in his firm's history: Microsoft Corp's $8.5 billion acquisition of Internet telephone service provider Skype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the deal closes, Silver Lake will book a $2 billion profit and 209 percent return on its investment in less than two years. Goldman will have reaped an estimated $30 million in fees from advising on the two transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANKING REBOUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across Wall Street, traders have long fought for the upper hand against bankers, and at Goldman, traders have been on top for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Blankfein, a former commodities salesman, took the reins five years ago, Goldman's trading desks were booming, fueling 72.8 percent of profit. But regulatory reform is trimming trading results across Wall Street. Profit from the businesses fell 60.6 percent at Goldman in 2010, and continued to fall in this year's first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking is small in comparison, but it's growing -- fees were up 7 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Going forward, trading will be a sparse area to raise vegetables," said Jacob H.

&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; TURNING ON THE CHARM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Solomon avoids the spotlight. Bald and paunchy, with a
gravelly voice and a casual demeanor, he hardly radiates power.
Described by friends as a family man close to his wife and two
daughters, Salomon lives in an apartment on tony Central Park
West in Manhattan, and is not known to flaunt his wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Solomon's candor on a topic of great sensitivity, Wall
Street pay, appears to set him apart from some colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The incentive systems have gotten out of whack," the
alumnus told Hamilton College students last year. Short-term
incentives producing outsize pay have not been productive for
the financial system,  he said, and need to be "rebalanced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Associates who describe Solomon frequently use words like
"modest" and "humble," but they also paint him as tenacious,
hard-working and shrewd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guggenheim's Schwartz said the two speak often about their
personal lives and current events, but avoid talking business
because they're too competitive. "We'd kill each other," he
joked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former Bear Stearns Co-president Warren Spector said in an
interview that he was sorry to see Solomon leave the bank for
Goldman: "It was their gain and our loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Solomon's sometimes bland exterior masks a savvy negotiator
who can turn on his charm as readily as he can pound fists on
the table, say coworkers and competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "David has always been a very large presence in meetings
and rooms, even when he wasn't maybe the most senior guy in the
room," said a former colleague. "But you also wouldn't mind
hanging out with David after the meeting's over. That's a
pretty unique combination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Solomon entered Wall Street in 1984 armed with a B-plus
average and a degree in political science from Hamilton
College, a liberal arts school in Clinton, New York, more than
200 miles northwest of lower Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After beginning his career as a commercial paper salesman,
he moved into junk bonds and leveraged finance at Salomon
Brothers, Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear Stearns. They were
hot and scrappy in his day, but today evoke memories of
fantastic implosions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein plucked Solomon away from Bear Stearns in 1999
and gave him the coveted title of partner. He climbed the
management ladder fast at a bank that typically promotes people
at a glacial pace, and in 2006 -- soon after Blankfein became
CEO -- was tapped as a co-head of investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clients describe Solomon as one of a handful of top Wall
Street bankers who can deliver what they need in a crunch --
whether that means funding, connections or advice on the wisdom
of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Clients feel he's a smart guy who's going to be very
responsive to their needs," said Ted Virtue, chief executive of
private-equity firm MidOcean Partners, who hired Solomon at
Drexel and occasionally consults with him on deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Solomon has the pull of Jimmy Lee, a vice chairman of
JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) who made his mark selling buyout
loans, Virtue said. "Those are guys people like to know, who
can speak for their organization," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indeed, Solomon was recently spotted having lunch at the
Four Seasons Restaurant in midtown Manhattan in a room full of
Wall Street heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Lee was chatting nearby with billionaire Home Depot (HD.N)
founder Ken Langone. At another table sat prominent financiers
Steve Rattner and Damon Mezzacappa, both of whom were once top
executives at Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Solomon was dining with Glenn Hutchins, a co-founder of the
private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners [SILAK.UL], who is a
longtime friend and occasional client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Just 10 days before their get-together on May 19, Hutchins
announced the biggest deal in his firm's history: Microsoft
Corp's (MSFT.O) $8.5 billion acquisition of Internet telephone
service provider Skype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Once the deal closes, Silver Lake will book a $2 billion
profit and 209 percent return on its investment in less than
two years. Goldman will have reaped an estimated $30 million in
fees from advising on the two transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANKING REBOUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Across Wall Street, traders have long fought for the upper
hand against bankers, and at Goldman, traders have been on top
for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When Blankfein, a former commodities salesman, took the
reins five years ago, Goldman's trading desks were booming,
fueling 72.8 percent of profit. But regulatory reform is
trimming trading results across Wall Street. Profit from the
businesses fell 60.6 percent at Goldman in 2010, and continued
to fall in this year's first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Investment banking is small in comparison, but it's growing
-- fees were up 7 percent in the first quarter from a year
earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Going forward, trading will be a sparse area to raise
vegetables," said Jacob H. Schiff, chair in investment banking
emeritus, at the Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman has frequently had an investment banker in one of
its top management seats Schiff said, and it would be logical
to put one in place again. That's partly because bankers do not
just structure and execute deals; they also generate trading
business through client relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This may put Solomon in a favorable position, according to
some insiders. His businesses have generated solid, steady fees
for the company, not the erratic swings in profits and losses
that traders often produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, some think that if Goldman is trying to hearken back
to the days of aloof, white-shoe investment bankers, Solomon
may not be the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The only negative I see for David -- whom I like and
admire and find very smart and a very good banker -- is that he
is just a mongrel," said William Cohan, who knows Solomon from
writing books about Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs. "He's not a
thoroughbred from Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Then again, Solomon is not the only Goldman executive to
have skipped the Ivy League, or to have worked at other firms.
The bank prides itself on being a meritocracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein, the son of a post-office worker, started at the
commodities firm J. Aron  Co, which Goldman bought. Cohn went
to American University in Washington, D.C. Sidney Weinberg,
Goldman's most powerful and longest serving CEO, started as a
janitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Still, Cohan predicts that Blankfein won't step down for
another five years and that his successor will be a banker
"whose name we don't yet know."

&lt;p&gt;  
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Could begin producing 50,000 bpd in Sept. 2012&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says Venezuela taxes could affect future investments&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Daniel Wallis&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CARACAS, June 26 (Reuters) - Chevron (CVX.N) could begin
pumping 50,000 barrels per day from Venezuela's huge Orinoco
extra heavy crude belt next year but needs investment in the
project, an executive said in remarks published on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ali Moshiri, Chevron's president of exploration in Africa
and Latin America, added that a move to hike taxes on some
windfall oil income in Venezuela could affect the company's
future investment decisions in the country, which is South
America's biggest oil exporter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. major has a 34 percent stake in Orinoco's Carabobo
Project 3, which has estimated reserves of 66 billion barrels.
Venezuelan state oil company PDVSA holds 60 percent, while
Venezuelan and Japanese companies split the rest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; President Hugo Chavez's government is pinning its hopes for
revitalizing its crucial oil sector on a string of ambitious
development projects in the region, seen as one of the largest
mostly untapped hydrocarbon reserves left in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is possible there could be production next year. We
will have output of 50,000 bpd from Carabobo in September
2012," Moshiri told Venezuela's El Universal newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Technically we're ready, but there needs to be investment.
There has to be immediate investment, or we could wait until
next month because we can accelerate the activity. But we need
to have a decision on this," he said in the interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Moshiri said he was visiting Caracas for discussions with
the OPEC member's energy minister, Rafael Ramirez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think we have the technology and human resources, like
PDVSA, to work together and begin this project," Moshiri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "TIME TO DECIDE"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carabobo 3 is one of several Orinoco projects slated
eventually to add 2.1 million bpd of new production and bring
the country some $80 billion in investment.  For a factbox on
Venezuela's Orinoco belt developments: [ID:nN11230969]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The two Japanese companies with minority stakes in Carabobo
3 are Mitsubishi Corp (8058.T) and Inpex (1605.T).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "PDVSA is very strong and has sufficient financing, and
there are good relations between PDVSA and Chevron. Now is the
time to take the decision about how we are going to do this.
That is the only thing that is missing," Moshiri said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramirez told Reuters on Thursday that Chinese and Italian
banks were expected to provide new loans totaling $5.5 billion
this year to develop joint ventures in the region, and that
some early production could begin in 2011. [ID:nN1E75N0CY]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, the Chavez government boosted tax rates on some
windfall oil income, and Moshiri said that might have an impact
on how the industry viewed Venezuelan projects in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The positive aspect is that the government receives the
tax. The negative could be on how future projects in Venezuela
-- not the current ones -- are perceived," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are not going to quit the projects or current plans
just because the tax was increased. But in the future, when we
want to make a decision on Venezuela, we will consider this tax
and see if it is competitive or not with other developments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ramirez has said the higher tax rates will not apply to new
crude output by joint ventures between private firms and PDVSA
until they have recovered their investments. [ID:nN25223989]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The new tax doesn't refer to new projects, and that gives
us a certain area for discussion," Moshiri said. "But we need
to talk about the government's expectations regarding the
return of our investment. This should be discussed."

He climbed the management ladder fast at a bank that typically promotes people at a glacial pace, and in 2006 -- soon after Blankfein became CEO -- was tapped as a co-head of investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients describe Solomon as one of a handful of top Wall Street bankers who can deliver what they need in a crunch -- whether that means funding, connections or advice on the wisdom of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clients feel he's a smart guy who's going to be very responsive to their needs," said Ted Virtue, chief executive of private-equity firm MidOcean Partners, who hired Solomon at Drexel and occasionally consults with him on deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon has the pull of Jimmy Lee, a vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) who made his mark selling buyout loans, Virtue said. "Those are guys people like to know, who can speak for their organization," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Solomon was recently spotted having lunch at the Four Seasons Restaurant in midtown Manhattan in a room full of Wall Street heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee was chatting nearby with billionaire Home Depot (HD.N) founder Ken Langone. At another table sat prominent financiers Steve Rattner and Damon Mezzacappa, both of whom were once top executives at Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon was dining with Glenn Hutchins, a co-founder of the private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners SILAK.UL, who is a longtime friend and occasional client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 10 days before their get-together on May 19, Hutchins announced the biggest deal in his firm's history: Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $8.5 billion acquisition of Internet telephone service provider Skype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the deal closes, Silver Lake will book a $2 billion profit and 209 percent return on its investment in less than two years. Goldman will have reaped an estimated $30 million in fees from advising on the two transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANKING REBOUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across Wall Street, traders have long fought for the upper hand against bankers, and at Goldman, traders have been on top for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Blankfein, a former commodities salesman, took the reins five years ago, Goldman's trading desks were booming, fueling 72.8 percent of profit. But regulatory reform is trimming trading results across Wall Street. Profit from the businesses fell 60.6 percent at Goldman in 2010, and continued to fall in this year's first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking is small in comparison, but it's growing -- fees were up 7 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Going forward, trading will be a sparse area to raise vegetables," said Samuel Hayes, the Jacob H. Schiff chair in investment banking emeritus, at the Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has frequently had an investment banker in one of its top management seats, Hayes said, and it would be logical to put one in place again. That's partly because bankers do not just structure and execute deals; they also generate trading business through client relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may put Solomon in a favorable position, according to some insiders. His businesses have generated solid, steady fees for the company, not the erratic swings in profits and losses that traders often produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, some think that if Goldman is trying to hearken back to the days of aloof, white-shoe investment bankers, Solomon may not be the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only negative I see for David -- whom I like and admire and find very smart and a very good banker -- is that he is just a mongrel," said William Cohan, who knows Solomon from writing books about Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs. "He's not a thoroughbred from Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then again, Solomon is not the only Goldman executive to have skipped the Ivy League, or to have worked at other firms. The bank prides itself on being a meritocracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, the son of a post-office worker, started at the commodities firm J. Aron  Co, which Goldman bought. Cohn went to American University in Washington, D.C. Sidney Weinberg, Goldman's most powerful and longest serving CEO, started as a janitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Cohan predicts that Blankfein won't step down for another five years and that his successor will be a banker "whose name we don't yet know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; editing by Knut Engelmann, Dan Wilchins and Robert MacMillan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(In June 26 story, corrects name of professor in paragraphs 42 and 43 to Samuel Hayes from Jacob H.

      Fitch Affirms IBM's IDR at 'A+/F1'; Outlook Stable
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has affirmed the ratings of International Business 
      Machines Corporation (IBM) and IBM International Group Capital LLC 
      (IIGC), an indirect, wholly owned subsidiary whose debt is fully and 
      unconditionally guaranteed by IBM, as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured revolving credit facility (RCF) at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR at 'F1';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Commercial paper (CP) rating at 'F1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IIGC
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-term IDR at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior unsecured debt at 'A+';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Short-term IDR at 'F1';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --CP rating at 'F1'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable. Fitch's action affects approximately $40 
      billion of debt, including the company's undrawn $10 billion credit 
      facility.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ratings and Outlook reflect IBM's:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Strong company profile primarily supported by i) significant revenue 
      market share in information technology (IT) services (#1), servers (#1), 
      enterprise software (#1) and external storage (#2); ii) Solid recurring 
      revenue (50%) from IT services, software and financing that mitigates 
      revenue and profit volatility; and iii) Highly diversified revenue base 
      by offering, customer, industry and geography (60%+ revenue outside 
      U.S.).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Exceptional financial flexibility due to i) robust internal liquidity 
      supported by a significant cash position ($13 billion) and ample annual 
      free cash flow (FCF) in excess of $11 billion since 2008; ii) solid 
      external liquidity supported by an undrawn $10 billion RCF maturing in 
      2012, which includes a highly diverse group of lenders, and ready access 
      to capital markets; iii) strong credit protection metrics, with total 
      and core (non-financing) leverage (debt/ operating EBITDA) of 1.2 times 
      (x) and 0.3x, respectively, as of March 31, 2011; and iv) roughly $25 
      billion of finance receivables, with 58% short-term and 65% considered 
      investment grade.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Well executed management strategy, including i) ability to identify 
      early trends that present significant higher margin, long-term growth 
      opportunities and reposition investment priorities, both organic and 
      inorganic, to capitalize on these opportunities (i.e. analytics and 
      growth markets); ii) consistent and sizable investments in RD (6% of 
      revenue) to develop innovative differentiated solutions that leverage 
      IBM's entire portfolio of offerings and command higher profit margins 
      (i.e. Smarter Planet); iii) core competency in identifying and 
      integrating strategic acquisitions and iv) established track record of 
      consistently meeting or exceeding financial forecasts.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ratings concerns include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Risk of core debt (non-financing) increases to achieve financial 
      and/or business objectives, such as sizable debt-financed share 
      repurchases and/or acquisitions, resulting in a material reduction of 
      credit protection measures;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Consistent, material increases in cash dividends long-term, which 
      could pressure free cash flow and financial flexibility in the absence 
      of commensurate growth in profitability, thereby necessitating further 
      increases in core debt to fund acquisitions and/or share repurchases.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Long-term outlook for mainframe demand (system z) and associated 
      operating system software (zOS) as industry standard servers become 
      increasingly capable, which could potentially narrow the cost (i.e. 
      total cost of ownership) and benefit differential to mainframes.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In addition, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and European 
      Commission are currently investigating possible antitrust violations by 
      IBM primarily relating to the tying of its zOS software to mainframe 
      hardware following complaints from several competitors, several of which 
      are backed by Microsoft. In the event of an adverse ruling, sales of 
      IBM's high margin mainframe could potentially decline.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM has exceptional financial flexibility supported by $13.2 billion of 
      cash and equivalents as of March 31, 2011 and an undrawn $10 billion RCF 
      expiring on June 28, 2012. Liquidity is further supported by strong and 
      consistent FCF (post-dividends) of $10.7 billion in the latest 12 months 
      (LTM) ended March 31, 2011. Fitch expects uses of FCF will continue to 
      center on share repurchases, acquisitions, primarily software and 
      services, and increasing cash dividends to shareholders.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch projects IBM's FCF will increase to nearly $12 billion in 2011 
      primarily due to continued profit margin expansion, reflecting a more 
      favorable revenue mix, continued cost discipline and top-line growth led 
      by Smarter Planet solutions, business analytics, growth markets and 
      opportunities in cloud computing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The underfunded status of IBM's worldwide defined benefit (DB) pension 
      plans modestly improved to negative $7.9 billion (92% funded) at 
      year-end 2010 from negative $8.1 billion (91% funded) in 2009 due to a 
      second consecutive year of double-digit returns of 12% on pension 
      assets. However, discount rate declines in several countries increased 
      IBM's pension liability (U.S. discount rate declined 60 basis points to 
      5.0%), partially offsetting the strong asset returns.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Excluding unfunded nonqualified DB pension plans, the funded status of 
      IBM's U.S. and worldwide plans at year-end 2010 remained flat at 101% 
      and 99%, respectively. In 2011, IBM is legally mandated to contribute a 
      minimum of $900 million to its international DB plans only compared with 
      the $800 million contributed in 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch believes the company has more than ample liquidity to satisfy its 
      longer-term legally mandated pension funding requirements, estimated at 
      approximately $3.9 billion through 2015. This estimate could increase 
      due to more frequent remeasurement of funded status in certain non-U.S. 
      countries and the performance of financial markets.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total debt was $30.3 billion as of March 31, 2011, consisting of $8.5 
      billion of short-term debt, including $3.3 billion of CP, and $21.7 
      billion of long-term debt. Fitch estimates $23.7 billion, or 78%, of 
      total debt is attributable to IBM's global financing business with the 
      remaining debt attributable to core (non-financing) operations.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      For the purpose of financial evaluation, Fitch analyzes IBM's core 
      business and financing activities separately since they are capitalized 
      differently and have dissimilar cash flow characteristics. IBM Global 
      Finance (IGF) contributed nearly 10% to IBM's pre-tax earnings in 2010, 
      but constituted the largest component of IBM's balance sheet, 
      representing approximately 22% of total assets and 26% of total 
      liabilities as of March 31, 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM has approximately $3 billion of debt maturing in the remainder of 
      2010 and $4 billion in 2012. Fitch believes IBM will refinance the vast 
      majority of the upcoming debt maturities in order to maintain a targeted 
      debt/equity ratio of approximately 7x for the financing business and 
      maintain a permanent amount of core debt in the capital structure.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      IBM's total credit protection measures were relatively flat as of March 
      31, 2011 compared to the prior year. Revenue growth of 4.9% and a 
      40-basis point improvement in EBITDA margin nearly offset a 15% increase 
      in total debt to $30.3 billion, which resulted in a 60% increase in core 
      debt to $6.5 billion. Fitch notes core debt has fluctuated between $2.5 
      billion and $11.8 billion since IBM added a permanent amount of core 
      debt to the capital structure in the second quarter of 2007.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Total leverage was 1.2x at March 31, 2011 versus from 1.1x in the prior 
      year. However, total interest coverage did improve to 27x from 24x. In 
      the past year, core leverage (core debt/core EBITDA) modestly increased 
      to 0.3x from 0.2x and core interest coverage declined to 62x for the LTM 
      ended March 31, 2011 from 65x in the same period last year.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The main purpose of IGF is to facilitate clients' acquisition of IBM 
      systems, software and services by providing financial and capital 
      management solutions. IGF has a solid long-term operating record, 
      provides strategic advantages to IBM in terms of attracting and 
      retaining customers by delivering total solutions, and generates an 
      annuity-like revenue stream associated with multi-year leases. IGF's 
      primary focus on IBM's products and clients mitigates some risks 
      associated with financing via a deep knowledge of its client base and 
      clear insight into the solutions being financed. Asset quality metrics 
      have remained relatively solid due to a relatively conservative 
      underwriting culture and strong risk management capabilities. IGF's 
      capitalization remains solid for the rating category and leverage levels 
      continue to hover near management's target of 7x.

&lt;p&gt; * Reporting to Jeff Hogan, head of Western Region IB&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Nadia Damouni&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, June 27 (Reuters) - Morgan Stanley (MS.N) has
added two JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) industrial bankers to

situation said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Rick Polhemus and Mike Groeninger will join as managing

recent months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In May, JPMorgan lost two bankers within the technology
team at JPMorgan: Mark Solomons joined Morgan Stanley's
technology group based in Menlo Park, California, and Akhil
Ahuja, based in San Francisco, moved to Wells Fargo  Co
(WFC.N) affiliate Wells Fargo Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That same month, the bank hired the former head of
technology mergers and acquisitions at Barclays Plc's Barclays
Capital, Drago Rajkovic, who will join in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this year, Faisal Chughtai and Sarah Anderson
joined the firm's Internet and digital media group from Royal
Bank of Canada's (RY.TO) RBC Capital Markets. They are both
based in San Francisco.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Shares of Icagen Inc ICGN.O more than doubled on Monday to a year high as investors cheered the possibility of the biotech firm inking a deal with Pfizer Inc (PFE.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, Pfizer said it was considering a strategic transaction with the company in which the world's largest drugmaker already holds a stake.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement released late on Friday, Icagen also said it was engaged in early talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think an acquisition is very reasonable... a deal value of around $100 million is a possibility," McNicoll, Lewis  Vlak analyst Christopher James said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icagen has a market capitalization of $18 million, according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company has a pain drug collaboration with Pfizer, and James said the drug holds potential to bring in over a billion dollars in sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Picking up an early stage drug that can fetch a billion dollars for hundred million dollars makes perfect sense for Pfizer," James added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Icagen also has an epilepsy drug, which was put on clinical hold due to an adverse event, but the hold was lifted earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;About 3 million Americans have epilepsy, a brain disorder that causes seizures. But an estimated 30 percent of patients do not find adequate relief with current drugs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of the company were up 129 percent at $5.48 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq. They touched a high of $5.75 earlier in the session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Esha Dey in Bangalore; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  POINT ROBERTS, WA, Jun 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Investorideas.com, an investor research portal covering leading sectors
including biotech and pharma stocks, features a sector snapshot of
biotech/pharma stocks in the sexual dysfunction and sexual health
markets. 

    The competition is heating up in the men's sexual dysfunction market for
Pfizer 's Viagra but there is only one Biotech/Pharma company postured to
be first to market in the women's sexual health market, BioSante
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ: BPAX), with LibiGel, a testosterone gel in
late-stage Phase III clinical development for the treatment of women who
suffer from female sexual dysfunction (FSD).

    There is a lot of money on the table in the men's erectile dysfunction
market, with Viagra generating revenues of $1.93 billion for Pfizer in
2010. Pfizer Inc is battling it out in court with Teva Pharmaceutical and
Watson Pharmaceuticals for generic versions of Viagra. Teva has announced
it plans to make generic versions of Viagra in 2012, when the basic
Pfizer patent expires. More info

Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: BPAX), recently commented in an

products to treat women's sexual health is well over $1 billion in the
U.S. alone. We also believe that LibiGel will be the first product
approved for the treatment of menopausal women in this indication. Being
first to market will result in gaining the majority of the available
market."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - David Solomon isn't your typical master of the universe, but he might have what it takes to lead Wall Street's most powerful bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 49-year-old co-head of Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) investment banking unit is an unassuming banker who moved into junk bonds early in his career and stayed in underwriting, even as other Wall Street businesses grew hotter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He has been promoted into ever-more senior roles, and now works mostly behind the scenes, making sure that investment banking clients get what they need, that employees are happy and that Goldman's deal-making machinery operates smoothly. He has been behind some spectacular deals, even if he is not famous for them, and some clients view him as one of the best bankers in the business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Goldman insiders believe that his low-key personality may be just the thing for a firm that has spent two years dodging charges of greed, conflicts of interest and fraud. With Goldman having recently named a third "co-head" of investment banking, these insiders believe that Solomon could be elevated to a more prominent position, putting him in the race for the chief executive job one day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most people see Solomon as being in line for a promotion soon and as a CEO candidate down the line," said a banker who works closely with him. "Clients love him, we love him -- he's actually a really good guy. Competitors don't love him necessarily, but they respect him."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street veterans are loath to handicap any race to succeed CEO Lloyd Blankfein. Goldman is swarming with smart and ambitious people eager to run the show, and insiders familiar with Blankfein's thinking say he has no plans to step down any time soon, leaving plenty of time for a race to sort itself out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Promoting a banker like Solomon to CEO would be a departure for Goldman, which has been led by traders in recent years and still earns most of its profit from trading. Less than 10 percent of Goldman's $4.04 billion of pre-tax earnings in the first quarter came from banking activities such as underwriting securities and advising companies on acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But changes to U.S. financial law likely will lower trading profits, and the bank's reputation has been dented by government investigations into its derivatives dealings during the subprime crisis. The steady fees that underwriting and advising can generate look unimpeachable by comparison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than three dozen friends, clients and current and former colleagues described Solomon as a consummate dealmaker who plays well inside and outside the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's very technically capable and he's also really good with clients," says Alan Schwartz, the former CEO of Bear Stearns who is now executive chairman at investment bank Guggenheim Partners. "But what differentiates David from a lot of bankers is he's a great leader and manager. A lot of people are just practitioners, but he knows how to inspire, manage and lead other professionals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon, through a Goldman spokesman, declined to comment. Many sources for this article spoke on condition of anonymity to protect their jobs and business relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A CROWDED FIELD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At least three other senior Goldman executives could be successors to the 56-year-old Blankfein, who just entered his sixth year as chief executive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gary Cohn, Goldman's president and chief operating officer, is Blankfein's right-hand man and has long been considered his heir apparent. But Cohn came from the trading side of the business, and his leadership during a time of controversy could be a handicap, insiders say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Senate panel in April released a lengthy report that described Goldman unloading subprime exposure onto unsuspecting clients in 2006 and 2007, among other practices that look unsavory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cohn's name appears often in the report, in communications with senior traders. Cohn was not accused of any wrongdoing and Goldman said it disagreed with many of the findings of the report. Government investigations have ensued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Michael Sherwood, a British native who is also thought to be a candidate, took over a powerful position from Cohn in March, as head of the bank's partnership committee. Sherwood was one of the top revenue generators in Goldman's London office. As co-head of the international division, he also brings valuable overseas experience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet another potential contender is J. Michael Evans, a vice chairman who oversees Asia and growth markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Evans irked some colleagues last year as co-chairman of an internal committee that analyzed Goldman's missteps during the financial crisis, sources familiar with the matter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Evans angled for a more prominent role after the committee's work was done, they said, and other top executives were not pleased with the publicity surrounding him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TURNING ON THE CHARM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon avoids the spotlight. Bald and paunchy, with a gravelly voice and a casual demeanor, he hardly radiates power. Described by friends as a family man close to his wife and two daughters, Salomon lives in an apartment on tony Central Park West in Manhattan, and is not known to flaunt his wealth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon's candor on a topic of great sensitivity, Wall Street pay, appears to set him apart from some colleagues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The incentive systems have gotten out of whack," the alumnus told Hamilton College students last year. Short-term incentives producing outsize pay have not been productive for the financial system, he said, and need to be "rebalanced."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Associates who describe Solomon frequently use words like "modest" and "humble," but they also paint him as tenacious, hard-working and shrewd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guggenheim's Schwartz said the two speak often about their personal lives and current events, but avoid talking business because they're too competitive. "We'd kill each other," he joked.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Bear Stearns Co-president Warren Spector said in an interview that he was sorry to see Solomon leave the bank for Goldman: "It was their gain and our loss."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon's sometimes bland exterior masks a savvy negotiator who can turn on his charm as readily as he can pound fists on the table, say coworkers and competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"David has always been a very large presence in meetings and rooms, even when he wasn't maybe the most senior guy in the room," said a former colleague. "But you also wouldn't mind hanging out with David after the meeting's over. That's a pretty unique combination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon entered Wall Street in 1984 armed with a B-plus average and a degree in political science from Hamilton College, a liberal arts school in Clinton, New York, more than 200 miles northwest of lower Manhattan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After beginning his career as a commercial paper salesman, he moved into junk bonds and leveraged finance at Salomon Brothers, Drexel Burnham Lambert and Bear Stearns. They were hot and scrappy in his day, but today evoke memories of fantastic implosions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein plucked Solomon away from Bear Stearns in 1999 and gave him the coveted title of partner. He climbed the management ladder fast at a bank that typically promotes people at a glacial pace, and in 2006 -- soon after Blankfein became CEO -- was tapped as a co-head of investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Clients describe Solomon as one of a handful of top Wall Street bankers who can deliver what they need in a crunch -- whether that means funding, connections or advice on the wisdom of a deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Clients feel he's a smart guy who's going to be very responsive to their needs," said Ted Virtue, chief executive of private-equity firm MidOcean Partners, who hired Solomon at Drexel and occasionally consults with him on deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon has the pull of Jimmy Lee, a vice chairman of JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) who made his mark selling buyout loans, Virtue said. "Those are guys people like to know, who can speak for their organization," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, Solomon was recently spotted having lunch at the Four Seasons Restaurant in midtown Manhattan in a room full of Wall Street heavyweights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lee was chatting nearby with billionaire Home Depot (HD.N) founder Ken Langone. At another table sat prominent financiers Steve Rattner and Damon Mezzacappa, both of whom were once top executives at Lazard Ltd (LAZ.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Solomon was dining with Glenn Hutchins, a co-founder of the private-equity firm Silver Lake Partners SILAK.UL, who is a longtime friend and occasional client.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just 10 days before their get-together on May 19, Hutchins announced the biggest deal in his firm's history: Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) $8.5 billion acquisition of Internet telephone service provider Skype.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once the deal closes, Silver Lake will book a $2 billion profit and 209 percent return on its investment in less than two years. Goldman will have reaped an estimated $30 million in fees from advising on the two transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BANKING REBOUND&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Across Wall Street, traders have long fought for the upper hand against bankers, and at Goldman, traders have been on top for years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When Blankfein, a former commodities salesman, took the reins five years ago, Goldman's trading desks were booming, fueling 72.8 percent of profit. But regulatory reform is trimming trading results across Wall Street. Profit from the businesses fell 60.6 percent at Goldman in 2010, and continued to fall in this year's first quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Investment banking is small in comparison, but it's growing -- fees were up 7 percent in the first quarter from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Going forward, trading will be a sparse area to raise vegetables," said Jacob H. Schiff, chair in investment banking emeritus, at the Harvard Business School.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has frequently had an investment banker in one of its top management seats Schiff said, and it would be logical to put one in place again. That's partly because bankers do not just structure and execute deals; they also generate trading business through client relationships.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This may put Solomon in a favorable position, according to some insiders. His businesses have generated solid, steady fees for the company, not the erratic swings in profits and losses that traders often produce.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, some think that if Goldman is trying to hearken back to the days of aloof, white-shoe investment bankers, Solomon may not be the best choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The only negative I see for David -- whom I like and admire and find very smart and a very good banker -- is that he is just a mongrel," said William Cohan, who knows Solomon from writing books about Bear Stearns and Goldman Sachs. "He's not a thoroughbred from Goldman Sachs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Then again, Solomon is not the only Goldman executive to have skipped the Ivy League, or to have worked at other firms. The bank prides itself on being a meritocracy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein, the son of a post-office worker, started at the commodities firm J. Aron  Co, which Goldman bought. Cohn went to American University in Washington, D.C. Sidney Weinberg, Goldman's most powerful and longest serving CEO, started as a janitor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Still, Cohan predicts that Blankfein won't step down for another five years and that his successor will be a banker "whose name we don't yet know."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(This story corrects Sherwood's title by removing the word "former" in paragraph 16)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; editing by Knut Engelmann, Dan Wilchins and Robert MacMillan)&lt;/p&gt;

			Aruba MOVE Architecture Enables Wire-Like Performance for Microsoft 
      Lync Server 2010 Delivered Over Wi-Fi
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Tests show Aruba Wi-Fi provides up to 75 percent better performance 
      for Lync Server 2010 when compared to equivalent Cisco Wi-Fi; YES Prep 
      schools of Houston reduces cost and time required to bring new schools 
      online by 90 percent using Aruba and Lync Server 2010
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aruba Networks, Inc. (NASDAQ:ARUN) today announced that its Mobile 
      Virtual Enterprise (MOVE) architecture for Wi-Fi networking enables 
      wire-like performance of Microsoft Lync Server 2010, with tests showing 
      up to 75 percent better performance for Microsoft Lync Server 2010 
      delivered over an Aruba network when compared to an equivalent Cisco 
      Wi-Fi network. The degree of improvement was calculated from mean 
      opinion scores (MOS) after rigorous testing by Aruba and Microsoft, 
      using Microsoft testing and evaluation criteria.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aruba has also been named a Microsoft
			Network Infrastructure 
      Optimization Partner. To ensure that end-users experience high audio and 
      video quality with Microsoft Lync, Microsoft has collaborated with 
      several network infrastructure vendors, including Aruba, to provide 
      prescriptive guidance on the networking requirements for Lync. Focused 
      on the needs of networking and IT Professionals, Network Infrastructure 
      Optimization partners provide documentation, services and support for 
      companies to optimize their enterprise networks for real-time audio, 
      video and collaboration with Lync.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Aruba MOVE architecture has also been certified as interoperable 
      with Lync Server 2010, through the ArubaEdge Partner Program. "The 
      performance testing and associated solution guide for the Aruba wireless 
      infrastructure with Lync Server 2010 will help make it faster and easier 
      for integrators to deploy a combined system,"&#160;said Kapil Sharma, 
      principal group program manager of Lync Partner Engineering at Microsoft.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      YES Prep Public Schools, a free, open-enrollment public school system 
      that serves 4,200 students across&#160;eight locations in the Houston area, 
      needed an access network that would ensure high performance of Lync 
      Server 2010. The collaboration suite is used by teachers and staff at 
      all eight YES Prep schools, as well as its headquarters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "No one here has a desk phone, period," said Troy Neal, director of 
      information technology at YES Prep. "With the discounts that Microsoft 
      gives K-12 on Microsoft Lync 2010, the quality with which it performs 
      over the Aruba access network, and the cost savings associated with 
      deploying Lync instead of traditional PBX&#8217;s, every K-12 school in the 
      country should be doing this. We went from it taking six to nine months 
      and $40,000 to $60,000 dollars to get a school up and running with a 
      voice PBX to two or three weeks at between $300 and $3,000 dollars per 
      site. As for the video and voice quality over the Aruba wireless 
      network, let&#8217;s just say no one can tell it&#8217;s wireless, and that pretty 
      much says it all."
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Gartner Research forecasts that growth of PC softphones, mobile 
      softphones and IP-enabled wireless telephones will outstrip that of 
      wired IP phones in the business telephone market from 2011 to 2015; TDM 
      wireless telephones and both analog and digital telephones are in 
      decline.* The rapid adoption of softphones and wireless phones that 
      serve as the foundation of unified communications solutions makes the 
      availability of a highly-secure and context-aware wireless network a 
      practical necessity.

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Jun 27 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SOA Software, a leading SOA and Cloud Services Governance provider, today
announced it has achieved a Gold Independent Software Vendor
(ISV)/Software Competency in the Microsoft Partner Network. To earn a
Microsoft Gold Competency, organizations must complete a rigorous set of
tests to prove their level of technology integration, have the right
number of Microsoft Certified Professionals, submit customer references
and demonstrate their commitment to customer satisfaction by
participating in an annual survey.

    Organizations accredited with the Gold Partner status are among an elite
group of companies that have proven to be experts in providing customers
with quality solutions. As a trusted Microsoft Gold Partner, SOA Software
will receive enhanced support from Microsoft and gain access to a
multitude of partner-exclusive resources. 

    "We are thrilled to have achieved this level in the Microsoft Partner
Network," said Roberto Medrano, Executive VP, SOA Software. "Our
commitment to helping our clients find success with SOA Governance on the
Microsoft platform is well matched by Microsoft's drive to make their
solutions connected and interoperable. It's a partnership for mutual
success."

    SOA Software's products, including Service Manager for Microsoft BizTalk,
provide Unified SOA Governance Automation for Microsoft's Enterprise SOA
technologies. This allows customers to use Microsoft products with
confidence as part of a heterogeneous enterprise SOA environment,
ensuring that services they identify, design and build using .NET and
Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) are relevant to and consumable by
applications they design, build and deploy using other platforms. SOA
Software products make services exposed on applications running on .NET
and WCF visible to and compliant with enterprise policies defined,
enforced and audited across other platforms. Alternatively, they make
services from other platforms, such as SAP and open source environments,
visible to and compliant with enterprise policies defined, enforced and
audited across .NET and WCF applications. For more information about SOA
Software integration with Microsoft Products, see www.soa.com/microsoft 

    The Microsoft Gold Competency signifies to the market that a company has
demonstrated the highest level of skill and achievement within a given
technology specialization. All 28 Microsoft competencies are designed to
help differentiate a partner's specific technology capabilities, helping
customers find solution providers quickly and easily. Each competency has
a unique set of requirements and benefits, formulated to accurately
represent the specific skills and services that partners bring to the
industry. 

    "The Microsoft Partner Network is designed to empower solution providers
to succeed in today's business environment. By achieving the prestigious
Gold competency, participating companies are provided with a rich set of
benefits, including increased customer visibility through branding and
accessibility, training and support," said Jon Roskill, Corporate Vice
President, Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. "We are proud to
put forth a program that provides the right resources to help a company
develop the expertise customers demand in today's competitive market and
also provides the community and infrastructure that can connect them to
one another, lowering costs for all parties." 

    The Microsoft Partner Network is designed to equip organizations that
deliver products and services based on the Microsoft platform with the
training, resources and support they need to provide their customers a
superior experience and outcomes. Through the Microsoft Independent
Software Vendor (ISV)/Software competency, SOA Software can gain access
to the latest technology, market opportunities, and sales and marketing
resources that have been specifically created with ISVs in mind. From
planning the development cycle to supporting customers, firms will have
the tools and resources they need to build innovative solutions and bring
them to market.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jun (Reuters) - Facebook overtook Microsoft (MSFT.O) websites in Britain for the first time last month, becoming the UK's second-most popular after Google (GOOG.O) as people aged over 50 flocked to social networks, online measurement body UKOM/Nielsen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook attracted a record 26.8 million visitors in Britain in May, up 7 percent year on year, beating the 26.2 million who visited Microsoft's MSN/WindowsLive/Bing sites combined, the organisation said on Monday. Google had 33.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter's UK audience jumped by a third to 6.1 million, after thousands of users retweeted allegations of celebrity scandals in defiance of gagging orders, including an extra-marital affair by Manchester United soccer star Ryan Giggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UKOM/Nielsen said the number of women pensioners visiting the site doubled after "Giggsgate".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The growth in audiences to these social networks is now primarily being driven by the 50-plus age group. Just a few years ago, this group may have found itself out of place on these sites," UKOM general manager James Smythe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said over-50 year-olds accounted for more new adults visiting Facebook in the last two years than under-50s, resulting in an age profile far more closely reflecting that of the UK online population as a whole than previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older age groups were also more likely to visit Twitter than in the past, but under-18s were less likely to visit the site than two years ago -- which was not the case for Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business network LinkedIn (LNKD.N), whose market value has risen 58 percent to $6.65 billion since its New York stock market debut last month, registered 3.6 million UK visitors in May, up 57 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Facebook attracted 140 million visitors in the United States, up 12 percent. In Spain its numbers were up 7 percent, in France 18 percent, in Italy 26 percent and in Germany 72 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter's visitor numbers rose 22 percent in the United States, 48 percent in France, 58 percent in Italy and more than doubled in Spain. But in Germany they fell by 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UKOM/Nielsen monitored the online behaviour of about 50,000 people in Britain and similar numbers in the other countries. The panel was recruited both online and offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)&lt;/p&gt;

			Coca-Cola Hellenic Makes a Splash on Danube Day
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      More than 81 million people in Central and Eastern Europe will unite to 
      preserve, protect and celebrate the river that connects their countries 
      on 29 June, when the eighth annual Danube Day takes place.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Danube Day is the largest river festival in the world and highlights 
      conservation efforts along the course of the river Danube and within the 
      wider Danube Basin which includes more than 300 tributaries. As a 
      founder member of the Green Danube Partnership*, Coca-Cola 
      Hellenic plays a key role in the increasingly broad series of 
      awareness-raising activities ranging from local festivities to major 
      international campaigns. A list of events by country is available here www.coca-colahellenic.com
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In developing and staging celebrations, the Green Danube Partnership 
      works together with governments, NGOs, educational institutions and 
      local authorities. Since the partnership was launched in 2005, it has 
      raised awareness of the need to conserve vital water resources through a 
      broad range of performances, exhibitions, competitions and the 
      distribution of educational material. It has been especially keen to 
      actively engage citizens in hands-on activities such as cleaning 
      riverbanks, removing and recycling waste from waterways and 
      rehabilitating wildlife habitats.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Ulrike Gehmacher, Group Public Affairs and Communication Manager at 
      Coca-Cola Hellenic, explained: &#8220;Rivers are a particular focus for our 
      conservation efforts. The Danube is an iconic waterway which has played 
      a key role in the history and culture of many of the countries Coca-Cola 
      Hellenic operates in, which is why we are so committed to efforts to 
      protect and preserve it.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Passing through 10 countries and four capital cities, more than any 
      other river in the world, the Danube and its tributaries transcend 
      national boundaries. It is heartening to see this is being mirrored in 
      the annual celebration of Danube Day and in ever-greater cross border 
      cooperation to conserve this vital water source and ecological hotspot.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      This year the Danube Day celebrations will pay special attention to the 
      Tisza Basin, an important Danube tributary. In an example of the cross 
      border collaboration that Danube Day embodies, Ukraine, Romania, Serbia, 
      Slovakia and Hungary will be celebrating their international cooperation 
      in the Tisza Basin. Each country will place a memorial plaque at the 
      source of the mighty river in the Carpathians near Rakhiv in Ukraine, in 
      recognition of the progress made working together for the Tisza.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Every year, a particular focus for Danube Day activities is to inspire 
      school pupils to be aware of the river&#8217;s importance. Schools throughout 
      the Danube Basin were able to take part in the Danube Art Master 
      competition to create sculptures and images from materials collected at 
      river banks. Two winners from each of the 14 countries that celebrate 
      Danube Day will be announced on the day itself.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Since its creation, the award-winning Danube Box, an educational toolkit 
      developed to inform future generations about the importance of resource 
      conservation and water management, has been translated and specifically 
      tailored for each country. The toolkit, which includes interactive 
      materials, maps and games was launched to offer a holistic approach and 
      raise pupils&#8217; awareness about the protection of the Danube and its wise 
      and sustainable use. The individual translations are available online at www.danubebox.org
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Danube Day commemorates the anniversary of the signing of the Danube 
      River Protection Convention in Sofia, Bulgaria, on 29 June, 1994.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Jun (Reuters) - Facebook overtook Microsoft websites in Britain for the first time last month, becoming the UK's second-most popular after Google as people aged over 50 flocked to social networks, online measurement body UKOM/Nielsen said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Facebook attracted a record 26.8 million visitors in Britain in May, up 7 percent year on year, beating the 26.2 million who visited Microsoft's MSN/WindowsLive/Bing sites combined, the organization said on Monday. Google had 33.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter's UK audience jumped by a third to 6.1 million, after thousands of users retweeted allegations of celebrity scandals in defiance of gagging orders, including an extra-marital affair by Manchester United soccer star Ryan Giggs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UKOM/Nielsen said the number of women pensioners visiting the site doubled after "Giggsgate." [ID:nLDE74M1KJ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The growth in audiences to these social networks is now primarily being driven by the 50-plus age group. Just a few years ago, this group may have found itself out of place on these sites," UKOM general manager James Smythe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said over-50 year-olds accounted for more new adults visiting Facebook in the last two years than under-50s, resulting in an age profile far more closely reflecting that of the UK online population as a whole than previously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Older age groups were also more likely to visit Twitter than in the past, but under-18s were less likely to visit the site than two years ago -- which was not the case for Facebook.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Business network LinkedIn, whose market value has risen 58 percent to $6.65 billion since its New York stock market debut last month, registered 3.6 million UK visitors in May, up 57 percent from a year earlier.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elsewhere, Facebook attracted 140 million visitors in the United States, up 12 percent. In Spain its numbers were up 7 percent, in France 18 percent, in Italy 26 percent and in Germany 72 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Twitter's visitor numbers rose 22 percent in the United States, 48 percent in France, 58 percent in Italy and more than doubled in Spain. But in Germany they fell by 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UKOM/Nielsen monitored the online behavior of about 50,000 people in Britain and similar numbers in the other countries. The panel was recruited both online and offline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Georgina Prodhan; Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In business, change is a given, for both businesses and the executives that lead them. That's especially true at a high-tech company like IBM, which celebrates its 100th birthday this month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;IBM has long been in the information business, starting with scales, tabulators and clocks. The company has been a pioneer in the IT industry, designing and developing products to record, process, communicate, store and retrieve information. As the market changes, so does the company's technology-related solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Today, Sharon Nunes is the vice president of IBM's Smarter Cities, one of IBM's pivotal growth businesses. The Smarter Cities initiative provides measurement and monitoring of information on city operations, such as traffic flow and water use. Before heading up that initiative, Nunes had been up, down and all around the global corporate giant -- starting in RD, launching new business units like Big Green Innovationsand Advanced Water Management, leading worldwide teams, engaging clients -- all the while traveling the world visiting scores of IBM's more than 170 sites worldwide to effect sustainable innovation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She's an example of making change from the inside out, and for those looking to learn from her experience, she's a model of how to go about learning the ropes of sustainability while climbing the corporate ladder of a sprawling global company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part and parcel of IBM's sustainability-driven strategy, the organization Nunes heads recognizes that smarter cities will be economic growth engines of the 21st century and seeks ways to apply the company's unique set of capabilities to create, manage and run intelligent and interconnected infrastructures and systems for urban centers in every major geography.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As Nunes explained at WNSF's clean tech advantage summitin California last November, to create value, it's important to encourage systematic social innovation, reinventing relationships, and re-evaluating values. That's part of what the company seeks through its collaborative, nine-member Green Sigma Coalitionof corporate partners, which brings collective business expertise to its Smarter Cities program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesson 1: Don't Be Afraid of the Detour&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of successful innovation -- and progress -- is flexibility, she believes. It's funny because people are always trying to plan for success, Nunes says. I look at them and say 'it's great to have a plan, but I hope you're flexible, because taking a left or a right turn might lead to interesting results you wouldn't have experienced if you'd stuck to the plan.'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nunes' career path exemplifies the innovation inspired by flexibility, with more than a few left turns along the way. Trained as a materials scientist, she began her career in research and development, working for a decade on projects like electronic packaging for modules of IBM's high-end computers, then supporting the director of research with strategy and alignment with other IBM groups.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's when I realized the breadth of what the company was doing and moved into software, she says. It was the transition point for me, walking into a new area of research, putting together groups, aligning strategy with business opportunities and learning non-tech disciplines.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesson 2: Reach Outside Your Role&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nunes admits it hasn't always been a breeze to segue. Some transitions were easier than others, but I tell my mentees they should take a risk, because you never know what you can or can't do until you try.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In her current role, Nunes gets to think about heady issues like the unit's strategic direction, driving business progress, upping sales and generally working across the company to grow the expanding market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means plenty of opportunities to work with others who may not have sustainability at the core of their role. There are only 15 people who report directly to the Smarter Cities team, but Nunes manages to matrix some 500 other IBM employees, from around the world, into critical projects. That gives those employees the chance to keep things interesting and expand their role, she says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lesson 3: Like What You Do (and Who You Do It With)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nunes also reminds her mentees that it's a good idea to check in with yourself, follow your passion. I like working on the cutting edge, she says. I like both the technology and the business components. But leadership styles are very different in different organizations, and you have to learn the differences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More importantly, perhaps, You have to find the people you trust, so you can bounce ideas off them and learn from them. [] I've had a great informal network of people in the company I can go to and ask how to approach various problems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, though, flexibility, whether personal or corporate, is the key to successful innovation, she says. You have to be flexible, change your style, adapt to different people, different circumstances, different personalities. It's fun and challenging -- and it keeps the company's engine oiled.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MONTERREY, Mexico (Reuters) - Coca-Cola FEMSA, the world's top Coke bottler (KOFL.MX) (KOF.N), said on Tuesday it had agreed to a merger with a family-owned Mexican bottler in a deal worth 9.3 billion pesos ($790 million).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some six months after two of Coca-Cola FEMSA's local rivals announced a merger to create powerful competition, the bottler said it was absorbing the beverage division of conglomerate Grupo Tampico, which has four bottling plants.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola FEMSA, sitting on $1.1 billion in money saved after generating strong cash flow for several years, had been tipped to spend some of its savings this year, although few analysts had pinpointed Grupo Tampico as a target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola FEMSA, an association of Monterrey-based drinks maker FEMSA (FMSAUBD.MX) (FMX.N) and The Coca-Cola Co. (KO.N), will give Grupo Tampico shares to pay for the deal and said it was still subject to shareholder and regulatory approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As a result of this merger, Grupo Tampico will receive 63.5 million new series L KOF shares worth 103.20 each," Coca-Cola FEMSA said in a statement, referring to its abbreviation as KOF.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coca-Cola FEMSA will take on around 2.8 billion pesos in net debt in the transaction, while two of Grupo Tampico directors will take an alternating seat on Coca-Cola FEMSA's board, the company said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HAS ROOM TO EXPAND FURTHER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The combined operations of the two companies will bottle about 45 percent of Coca-Cola Company's volume in Mexico, one of the biggest per-capita Coke guzzlers in the world.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mexican bottlers Arca ARCA.MX and Contal CONTAL.MX in January agreed to merge to create the world's No. 3 Coca-Cola bottler, behind Coca-Cola FEMSA and Greece's Coca-Cola Hellenic HLBr.AT and closed the deal earlier this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the enduring popularity of Coca-Cola and its range of fizzy drinks in Latin America, analysts say Coca-Cola FEMSA still has room to expand with some 40 bottlers operating across the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in Coca-Cola FEMSA have gained almost 8 percent this year even when Mexico's overall index of leading shares has slumped and analysts say the company could go after smaller bottlers in southern Mexico and also in Chile.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Robin Emmott in Monterrey and Armando Tovar in Mexico City; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman)&lt;/p&gt;

contribute our expertise to the decision-making process of the Company,"
said Mr. Herman Fleishman.

Coca-Cola bottling system. This merger will reinforce our Company's
leadership position in Mexico and Latin America. The talented team of
professionals at Grupo Tampico's beverage division and their passion for
execution will certainly enhance our joint operations' go-to-market
capabilities, strengthen our diversified portfolio of geographies, and
enable us to create value for our shareholders. Henry and Robert
Fleishman will continue to play an important leadership role within the
Mexican Coca-Cola bottling system and we are honored to have them join

		&lt;p&gt;
      Insyde Software, a leading provider of Unified Extensible Firmware 
      Interface (UEFI) firmware, today announced the delivery of UEFI BIOS and 
      engineering services to customers designing ultra-thin laptops, tablets, 
      and mobile internet devices based on the ARM-based OMAP&#8482; 4 platform from 
      Texas Instruments Incorporated (TI).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Insyde Software will ensure that InsydeH2O, the most widely used UEFI 
      BIOS in mobile devices today, has complete support for the OMAP platform 
      features, complies with the most current UEFI specifications , and 
      offers customers the ability to easily customize their OMAP firmware for 
      product differentiation.

      Earlier this month at the Computex Taipei trade event, Microsoft Corp. 
      disclosed details of the next version of Windows, code-named &#8220;Windows 
      8&#8221;. Among this disclosure, Michael Angiulo, Corporate Vice President of 
      the Planning, Hardware and PC Ecosystem team at Microsoft stated that 
      UEFI is an important area of engagement for the next version of Windows, 
      as it represents a major shift in the direction for all PCs and is 
      required on ARM.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Hundreds of OEM and ODM customers worldwide rely on InsydeH2O for its 
      easily customizable modular architecture, fast boot performance, power 
      management configurations, support for UEFI, ACPI , USB, PCI and other 
      industry specification support, flexibility in hardware design and a 
      consistent development environment for platforms of all types and 
      architectures.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      "TI&#8217;s OMAP platform is relied upon to deliver superior user experiences. 
      As consumers shift to tablets and ultrathin laptops for their mobile 
      computing needs, they expect that instant-on access they&#8217;ve come to love 
      on their smartphones to shift with them. The introduction of Insyde 
      Software&#8217;s UEFI technology enables the OMAP platform to meet that 
      expectation,&#8221; said Deepu Talla, general manager, OMAP mobile computing, 
      wireless business unit, TI.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Collaborating with TI on OMAP platforms allows us to bring unique value 
      to our customers on architecture where UEFI BIOS has not been used 
      before,&#8221; said Aven Chuang, SVP and GM, Personal Computing Group, Insyde 
      Software. &#8220;Combining the OMAP platform&#8217;s high-performance and ultra-low

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp made its biggest move into the mobile, Internet-accessible world of "cloud" computing on Tuesday, taking the wraps off a revamped online version of its hugely profitable Office software suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is heaving its two-decade old set of applications -- including Outlook email, Excel spreadsheets and SharePoint collaboration tools -- into an online format so that customers can use them on a variety of devices from wherever they can get an Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wants to push back against Google Inc, which has stolen a small but worrying percentage of corporate customers with Google Apps -- a cheaper, Web-only alternative that removes the need for companies to spend time on installing software or managing servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Steve Ballmer presented the overhauled and updated set of offerings -- collectively called Office 365 -- at an event in New York City on Tuesday morning, stressing that online versions and built-in conferencing tools can save users money, especially small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full launch of Office 365, which has been in beta testing since last autumn, spices up the lively competition with Google for new users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While Office 365 does put Microsoft in mortal combat with Google, it is not really an existential threat for Google since Microsoft is essentially validating the model that Google pioneered with Google Apps," said Matt Cain, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner. "I would expect that Office 365 actually heightens interest in Google Apps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 2.4 percent on Tuesday afternoon, following a 3.7 percent jump the day before, partly buoyed by hopes that the company can ultimately boost profits by extending its software dominance to the growing cloud sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has offered online versions of some Office programs -- chiefly Outlook email -- for its corporate customers for several years, and last year rolled out free versions for individual home users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest thing I like about it is that it takes the need to manage servers away and puts it in someone else's hands," said Kevin Lisota, CEO of Seattle real estate startup Findwell, which has five employees and has been using the test version of the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It takes our email and team Internet sites and basically makes that Microsoft's problem so I don't have to worry about that," said Lisota, who was invited by Microsoft to an Office 365 launch event at its headquarters near Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GROWING MARKET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for Web-based software services is heating up, and every company, government department and local authority is getting pitches from Microsoft and Google whenever they re-evaluate their office software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a new challenge for Microsoft, which built itself up on expensive versions of software installed on individual computers. That business model turned the Office unit into Microsoft's most profitable, earning more than $3 billion alone last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's plan is to make up for smaller profit margins from Web-based applications -- due to the cost of handling data and keeping up servers -- by grabbing a larger slice of companies' overall technology spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will charge from $2 per user per month for basic email services to $27 per user per month for advanced offerings, with a standard, small business package priced at $6 per user per month. Google charges a flat fee of $50 per user per year for its Web-based Google Apps product, which offers email, calendars, word processing and more online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, like Google, will host users' data remotely, and maintain all the servers in vast data centers. Unlike Google, it will also allow companies to put their data on dedicated servers should they choose, or keep the data on their own premises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, which has had the most success in the small and medium-sized business range, says there are now 40 million users of online Google Apps suite. Microsoft does not publish equivalent numbers, but research firm comScore has estimated 750 million people worldwide use Office in some form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Internet-centric Google -- whose success is based on its dominance in Web search -- is confident it has the upper hand in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Compared to what they (Microsoft) have in the market today, they have nowhere to go but up," said Dave Girouard, head of Google's worldwide enterprise business, in an interview last week. "We feel we're years ahead of them in terms of building a viable cloud solution that just works."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - As Google tries to fend off a U.S. probe of its multibillion-dollar search business, it has been quietly adding to its stable of antitrust advisers, which, Reuters has learned, includes a former Microsoft prosecutor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jeffrey Blattner, a former U.S. Department of Justice attorney who helped supervise the government's litigation against Microsoft in the 1990s, was one of a handful of Google representatives who attended a briefing for the American Antitrust Institute earlier this year, according to Robert Lande, an AAI senior fellow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blattner joins a roster of antitrust heavyweights from outside law firms who are expected to aid the search giant as it engages with the Federal Trade Commission. The agency has launched a formal investigation into Google's search business, the company disclosed last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft waged a two-decade fight with the U.S. Department of Justice and state attorneys general over charges that it abused its monopoly in operating systems to crush competition in other areas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft finally settled the matter in 2002, and only last month emerged from government oversight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blattner was special counsel for information technology in Justice Department's antitrust division, and now runs his own consulting firm in Washington, D.C., his website says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAI issues white papers on antitrust subjects -- for instance, it raised concerns last year about Google's merger with ITA Software Inc. The Justice Department eventually approved that deal, with conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google representatives met with AAI fellows and staff in January to defend the "neutrality" of Google's search process, said Randy Stutz, AAI's director of special projects. Google's critics have long complained that Google searches favor Google's own services, and federal investigators and some state attorneys general are reportedly looking into those allegations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AAI personnel have also been briefed by Microsoft representatives, who laid out the antitrust case against Google, said Lande, who is a professor at University of Baltimore School of Law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"That's the way Washington works," Lande said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google did not respond to inquiries about its lawyers, and Blattner declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TO SCORCH OR NOT TO SCORCH?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Legal experts are divided on what sort of posture Google is likely to assume as it prepares for what could be the fight of its life with the FTC. Eric Goldman, a professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, notes that while Google must gird for a potentially long and expensive showdown, it also has to work with regulators on any future deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That means the company may try to keep the fight from becoming bitter, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unless Google swears off mergers for a while, I don't think it can use a scorched Earth policy," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others think the company will try to slow the production of discovery to the FTC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They're going to scorch the Earth document-wise, and then try to settle for something worthless," said Gary Reback, a well-known antitrust lawyer who once opposed Microsoft and now represents clients adverse to Google.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In dealing with the FTC, Google is expected to continue using its long-time antitrust advisers from the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich  Rosati.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google also used Cleary Gottlieb Steen  Hamilton in its acquisition of AdMob, the mobile advertising network.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Upgrades J.P. Morgan Series 2000-C9
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings upgrades one class of J.P. Morgan Commercial Mortgage 
      Finance Corp.'s mortgage pass-through certificates, series 2000-C9. A 
      detailed list of rating actions follows the end of the press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The upgrade is due to increased credit enhancement as a result of 
      principal paydown which is sufficient to offset Fitch expected losses. 
      Fitch modeled losses of 3% of the remaining pool; expected losses of the 
      original pool are at 4.2%, including losses already incurred to date. 
      Fitch expects losses to be absorbed by the non-rated class J. Fitch 
      identified three loans (58.4%) as Fitch Loans of Concern, all of which 
      are currently in special servicing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the June 2011 distribution date, the pool's aggregate principal 
      balance has been paid down approximately 95.3% to $38.5 million from 
      $814.4 million at issuance. Currently only eight loans remain in the 
      pool, including one defeased loan (24.5%). Interest shortfalls are only 
      affecting the non-rated classes J through NR with cumulative unpaid 
      interest totaling $1.3 million.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining loans by applying a 5% 
      reduction to 2009 or 2010 fiscal year-end net operating income, and 
      applying an adjusted market cap rate between 8.10% and 9.5 % to 
      determine value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      All the loans also underwent a refinance test by applying an 8% interest 
      rate and 30-year amortization schedule based on the stressed cash flow. 
      All of the loans are modeled to pay off at maturity, and could refinance 
      to a debt-service coverage ratio (DSCR) above 1.25 times (x). The 
      current weighted average DSCR is 1.49x.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The only contributor to Fitch modeled losses is a 250-unit multifamily 
      property located in Colorado Springs, CO. The loan transferred to the 
      special servicer on July 6, 2009 due to imminent default. The loan 
      subsequently matured on Oct. 1 ,2009 and did not pay off. The special 
      servicer is working with the borrower to pay off the loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has upgraded the following class, as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$4.4 million class G to 'AAA/LS2' from 'AA/LS2'; Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has affirmed the following class, as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$20.4 million class H at 'BB+/LS2'; Outlook Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Classes A-1 through F have paid in full. Classes J, K and NR are not 
      rated by Fitch.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch has withdrawn the rating of the Interest-only class X (for 
      additional information on the withdrawal of the rating on Class X, see 
      'Fitch Revises Practice for Rating IO  Pre-Payment Related Structured 
      Finance Securities', dated June 23, 2010).

&lt;p&gt; * Online versions of Outlook, Word, Excel and more&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft stresses cost savings for users&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Takes on rival Google Apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft shares up 2.4 pct after gains on Monday
 (Adds user, analyst comments, updates share price)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, June 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) made
its biggest move into the mobile, Internet-accessible world of
"cloud" computing on Tuesday, taking the wraps off a revamped
online version of its hugely profitable Office software suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company is heaving its
two-decade old set of applications -- including Outlook email,
Excel spreadsheets and SharePoint collaboration tools -- into
an online format so that customers can use them on a variety of
devices from wherever they can get an Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wants to push back against Google Inc (GOOG.O), which
has stolen a small but worrying percentage of corporate
customers with Google Apps -- a cheaper, Web-only alternative
that removes the need for companies to spend time on installing
software or managing servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Steve Ballmer presented the overhauled and
updated set of offerings -- collectively called Office 365 --
at an event in New York City on Tuesday morning, stressing that
online versions and built-in conferencing tools can save users
money, especially small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The full launch of Office 365, which has been in beta
testing since last autumn, spices up the lively competition
with Google for new users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While Office 365 does put Microsoft in mortal combat with
Google, it is not really an existential threat for Google since
Microsoft is essentially validating the model that Google
pioneered with Google Apps," said Matt Cain, an analyst at tech
research firm Gartner. "I would expect that Office 365 actually
heightens interest in Google Apps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares were up 2.4 percent on Tuesday afternoon,
following a 3.7 percent jump the day before, partly buoyed by
hopes that the company can ultimately boost profits by
extending its software dominance to the growing cloud sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has offered online versions of some Office
programs -- chiefly Outlook email -- for its corporate
customers for several years, and last year rolled out free
versions for individual home users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The biggest thing I like about it is that it takes the
need to manage servers away and puts it in someone else's
hands," said Kevin Lisota, CEO of Seattle real estate startup
Findwell, which has five employees and has been using the test
version of the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It takes our email and team Internet sites and basically
makes that Microsoft's problem so I don't have to worry about
that," said Lisota, who was invited by Microsoft to an Office
365 launch event at its headquarters near Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GROWING MARKET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market for Web-based software services is heating up,
and every company, government department and local authority is
getting pitches from Microsoft and Google whenever they
re-evaluate their office software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is a new challenge for Microsoft, which built itself up
on expensive versions of software installed on individual
computers. That business model turned the Office unit into
Microsoft's most profitable, earning more than $3 billion alone
last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's plan is to make up for smaller profit margins
from Web-based applications -- due to the cost of handling data
and keeping up servers -- by grabbing a larger slice of
companies' overall technology spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it will charge from $2 per user per month
for basic email services to $27 per user per month for advanced
offerings, with a standard, small business package priced at $6
per user per month. Google charges a flat fee of $50 per user
per year for its Web-based Google Apps product, which offers
email, calendars, word processing and more online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, like Google, will host users' data remotely, and
maintain all the servers in vast data centers. Unlike Google,
it will also allow companies to put their data on dedicated
servers should they choose, or keep the data on their own
premises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google, which has had the most success in the small and
medium-sized business range, says there are now 40 million
users of online Google Apps suite. Microsoft does not publish
equivalent numbers, but research firm comScore has estimated
750 million people worldwide use Office in some form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Internet-centric Google -- whose success is based on its
dominance in Web search -- is confident it has the upper hand
in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Compared to what they (Microsoft) have in the market
today, they have nowhere to go but up," said Dave Girouard,
head of Google's worldwide enterprise business, in an interview
last week. "We feel we're years ahead of them in terms of
building a viable cloud solution that just works."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) shares hit a two-year low on Tuesday as investors fretted about the bank's ability to earn money in a new regulatory environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman's stock was down $2.11, or 1.6 percent, to $128.60 in afternoon trade and were on track to close at their lowest level since May 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The latest price represented a discount to Goldman's most recently posted book value per common share of $129.40 as of March 31. Book value is the accounting value of the bank's assets minus its liabilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like other large financial institutions, Goldman faces higher capital requirements and restrictions on the type of activities it can engage in. Goldman is also experiencing a decline in trading revenue and other client activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the first quarter, Goldman reported an annualized return on equity of 12.2 percent, or 14.5 percent adjusted for a special charge. That compares with ROE of more than 30 percent before the financial crisis hit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Their earnings are not going to be what they used to be," said Mark Coffelt, president and chief investment officer of the mutual fund company Empiric Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coffelt, who does not own Goldman shares, said that at 5 percent of his holdings, financial stocks now represent the lowest portion of his portfolio since founding Empiric Advisors 16 years ago. He is not considering investments any time soon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analysts say boosting returns will be difficult for Goldman, at least in the near term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Regulatory clarity is necessary to jumpstart the stock," Barclays Capital analyst Roger Freeman wrote in a recent note, lowering his second-quarter earnings estimate for the bank by 37 percent, to $2.10 per share. He rates Goldman shares "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman is due to report second-quarter results on July 19. Analysts' average earnings estimate is $3.21 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of the 21 analysts covering the stock, 18 advise clients to buy Goldman shares, two suggest selling the stock and six are neutral.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Lauren Tara LaCapra; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

			Morgan Stanley Smith Barney Congratulates Clients Aon Hewitt, 
      Microsoft, Siemens and Telefonica on Global Equity Organization Industry 
      Awards
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			The 12th annual Global 
      Equity Organization conference focuses on the equity compensation 
      industry; awarding firms for plan design, employee communications and 
      other categories
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Morgan Stanley Smith Barney is pleased to announce that four of its 
      stock plan clients were awarded prestigious Global Equity Organization 
      (GEO) Awards at the 2011 ceremony in Amsterdam on June 16, 2011.1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Founded in 1999, GEO is an international, not-for-profit organization 
      designed to support equity compensation professionals. Morgan Stanley 
      Smith Barney joins over 1,500 companies and professional firms in 59 
      countries around the world to participate in this conference, as well as 
      sponsoring the 2011 GEO Awards, which honor organizations that 
      demonstrate excellence in leadership and dedication to their share plans.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Aon Hewitt, the global human resources outsourcing and consulting 
      company of Aon Corporation (NYSE: AON) won the GEO award for &#8220;Best use 
      of Employee Share Plans in a Corporate Action.&#8221; Aon Hewitt was selected 
      by the judges for its strong commitment to its employees and equity plan 
      during the merger between Aon Consulting and Hewitt Associates, Inc., 
      which closed on October 1, 2010. That merger created a high degree of 
      complexity around the Hewitt Global Stock and Incentive Compensation 
      Plan. Legacy Hewitt worked with its stock plan service provider, Morgan 
      Stanley Smith Barney, on this complex merger consideration payout while 
      deploying strategic and timely means of communication, including 
      targeted email, immediate message posting and online progress reports. 
      The company&#8217;s collaborative partnership with Morgan Stanley Smith Barney 
      in delivering the merger consideration payout, along with its 
      communication and frequent updates, helped the company maintain positive 
      momentum around the merger and minimized the amount of questions from 
      legacy Hewitt colleagues.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Microsoft (NYSE: MSFT) was granted the GEO award for &#8220;Best Use of 
      Technology: Back Office Solutions.&#8221; The judges recognized Microsoft for 
      its world-class internally created stock system that maximizes both the 
      effectiveness of the stock plan administrator and the understanding of 
      value of the stock plan by the participating employees. The system is 
      comprehensive, highly configurable and automates all standard 
      administrative functions with a solution designed to manage broad based 
      equity programs for over 90,000 Microsoft employees worldwide.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Siemens (NYSE: SI) was granted the GEO &#8220;Judges&#8221; award. Siemens was 
      recognized for its Share Matching Plan (SMP), a global equity benefit 
      initiative that opens the door to all its employees worldwide (where 
      local laws permit), giving every member of staff the opportunity to own 
      a part of the company. This innovative program forms the foundation of 
      the distinctive Siemens Equity Culture
			and encourages active 
      participation in the firm&#8217;s long-term future development.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Telefonica (NYSE: TEF) won the GEO&#160;award for the category of &#8220;Best&#160;Use 
      of Technology: Employee Facing Solutions.&#8221; Telefonica was selected&#160;by 
      the judges for its&#160;innovative use of technology, in both the 
      communication and delivery of&#160;their&#160;share plan to employees, across the 
      globe. A sophisticated multilingual enrollment website was 
      simultaneously launched to&#160;over 120,000 eligible employees across four 
      continents. This process was supported&#160;through localized distribution of 
      information via email and through Telefonica&#8217;s intranet sites &#8211; 
      providing additional employee information and education. The resulting 
      take-up rates surpassed all expectations. Following the 
      launch,&#160;employees have been able to access their&#160;web accounts, 
      with&#160;information&#160;in local language and currency.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As one of the founding sponsors of the Global Equity Organization, we 
      are committed to supporting corporate executives and equity compensation 
      professionals dealing with the challenges of creating, managing and 
      administrating quality equity compensation plans. We are delighted for

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 28 (Reuters) - New Jersey has chosen
JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N) for a $2.5 billion line of credit that
will help the state manage its cash flow more flexibly than its
more traditional strategy of selling short-term notes, a
spokesman for the treasurer said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The line of credit will cost about 45 basis points over the
SIFMA index rate, plus fees, for a possible total of around 65
basis points. "But this way, we only pay interest on what we
draw down," spokesman Andrew Pratt said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So if New Jersey only uses part of the credit line, this
approach could be less costly than issuing $2.5 billion of tax
and revenue anticipation notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The credit line will be repaid after six months with tax
and revenue anticipation notes. Last year, New Jersey paid an
interest rate of around 0.54 percent on its tax and revenue
anticipation notes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; New Jersey's budget, like most states, is due on July 1 and
until it is finally approved, the treasurer will not know
precisely how much cash the state will need for a few
big-ticket items, including an approximately $500 million
pension contribution. That is another reason the flexibility
offered by the line of credit is preferred.

&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft stresses cost savings for users&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Takes on rival Google Apps&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft shares up slightly after gains on Monday&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Bill Rigby&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEATTLE, June 28 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) made
its biggest move into the mobile, Internet-accessible world of
"cloud" computing on Tuesday, taking the wraps off a revamped
online version of its hugely profitable Office software suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest software company is heaving its
two-decade old set of applications -- including Outlook email,
Excel spreadsheets and SharePoint collaboration tools -- into
an online format so that customers can use them on a variety of
devices from wherever they can get an Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It wants to push back against Google Inc (GOOG.O), which
has stolen a small but worrying percentage of corporate
customers with cheaper, web-only alternatives, which remove the
need for companies to spend time on installing software or
managing servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It puts Microsoft in a better position than they were --
they now have a broad product that they can more easily sell,"
said Michael Silver, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft shares rose 0.8 percent on Tuesday, following a
3.7 percent jump the day before, partly buoyed by hopes that
the company can ultimately boost profits by extending its
software dominance to the growing cloud sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has offered online versions of some Office
programs -- chiefly Outlook email -- for its corporate
customers for several years, and last year rolled out free
versions for individual home users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Steve Ballmer presented the overhauled and
updated set of offerings -- collectively called Office 365 --
at an event in New York City on Tuesday morning, stressing that
online versions and built-in conferencing tools can save users
money, especially small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One test customer "expects to cut travel costs and reduce
carbon emissions by 30 percent after they retire the 60 servers
they think they will save," said Ballmer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; GROWING MARKET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The market for web-based software services is heating up,
and every company, government department and local authority is
getting pitches from Microsoft and Google whenever they
reevaluate their office software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a new challenge for Microsoft, which built itself up
on expensive versions of software installed on individual
computers. That business model turned the Office unit into
Microsoft's most profitable, earning more than $3 billion alone
last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft's plan is to make up for smaller profit margins
from web-based applications -- due to the cost of handling data
and keeping up servers -- by grabbing a larger slice of
companies' overall technology spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The key message is this is a great opportunity for
organizations to get out of the business of trying to provide
commodity yet mission-critical services," said Silver at
Gartner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft said it will charge from $2 per user per month
for basic email services to $27 per user per month for advanced
offerings. Google charges a flat fee of $50 per user per year
for its web-based Google Apps product, which offers email,
calendars, word processing and more online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft, like Google, will host users' data remotely, and
maintain all the servers in vast data centers. Unlike Google,
it will also allow companies to put their data on dedicated
servers should they choose, or keep the data on their own
premises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The full launch of Office 365, which has been in beta
testing since last autumn, spices up the lively competition
with Google for new users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier this month, Google snagged InterContinental Hotels
Group (IHG.L) as a major customer, moving 25,000 of its
employees onto Google email from Outlook. [ID:nN15132483]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Google, which has had the most success in the small and
medium-sized business range, says there are now 40 million
users of online Google Apps suite. Microsoft does not publish
equivalent numbers, but research firm comScore has estimated
750 million people worldwide use Office in some form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Internet-centric Google -- whose success is based on
its dominance in Web search -- is confident it has the upper
hand in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Compared to what they (Microsoft) have in the market
today, they have nowhere to go but up," said Dave Girouard,
head of Google's worldwide enterprise business, in an interview
last week. "We feel we're years ahead of them in terms of
building a viable cloud solution that just works."

			LiveOffice First to Provide Complete Compliance and E-Discovery for 
      Microsoft Office 365
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Only Archiving Provider Capturing Content Across Exchange Online and 
      SharePoint Online
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			LiveOffice, 
      the number-one global provider of cloud-based email 
      archiving, email 
      compliance, email 
      discovery and email 
      continuity solutions,&#160;today announced advanced compliance and 
      e-discovery capabilities for Microsoft Office 365. LiveOffice built 
      these capabilities based on its several years of experience providing 
      archiving for more than 250 customers of the predecessor to Microsoft 
      Office 365, Microsoft Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS). 
      LiveOffice is now the only archiving provider that allows enterprises to 
      move to Microsoft&#8217;s cloud-based collaboration solution with confidence, 
      knowing that content created in Microsoft Exchange Online and Microsoft 
      SharePoint Online can be securely captured, retained, searched and 
      supervised in one integrated system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Many public and private organizations are taking their first steps into 
      the cloud with email. Web-enabled solutions like Microsoft Office 365 
      simplify the transition by relieving the burden of managing and 
      maintaining business systems, freeing up IT departments and businesses 
      to focus on initiatives that can deliver true competitive advantages. 
      Microsoft Office 365 combines the Office desktop suite with familiar 
      cloud-based versions of its next-generation communications and 
      collaboration services, including Microsoft Exchange Online, Microsoft 
      SharePoint Online and Microsoft Lync Online. These combined services 
      allow users to stay productive and connected anywhere, anytime, without 
      losing essential security and control.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;According to our research, email and collaboration are two of the top 
      three applications that companies are currently consuming or expect to 
      consume via the cloud,&#8221; said Brian Babineau, vice president, research 
      and analyst services, Enterprise Strategy Group. &#8220;Companies have to 
      consider solutions such as LiveOffice to accelerate and mature this 
      transition, because compliance and e-discovery challenges remain 
      regardless of where collaboration data is ultimately stored.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			LiveOffice&#8217;s Unique Integration with Microsoft Office 365
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      LiveOffice offers the only
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        integrated archive across Exchange Online and SharePoint Online.
      
			
        third-party archive to automatically synchronize users, email 
        addresses and distribution list members with Microsoft Office 365.
      
			
        archive with native access from Windows Phone 7, along with other 
        mobile devices.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
			Additional Benefits of LiveOffice Archiving
		&lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				SEC/FINRA Compliance: Capture and supervise email from 
        Microsoft Office 365 as well as IM, Bloomberg and social media 
        communications to adhere to SEC and FINRA regulations.
      
			
				Advanced E-Discovery: Leverage case management workflow, 
        dynamic legal holds, EDRM XML metadata export and granular, role-based 
        access to reduce the cost and time involved in fulfilling e-discovery 
        requests for Microsoft Office 365 content.
      
			
				Migration: Receive assistance with migration from on-premise 
        email archives (e.g., Symantec Enterprise Vault and EMC EmailXtender) 
        as part of a migration to Microsoft Office 365.
      
			
				Data Protection: Protect data stored in Microsoft Office 365 in 
        the event of inadvertent deletion, data loss or employee attrition; 
        ensure 24&#8211;7&#8211;365 access in the event of downtime (planned or 
        unplanned); and give end users the power to restore lost or deleted 
        messages themselves, without involving IT.
      
			
				Business Intelligence: Maximize the value of archived data with 
        comprehensive benchmarking reports and statistics; the ability to 
        reassign former employees&#8217; archives to new owners; and automatic 
        alerts to identify intellectual property (IP) leakage, inappropriate 
        language in correspondence and other corporate compliance violations.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Microsoft Office 365 lets its users work from virtually anywhere and 
      from almost any device, and email and file sharing are a big part of the 
      daily work process,&#8221; said Nick Mehta, CEO, LiveOffice. &#8220;Email&#8217;s portable 
      nature is what makes it essential to the modern mobile workforce, and 
      SharePoint Online helps keep colleagues on the same page&#8212;no matter where 
      they sit. Organizations need to be able to archive this content 
      regardless of where it exists&#8212;on-premise or in the cloud. With the 
      LiveOffice archiving and Microsoft Office 365 integration, workers can 
      be sure they can always access their most valuable work assets&#8212;email and 
      shared content.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Pricing and Availability
		&lt;/p&gt;

      Footprint While Growing Business, Improves Water Use Ratio and Launches 
      Recycling Joint Venture
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Company Details Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability Progress 
      in Latest Report and Seeks Continued Stakeholder Input on 2020 
      Commitments
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Coca-Cola Enterprises (NYSE/NYSE Euronext Paris: CCE) released today its 
      sixth company-wide Corporate Responsibility and Sustainability (CRS) 
      Report, Committed to 2020: Shaping a Sustainable Future in Europe. 
      Coca-Cola Enterprises employs 13,500 employees and operates 17 
      manufacturing facilities across Western Europe, where the company 
      distributes a wide range of beverages including regular, no- and 
      low-calorie sparkling, energy and sports drinks, waters, juices and 
      juice drinks, coffees and teas.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Report is CCE&#8217;s first as a European-focused company and provides a 
      detailed overview of its progress towards Commitment 2020, the company&#8217;s 
      CRS targets and goals in its focus areas -- Energy Conservation/Climate 
      Change, Water Stewardship, Sustainable Packaging/Recycling, Product 
      Portfolio, Active Healthy Living, Community, and Workplace. The report 
      also reviews how CCE is engaging with stakeholders across its European 
      territories to discuss what sustainability leadership entails and the 
      implications for CCE as a European company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;CRS is core to our business and at the forefront of our company&#8217;s 
      priorities. We are committed to being the CRS leader in the food and 
      beverage industry in Europe and are proud of our significant 
      sustainability progress,&#8221; said John F. Brock, chairman and chief 
      executive officer. &#8220;We recognize this is an on-going journey and believe 
      that partnering with our stakeholders is the only way to determine how 
      to shape our CRS commitments so we continue to be a viable part of the 
      solution to environmental and social challenges.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2010, CCE calculated its operational carbon footprint at 795,181 
      metric tons, a reduction of four percent since 2009, while the business 
      grew volume by four percent. The company has invested in carbon 
      reduction projects, focusing on its cold drink equipment and improving 
      efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution. CCE also exceeded its 
      water use ratio reduction target one year ahead of schedule, using 1.42 
      liters of water to make one liter of product, down six percent from 1.51 
      liters in 2009. Through CCE&#8217;s internal recycling infrastructure in its 
      facilities, the company achieved a 99.5 percent waste recovery rate 
      across its territories. In March 2011, CCE announced a joint venture 
      with ECO Plastics to develop one of the biggest plastic reprocessing 
      facilities in Western Europe. When operational, the facility is expected 
      to make a step change in the plastics reprocessing industry in Great 
      Britain by producing 25,000 tons of recycled PET (rPET) annually, more 
      than doubling the amount of high quality rPET produced in the country at 
      present. The facility will supply CCE with enough high quality rPET to 
      include 25 percent rPET in all our plastic packaging in Great Britain by 
      2012.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In 2009 and 2010, CCE was named #1 in the food and beverage industry in Newsweek's 
      Green Rankings. CCE&#8217;s latest CRS Report has been verified by SGS and is 
      self-assessed at level B+ in alignment with the Global Reporting 
      Initiative (GRI). The Report can be accessed at http://www.cokecce.com,

&lt;p&gt;  SUNNYVALE, CA, Jun 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Proofpoint, Inc., the leading provider of cloud-based email security and
compliance solutions, today announced availability of Proofpoint
Compliance for Microsoft Office 365, a suite of cloud-based products that
provide regulatory compliance support for the Microsoft Office 365 email
application. Microsoft Office 365 is a cloud-hosted application suite
that is the successor to the Microsoft Business Productivity Online Suite
(BPOS). Proofpoint Compliance for Microsoft Office 365 allows customers
using Microsoft Office 365 email to comply with regulatory standards that
require email encryption, email archiving, email security and data loss
prevention (DLP). In addition, because the Proofpoint solution is based
in the cloud, it provides all of the benefits SaaS buyers are looking for
including easy deployment, reduced TCO and predictable costs.

    "Concerns about security and compliance have been a major barrier to
accelerated adoption of cloud solutions," said David Knight, executive
vice president, product management and marketing, at Proofpoint.
"Proofpoint provides a powerful, proven compliance solution that allows
enterprises to move email services to the cloud without hesitation."

    As they move to Microsoft Office 365, customers in all markets are
concerned about complying with government and industry standards that
regulate email communications. Architected to work in conjunction with
the robust Microsoft Office 365 solution, the Proofpoint Compliance for
Office 365 bundle provides compliance for a wide range of mandates,
including HIPAA/HITECH, SOX, GLBA, PCI, FERPA, FINRA and SEC regulations.
The solution also meets the stringent requirements of the Federal
Information Security Management Act (FISMA) certification and
accreditation process for email archiving. The company's Proofpoint
Enterprise Archive(TM) is the first cloud-based archiving solution to
achieve FISMA certification and in April 2011 became the first to be
granted an Authorization to Operate (ATO) by a cabinet-level federal
agency, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA).

    Powerful Features and Capabilities
 Proofpoint Compliance for Microsoft
Office 365 offers all the features customers need to protect their email
communications and comply with regulations through a bundle that includes
Proofpoint Enterprise Archive(TM), Proofpoint Enterprise Protection(TM)
and Proofpoint Enterprise Privacy(TM). The bundle delivers these critical
compliance capabilities:


--  Email archiving that addresses eDiscovery, regulatory compliance,
    rapid searchability, and storage and management challenges
--  DLP that protects private information in emails, defends against leaks
    of confidential information and ensures compliance with common
    international, industry and U.S. data-protection regulations
--  Powerful, policy-driven email encryption that mitigates the risks
    associated with regulatory violations, data loss and corporate policy
    violations

    

Availability

Proofpoint Compliance for Microsoft Office 365
addresses the needs of mid-size businesses and large enterprises. It is
available now for any Microsoft Office 365 cloud deployment, including
shared, dedicated and those used for and by federal agencies. To learn

&lt;p&gt; * Fixed income to double to 25 pct of EMEA assets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Alternatives seen at 25 pct, up from 10 pct&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Stocks reduced from well over 50 pct

 (Adds detail)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Cecilia Valente	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MONACO, June 28 (Reuters) - JP Morgan's asset
management arm aims to double the proportion of fixed income and
alternatives in its assets in the Europe, Middle East and Africa
(EMEA) region, diversifying away from stocks to cushion against
market shocks, its regional chief said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jamie Broderick, the managing director in charge of JP
Morgan Asset Management's EMEA unit, said he plans to reduce
equities from well over 50 percent to around half of assets.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fixed income and alternatives would account for 25 percent
each, up from around 12.5 percent and 10 percent respectively,
he said, adding the target could be achieved in three years.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What I am really looking for is a book of business that has
a balance between the different asset classes -- equities, fixed
income and alternatives -- such that we are not vulnerable to
... disruptions in any of those markets," he said on the
sidelines of the Fund Forum industry conference on Tuesday.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fixed income expansion would involve long and short
debt, credit, emerging markets, absolute return and high yield,
he said. The alternatives would includes real estate, hedge
funds and private equity.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think we can double alternatives, I think we can get a
quarter of our book in alternatives, we would like to do that
because of the diversification effect and the revenues
characteristics are attractive," Broderick said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broderick is also eying more business from institutional
investors, which contribute 25 percent to the unit's revenue at
the moment.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think we could do with having a higher penetration in
institutional (business) ... that's an area that has very
interesting characteristics, it is a much more persistent
business."

It set a $92 price target on the stock.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Both brokerages noted LinkedIn's aggressive investments inits field sales force both at home in the U.S. as well asoverseas and in product development.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Additionally, we believe LinkedIn has scarcity value in twoways: it&#8217;s one of the few public companies with social mediacharacteristics and less than 10 percent of it's sharesoutstanding are floating," JP Morgan said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Mountain View, California based LinkedIn closed at$76.38 on Monday on the New York Stock Exchange.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in Bangalore; Editing by SavioD'Souza)	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((siddharth.cavale@thomsonreuters.com; within U.S. +1 646 2238780; outside U.S. +91 80 4135 5800; Reuters Messaging:siddharth.cavale.reuters.com@reuters.net))	Keywords: LINKEDIN/RESEARCH JPMORGAN&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2011.

		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. will present early and mid-stage data from its lung cancer 
      portfolio, including PF-00299804 (PF-299) an investigational, oral, 
      pan-HER inhibitor;1 and crizotinib, an investigational, oral, 
      first-in-class compound that inhibits the anaplastic lymphoma kinase, or 
      ALK,2 at the International Association for the Study of Lung 
      Cancer&#8217;s (IASLC) 14th World Conference on Lung Cancer (WCLC), 
      July 3-7 in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;While lung cancer remains a difficult-to-treat disease, we&#8217;re learning 
      more about how therapies like crizotinib and PF-299 may be able to 
      specifically target ALK or the HER pathway, respectively, and how this 
      may lead to more rationally selected and personalized therapy,&#8221; said 
      Maurizio Voi, MD, Thoracic Tumor Strategy Lead, Pfizer Oncology. &#8220;Data 
      being presented show survival outcomes for PF-299 and crizotinib, as 
      well as quality-of-life or patient-reported outcomes after treatment for 
      patients with non small cell lung cancer, which represent important 
      considerations in determining the best treatment option for these 
      patients.&#8221;

			First Presentation of PF-299 Preliminary Overall Survival Data

      Pfizer will present, for the first time, preliminary overall survival 
      data from a Phase 2 study evaluating PF-299 vs erlotinib in patients 
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) after progression on at 
      least one chemotherapy regimen (oral presentation, Abstract #745, 
      Monday, July 4).1
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer also will present patient-reported outcomes (PRO) from clinical 
      trials of PF-299 in refractory and second-/third-line NSCLC, which 
      provide a better understanding of the patient&#8217;s perspective of the 
      burden of adverse events associated with treatment and how it may change 
      over time.3,4

      Based on results from across the PF-299 clinical trial program, Pfizer 
      has initiated a Phase 3 trial, ARCHER 1009, evaluating PF-299 vs 
      erlotinib for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or 
      metastatic NSCLC following progression after, or intolerance to, at

      Crizotinib is an investigational agent that inhibits ALK, 10 
      which blocks signaling in a number of cell pathways that are believed to 
      be critical for the growth and survival of tumor cells.11,12

&lt;p&gt; (Adds quote, details)	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, June 28 (Reuters) - JP Morgan Chase  Co's 
securities joint venture in China received final approval from
the central government on Tuesday allowing the U.S. investment
bank to tap the country's lucrative stock and bond markets.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The venture, JP Morgan First Capital Securities Co Ltd, will
allow the investment banking giant long-sought access to China's
growing underwriting market. 	
Approval of the tie-up with China's First Capital Securities
Co Ltd was widely expected, after initial approval was granted
to JP Morgan and to Morgan Stanley in January for their
proposed ventures. 	
Other investment banks such as UBS AG , Credit
Suisse Group AG , Deutsche Bank AG (DBKGn.DE) and
Goldman Sachs Group Inc already have similar joint
ventures in China. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "(The joint venture) is of strategic importance to both
partners and central to our shared desire to expand and enhance
the range of services we are able to offer our respective client
bases in China," Gaby Abdelnour, Chairman and CEO of J.P. Morgan
Asia-Pacific, said in a statement. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  First Capital Chairman Liu Xuemin will be chairman of the
joint venture, and Bei Duoguang, an industry veteran who spent
12 years with Chinese investment bank China International
Capital Corp (CICC), will be chief executive. 	
  Chinese IPO markets have exploded in the past two years,
with total proceeds from offerings in 2010 rising to $69
billion, compared with $9.5 billion in 2008, according to
Thomson Reuters data. 	
  China has dominated global IPOs, accounting for about 27
percent of global volume last year. Similarly, the bond market
in China has more than doubled since 2008 to $172 billion in
2010.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - As its fourth "Pirates of the Caribbean" film races to the billion-dollar mark at the worldwide box office, Disney is developing an adventure movie based on another theme-park attraction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This time it's the Matterhorn rollercoaster ride, also known as the Matterhorn Bobsleds, which has been part of Disneyland's Fantasyland section since 1959.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The studio has hired Jason Dean Hall to write a script for the project, which has a working title of "The Hill." The idea is to do a thrilling, fast-paced movie centering on five young adventure seekers who, for mysterious reasons, are called to the top of the mountain and encounter a Yetis on the journey down.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Matterhorn ride was inspired by Walt Disney's desire for a toboggan-themed roller coaster as well as thoughts he had after an extended trip to Switzerland, the site of the famed mountain. The ride, a centerpiece of the park, was refurbished in 1978, with one of the upgrades being the addition of three automatronic Abominable Snowmen (a.k.a. Yetis) who growl at riders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Adapting Disney rides into film franchises is clearly a priority for the company. "Pirates of the Caribbean" is the most successful of the rides-turned-movies, generating $3.7 billion worldwide over four films. A movie was made out of the Haunted Mansion, and another is being developed with Guillermo del Toro producing. "20,000 Leagues Under the Sea" was a Disney film, then a theme park ride, and is now being rebooted as a David Fincher directing vehicle. The ultimate theme park movie might be "Disney's Magic Kingdom," which is set entirely in the park. That project is being developed by writer Michael Chabon and director Jon Favreau.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hall is best known for writing the 2009 indie drama "Spread," starring Ashton Kutcher and Anne Heche. But he has worked on action-oriented projects that are in various development stages, notably "Robin Hood 2058," set up at Warners, "Grand Theft Auto," and sci-fi actioner "Blacklight."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, June 29 (Reuters) - Executives at Coca-Cola
FEMSA, the world's top Coke bottler, said on Wednesday they are
open to further deals, just a day after agreeing a merger with
family-owned bottler Grupo Tampico in Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola FEMSA (KOFL.MX) executives said they believe they
still have a lot of cash and may consider other acquisitions,
after completing their first stock-based deal since the company
went public 18 years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is possible for us to continue to grow ... and
participate in the globalization of the industry in the
different parts of the world," said Chief Executive Carlos
Salazar, on a call with analysts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts have speculated for months that Coca-Cola FEMSA,
which has a $1.1 billion cash pile after generating strong cash
flow for several years, might consider expanding, particularly
since fellow Mexican bottlers Arca ARCA.MX and Contal
CONTAL.MX merged this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Hector Trevino, Coca-Cola FEMSA chief financial officer,
told analysts that the company could consider both cash and
stock-based acquisitions in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola FEMSA expects to complete its $790 million
acquisition of Tampico at the end of the third quarter, pending
regulatory approval, executives said.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, June 29 (Reuters) - JP Morgan is setting up
a new wealth management business in the UK aimed at clients
whose riches fall short of the $25 million needed to qualify for
its private bank, a source familiar with the matter told
Reuters.	&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; According to the source, the new division launches in
September and will be run by Tracy Reddings who is joining from
Societe Generale where she is currently head of UK
private banking at the British unit SG Hambros.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokeswoman at Societe Generale confirmed Reddings had
left.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reddings will build a business for clients with wealth
between $10 million and around $25 million, similar to JP
Morgan's existing private wealth management business in the
United States and Asia.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; She will report to Olivier de Givenchy, head of the private
bank for the UK and Ireland, the source said.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan would not comment.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Clients who are rich - as opposed to super rich - are often
regarded as more attractive by banks because they generate
higher margins, and can make up a more profitable business.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; British private bank Coutts, the wealth arm of Royal Bank of
Scotland recently said it will focus on clients worth
between 1 million pounds and $75 million pounds.

&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Downgrades One Class of JPM 1998-C6
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings has downgraded one class of JP Morgan Commercial Mortgage 
      Finance Corp. (JPM), series 1998-C6 commercial mortgage pass-through 
      certificates. In addition, Fitch has revised the Loss Severity (LS) 
      ratings and assigned Rating Outlooks as applicable. A list of the 
      ratings follows at the end of this press release.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The downgrade is a result of an increase in expected losses on the 
      specially serviced loan. Fitch modeled losses of 11.2% of the remaining 
      pool; expected losses of the original pool are at 3.1%, including losses 
      realized to date. Fitch has identified three Loans of Concern (45.2% of 
      pool balance), which includes one loan currently in special servicing 
      (38.6%). Fitch expects that class H may eventually be fully depleted 
      from losses associated with the specially serviced loan.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As of the June 2011 distribution date, the pool's certificate balance 
      has paid down 92.22% to $61.9 million from $796.4 million at issuance. 
      There are 11 of the original 91 loans remaining in the transaction. 
      There are no defeased loans. Interest shortfalls are affecting classes G 
      and H.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The specially serviced loan, The Court at Deptford, is the largest loan 
      in the pool. The loan is secured by a 361,000 square foot (sf) retail 
      center in Deptford, NJ. The property was previously anchored by a Sam's 
      Club (33% of the property's net rentable area [NRA]), Sports Authority 
      (11% NRA) and Circuit City (9% NRA) - all three of which had 
      subsequently vacated at or prior to the individual lease expirations 
      between 2008 and 2010. Occupancy as of December 2010 reported at 43%, 
      with the three anchor spaces still vacant. Leases corresponding to 
      approximately 11.4% of the property's NRA are scheduled to expire in 
      2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The loan transferred to special servicing in February 2009 due to 
      imminent default. A forbearance agreement has since been executed where 
      the borrower stipulated to a receivership, which in turn limited the 
      trusts ability to foreclose no earlier than June 30, 2011. A receiver 
      was appointed in April 2010, and continues to lease and manage the 
      property.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch stressed the cash flow of the remaining non-specially serviced 
      loans by applying a 5% reduction to most recent fiscal year end (2009  
      2010) net operating income, and applying an adjusted market cap rate 
      between 8% and 11% to determine value.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Similar to Fitch's prospective analysis of recent vintage CMBS, the 
      non-specially serviced loans also underwent a refinance test by applying 
      an 8% interest rate and 30-year amortization schedule based on the 
      stressed cash flow. All 10 of the non-specially serviced loans are 
      considered to pay off at maturity, and could refinance to a debt service 
      coverage ratio (DSCR) above 1.25 times (x).
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch downgrades the following class as indicated:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$19.9 million class G to 'C/RR4' from 'CCC/RR4'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch affirms the following classes and RR Ratings, and revises Outlooks 
      and Loss Severity (LS) ratings as follows:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$39.8 million class F at 'BBB-'; loss severity to 'LS2' from 'LS3'; 
      Outlook to Stable from Negative;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --$2.4 million class H at 'D/RR6'.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Class NR is not rated by Fitch. Due to realized losses class NR has been 
      reduced to zero, and class H has been reduced to $2.4 million from $6 
      million at issuance. Classes A-1, A-2, A-3, B, C, D, and E have paid in 
      full.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On July 16, 2010, Fitch had withdrawn the rating on the interest-only 
      class X. (For additional information on the withdrawal of the ratings on 
      these classes, see 'Fitch Revises Practice for Rating IO  Pre-Payment 
      Related Structured Finance Securities', dated June 23, 2010.)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday approved a $153.6 million settlement between JPMorgan Chase  Co and the top U.S. market regulator over allegations a mortgage CDO product defrauded the bank's investors at the time of the housing market collapse.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and the second-largest U.S. bank announced the settlement on June 21 of civil charges over JPMorgan's collateralized debt obligation (CDO) marketed as Squared CDO 2007-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement was approved at a hearing in New York by U.S. District Judge Richard Berman, who described it as "another important step for the financial industry and the SEC in righting the wrongs of the recent financial crisis."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement echoes on a smaller scale the $550 million accord that Goldman Sachs Group Inc reached last July over its Abacus collateralized debt obligation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both cases involved charges that banks let hedge fund clients structure complex securities -- and then bet against them -- without disclosing their involvement to investors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, SEC lawyer Matthew Martens told Berman that the settlement was in the interests of both parties and in the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;John Savarese, a lawyer for JPMorgan Chase  Co said the matter had been "thoroughly investigated" and the parties had reached "a fair and reasonable agreement."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The SEC also filed civil charges against Edward Steffelin, 41, a former managing director at the now bankrupt GSC Capital Corp, which served as collateral agent for Squared CDO 2007-1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steffelin's case has been assigned to a different judge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan sold $150 million of Squared CDO notes to pension funds and investors worldwide that lost most of their value in just 10 months, the SEC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cases are SEC v. JPMorgan Securities LLC, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 11-04206; and SEC v. Steffelin in the same court, No. 11-04204.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Grant McCool, editing by Gerald E. McCormick, Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

      Business Benefits and Facilitate Migration Processes

		&lt;p&gt;
			Cloud email specialist offers enhanced archiving and eDiscovery 
      capabilities, and 100% service availability SLAs to add value to 
      Microsoft&#8217;s new email offering
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Mimecast&#174;, 
      the leading supplier of cloud-based email 
      archiving, continuity 
      and security 
      for Microsoft 
      Exchange, has today announced that it is offering a full suite of 
      value added cloud services for Office 
      365, Microsoft&#8217;s latest email offering, which launched yesterday.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Deployed in tandem with Microsoft Office 365, Mimecast&#8217;s cloud-based 
      services support organizations adopting the new platform by offering an 
      independent, tamper-proof, long-term email archive with granular 
      eDiscovery and legal hold capabilities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The benefits of Mimecast&#8217;s services for Microsoft Office 365 include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
				100% service availability SLA - Should there be any planned or 
        unplanned outages, during or after the move to Office 365, Mimecast 
        will automatically deliver an uninterrupted email service to end users 
        via their Microsoft Outlook mailboxes
      
			
				A unified system &#8211; Mimecast supports any combination of 
        Exchange &#8211; whether on-premise, hosted or as part of Office 365 &#8211; by 
        enabling centralized policy management and a single organization-wide 
        archive wherever users&#8217; mailboxes reside
      
			
				Legal and compliance support &#8211; Mimecast&#8217;s granular eDiscovery 
        and litigation hold capabilities allow designated personnel to rapidly 
        identify, control and retrieve data. Strong chains of custody are 
        maintained for each message, providing evidential quality data, should 
        it be required
      
			
				Seamless integration &#8211; The Mimecast solution is easy to set-up 
        &#8211; organizations simply have to switch their MX records to point to 
        Mimecast&#8217;s data centers and enable SMTP journaling in Microsoft 
        Exchange Online &#8211; and the archive and continuity capability integrates 
        fully with Microsoft Outlook and Exchange
      
			
				Migration support - Moving historical email to the independent 
        Mimecast archive before migrating to Office 365 protects data from the 
        increased risks associated with any migration process as well as 
        providing a single consolidated message repository for ongoing 
        business benefits
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;With the introduction of Microsoft Office 365, organizations now have a 
      cloud-based alternative to managing their email system in-house,&#8221; 
      commented Peter Bauer, CEO, Mimecast. &#8220;Office 365 offers greater 
      scalability, lower total cost of ownership and the chance to reduce the 
      complexity of the email infrastructure. Mimecast&#8217;s services have always 
      enabled our customers to get maximum value from their investment in 
      Exchange, and our support for Office 365 is no exception. By offering a

			Pfizer and ChemRar High Tech Center Announce Plans to
			Explore 
      Innovative Medical Research and Development Partnership in Russia
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Collaboration focused on addressing unmet medical needs of 
      patients in cancer, cardiovascular, central nervous system, and other 
      major therapeutic areas that impact the Russian population
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and the Russian pharmaceutical investment and 
      RD group ChemRar High Tech Center (ChemRar) announced today that they 
      have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) to explore a 
      collaboration focused on research, development and commercialization of 
      innovative drugs in Russia and other countries. The announcement was 
      made during the BIO International Convention.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The two companies will explore opportunities for accelerated development 
      and commercialization of certain innovative compounds from Pfizer&#8217;s 
      pipeline, through technology transfer and out-licensing deals with 
      venture funding. Through this arrangement, Pfizer and ChemRar plan to 
      develop innovative compounds and vaccines to treat patients with 
      cardiometabolic, infectious and oncology diseases, which are a high 
      priority for the Russian Federation healthcare system.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the terms of the MoU, the two companies can further collaborate 
      with other potential partners, including the Moscow Institute of Physics 
      and Technology, the Skolkovo Foundation and other members of the Russian 
      Biopharmaceutical Cluster &#8220;Northern,&#8221; created under the Federal Target 
      Program of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian Federation. 
      In addition, the companies can establish a shared-risk platform for 
      several Pfizer RD programs designed to achieve clinical candidates and 
      proof of concept in the clinic.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We see Russia as a potential leader in the innovative pharmaceutical, 
      biotechnological and nano-technological areas,&#8221; said David Simmons, 
      President and General Manager, Emerging Markets and Established 
      Products, Pfizer. &#8220;The Pharma 2020 Strategy driven by the Russian 
      Government creates favorable conditions for transition of the Russian 
      pharmaceutical industry to the innovative development model, and Pfizer 
      is excited to be a part of these new opportunities.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Considering the importance of international partnership to our 
      Government&#8217;s vision for Russian business, the expertise of leading 
      pharmaceutical companies such as Pfizer is very important. Agreements 
      such as this are critical to developing the applied sciences and 
      university research in Russia, within the global market environment. We 
      hope our partnership will also help create a belt of small innovative 
      businesses within the Biopharm Cluster &#8220;Northern&#8221; initiative created 
      under the auspices of the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology and 
      fully supported by the Ministry of Industry and Trade of the Russian 
      Federation,&#8221; says Andrey Ivaschenko, Chairman of the Board, ChemRar.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      To expedite cooperation Pfizer and ChemRar will create an Expert 
      Committee, which will include specialists with a high level of 
      experience and expertise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The partnership with ChemRar is an important component of Pfizer&#8217;s 
      broader strategy in Russia named &#8220;MORE THAN,&#8221; which is designed 
      to contribute to the modernization of the national healthcare system, 
      extended life-expectancy, lowered mortality rate and a better quality of 
      life for all Russians. More Than is designed to create value for the 
      Russian people through progressive partnerships aimed at the 
      modernization of the pharmaceutical industry, accelerating the 
      development of medical innovations, and improving access to medicines 
      and better healthcare.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of its investment strategy in Russia, in March 2011 Pfizer 
      announced the agreement with Russian biopharmaceutical company Petrovax 
      Pharm to manufacture Pfizer&#8217;s innovative pneumococcal vaccine in the 
      Moscow region, as well as the June 2011 launch of the capability 
      building program MORE THAN EDUCATION in partnership with 
      Saint-Petersburg, St. Petersburg State Chemical-Pharmaceutical Academy 
      and the Russian biotechnology company Biocad. Pfizer and its partners 
      look forward to contributing to the creation of medical innovations, 
      further modernization of the Russian pharmaceutical industry, improving 
      the national healthcare system and delivering better health and quality 
      of life to Russian citizens.

			Pfizer Nutrition Data Demonstrate that Appropriate Early Child 
      Nutrition May Be Linked to Long-Term Health Outcomes in At-Risk 
      Populations and Picky Eaters
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Data Demonstrate that Appropriate Feeding Practices that Support 
      the Growth and Development of Nutritional-Challenged Children are Key 
      Factors for Long-Term Health Outcomes
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Results from studies presented by Pfizer Nutrition at the 5th 
      Europaediatrics Congress in Vienna provide further evidence that 
      appropriate feeding practices are critical to support the healthy growth 
      and development of at-risk infants and picky eaters facing nutritional 
      challenges. Data from two studies presented at the Congress demonstrate 
      that many infants and children face nutritional challenges, including 
      those who are preterm and low-birthweight, as well as children who are 
      picky eaters.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Nutrition during the first years of life is crucial for life-long health 
      and wellness. The rate of growth of a child is an important indicator of 
      overall health and reflects a child&#8217;s nutritional well-being. 
      Appropriate rate of weight gain in infancy and childhood may lead to 
      more positive weight outcomes later in life.1,2
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The right balance and amount of nutrients a child receives early in 
      life is critical to achieving optimal growth, development and 
      gastrointestinal health - paving the way for a healthy future,&#8221; said 
      John Troup, PhD, vice president, Global Research  Development, Pfizer 
      Nutrition.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the first of two summaries of the study population, results found 
      that specialized nutrition may be indicated for preterm, low-birthweight 
      Chinese infants to appropriately promote catch-up growth in the weeks 
      immediately following discharge from the hospital.3 The goal 
      of this study was to gather further insights and data into the growth of 
      this population, to help guide nutritional management.4 In 
      this study involving 100 infants in China who were preterm and 
      low-birthweight, findings showed that after hospital discharge most 
      infants achieved catch-up growth by 1 month corrected age. Following 
      hospital discharge, specialized nutrition may be indicated for a short 
      duration. Appropriate nutritional management of preterm and 
      low-birthweight infants is critical to prevent potential adverse 
      long-term health consequences.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The second study summary of the same population of preterm, low-birth 
      weight Chinese infants aimed to define the current growth and feeding 
      practices of this group. There are multiple variables that can 
      contribute to infant growth velocity, including gender, feeding type and 
      feeding volume. Study data suggest that high-nutrient density feedings 
      after hospital discharge may contribute to higher weight gain velocity 
      in some preterm, low-birthweight infants. These findings reinforce the 
      importance of making appropriate feeding decisions specific to each 
      individual infant, and of ensuring that nutritional intake is monitored 
      and modified based on a preterm infant&#8217;s growth progress.5
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Children who are picky eaters (PE) also may have inadequate nutrient 
      intake and are more likely to be underweight at early school age as 
      compared to non-PE children. PE children typically skip meals, consume a 
      limited number of foods, do not have interest in food, eat slowly and 
      eat little. A study examined the effects of standardized nutrition 
      counseling with and without the consumption of growing-up milk on growth 
      and nutrient adequacy of children who are picky eaters. Data showed that 
      consumption of growing-up milk in conjunction with nutrition counseling 
      promoted better growth and nutrient intake than nutrition counseling 
      alone in PE children. In addition, growing-up milk was found to be 
      well-tolerated and accepted by study participants.6

			About the Pfizer-Sponsored Studies
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The preterm infant trial was a multicenter, prospective, observational 
      study at three hospitals in China. Infants who were born at or before 34 
      weeks gestation and were less than 2000g at birth were enrolled at the 
      time of hospital discharge. Both summaries resulted from this trial.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The first summary of the preterm study, &#8220;New Evidence in the Growth 
      of Chinese Preterm, Low-Birthweight Infants After Hospital Discharge,&#8221; 
      evaluated anthropometrics (weight, length and head circumference) at 
      hospital discharge, term (40 weeks), one and two months corrected age. 
      The main outcome measure was weight gain velocity (WGV). Secondary 
      outcomes included weight, length and head circumference-for-age Z-scores 
      using a fetal-infant growth chart reference.7
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In the second summary of the preterm study, &#8220;New Insight into Feeding 
      Practices and Growth of Post-Discharge Preterm Infants in China,&#8221; 
      anthropometry and feeding (formula and human milk) information was 
      collected at hospital discharge, term (40 weeks), one and two months 
      corrected age. Infants were stratified by WGV tertile; tertile 1 37g/d, 
      tertile 2 37-44g/d, tertile 3 =44g/d; growth and feeding within each 
      tertile was evaluated. Feeding data was collected using a 1-day feeding 
      record prior to each study timepoint. Feedings were categorized by 
      nutrient density: standard (640-690 kcal/L); moderate (700-770 kcal/L); 
      and high (800-820 kcal/L).8
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Another study, &#8220;Effects of Nutrition Counseling with and without 
      Growing-up Milk on Growth and Nutrient Adequacy in Picky Eaters: a 
      Randomized Controlled Trial,&#8221; was an in-market, multicenter, 
      randomized controlled trial conducted in China (4 sites in Mainland 
      China, and 1 site in Hong Kong). Chinese PE children 2.5-5 years old 
      with weight-for-height 25th percentile were randomized to 
      Control group to receive nutrition counseling alone or Study group to 
      receive nutrition counseling plus recommended 2 servings/day of 
      growing-up milk for 120 days. Of the 153 enrolled children, 131 
      completed the study. Subject demographics and baseline anthropometric 
      data were comparable between the Study and Control groups.9
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In this study, the Study group experienced significantly greater 
      increases in z-scores for weight-for-height (primary growth outcome) and 
      weight-for-age than the Control group. Additionally, the Study group 
      experienced a significantly greater intake of total energy, protein, 
      carbohydrate, key long-chain fatty acids (docosahexaenoic acid [DHA] and 
      arachidonic acid [ARA]), and specific micronutrients (calcium, iron, 
      zinc and vitamins A, D, E, C, B6) than the Control group at 120 days.10 
      Incidence of physician-reported GI events in this study was low and 
      similar between the two treatment groups.11

      component of Visa&#8217;s partnership with Kiva to help U.S. small businesses 
      by expanding their awareness and understanding of microfinance 
      opportunities. The Kiva City program, kicking off in Detroit, was 
      launched as part of a commitment announced today by President Bill 
      Clinton on stage at the Clinton Global Initiative America conference in 
      Chicago.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Kiva City aims to spur job growth and economic recovery by connecting 
      Kiva&#8217;s global network of 592,000 individual lenders with the owners of 
      small businesses throughout the country. With very few microfinance 
      institutions operating at scale in the U.S., Kiva City helps address 
      this challenge by tapping the power of local communities to come 
      together and bring Kiva to their city, particularly those whose small 
      business communities have been most impacted by the recent economic 
      downturn. According to a new study by the Economist Intelligence Unit, 
      commissioned by Kiva and Visa, 20 of the nation&#8217;s 50 largest 
      metropolitan statistical areas have lost at least one percent of their 
      small businesses from 2006 to 2008. This represents approximately 15,000 
      businesses.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Kiva City program launches today in Detroit, which ranked fifth in 
      the study&#8217;s list of the top U.S. small business trouble spots. The 
      microloans, made possible through Kiva&#8217;s lending partnership with 
      microlender ACCION USA, a member of the ACCION Network in the U.S., will 
      offer Detroit area small businesses an additional option for accessing 
      capital that can be used to fund operations, ranging from purchasing 
      equipment and paying rent, to hiring and retaining employees, to 
      offering promotions.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Since launching in the U.S. two years ago, we have worked with our 
      partners to replicate our successful global model, empowering each and 
      every American to help our economy by adding as little as $25 to a small 
      business owner&#8217;s loan,&#8221; said Premal Shah, co-founder of Kiva.org. &#8220;But 
      as our study shows, the needs in the U.S. are widespread and many 
      regions simply don&#8217;t have microfinance institutions operating at scale. 
      Now, spurred by Visa&#8217;s commitment to small business, we are able to 
      expand our reach and, as a result, open new avenues of capital for small 
      business owners across the country.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			How the Program Works
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      With Kiva City, civic leaders and community members alike have the 
      opportunity to effect meaningful change. The new program extends Kiva&#8217;s 
      Internet-based lending model to underserved communities throughout the 
      country&#8212;even where microfinance institutions have yet to establish local 
      branches. Working in concert with Kiva and microlending partners, 
      communities join forces and commit the resources to conduct 
      on-the-ground outreach to small business owners to support the three 
      components of microlending: sourcing the businesses to apply for 
      microloans, administering the loans and funding the loans. The average 
      size of Kiva&#8217;s field partner loans in the U.S. is $7,000.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;ACCION USA is the vital link between Kiva lenders, communities and the 
      small business owners in Detroit who need our help,&#8221; said Gina Harman, 
      President and CEO of ACCION Network in the U.S. &#8220;With the visibility, 
      community group connections and committed loan funds provided by Kiva, 
      we believe Kiva City and its launch in Detroit will serve as a model for 
      bringing solutions to more cities across America.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Detroit became the first Kiva City in partnership with Michigan Corps, a 
      social network of local and global Michiganders committed to positive 
      change in their home state. &#8220;Through our partnership with Kiva and 
      ACCION USA, we&#8217;ve been able to bring the tools of microfinance to our 
      neighborhood businesses so that they can invest in their growth. Through 
      local networking events, church gatherings, and neighborhood BBQs, we 
      have built an engaged community of small business owners and lenders 
      alike. Detroit is proud to be the pioneer of the Kiva City model.&#8221; said 
      Anuja Jaitly, co-founder and executive director of Michigan Corps.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			U.S. Small Business Trouble Spots
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Kiva and Visa Study of Small Business Trouble Spots looked at 
      small business trends in the 50 largest metropolitan areas to identify 
      the degree of small business stress there. Some of the more heavily 
      affected regions, like Detroit, also experienced decreases in their 
      employment levels by more than five percent.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The ten regions that experienced the greatest losses of small businesses 
      were:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        Cleveland-Elyria-Mentor, Ohio
      
			
        Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, Florida
      
			
        Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
      
			
        Columbus, Ohio

		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Our work, which includes providing products, services and resources to 
      the small business community, confirms that while the economic 
      challenges that small businesses have faced recently are very real, 
      small business owners are resilient and optimistic,&#8221; said William M. 
      Sheedy, Group President, Americas, Visa. &#8220;We are pleased to continue to 
      work in partnership with organizations like Kiva to help serve small 
      business owners and spur job creation.&#8221;

			SAIC, Tetra Tech Joint Venture Awarded U.S. Department of StateCriminal 
      Justice Program Support (CJPS) Contract
		&lt;/p&gt;

      Integrated Justice Systems International, LLC (IJSI), has been awarded a

			Autodesk Vault Works with Microsoft SharePoint 2010 to Provide Access 
      to Design Information Across the Enterprise
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Autodesk, 
      Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) announced Autodesk Vault 2012 software now works 
      with Microsoft SharePoint 2010 and Microsoft SQL Server 2008 R2 to 
      facilitate access to design information across the enterprise. 
      Autodesk&#8217;s data management software works with the Microsoft 
      collaboration platform to simplify business intelligence, content 
      management, search and sharing functions for intranet and Internet sites 
      &#8213; all while building a crucial connection between design teams and an 
      extended business enterprise.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Autodesk Vault works with SharePoint 2010 to help enterprises be more 
      productive and profitable by facilitating sharing of and access to 
      information throughout the lifecycle of any project,&#8221; said &#199;a&#287;layan 
      Arkan, General Manager, Worldwide Manufacturing  Resources Sector at 
      Microsoft Corp. &#8220;Vault provides the world&#8217;s designers, architects, 
      engineers, builders and manufacturers with a complete view of their 
      information, while enabling access across the entire organization.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      On any design project, hundreds of people may be using dozens of 
      specialized applications to create thousands of models and drawings. In 
      addition to this design data, a significant amount of &#8220;nondesign&#8221; 
      information surrounds most projects: contracts, bid documents, 
      photographs, emails and more. Vault working with Microsoft provides an 
      extended enterprise &#8212; including nondesign professionals &#8212; with the 
      ability to share and manage engineering and design data through familiar 
      Microsoft SharePoint 2010 workflows. The solution takes advantage of 
      features and functionality provided in SharePoint 2010 and Autodesk 
      Vault 2012, giving SharePoint 2010 users direct access to engineering 
      and design data within Vault, including easy search and navigation, and 
      the ability to view and print design data.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Global companies such as Joy 
      Mining, are eager to reap the benefits of the Vault/SharePoint 
      integration.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;As a strategic partner of both Autodesk and Microsoft, we at Joy are 
      very excited about this collaborative development as it will enable us 
      to further leverage our investments in SharePoint and Vault by allowing 
      us to make our CAD models available to a wider audience,&#8221; said Chris 
      Flynn, global director of engineering systems at Joy Mining Machinery. 
      &#8220;We expect to dramatically improve the efficiency of our processes for 
      outsourcing collaboration as well as our core engineering communication. 
      Furthermore, the cost of implementing the application is minimized since 
      both the IT organization and the end user are already familiar with 
      SharePoint. We look forward to working with Autodesk and Microsoft in 
      the near future on realizing this potential.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Additional benefits include:
    &lt;/p&gt;
		
			
        SharePoint 2010 users now have direct access to Building Information 
        Modeling (BIM) and Digital Prototyping data within Vault and can 
        incorporate it into existing enterprise data, tools and processes.
      
			
        Autodesk Vault 2012 users now have the ability to take advantage of 
        the latest social computing enhancements provided in Microsoft 
        SharePoint 2010 through video conferencing, capturing discussions, 
        voting mechanisms, mining expertise and business intelligence.
      
			
        Federated searching enables users to do a single search to quickly 
        aggregate results from both SharePoint and Vault applications, helping 
        users increase productivity without changing the way they work.
      
			
        Seamlessly allows technology from SharePoint 2010 and Autodesk Vault 
        2012 that runs on Microsoft Windows-based servers, utilizes Microsoft 
        Web Services and SQL Server technology.
      
		
		&lt;p&gt;
      The collaboration between Microsoft and Autodesk extends beyond 
      SharePoint 2010 to Microsoft Office 2010, including Microsoft Outlook 
      2010, Microsoft Word 2010, Microsoft PowerPoint 2010 and Microsoft Excel 
      2010, enabling users to be more productive with their everyday tools. 
      Colleagues, customers and partners can share content and information in 
      a familiar environment, whether reading a DOC file or printing a DWG 
      drawing. The solution is easy to deploy, enabling customers to get up 
      and running immediately.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;More than ever, clear communication and easy access to accurate data 
      are the keys to success for any business,&#8221; said Steven Bodnar, vice 
      president of data management at Autodesk. &#8220;Competitive enterprises need 
      to collaborate beyond their boundaries in order to strengthen their 
      relationships and cooperation with their customers, partners and 
      vendors. This is especially true for design and manufacturing 
      organizations working with globally distributed teams.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) made its biggest move into the mobile, Internet-accessible world of "cloud" computing on Tuesday, taking the wraps off a revamped online version of its hugely profitable Office software suite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's largest software company is heaving its two-decade old set of applications -- including Outlook email, Excel spreadsheets and SharePoint collaboration tools -- into an online format so that customers can use them on a variety of devices from wherever they can get an Internet connection.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It wants to push back against Google Inc (GOOG.O), which has stolen a small but worrying percentage of corporate customers with Google Apps -- a cheaper, Web-only alternative that removes the need for companies to spend time on installing software or managing servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Steve Ballmer presented the overhauled and updated set of offerings -- collectively called Office 365 -- at an event in New York City on Tuesday morning, stressing that online versions and built-in conferencing tools can save users money, especially small and medium-sized businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The full launch of Office 365, which has been in beta testing since last autumn, spices up the lively competition with Google for new users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"While Office 365 does put Microsoft in mortal combat with Google, it is not really an existential threat for Google since Microsoft is essentially validating the model that Google pioneered with Google Apps," said Matt Cain, an analyst at tech research firm Gartner. "I would expect that Office 365 actually heightens interest in Google Apps."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft shares were up 2.4 percent on Tuesday afternoon, following a 3.7 percent jump the day before, partly buoyed by hopes that the company can ultimately boost profits by extending its software dominance to the growing cloud sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has offered online versions of some Office programs -- chiefly Outlook email -- for its corporate customers for several years, and last year rolled out free versions for individual home users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The biggest thing I like about it is that it takes the need to manage servers away and puts it in someone else's hands," said Kevin Lisota, CEO of Seattle real estate startup Findwell, which has five employees and has been using the test version of the product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It takes our email and team Internet sites and basically makes that Microsoft's problem so I don't have to worry about that," said Lisota, who was invited by Microsoft to an Office 365 launch event at its headquarters near Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GROWING MARKET&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market for Web-based software services is heating up, and every company, government department and local authority is getting pitches from Microsoft and Google whenever they re-evaluate their office software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a new challenge for Microsoft, which built itself up on expensive versions of software installed on individual computers. That business model turned the Office unit into Microsoft's most profitable, earning more than $3 billion alone last quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's plan is to make up for smaller profit margins from Web-based applications -- due to the cost of handling data and keeping up servers -- by grabbing a larger slice of companies' overall technology spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it will charge from $2 per user per month for basic email services to $27 per user per month for advanced offerings, with a standard, small business package priced at $6 per user per month. Google charges a flat fee of $50 per user per year for its Web-based Google Apps product, which offers email, calendars, word processing and more online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft, like Google, will host users' data remotely, and maintain all the servers in vast data centres. Unlike Google, it will also allow companies to put their data on dedicated servers should they choose, or keep the data on their own premises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, which has had the most success in the small and medium-sized business range, says there are now 40 million users of online Google Apps suite. Microsoft does not publish equivalent numbers, but research firm comScore has estimated 750 million people worldwide use Office in some form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Internet-centric Google -- whose success is based on its dominance in Web search -- is confident it has the upper hand in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Compared to what they (Microsoft) have in the market today, they have nowhere to go but up," said Dave Girouard, head of Google's worldwide enterprise business, in an interview last week. "We feel we're years ahead of them in terms of building a viable cloud solution that just works." (Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Gerald E. McCormick and Matthew Lewis)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Visa for foreign property buyers extended to 3 years&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * UAE property stocks rise on the move&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
 (Adds details, background, stock prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DUBAI, June 29 (Reuters) - A decision to extend visa tenures
for real estate investors will "significantly" boost investor
confidence in the United Arab Emirates' struggling property
sector, the head of the country's largest developer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UAE government said on Tuesday that it has extended
visas for foreign property buyers to three years from the
existing six months, as the Gulf state looks to boost investment
in its struggling property market. [ID:nLDE75R1EW]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The UAE federal cabinet decision ... will significantly
enhance investor confidence and drive the growth of the
country's property sector," Mohammed Alabbar, chairman of
Dubai's Emaar Properties EMAR.DU, said in a statement on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Property stocks rose as a result of Tuesday's announcement
with Emaar rising 1.7 percent by 0930 GMT and builder Arabtec's
ARTC.DU shares gaining 1.6 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In neighbouring Abu Dhabi, Aldar Properties ALDR.AD, the
emirate's largest developer by market value increased 0.8
percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently, foreign owners of property worth more than 1
million dirhams ($272,300) in the UAE have to renew their visa
every six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a research note, Citigroup said the decision could
significantly boost demand in Dubai's residential real estate
sector, where the promise of a long-term residency visa was a
major driver of second-home purchases during the boom prior to
mid-2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "However, the overall impact on the property market will
likely be somewhat muted by oversupply issues that are being
exacerbated by the ongoing completion of new properties," 
analyst Farouk Soussa said in the note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Dubai's property sector has been hit hard in recent years
with billions of dollars worth of projects put on hold or
cancelled, while prices slumped as much as 60 percent largely
due to lack of buyers in the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The emirate's Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) said
earlier this year it cancelled as many as 217 registered
property projects over the past two years. [ID:nLDE75B026]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RERA has been taken a number of steps to improve regulation
and transparency of Dubai's property sector, such as laws for
property maintenance, but more needs to be done to tempt
overseas investors back to Dubai after the collapse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; More clarity on the mortgage law and visa regulations are
among further steps that need to be introduced, analysts have
said.

&lt;p&gt; * Top Coke bottler agrees deal worth 9.3 billion pesos&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Grupo Tampico is family-owned Mexican bottler&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Merger is a share deal; Coca-Cola FEMSA takes on debt
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gabriela Baczynska	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MONTERREY, Mexico, June 28 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola FEMSA, the
world's top Coke bottler  , said on Tuesday it
has agreed to a merger with a family-owned Mexican bottler in a
deal worth 9.3 billion pesos ($790 million).	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some six months after two of Coca-Cola FEMSA's local rivals
announced a merger to create powerful competition, the bottler
said it was absorbing the beverage division of conglomerate
Grupo Tampico, which has four bottling plants.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola FEMSA, sitting on $1.1 billion in money saved
after generating strong cash flow for several years, had been
tipped to spend some of its savings this year, although few
analysts had pinpointed Grupo Tampico as a target.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola FEMSA, a joint venture of Monterrey-based drinks
maker FEMSA  and The Coca-Cola Company
 , will give Grupo Tampico shares to pay for the deal and
said it was still subject to shareholder and regulatory
approval.	
 "As a result of this merger, Grupo Tampico will receive 63.5
million new series L KOF shares worth 103.20 each," Coca-Cola
FEMSA said in a statement, referring to its abbreviation as KOF.	
 Coca-Cola FEMSA, which hopes to finalize the merger in the
third quarter, will take on around 2.8 billion pesos in net
debt, while two of Grupo Tampico's directors will take an
alternating seat on Coca-Cola FEMSA's board, the company said.	
 The combined operations of the two companies will bottle
about 45 percent of the Coca-Cola Company's volume in Mexico,
one of the biggest per-capita Coke guzzlers in the world.	
 FEMSA's chief financial officer, Hector Trevino, said the
merger would also bring cost savings of between 180 million and
270 million pesos.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those savings should come from economies of scale and shared
logistics and capacity benefits, he told Reuters.	
 With Grupo Tampico, Coca-Cola FEMSA's sales volumes are
likely to increase by up to 12 percent in Mexico, he added.	
 	
 OPPORTUNITIES BOTTLE UP 	
 Coca-Cola FEMSA's motivation for the deal appeared to come
from fears it would lose out on a consolidating bottling market
in Mexico.	
 Mexican bottlers Arca and Contal in
January agreed to merge to create the world's No.3 Coca-Cola
bottler, behind Coca-Cola FEMSA and Greece's Coca-Cola Hellenic
HLBr.AT, and closed the deal earlier this month.	
 Given the enduring popularity of Coca-Cola and its range of
fizzy drinks in Latin America, analysts say Coca-Cola FEMSA
still has room to expand with some 40 bottlers operating across
the region.	
 Shares in Coca-Cola FEMSA have gained almost 8 percent this
year while Mexico's overall index of leading shares has slumped
and analysts say the company could go after smaller bottlers in
southern Mexico and in Chile.	
 The company bought a dairy products company in Panama last
October as it seeks to tap into new trends in health and diet
drinks. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Additional reporting by Robin Emmott in Monterrey and

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Thursday said it will turn the lights off on Hohm, an electricity-monitoring tool intended to help people find ways to reduce power consumption. Hohm will go dark on May 31, 2012.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&#8220;The feedback from customers and partners has remained encouraging throughout Microsoft Hohm&#8217;s beta period,&#8221; the company wrote in a blog post. &#8220;However, due to the slow overall market adoption of the service, we are instead focusing our efforts on products and solutions more capable of supporting long-standing growth within this evolving market.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The announcement comes only days after Google announced it was pulling the plug on PowerMeter, its own electricity monitoring tool. PowerMeter will be retired even earlier, on Sept. 16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google also cited low usage rates as the reason for shutting down its PowerMeter product. Because the two products were so similar and lagging in customers, it appears both Microsoft and Google were simply waiting for the other to blink first &#8212; a game of green chicken, if you will.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite shutting down Hohm, Microsoft said it will &#8220;continue to focus on developing products, solutions and partnerships that span a wide spectrum of industries, such as power generation, distribution grids, buildings and transportations systems.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you a user of Hohm?

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As many as 12,000 federal prison inmates convicted for crimes related to crack cocaine may serve shorter sentences as a result of a unanimous vote on Thursday of a federal commission.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States Sentencing Commission, a seven-member body that sets sentencing guidelines, voted to retroactively apply the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That act of Congress sought to even out sentencing disparities between powdered cocaine users, who historically have been sentenced to less time, and crack cocaine users who have been sentenced more harshly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Crack is the colloquial term for processed cocaine in the form of rock crystals which produce vapors when heated that are smoked, according to the National Institutes of Health. Crack is generally cheaper than the unprocessed form.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Congress recognized the fundamental unfairness of federal cocaine sentencing policy and ameliorated it through bipartisan legislation," Commission chair Judge Patti Saris said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commission estimates that 12,000 offenders may be eligible to seek a sentence reduction of an average of 37 months. The average sentence will still be about ten years, but the reductions will save over $200 million in prison housing costs, the statement, said citing the Bureau of Prisons.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Human rights groups applauded the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's vote will give thousands of men and women the opportunity to seek reductions in their sentences in line with the new law. Correcting these sentences will go a long way toward alleviating some of the pain felt by the families and communities most impacted by this disparity," the Civil and Human Rights Coalition said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Wendell Marsh; Editing by Greg McCune)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A jury in Maryland ordered oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp to pay more than $495 million in damages for a leak from a gas station in 2006, the Baltimore Sun reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sun, citing documents released by Baltimore County Circuit Court, said the jury had given the awards to 160 families and businesses to compensate for lost property, emotional distress and medical monitoring related to damage from the underground leak of 26,000 gallons of gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The leak, which occurred from a pressurized line at the retail station over 37 days in January and February in 2006, reached the groundwater in the community that relies on private wells for drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Reuters was not immediately able to verify the damages, and Exxon Mobil was not able to comment on the report because the judge in the case, Robert Dugan, has imposed a gag order on the parties while the six-person jury remains in session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is the second related to the spill. The jury in the first lawsuit, which involved fewer plaintiffs, awarded $150 million in compensatory damages. Exxon Mobil has appealed that verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An Exxon lawyer told the jury on Tuesday that the company had already spent more than $46 million on the spill's cleanup and been fined $4 million by the state, the paper reported.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily; Editing by Derek Caney)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, June 30 (Reuters) - A jury in Maryland ordered
oil giant Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) to pay more than $495
million in damages for a leak from a gas station in 2006, the
Baltimore Sun reported on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Sun, citing documents released by Baltimore County
Circuit Court, said the jury had given the awards to 160
families and businesses to compensate for lost property,
emotional distress and medical monitoring related to damage
from the underground leak of 26,000 gallons of gasoline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The leak, which occurred from a pressurized line at the
retail station over 37 days in January and February in 2006,
reached the groundwater in the community that relies on private
wells for drinking water.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Reuters was not immediately able to verify the damages, and
Exxon Mobil was not able to comment on the report because the
judge in the case, Robert Dugan, has imposed a gag order on the
parties while the six-person jury remains in session.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is the second related to the spill. The jury in
the first lawsuit, which involved fewer plaintiffs, awarded
$150 million in compensatory damages. Exxon Mobil has appealed
that verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An Exxon lawyer told the jury on Tuesday that the company
had already spent more than $46 million on the spill's cleanup
and been fined $4 million by the state, the paper reported.

			Goldman Sachs and BlackRock Complete Electronically Executed and 
      Centrally Cleared Credit Default Swap Trade
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE: BLK) today announced 
      the completion of a CDX investment-grade index trade that was executed 
      electronically and centrally cleared. This CDS trade is significant in 
      that it demonstrates end-to-end integration across swap execution, 
      affirmation and clearing.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The transaction between Goldman Sachs and BlackRock was executed via the 
      Tradeweb platform and centrally cleared through CME Group, with Goldman 
      Sachs as the clearing agent. The trade successfully demonstrated full 
      end-to-end connectivity across swap execution and a central counterparty 
      (CCP), which will be essential in order to facilitate successful 
      implementation of several key goals of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform 
      and Consumer Protection Act.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;This trade is another milestone toward helping our clients prepare for 
      implementation of Dodd Frank requirements,&#8221; said Jack McCabe Co-Head of 
      Futures and Derivative Clearing Services (DCS) at Goldman Sachs. 
      &#8220;Goldman Sachs is pleased to provide market leading execution and 
      clearing services to our clients.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The coordination among BlackRock and Goldman Sachs&#8217; credit trading 
      franchise and DCS businesses demonstrates the continued commitment by 
      Goldman Sachs to assist industry participants in compliance with Dodd 
      Frank regulation.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;BlackRock is fully supportive of central clearing and these trades are 
      an important step forward in offering clients a viable clearing 
      solution,&#8221; commented Supurna VedBrat, Managing Director and co-head of 
      the market structure and electronic trading team at BlackRock.

      Fitch: No Impact on Coca Cola Femsa's Ratings From Grupo Tampico 
      Acquisition
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch Ratings views the agreement reached by Coca Cola Femsa, S.A.B. de 
      C.V. (KOF) to merge the bottling operations of Grupo Tampico, S.A. de 
      C.V. (Grupo Tampico) to have no material impact to the credit quality of 
      KOF. The all share transaction will not significantly change the 
      company's financial profile or credit metrics. In addition, Fitch 
      considers that Grupo Tampico's contiguous franchise territories, 
      production facilities, distribution network and expected synergies will 
      slightly improve KOF's business position. The transaction was valued at 
      MXN9.3 billion and will be settled with the issuance of 63.5 million of 
      new KOF's shares (series L). The consolidation of Grupo Tampico will add 
      to KOF's balance sheet a net debt of approximately MXN2.7 billion.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Grupo Tampico operates mainly in the states of Tamaulipas, San Luis 
      Potosi and Veracruz located in the Northeast of Mexico as well as in 
      Hidalgo, Puebla and Queretaro. The company has four bottling plants and 
      25 distribution centers. Grupo Tampico should sell close to MXN4.4 
      billion and 154 million unit cases during 2011.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      KOF's ratings are supported by its solid financial position, good 
      operating performance and strong business profile. The ratings also 
      factor in the company's strategic relationship with The Coca-Cola 
      Company (KO) and the explicit and implicit financial support KOF has 
      received from KO. The ratings are constrained by the highly competitive 
      nature of the beverage industry, the economic volatility present in its 
      territories and possible potential acquisitions. KOF maintains a solid 
      financial profile supported by positive volume and revenue growth in all 
      of its markets, good profitability and a robust free cash flow 
      generating capacity.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Fitch currently rates KOF as follows
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Foreign Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Local Currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) 'A';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --National Scale Long Term Rating 'AAA(mex)';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --National Scale Short Term Rating 'F1+(mex)';
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      --Senior Notes for USD500 million 'A'
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      The Rating Outlook is Stable.
    &lt;/p&gt;

      Turkey
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Sjoerd Leenart to head Middle East and North Africa region; Emre 
      Derman to run Turkey
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      J.P. Morgan announced today that it has appointed Sjoerd Leenart to be 
      the Senior Country Officer of the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) 
      region, based in Dubai. The firm has also hired Emre Derman to be Senior 
      Country Officer of Turkey. Both executives will report to Emilio 
      Saracho, head of Investment Banking for Europe, the Middle East and 
      Africa.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;These appointments represent our continued commitment to the region,&#8221; 
      said Saracho. &#8220;We have made no secret about our expansion plans and we 
      are confident that Sjoerd and Emre will continue to grow and maximize 
      opportunities in those markets.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Senior Country Officers are responsible for building and managing J.P. 
      Morgan&#8217;s regional presence across lines of business, including the 
      Investment Bank, Asset Management, Treasury  Securities Services and 
      the Global Corporate Bank. They play a central role in delivering the 
      firm&#8217;s global capabilities to local clients.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Leenart has been with J.P. Morgan for 17 years and has held numerous 
      roles. Most recently he was co-head of Debt Capital Markets and Sales  
      Marketing for Central and Eastern Europe, the Middle East, Africa and 
      Latin America.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;It&#8217;s a privilege to take on this important and prestigious role at J.P. 
      Morgan,&#8221; said Leenart. &#8220;We have built great momentum in the region and I 
      look forward to building out the franchise further.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Derman joins J.P. Morgan with a successful legal career, advising on a 
      broad range of major corporate transactions in the Turkish market. He 
      spent 18 years at law firm White  Case in Istanbul and London as a 
      senior associate and partner. He managed the Istanbul office achieving 
      record fiscal performance and growth.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;I&#8217;m excited to join J.P. Morgan, which has a long, successful track 
      record in Turkey,&#8221; said Derman. &#8220;I&#8217;ll be able to provide local clients 
      with the expertise, products and financial strength of J.P. Morgan&#8217;s 
      global network behind me.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Leenart and Derman effectively take on responsibilities that were once 
      held by Murad Megalli, the former head of the region who died in a plane 
      accident earlier this year. Mark Garvin, chairman of Treasury  
      Securities Services International, has been temporarily acting as the 
      interim Senior Country Officer for the MENA region.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			JAAS Systems migrates its leading mid-market manufacturing solution 
      to the Acumatica Cloud so companies can access fully integrated 
      accounting, distribution, and manufacturing
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Acumatica and JAAS Systems, providers of Cloud ERP software, today 
      announced the availability of a fully integrated manufacturing,

      from a web-browser no matter where they are located.
    &lt;/p&gt;

			EA Launches Procter and Gamble&#8217;s First Social Gaming Campaign in 
      Playfish Social Game Restaurant City
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
			Cleaning Becomes Entertaining and Social Through Virtual Gifts and 
      Game Challenges Featuring Bounty Paper Towel Products
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Electronic Arts Inc. (NASDAQ:ERTS) today announced a collaboration with 
      Procter and Gamble to feature its Bounty&#174; products in the popular 
      Playfish&#8482; Restaurant City social game. Players will be able to 
      utilize Bounty products to further enhance their Restaurant City 
      gameplay experience and interactions with friends on Facebook&#174;. The 
      collaboration will feature the integration of Bounty paper towel 
      products in fun and relevant ways and will feature product centric 
      in-game challenges.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      In Restaurant City, players create and manage virtual restaurants 
      and employ their Facebook&#174; friends as waiters and chefs. Players select 
      from a variety of themes, furniture and equipment to customize and 
      personalize their restaurants for a unique social gaming experience. 
      Players can also visit their friends' restaurants and trade culinary 
      ingredients to create tasty menus which guarantee their restaurant is a 
      virtual foodie favorite. Now Restaurant City players can use 
      special Bounty in-game products just as they would in real-life to make 
      sure their restaurants are in tip-top shape.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Bounty recognized the unique opportunity to build brand awareness and 
      preference amongst the relevant and engaged player audience in Restaurant 
      City,&#8221; said Dave Madden, Senior Vice President of Global Media Sales 
      at Electronic Arts. &#8220;This collaboration allows us to not only enhance 
      the gameplay within Restaurant City in an authentic way but also 
      provides Bounty with a vehicle to build brand affinity with Restaurant 
      City players.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;We are incredibly excited for Bounty to become an integral part of Restaurant 
      City during this campaign,&#8221; said Ihsan Leggett, Assistant Brand 
      Manager for Bounty Paper Towels. &#8220;This is a big test for Bounty and PG 
      as we look to see if we should make further investments into social 
      gaming. We expect great engagement from our consumers in Restaurant 
      City.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As part of this multifaceted campaign, Restaurant City players 
      that &#8220;Like&#8221; the Bounty Facebook page are rewarded with a decorative 
      Bounty Tower that when displayed in players&#8217; restaurants adds five 
      popularity points to their restaurants. Players will also be presented 
      with two &#8220;Bounty Challenges&#8221; that kick-start their cleaning quest and 
      opens the door to earning a special Bounty paper towel roll and a 
      dutiful Bounty Janitor to keep things spotless in their restaurants. In 
      the first Bounty Challenge, players are tasked with getting their 
      restaurants &#8220;Bounty Clean&#8221; by cleaning five messy spills. Upon 
      completing this task, players are awarded with a Bounty paper towel roll 
      that gives them the ability to clean their entire restaurant with one 
      mouse click. In the second Bounty Challenge, players are asked to use 
      their Bounty paper towel roll to clean their restaurants five times to 
      receive the services of the Bounty Janitor who can clean the restaurant 
      30% faster than a traditional Restaurant City janitor. The depth 
      of this integration has been designed to reflect the real-world 
      attributes of Bounty products in relevant ways for players within the 
      game.

&lt;p&gt;BANGALORE (Reuters) - The revised Federal Reserve rules governing how much banks charge retailers to process debit card purchases was given a big thumbs-up by some analysts, who expect the rules to be a huge boost to card networks Visa (V.N) and MasterCard (MA.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe the most significant threat to Visa and MasterCard profitability has been dramatically reduced," Chris Brendler of Stifel Nicolaus said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks pay card networks like Visa and MasterCard for processing debit transactions, and the softened rule is a victory for big banks like Bank of America (BAC.N) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), and card networks like Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new rule, banks would be allowed to charge as much as 22 cents per debit card transaction, which includes a one-cent allowance for meeting certain fraud prevention standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The final rules are a clear positive as a higher interchange cap could lessen pricing pressure from large bank issuers," Robert W. Baird analyst David Koning said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe Visa and MasterCard become more investable again, as the regulatory cloud lifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market capitalization of four largest U.S. card networks -- Visa (V.N), MasterCard (MA.N), American Express (AXP.N) and Discover (DFS.N) -- gained about $14 billion on Wednesday after the Fed's vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citigroup said while it was "incrementally more positive on the networks, given the sharp rise in Visa and Mastercard's share prices, it would look for "a better entry point," and would instead be buyers of American Express and Capital One (COF.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, banks still stand to lose billions of dollars in revenue despite the increased cap. Swipe fees in 2009 were $16.2 billion, according to the Fed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Banks are still taking a significant 46 percent hit to their debit interchange revenues, which will have an impact on debit programs and drive mitigation efforts such as new customer fees," Citigroup analyst Ashwin Shirvaikar said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks have said they will have to find ways to offset the losses through other fees and have raised doubts that merchants will pass along any savings to consumers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bank and merchant lobbies are sure to push for further changes more to their liking. We view these potential actions as important to monitor, but unlikely to have a truly meaningful impact for the foreseeable future," FBR Capital's Scott Valentin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Brenton Cordeiro; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)&lt;/p&gt;

			BioPontis Alliance Enters into Translational Technology Development 
      Agreement with Pfizer
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BioPontis Alliance, LLC, announced today at the 2011 BIO International 
      Convention in Washington DC that it has entered into a Translational 
      Technology Development agreement with Pfizer Inc. The agreement is an 
      element of BioPontis Alliance&#8217;s unique business model which combines 
      translational drug research with its own asset based investment fund. 
      Pfizer is the second leading pharmaceutical company to join the alliance 
      structure at BioPontis Alliance, which is a first-in-kind vehicle for 
      capturing innovative science from academia and doing the necessary work 
      to potentially translate discoveries into drug candidates for further 
      development by pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      BioPontis Alliance has established research alliances with a group of 
      the nation&#8217;s leading academic research institutes, in which BioPontis 
      Alliance searches for innovative science that has the potential to be 
      translated into new treatments for cancer, neurology, inflammation and 
      infectious diseases. BioPontis Alliance currently has agreements with a 
      consortium of leading universities and research institutions including 
      New York University, Columbia University, Memorial Sloan-Kettering 
      Cancer Center, University of Pennsylvania, University of North Carolina 
      (Chapel Hill), University of Virginia and University of Florida.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The gap between early science and translation into clinical 
      applications presents an opportunity for industry and academia to 
      collaborate in an unprecedented manner,&#8221; says Uwe Schoenbeck, Chief 
      Scientific Officer for External RD at Pfizer. &#8220;We at Pfizer are 
      committed to establishing productive relationships with academic 
      scientists, and the BioPontis agreement complements other innovation 
      initiatives at Pfizer, such as our Centers for Therapeutic Innovation. 
      We are excited to have the opportunity to work alongside BioPontis 
      Alliance as they conduct critical translational research and development 
      on promising new science.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Under the agreement, Pfizer will provide guidance on the BioPontis 
      Alliance product portfolio to help ensure that BioPontis Alliance&#8217;s 
      investment in particular development programs is in alignment with 
      clinical need and market demand. Pfizer will have the opportunity to 
      provide BioPontis Alliance with scientific and medical advice on the 
      design of experiments and the product profile needed for a successful 
      product development strategy. In addition, Pfizer will have an 
      opportunity to evaluate and license early-stage therapeutic 
      opportunities.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;The rapidly changing pharmaceutical development market is recognizing 
      BioPontis Alliance as a leading new enterprise for efficiently 
      translating academic discovery science into technologies validated for 
      clinical development that target cancer, neurologic, inflammation and 
      infectious diseases,&#8220; according to Barbara Handelin PhD, BioPontis 
      Alliance President. &#8220;We are excited to have Pfizer as a partner of 
      BioPontis Alliance, who along with Merck, will help as we continue to 
      expand the development bridge between our academic partner inventors and 
      the patients that rely upon translational research for improved health 
      outcomes.&#8221;

&lt;p&gt;  SCHAUMBURG, IL, Jun 30 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Flexera Software, the leading provider of strategic Application Usage
Management solutions for application producers and their customers, today
announced the launch of FlexNet Manager for IBM. This new product is a
scalable Enterprise License Optimization solution built on the FlexNet
Manager Platform, automating IBM license management, and giving
enterprises essential control over their software estates in order to
slash license, maintenance and audit costs for IBM desktop and server
software, and maintain continual software license compliance.

    The need for an IBM software license management tool has never been
greater, as illustrated in a recent industry research report, which found
that IBM, the second largest software provider with annual software
revenues in excess of $23 billion and more than eight percent market
share, has been one of the most aggressive vendors in initiating software
audits. In that report, 41% of enterprises surveyed reported that IBM has
audited them in the past year.

    "IBM software has a high degree of license complexity, making it
difficult to minimize the risk of audit exposure without a strategic
software license management solution," said Alan Swahn, vice president of
product management at Flexera Software. "FlexNet Manager for IBM is the
only solution available that can provide this level of visibility into
and control over the IBM software estate."

    FlexNet Manager for IBM offers enterprises the following capabilities:


--  Purchased Versus Installed Reconciliation: FlexNet Manager for IBM
    allows organizations to discover over/under licensing situations via
    the easy import of purchase order (PO) data from popular procurement
    systems. IBM Stock Keeping Units (SKUs), which have been added to the
    FlexNet Manager Platform SKU library, help automate the process by
    identifying exactly what has been purchased according to PO line item
    SKUs, and matching that to IBM installations.
--  IBM License Types: IBM-related license types including Processor Value
    Unit (PVU), Authorized User, Concurrent User, and Floating User, are
    supported by FlexNet Manager for IBM, adding to the extensive coverage
    of complex license models (e.g. Oracle Named User Plus, Symantec
    Tiered Server, etc.) in the FlexNet Manager Suite. This makes it
    possible for IT organizations to effectively manage complex license
    agreements and metrics without having extensive licensing expertise.
--  Application Recognition: The FlexNet Manager Platform Application
    Recognition Library has been enriched with IBM software titles,
    enabling the product to scrub raw inventory data and provide a list of
    installed software per device (desktops, laptops, servers and virtual
    environment "devices" such as virtual machines and hardware
    partitions).
--  Discovery &amp; Inventory: Cross-platform (Windows, Linux, UNIX, and
    MAC OS) discovery, inventory, and application usage (metering)
    collection tools are included, eliminating the need for separate
    purchase of these tools. The system performs discovery and inventory
    of virtual machines for VMware ESX/vSphere and Microsoft Hyper-V
    servers, as well as hardware partitions such as AIX LPAR, HP-UX nPar
    and vPar, and Solaris Zones. Usage and user information for Citrix
    application virtualization environments is also supported.
--  IBM Tool Integration: FlexNet Manager for IBM is integrated with the
    IBM License Metric Tool (ILMT) to provide support for sub-capacity
    licensing. In the FlexNet Manager Platform repository, purchase orders
    and contracts are correlated with inventory data from ILMT, enabling
    purchase-versus-installed reconciliation, and identification of
    software licenses that are out of compliance, or over licensed
    (shelfware).
--  Common Dashboard: To quickly report an enterprise-wide IBM software
    license compliance position, the solution offers a rich set of
    pre-defined and customizable FlexNet Manager Platform reports,
    including compliance and audit reports, contract renewals and
    opportunities for cost savings.

    

Moreover, the trends toward virtualization and the Cloud drastically
complicate the process of optimizing the software license estate, and
therefore increase a company's risk exposure further. "As a result of the
explosion of software vendor audits over the past two years it is in a
licensee's best interest to ensure they have tightly managed license
entitlement and compliance management processes and tools in place to
minimize financial risk within their organization," said Jo Ann
Rosenberger, Research Director at Gartner. FlexNet Manager for IBM
likewise can be leveraged to track and manage software whether it's
implemented on premises or in the cloud, on physical devices or in
virtual environments.

    FlexNet Manager for IBM is part of the FlexNet Manager Suite for
Enterprises, a comprehensive and proven solution enabling organizations
to reduce the time and effort spent managing software licenses and
compliance, slash on-going license and maintenance costs, minimize the
risk and cost of non-compliance, minimize the downtime and delays due to
denials of service, and enable more accurate planning and budgeting for
future needs.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - The revised Federal Reserve rules governing how much banks charge retailers to process debit card purchases was given a big thumbs-up by analysts, who see the rules being a huge boost to card networks Visa (V.N) and MasterCard (MA.N).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"We believe the most significant threat to Visa and MasterCard profitability has been dramatically reduced," Chris Brendler of Stifel Nicolaus said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks pay card networks like Visa and MasterCard for processing debit transactions, and the softened rule is a victory for big banks like Bank of America (BAC.N) and JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), and card networks like Visa and MasterCard.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new rule, banks would be allowed to charge as much as 22 cents per debit card transaction, which includes a one-cent allowance for meeting certain fraud prevention standards.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market capitalization of four largest U.S. card networks -- Visa (V.N), MasterCard (MA.N), American Express (AXP.N) and Discover (DFS.N) -- gained roughly $14 billion on Wednesday after the Fed's vote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The final rules are a clear positive as a higher interchange cap could lessen pricing pressure from large bank issuers," Robert W. Baird analyst David Koning said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe Visa and MasterCard become more investable again, as the regulatory cloud lifts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Brenton Cordeiro in Bangalore; Editing by Gopakumar Warrier)&lt;/p&gt;

2010&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman Sachs tops European ECM league tables in first
half&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Jaded investors reluctant to take part in new offerings&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Outlook for second half clouded by European sovereign
worries
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Kylie MacLellan	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - The volume of European share
sales jumped 93 percent year-on-year in the second quarter,
boosted by bank capital hikes and Glencore's mega
float, but with markets volatile and investors guarded the
outlook for the rest of the year is hazy.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bumper rights issues such as Porsche's (PSHG_p.DE) $7.2
billion offering and a $7.7 billion capital hike by Commerzbank
 helped propel Goldman Sachs to the top of
European equity capital market (ECM) league tables for the first
half of 2011, from fifth at the same point last year, despite
its absence from commodity trader Glencore's $10 billion float.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European companies raised $70 billion on equity markets in
the three months to the end of June, up from $36.3 billion in
the same period last year, Thomson Reuters data showed. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But despite a large pipeline of companies keen to come to
market in the second half, investors, who have lost money on
almost all floats completed in Europe this year, increasingly
lack the conviction to take a punt on the unfamiliar.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The lack of money is not the problem, it is this
fear of principal erosion," said Viswas Raghavan, head of
international capital markets at JPMorgan in London. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Where the story stacks up, where there is a track record,
you see an abundance of liquidity chasing it." 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Glencore's market debut, London's biggest ever premium
market listing, inflated initial public offering (IPO) volumes,
but new listings as a whole disappointed over the last three
months, with at least 15 deals pulled in Europe.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "What we expected to be a more steady recovery of
the IPO market has proven to be relatively erratic," said Credit
Suisse managing director of European equity syndicate Stephane
Gruffat . 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 	
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 	
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ABSENT ANIMAL SPIRITS	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After the first quarter in which many IPOs were hit by
market volatility following the Japanese earthquake and
political unrest in the Middle East, sentiment remained shaky in
the second with European sovereign debt worries weighing.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While some deals, such as Italian luxury shoemaker Ferragamo
 and Polish coking coal miner JSW, have managed to defy
the tough market, investors are expected to remain selective
with bankers saying no offerings are being seen as a "must buy".	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There is enormous uncertainty as to how the problems in the
euro zone will play out. In those circumstances it is not
surprising that investors' animal spirits are absent," said Alan
Brown, chief investment officer at Schroders.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When sentiment is fragile, pricing is key. Markets are open
for business, but only to deals that are demonstrably fairly
priced ... I don't think that has been the case with a number of
recent issues."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The standoff between investors and issuers has left
relationships in the market strained, with tensions brought to
the fore by a letter from U.S.-based fund manager BlackRock
 to investment banks which highlighted issues such as
large syndicates and lack of early meetings with companies.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The gap in valuation expectations between buyers and
sellers, another point raised by BlackRock, has been
particularly prevalent with Russian issuers.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While five Russian companies, including bank Nomos NMOSq.L
and real estate developer Etalon (ETLNGq.L), have completed
listings in London this year, at least seven have had to pull
IPOs after investors baulked at valuations sought by owners.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 	
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RACE TO THE TOP	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fundraising by financial institutions dominated wider ECM
activity in the quarter, a trend set to continue as European
banks strive to meet stricter capital ratio requirements.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As well as Commerzbank's rights issue, Denmark's bailed-out
Danske Bank raised 20 billion Danish crowns ($3.8
billion) while Italy's Intesa Sanpaolo raised 5 billion
euros ($7.1 billion).  	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We expect to see significant activity in the financial
sector," said Craig Coben, head of ECM for EMEA at Bank of
America Merrill Lynch. "There is a race to the top and many
banks aren't there yet."	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other financial deals expected in the second half are
government stake sales in Russia's biggest lender Sberbank
 and Poland's top bank PKO , while listings
by Spanish savings banks Bankia and Banca Civica are planned for
July. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Multi-billion euro offerings from German chemicals maker
Evonik , Siemens' light making unit Osram and Spain's
state lottery are also on the cards.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The potential pipeline is very large," said Antony Isaacs,
head of ECM at investment bank Macquarie in Europe. "The IPO
window will remain open in Q3/Q4 2011 but will continue to be
difficult to navigate and investors will remain selective."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Sarah White	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, June 30 (Reuters) - JPMorgan extended its
grip on the global investment banking fee pool in the first
half, even as income from bond deals, one of its top businesses,
slumped in the second quarter and pressure from rivals grew.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. bank lost ground in key areas such as equity
capital markets (ECM), with its haul of fees from listings
slipping further in Europe and Asia after a decline in 2010,
data from Thomson Reuters and Freeman Consulting showed.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This failed to dent JPMorgan's comfortable lead over peers
overall, as it held on to its top spot in U.S. ECM deals and
took home a bigger chunk of capital markets and advisory fees
than this time last year.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The pool of income from these types of deals rose 17.5
percent to $42.4 billion compared with the first half of 2010,
the data showed, a promising start after fees for all of last
year were the highest since 2007.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However much of this boost came from the early part of 2011.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Fees in the second quarter were down 6 percent on the first
three months of the year, dragged down by a 15 percent drop in
debt capital markets (DCM) income.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other businesses such as mergers and acquisitions also
suffered as economic woes in Europe and the fallout from
political turmoil in the Middle East cast a shadow over new
deals. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It's a slowdown many banks, especially those that are
dominant in European markets, fear will impact earnings for the
quarter. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 	
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; TOP RANKED 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, whose investment bank is run by Jes Staley, was
top ranked bank for global DCM fees. But U.S. rival Bank of
America Merrill Lynch , which improved its market share
in the United States, knocked it from the number one spot in
ECM, also causing other peers such as Morgan Stanley to slide.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None fell as noticeably as JPMorgan did in the European ECM
fee rankings, however, where it dropped from first place this
time last year to sixth.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Along with some rivals, JPMorgan was on a slew of deals that
were postponed after equity markets hit a rough patch.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also failed to grab a lead on the biggest initial public
offering of the year so far, that of commodities trader Glencore
 .	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This did not however impact Goldman Sachs , which also
missed out on the Glencore mandate but leapfrogged other banks
in the European ECM hierarchy to grab the top spot, up from a
number four ranking this time last year.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Other rivals are also turning the screws on JPMorgan in
Europe, most noticeably Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE), which took the
biggest haul of investment banking fees in the region and
knocked the U.S. bank into second place.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche's investment bank chief Anshu Jain recently laid
out his ambitions to push the German lender into at least the
top five rankings in every market in which it operates -- in his
eyes, the only way for a investment bank to break even and
survive in the new world of post-crisis regulation.
 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Deutsche Bank has crept up the global fee ranks in various
markets this year, including DCM.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the Americas still makes up a vastly higher chunk of the
fee pool than other regions, with activity in the United States
alone making up 45 percent of global fees this year. JPMorgan is
top or second-ranked bank in key markets there.	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In Asia, no bank has so far this year managed to oust
Switzerland's UBS from the top fee spot. 	&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It held on to its lead despite losing out to Goldman Sachs
in ECM, still one of the most-hotly contested markets in the
region even though a slowdown looms.

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;

		&lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      According to SDI&#8217;s 
      Pharmaceutical Company Image 2011 study, 
      obstetricians/gynecologists ranked Pfizer No. 1 overall. Forty percent 
      of the 325 participating OB/GYNs reported that Pfizer was one of the 
      three companies they held in highest esteem. In the 2010 study, Pfizer 
      placed second.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Bayer nearly captured the top spot, with 40% of respondents also naming 
      the company; Bayer had just one less mention than Pfizer. In 2010, Bayer 
      ranked fourth, with 30% of OB/GYNs considering it a top company.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Merck, last year&#8217;s leader, dropped to third. In 2011, 38% of OB/GYNs 
      reported that Merck was a top company, down from 43% in 2010.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Warner Chilcott, which ranked fourth, called on OB/GYNs more than any 
      other corporation during the 12 months that ended April 2011, accounting 
      for 13% of sales representative calls to these specialists. Bayer made 
      the second-most calls to OB/GYNs, accounting for almost 12% of the 
      total. Teva, Pfizer, and Merck followed with 7%, 7%, and 5% of OB/GYN 
      sales calls, respectively.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      &#8220;Bayer&#8217;s improved standing is impressive, particularly over only 1 
      year&#8217;s time,&#8221; said Jason Fox, associate director of SDI&#8217;s Syndicated 
      Analytics group. &#8220;The company&#8217;s reps have increased their presence among 
      OB/GYNs and must be making a positive impression.&#8221;
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      Compared with the previous 12 months, Bayer sales calls to OB/GYNs rose 
      19% in the year that ended April 2011. Bayer sales representatives were 
      most likely to discuss Beyaz or Natazia &#8211; two newer contraceptives &#8211; or 
      Yaz during their visits with OB/GYNs. Beyaz was discussed during 30% of 
      Bayer&#8217;s product details to OB/GYNs, Natazia during 24%, and Yaz during 
      19%.
    &lt;/p&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;
      As a whole, physicians&#8217; perception of the pharmaceutical industry 
      improved in 2011, with 58% reporting a somewhat positive or extremely 
      positive overall impression; up 2 percentage points from 2010. This is 
      the first time since 2004 that the percentage of physicians reporting a 
      positive impression increased.

&lt;p&gt;IBM moved forward with smart grid projects on international fronts in separate deals announced Wednesday with the largest privately held energy provider in Brazil and South Korea's largest utility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as IBM detailed its latest collaborations to help build a smarter energy grid, Groom Energy unveiled resources and initiatives to help companies better understand the emerging enterprise smart grid and the $5.2 billion vendor market that already exists in the U.S.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The smart grid and the information network that connects energy providers to those who consume it are among the key pillars of a concept GreenBiz Group calls VERGE -- the convergence of energy, information, building and vehicle and transportation technology. The first VERGE conference was held last week, with sustainability experts from IBM and Groom Energy among the speakers who led talks about the impact of VERGE on businesses and sustainability.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Brazil, IBM struck a deal with CPFL Energia Holdings to work on projects that are aimed at making CPFL's energy networks more efficient, more resilient and better positioned for transition to a smart grid. IBM, which is working with CPFL to develop its smart grid strategy, is providing consulting and assessment services on projects to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pilot automatic meter data collection. CPFL plans to install 25,000 smart meters among its largest business customers by the close of 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Manage the data will flows through the meters. The work includes devising management systems that integrate with CPFL business operations and enable the extend and scale smart metering to 6.5 million residential customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Develop the architecture for a communication network to support CPFL's smart grid plans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPFL, through its distributors, serves6.7 million customers in four states, including So Paulo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Energy Information Administration pegs Brazil as the world's ninth largest energy consumer and the third largest in the Western Hemisphere after the U.S. and Canada. Currently enjoying a boom, Brazil's primary energy consumption has increased by almost a third as the country's economy has grown in the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The growth is placing increasing demands on the country's energy companies to provide adequate, reliable power more efficiently. CPFL's work with IBM is intended to address those needs by building network capabilities for data collection, communication, analytics and operational efficiency -- all of which provide a foundation for a smarter grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPFL's upcoming projects mark its first foray into the smart metering world, said Michael Valocchi, the vice president and partner who leads IBM's Global Energy and Utilities unit, who praised CPFL's efforts in seeking solutions.This is a company that's not afraid to look globally for technology, best practices and lessons learned, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CPFL is a member of IBM's Global Intelligent Utility Network Coalition, which is made up of more than a dozen energy companies that are trying to advance the smart grid. The Brazilian firm joined the coalition in 2009 and first partnered with IBM to help determine what it would take to develop a more intelligent energy grid for CPFL and its networks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM announced its work with CPFL and the Korea Electric Power Company, also a coalition member, at the group's semi-annual meeting. Korea Electric Power enlisted IBM to help harness the data that's expected to pour into South Korea's Jeju Smart Grid Test-Bed project.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The project, formally called the Jeju Smart Grid Test-Bed Demonstration Complex, is being built on Jeju Island in the Korean Strait.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a budget of about $200 million, which includes $68.5 million in public funds, planners envision the site as the world's largest smart grid test bed. The project began in December 2009 with construction of infrastructure. Testing integrated operation of the smart grid is scheduled to begin this summer, continue for the next 24 months and in May 2013.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More than 160 companies are expected to use the area as a living RD lab to test advanced technology, systems to support it and business models developed for a fully connected, intelligent, low carbon community. Korea has a goal of establishing a national smart grid by 2030. The  concept for the Jeju project, the spring board for grid transformation,  is shown below.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM helped the Korea Electric Power Company develop an integrated energy management system for the test bed's Total Operations Center, which houses the brains and central nervous system for the living lab. Through IBM's work, the companies and consortia using the test bed will be able to collect and manage information on international markets, monitor smart grid systems and participate in data exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The test bed is designed to enable firms to test advanced smart grid technology, then swiftly scale it and bring it to market. The two latter points are crucial to the pace South Korea has set for reducing its greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting good technology to the right places is always a challenge when you think about innovation, Valocchi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the heart of the smart grid is good data delivered on a timely basis, said Paul Baier, the leader of Groom Energy's sustainability consulting practice and a GreenBiz senior contributor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groom Energy rolled out resources yesterday that are designed to help companies understand the importance of energy data, how the grid works and how enterprise smart grid solutions can benefit businesses that are looking to manage energy, costs and carbon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The enterprise smart grid opportunity involves the integration of sub-metering, software and hardware to achieve energy, cost and carbon management goals&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groom Energy's resources include a white paper on the enterprise smart grid, its trends, drivers and vendor landscape.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The firm also set up a website, www.enterprisesmartgrid.org, plans to hold a conference on the subject November 2 in Boston and will release a 120-page report in the fall.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Here is a chart from the white paper diagramming end-to-end smart grid:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the enterprise smart grid is relatively new, a $5.2 billion vendor market has already formed around it in the U.S. and is growing by 40 percent each year, according to research by Groom Energy. More than 300 vendor companies have emerged and corporate energy managers want to understand how to navigate that space, Baier said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;They want to know how all these solutions fit together and they want easier systems for tracking out energy, Baier said. Measurement and verification of energy consumption and reductions can produce cost savings as well as incentives and rewards, such as utility rebates, Baier noted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Groom Energy's white paper is available for free download with registration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top image CC licensed by Flickr user Andrew Imanaka.
