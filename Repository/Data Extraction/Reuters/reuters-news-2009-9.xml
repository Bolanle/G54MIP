&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co's (DIS.N) $4 billion bet on Marvel Entertainment's MVL.N superheroes is at best going to take some time to pay off and at worst may have increased some risks for the entertainment behemoth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Any initial optimism about the transaction has quickly turned to caution as analysts and investors realize that it is not easy to say whether Disney CEO Bob Iger got a good deal or overpaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the reasons for that are the myriad of deals that Marvel already has in place with movie, merchandising and theme park partners will take time to unwind. This means that Disney won't see the full benefits of the acquisition for some time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There is also concern that Disney has only increased its exposure to what is probably a long-term decline in the DVD sales market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And this on a deal struck at a relatively rich prospective price-to-earnings ratio of 37 times, and at a 29 percent premium to Marvel's share price before the announcement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Did (Disney) management pay a large price? Yes. But I think we won't know if it's a good deal until two or three years down the road," said James Marsh, an analyst with investment bank Piper Jaffray.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the short run, some analysts warn that Disney's stock may trend lower, as the studio battles a recession-hit consumer- and ad-spending landscape in addition to the lack of an immediate payoff from its Marvel division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marvel now enjoys ties on everything from films to toys with Disney's rivals, relationships that will take time to unwind.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paramount Pictures, a division of Viacom Inc VIAb.N, retains the right to distribute the next five Marvel superhero films, which analysts said will give Paramount about an 8 percent fee on box office results, or about $20 million to $50 million per movie.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For five highly anticipated upcoming films, including "Iron Man 2" and "Thor," that potentially amounts to a total of $100 million to $250 million going to Paramount instead of Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OVER-PRICED?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And Marvel has a deal in place with Universal Studios for domestic theme park rights and with Hasbro Inc HAS.N for toy license rights, arrangements expected to stay in place a few years more -- till 2017 in Hasbro's case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That had some investors worrying initially that Disney had overpaid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Piper Jaffray said in a report that most of the synergies from the deal will not likely materialize until 2011 and beyond, and that it expects Disney's "stock to likely drift slightly lower as near-term earnings estimates tick down."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a separate report, Bernstein Research said, "The transaction raises many more questions that need to be answered in the coming months and ... years."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The research firm noted that though Disney has been at the forefront in warning about declining DVD sales -- which are estimated to have fallen 6 percent industrywide last year -- the deal with Marvel will make the company more reliant on that sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blockbuster films, like the superhero-laden franchises that Marvel specializes in, often rely partly on DVD sales to beef up returns from movie projects.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hal Vogel, head of trading and consulting firm Vogel Capital, said another major question mark was whether Marvel's decades-old pantheon of superheroes can sustain their popularity beyond the next few years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts also said Disney stands to reap benefits even from movies distributed by Paramount, including the "Iron Man 2" film due out in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2007, revenue from a merchandising joint venture with Sony for "Spider-Man 3" increased by $117.2 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On future projects, Marvel stands to gain even more merchandise revenue because it will produce movies on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Iron Man 2" for instance is likely to boost those numbers, said Barton Crockett, an analyst at Lazard Capital Markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vogel said: "As long as the Disney company is intact and one entity, this is going to be theirs forever, so they're looking at it from a very long-term perspective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis: Editing by Edwin Chan and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Ecuador's Attorney General looking into bribery charge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Judge dismisses misconduct, bribe accusations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chevron wants judge removed from case
 (Adds comments from plaintiffs' supporters)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alexandra Valencia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUITO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Ecuadorean authorities said on
Tuesday they were looking into accusations by Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) that the judge involved in a $27 billion environmental
lawsuit against the U.S. oil company is guilty of misconduct
and involvement in a bribery scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said on Monday that it would ask to have Judge Juan
Nunez disqualified from the 16-year-old case, after giving
Ecuadorean and U.S. officials secretly recorded video footage
of Nunez talking of ruling against Chevron later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the video, posted at its TexacoEcuador YouTube
channel, www.youtube.com/texacoecuador, shows a man at
another meeting identifying himself as a representative of
Ecuador's ruling party and discussing a $3 million bribe for
contracts, of which he said Nunez would get a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ecuador Attorney General Washington Pesantez was examining
the case to decide what action authorities should take, a
spokesman for his office said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have to analyze everything here and carry out an
investigation," the country's Inspector General, Diego Garcia,
told local press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both offices are responsible for investigating cases
involving corruption of public employees and justice officials
and demands made by foreign companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge Nunez dismissed allegations of bribery. "My duty is
to decide a sentence according to procedure, nothing more," he
was quoted by a local newspaper as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Washington D.C.-based Amazon Defense Coalition, which
supports the plaintiffs, said in a statement on Tuesday that
the video showed Nunez had resisted the attempts to bribe him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs' lawyer, Pablo Fajardo, said in the Amazon
Defense Coalition statement that the timing of the release of
the videos, months after Chevron said it learned of them in
June, appeared related to the impending judgment by Nunez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "That's just one reason why this appears suspicious,"
Fajardo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit against Chevron is registered in the oil town
of Lago Agrio, where indigenous communities have accused the
company of damaging the environment and their health while
operating petroleum facilities in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs have said that Texaco, bought by Chevron in
2001, dumped billions of gallons of polluted water in the
jungle around where they live for more than two decades before
the company left Ecuador in the early 1990s. The first legal
action in the case was filed in New York in 1993.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An expert appointed by the Ecuadorean court said last year
that Chevron should pay around $27 billion, including more than
$8 billion in unjust enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has said before it will fight any adverse judgment,
and has complained of political interference in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WATCH, PEN CAMERAS USED TO TAPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said in a statement on Monday that two meetings
with Nunez and two meetings with purported party representative
Patricio Garcia were recorded by both Diego Borja, a local
logistics contractor who has worked for Chevron, and American
Wayne Hansen, who has no relationship with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the four meetings were recorded without its
knowledge, through small cameras in a watch on Borja and a pen
held by Hansen. Borja only brought the bribery scheme to the
company's attention in June, Chevron said in the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said Borja and Hansen had been "pursuing business
opportunities" in Ecuador before the potential for remediation
work was brought to their attention and the meeting with Garcia
was arranged to discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said on Monday that the
two men had not explained why they recorded the meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said Borja and Hansen first met with Nunez in May
after an initial meeting at Alianza Pais's Quito offices with
Garcia, who said he was a representative of the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garcia then arranged for Borja and Hansen to fly to Lago
Agrio to see Nunez, and the two men met Nunez again at a Quito
hotel in June, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said neither man was paid, though the San Ramon,
California-based company said it had assisted Borja with the
costs of relocating out of Ecuador and other support because he
and the company feared for his safety and that of his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Amazon Defense Coalition said in its statement on
Tuesday that Borja had worked for Chevron on the environmental
trial during the final eight field inspections conducted in
March, and that one of his cousins works for Chevron.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights CNOOC, Ltd. (NYSE: CEO) as the Bull of the Day
and China Eastern Airlines (NYSE: CEA) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks
Equity Research provides analysis on Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS), Morgan
Stanley (NYSE: MS) and American Express Company (NYSE: AXP). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

With favorable prospects for the resumption of China's economic growth and
commodity prices off of their lows, CNOOC, Ltd. (NYSE: CEO) ADSs are expected to
maintain their recent impressive performance momentum. 

This, coupled with the company's positive production-growth profile, exclusivity
in the offshore China region and lucrative LNG investments, account for
continued favorable view. 

The company's low cost operating model is also a competitive advantage. With
approximately ten new projects going on-stream this year, full-year volumes are
expected to increase by roughly 15%, with oil and natural gas production in the
first half having gone up by 15.2%. 

Bear of the Day: 

We are maintaining our Underperform rating on China Eastern Airlines (NYSE:
CEA). CEA reported 2009 first half earnings of RMB985 million, well above our
estimate, reflecting a number of nonoperating items. These included gains of
RMB831 million from an infrastructure levy refund and of RMB2,794 million on the
fair value of fuel option contracts, partly offset by a RMB1,875 million decline
in net exchange gains. 

To shore up its balance sheet, China Eastern also announced the sale of up to
RMB1.35 billion new A shares and 490 million new Hong Kong dollar-denominated H
shares to parent, China Eastern Air Holding Co. 

We continue to believe the fundamental outlook for airline carriers remains weak
and a CEA/SAL tie-up will not change this. Both CEA and SAL shares are subject
to special treatment, meaning that daily share price movements are limited to 5%
on the Shanghai Stock Exchange. Moreover, the shares could be delisted should
CEA and SAL continue to sustain losses in 2009.

Here are highlights from Monday`sAnalyst Blog: 

A Step Forward for Bayer

The therapeutic area of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is buzzing with news. We are
pleased with the development made by Bayer Schering Pharma, a division of Bayer
AG (OTC: BAYRY) in this field. The company completed patient enrollment in the
phase III study for Rivaroxaban (Xarelto). The study aims to assess the efficacy
and safety of this drug against Bristol-Myers Squibb`s (BMY) warfarin, which is
primarily used for the prevention of stroke in AF patients. 

The study is expected to include about 14,269 patients spanning over 45
countries with results due by next year. Atrial fibrillation is the most common
heart rhythm abnormality in the US. An estimated 3 million people in the US have
atrial fibrillation, which affects about one in 10 people aged over 70. 

Rivaroxaban, jointly developed with Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) is also being
studied for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and deep vein
thrombosis (DVT) (apart from AF). The drug is approved in the European Union
(EU) for the prevention of venous blood clots in adult patients who have
undergone elective (planned) hip or knee replacement surgery. 

Xarelto was submitted in July 2008 for approval to the US Food and Drug
Administration (FDA), and the agency`s advisory committee voted 15-2
recommending its approval in the US in March 2009. A final decision is expected
later this year. Xarelto offers multi-billion dollar sales potential. Upon
approval, J will market the drug in the US while Bayer holds ex-US marketing
rights. 

In July 2009, the US FDA approved Sanofi-Aventis` (SNY) Multaq, the first new
drug for AF to be approved in a decade. Viewing the high unmet need of the AF
market, many companies have pipeline candidates this area. Merck is developing
vernakalant intravenous for AF patients, for which it is seeking European
Medicines Agency (EMEA) approval. 

Moreover, Bristol-Myers and Pfizer (PFE) are co-developing apixaban in addition
to Boehringer Ingleheim GmbH`s Pradaxa (dabigatran). Though warfarin is widely
used to prevent blood clot, it has certain limitations like careful regulation
of blood levels to prevent overdose and reaction with some green vegetables. Any
of these drugs on approval has the potential to reach blockbuster status.

Moody`s Confident About U.S.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. government
and the Federal Reserve have injected about $12 trillion to revive the economy
and credit markets. As a result, the budget deficit is expected to reach $1.6
trillion this year and $1.4 trillion next year. In its mid-year economic review,
the Office of Management and Budget increased its estimate of the 10-year
deficit by almost $2 trillion from the previous level to $9.05 trillion. 

The U.S. government has also invested hundreds of billions of dollars to rescue
many financial institutions including American International Group (NYSE: AIG)
and Citigroup (NYSE: C) as part of its goal to stimulate the economy. These
spending programs have also increased debt. 

Most banks still have short-term debt guaranteed by the government. However,
some large financial firms have repaid the government funds, including Morgan
Stanley (NYSE: MS), Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE: BK) and Goldman
Sachs (NYSE: GS), among others. The repayment of government money can be viewed
as a sign of recovery of the institutions as well as the economy.

&lt;p&gt;Chevron`s Video Transcripts Raise Questions About Oil Giant`s Misconduct to
Delay $27 Billion Environmental Trial in Ecuador

Department of Justice Asked to Focus on Chevron
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
In a maneuver reminiscent of Richard Nixon`s infamous "dirty tricks" operations,
Chevron has posted a series of grainy videos on YouTube in an attempt to corrupt
the trial proceedings where the company faces a $27 billion liability for
environmental damage, representatives of the indigenous communities in Ecuador
charged Tuesday. 

Representatives of the communities in Ecuador called for the U.S. Department of
Justice and Ecuador`s Attorney General to jointly investigate Chevron for its
apparent role in working with an individual who tried to bribe government
officials in Ecuador, said Pablo Fajardo, the lawyer for the Amazonian
communities who accused the company of dumping billions of gallons of toxic
waste into the rainforest. 

"The bottom line is that evidence in the trial shows that Chevron is responsible
for wrecking Ecuador`s rainforest and destroying the lives of thousands of
indigenous peoples," said Steven Donziger, an American lawyer who advises the
Amazonian communities in the lawsuit, which is taking place in Ecuador at
Chevron`s insistence after the company submitted numerous affidavits praising
Ecuador`s courts. 

"Nothing Chevron has presented in these videos changes these underlying facts
one bit," he added. "The legal case will go on. This is a desperate attempt by
Chevron to delay the judgment." 

After carefully reviewing the videos and transcripts of the videos released by
Chevron, lawyers for the plaintiffs said Chevron`s hidden cameras produced "not
even a scintilla of evidence" that the judge was involved in bribes, "made no
sense" about how contracts would be awarded and raised questions about Chevron`s
own involvement in the bribery scheme perpetrated by an Ecuadorian Chevron
contractor and an American businessman. 

"There is clear evidence from the videos that individuals associated with
Chevron were trying to bribe Ecuadorian government officials to undermine the
trial process so the company can avoid paying a judgment," Fajardo said. 

"Corruption of the trial process by Chevron has become a pattern which we
believe extends to the highest levels of the company and which may constitute a
violation of criminal laws both in Ecuador and the United States," he added. 

Both Fajardo and Donziger called on Chevron to turn over copies of the unedited
videos, which were shot secretly using micro-cameras inside a watch and a pen,
and to make available corporate officials and outside counsel to answer
questions from investigators about their own roles or those of their
subordinates in the scheme. 

Curiously, Chevron has refused to disclose the whereabouts of the Ecuadorian
contractor, Diego Borja, and the American businessman, Wayne Hansen. Chevron
claims the pair "innocently" turned over the videos for Chevron`s use in June of
this year, but Borja had been working for Chevron on the environmental trial
during the final eight field inspections conducted in March. 

"It is odd that Chevron says Borja tried to bribe government officials, and then
they reward him by relocating him to the United States which is often seen as a
huge benefit for an Ecuadorian," said Fajardo. 

It is unknown who Hansen is, where he lives, or whether he received payments or
other benefits from Chevron. Borja and his family have long ties to the company;
a cousin works for Chevron, and it is believed that Borja is now working for
Chevron either as an employee or consultant after being relocated by Chevron to
an undisclosed location in the U.S. 

Instead of immediately giving the so-called evidence of corruption to the
authorities, Chevron posted the videos on YouTube yesterday - months after they
came into Chevron`s possession - because the legal case was winding down after
the court recently denied a Chevron attempt to conduct a study that would have
added months to the trial process, said Fajardo. 

"It appears the timing of the release of these videos is related to an impending
judgment against the company," said Fajardo. "If this was not part of a dirty
tricks operation, the videos would have been turned over to the authorities
rather than to Chevron, or at least Chevron would have taken these videos to the
authorities months ago. That`s just one reason why this appears suspicious." 

Donziger added: "More than anything, the videos appear to contradict Chevron`s
points. They certainly don`t support Chevron`s allegations in its press
materials of the government directing the judge. They showed the judge
repeatedly refusing the leading questions of Chevron`s contractor about how he
will rule. They raise questions about Chevron`s possible misconduct in designing
the bribery scheme. They also prove that individuals with ties to Chevron might
have been involved in offering a bribe to a public official in Ecuador." 

Chevron claims there was a $3 million bribe arranged to direct a remediation
contract to a certain company, but produced no evidence the judge knew about it
or that money changed hands. The only people present when the bribe was
discussed were the Chevron contractor, Borja; Hansen; and a person purporting to
represent Ecuador`s government, identified as Patricio Garcia. 

Chevron presented no evidence to connect Garcia to the Ecuadorian government,
and when Chevron contractor Borja said he would provide a bribe to the
plaintiffs, Garcia quickly cut him off and said all the bribe money should go
directly to him. Chevron presented no evidence that any member of the government
had any knowledge of the purported scheme. 

Donziger said it looked like some of the people in the fourth and final video
were "props" in a movie whose role was to contrive evidence of corruption that
could then be used by Chevron even though the company had a hand in creating it.
"This so-called evidence is at a minimum hearsay and would never be admitted in
court," said Donziger. "If it was fabricated by Chevron, then company officials
are going to have to answer for their latest episode in an ongoing smear
campaign." 

"This entire episode reeks of a Nixon-style dirty tricks operation and Chevron`s
fingerprints are all over it," said Donziger. "Chevron`s contractors film
themselves offering a bribe to Ecuadorians, and then Chevron uses that video to
try to undermine the judicial system in Ecuador where it faces a judgment. It is
classic Nixon-style dirty tricks. 

"Chevron now needs to turn over all of its evidence of unedited videos, full and
complete transcripts, and the witnesses that the company is hiding from
investigators. Chevron employees involved in this scheme, including its General
Counsel and other corporate officials, also need to answer questions from
investigators about their own roles in the scheme and their knowledge of the
scheme," Donziger added. 

Both attorneys called for a "complete and thorough investigation" of the facts
surrounding Chevron`s role. They also called for the investigation to address a
pattern of Chevron`s corrupt acts in the country, including a fraudulent
remediation in the mid-1990s, the creation of a false military report in 2005 to
delay a critical field inspection during the trial, threats of physical harm to
court officials, and the failure to condemn a series of deaths threats and
robberies suffered by representatives of the plaintiffs in recent years. 

"The indigenous people are the victims," said Fajardo. "Corruption on any level
designed to delay or profit from a long overdue remediation is unacceptable, and
should be investigated and sanctioned immediately."

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Put volume surged yesterday on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE: DIS), with
activity ramping up to two times the norm. On the International Securities
Exchange (ISE) alone, traders bought to open 1,757 of these bearishly oriented
options. By contrast, only 619 calls were bought to open, revealing a clear
preference for puts over calls. 

As a result, the stock's 10-day ISE put/call volume ratio has been pushed into
skeptical territory. Today's reading of 1.07 reveals that more puts than calls
have been bought to open during the past two weeks, and it ranks higher than 57%
of other such ratios taken during the previous year -- suggesting that bearish
bets are more popular than usual of late.

&lt;p&gt; * Ecuador's Attorney General looking into bribery charge&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Judge dismisses misconduct, bribe accusations&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chevron wants judge removed from case&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alexandra Valencia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUITO, Sept 1 (Reuters) - Ecuadorean authorities said on
Tuesday they were looking into accusations by Chevron (CVX.N)
that the judge involved in a $27 billion environmental lawsuit
against the U.S. petroleum company is guilty of misconduct and
involvement in a bribery scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said on Monday that it would ask to have Judge Juan
Nunez disqualified from the decades-old case, after giving
Ecuadorean and U.S. officials a secretly recorded video of
Nunez talking of ruling against Chevron later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the video, posted at its TexacoEcuador YouTube
channel, www.youtube.com/texacoecuador, shows a man at
another meeting identifying himself as a representative of
Ecuador's ruling party and discussing a $3 million bribe for
contracts, of which Nunez would get a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ecuador's Attorney General Washington Pesantez was
examining the case to decide what action authorities should
take, a spokesman for his office said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We have to analyze everything here and carry out an
investigation," the country's Inspector General, Diego Garcia,
told local press.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Both offices are responsible for investigating cases
involving corruption of public employees and justice officials
and demands made by foreign companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Judge Nunez dismissed allegations of bribery. "My duty is
to decide a sentence according to procedure, nothing more," he
was quoted by a local newspaper as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The lawsuit against Chevron is registered in the oil town
of Lago Agrio, where indigenous communities have accused the
company of damaging the environment and their health while
operating petroleum facilities in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs, represented by U.S.-based lawyer Steven
Donziger, have said that Texaco dumped billions of gallons of
polluted water in the jungle around where they live for more
than two decades before the company left Ecuador in the early
1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, which purchased Texaco in 2001, has complained
before about political interference in the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An expert appointed by the Ecuadorean court said last year
that Chevron should pay around $27 billion, including more than
$8 billion in unjust enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company has said it would fight any adverse judgment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; WATCH, PEN CAMERAS USED TO TAPE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said in a statement on Monday that two meetings
with Nunez and two meetings with purported party representative
Patricio Garcia were recorded by both Diego Borja, a local
logistics contractor who has worked for Chevron, and American
Wayne Hansen, who has no relationship with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the four meetings were recorded without its
knowledge, through small cameras in a watch owned by Borja and
a pen held by Hansen. Borja only brought the bribery scheme to
the company's attention in June, Chevron said in the
statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said Borja and Hansen had been "pursuing business
opportunities" in Ecuador before the potential for remediation
work was brought to their attention and the meeting with Garcia
was arranged to discuss it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said on Monday that the
two men had not explained why they recorded the meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Karen Hinton, a Washington D.C.-based spokeswoman for the
Amazon Defense Coalition, which supports the plaintiffs, said 
on Monday the video showed Nunez had resisted the attempted
bribe scheme put to him by the former Chevron contractor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "An appropriate investigation will determine whether the
allegations are true or if they are the product of a dirty
tricks campaign designed and financed by the company," Hinton
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said Borja and Hansen first met with Nunez in May
after an initial meeting at Alianza Pais's Quito offices with
Garcia, who said he was a representative of the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garcia then arranged for Borja and Hansen to fly to Lago
Agrio, where the case is being heard, to see Nunez, and the two
men met Nunez again at a Quito hotel in June, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said neither man was paid, though the San Ramon,
California-based company said it had assisted Borja with
relocation expenses and other support because he and the
company feared for his safety and that of his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron has alerted authorities both in Ecuador and in the
United States, and both governments should investigate this
evidence in a serious and expeditious manner," the U.S. Chamber
of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform said in a statement on
Monday.

&lt;p&gt;LiveOffice "Pre-Migration Diet" Reduces Cost and Effort of Moving from Exchange
2003 and 2007
TORRANCE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
LiveOffice, the leading provider of software-as-a-service (SaaS) email
archiving, email hosting and email continuity solutions, today announced that it
has become the first email archiving provider to support Microsoft Exchange
Server 2010. In addition to providing the e-discovery, mailbox management and
compliance benefits of email archiving for Exchange Server 2010 users,
LiveOffice`s hosted email archiving solution reduces the time and cost of
migrating to the new platform by moving existing email data to a secure cloud
prior to migration. 

"The pending release of Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 is generating a
significant amount of interest in the market," said Brian Babineau, senior
analyst with Enterprise Strategy Group. "Many of the inquiries we are fielding
center on Exchange 2010 upgrade and migration strategies. We strongly believe
that the implementation of an archiving solution is a great first step to
prepare for an upgrade, as it allows companies to copy and secure legacy
messages and attachments to an accessible and fully searchable, non-production
environment. Executing the archive process with a SaaS provider such as
LiveOffice frees up internal resources to help plan and execute the upgrade when
the organization is ready." 

LiveOffice Microsoft Exchange Server 2010 "Pre-Migration Diet"

To make the transition to Exchange Server 2010 smoother, LiveOffice provides a
simple process for shrinking customers` Exchange data stores prior to moving
them, thus speeding up the transition process.

* LiveOffice Personal Archive: First, clients enable journaling on their
existing mail servers, allowing LiveOffice to capture data in its secure cloud,
which effectively eliminates the need to migrate that data in the future. With
Personal Archive`s robust architecture, end users are able to view all archived
email (legacy and current) from the comfort of their Microsoft Outlook client. 
* LiveOffice CloudMerge for Microsoft Exchange: Next, clients can leverage
LiveOffice`s proprietary CloudMerge technology to automatically and securely
transfer data from existing Microsoft Exchange 2003 or 2007 mail stores to
LiveOffice Personal Archive. Again, this data is available for view by end users
directly from Microsoft Outlook. 
* LiveOffice CloudMerge for PST Files: LiveOffice`s CloudMerge technology is
also able to securely ingest an organization`s PST files into the centrally
managed, hosted archive - eliminating the most common source of data loss and IT
headaches. 
* "Skinny Migration:" With all historical and ongoing email securely stored in
LiveOffice`s cloud-based archive, IT administrators only need to migrate a small
amount of data to their upgraded Exchange 2010 environment.

Finally, an organization`s relationship with LiveOffice doesn`t end once the
migration is complete. With legacy data safely ingested into the cloud-based
archive, organizations can delete messages from the mail server as needed to
improve server performance and reduce the risk of data loss. In addition,
auditors and other authorized personnel have easy access to a centralized
archive of messages where they can perform advanced searches and retrieve data
on demand from the archive to satisfy legal and compliance requests.
Simultaneously, end users have access to their personal archives and can
instantly find emails and attachments they need, even if they no longer reside
in their inbox or on the corporate mail server.

LiveOffice is the leading provider of software-as-a-service email archiving and
Hosted Exchange 2007 solutions, with more than 9,000 clients and a 97-percent
client-retention rate. Founded in 1998 and backed by leading private-equity firm
Summit Partners, the company has more than 100 employees with deep experience in

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Chinese banks are expected to seek investment opportunities in Taiwan, hoping to apply new government guidelines and tap the busy cross-strait commerce, J.P. Morgan's (JPM.N) Brian Gu told Reuters on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Opportunities exist in the other direction too, as China represents an excellent chance for Taiwan's financial industry to expand onshore, Gu, the Greater China MA head at JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), said at the China Investment Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at the recent Taiwanese regulations around mainland investment guidelines, financials are one of the encouraged sectors," Gu said. "It's conceivable that Chinese banks can look at that market as a way to expand the Greater China concept and tap into cross-strait commerce."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gu cautioned that China-Taiwan investing involves more political considerations than economic ones. China has claimed sovereignty over Taiwan since 1949, when Mao Zedong's forces won the Chinese civil war and Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalists fled to the island. Beijing has vowed to bring Taiwan under its rule, by force if necessary.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beijing-Taiwan relations have recently thawed, leading some bankers to see potential deal opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There is definitely strategic rationale for that, it just needs to be handled very carefully," Gu said at the summit, held at the Reuters office in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to natural resource deals in Australia, China is also eyeing investments in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gu said that China MA advisory is a business that has steadily grown in the last five years, unlike similar banking units in other parts of the world that ride market ups and downs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at cross-border deal volume, I don't think it correlates significantly with the A-share market," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That is driven by two factors, he said: One is that China acquisitions typically involve cash deals and not stock swaps. The other is that the financing market in China, backed largely by state banks, is more detached from stock market movements and corporate confidence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though not unscathed by the financial crisis that brought Wall Street to its knees, J.P. Morgan has emerged from the mess ahead of most of its peers. A combination of factors has allowed the bank to distance itself from rivals at a time when hopes are high that the global economy is recovering.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Asia, excluding Japan, J.P. Morgan ranked second in the 2008 MA league table category for fees from completed deals. Thomson Reuters data estimates the bank pulled in $120.3 million in fees in the region last year, behind Morgan Stanley's $137.9 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In that same category for China only, J.P. Morgan was also second behind Morgan Stanley, with an estimated $30.9 million in fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the deals Gu has participated in are China Unicom's (0762.HK) $56 billion stock merger with China Netcom and Sinosteel's $1.3 billion unsolicited cash offer for Midwest -- China's first hostile takeover of an Australian listed company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan's financial sector has long been thought to be ripe for dealmaking. The window may be opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As political and business ties across the strait get warmer, more Taiwanese people move to major cities in mainland China for jobs or investments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are an estimated half million Taiwanese people living in Shanghai, and demand for cross-strait financial services is growing fast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taiwan's financial institutions are also interested in expanding into the mainland China market. In early August, Fubon Financial Holding (2881.TW), parent of Taiwan's No. 2 insurer, said it would participate in a fund-raising plan by China's Xiamen Commercial Bank by the end of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Chinese banks to go on an acquisition spree, Gu says, it's always a question of whether the regulators and the companies can make a judgment call and say "the worst is over, it's time for us to make bold moves."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other question centers on integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For any MA, they need the confidence that they aren't getting into anything that's messy," Gu said. They have to demonstrate strong integration and a capability to absorb those assets."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by George Chen and Donald Durfee)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  TORONTO, ONTARIO, Sep 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Sparton Resources Inc. (TSX VENTURE: SRI) (the "Company") is pleased to
announce that it has received a notice letter from ExxonMobil Canada Ltd.
indicating that ExxonMobil is considering the development of a
Significant Discovery License (SDL) in which the Company owns a 12.5 %
working interest. SDL 2286, part of the Chebucto field, is located near
the existing Sable Offshore Energy Project ("SOEP") facilities The SOEP
natural gas project, is located in offshore Nova Scotia, and supplies
natural gas into the northeast seaboard areas of the United States and
Canada. Sparton has owned the Chebucto interest since 1997.

    INITIAL PROGRAM AND COSTS

    Prior to the development of Chebucto into a producing gas field, certain
geological and engineering studies must be undertaken to confirm the
resource size and production expectations, design the required
facilities, and estimate the capital costs. As well, certain commercial
and regulatory matters need to be resolved. It is estimated that
Sparton's share of the initial costs will be between $200-300,000 over
the next 12 month period. Following completion of this work a further
cost of $250-500,000 is estimated to accrue to Sparton during the next 12
months for the final detailed engineering and project execution planning.

    SCHEDULE

    If the study work confirms the viability of development the earliest that
first gas could be produced is in 2013.

    THE CHEBUCTO GAS FIELD

    The Chebucto gas field, discovered in 1984, covers two SDL's (2286 and
2276A) and based on the currently known geometry of the field Sparton's
overall ownership share of the field's hydrocarbon accumulation after
unitization is estimated at 6%. Chebucto is located approximately 16 km
east of the North Triumph production platform.

    VALUATION TO SPARTON

    The Company has reported several valuations of its Chebucto interest. The
initial evaluation, with an effective date of August 1, 2003, was
prepared for the Company by APA Petroleum Engineering Inc. (APA),
petroleum engineering consultants of Calgary Alberta. APA has extensive
engineering and evaluation experience in the Canadian East Coast and on
other projects world-wide. Subsequent updates were prepared by the same
organization with the latest being May 11, 2005, (See Sparton news
release dated September 4, 2003, Long Form Prospectus dated February 27,
2004, and news release dated June 2, 2005). All these documents are
available on www.sedar.com. Based on a review of all available technical
data APA reported that Sparton's estimated unitized 6% share of the
Chebucto gas accumulation amounts to approximately 20 Bscf (billion
standard cubic feet) in proven and probable categories. Using then
current gas prices and a 10% discount rate with a 2010 production
startup, and a 20 year production life APA, in 2005 calculated a net
present value to Sparton before tax of approximately $27 million. This
valuation will be updated to reflect current conditions and reported to
shareholders when available.

    DISCUSSION

    The news of an initial planning program for possible production at
Chebucto is a significant event in the potential development of Sparton's
resource assets. Chebucto has historically been difficult to evaluate due
to uncertainty in the time frame for development. With the current
development planning proposed by the interest representative, Company
management believes that Chebucto now has the potential to create
significant value for its shareholders. Sparton looks forward to becoming
a full participant in the development of the Chebucto natural gas field.
New information and results of an updated valuation for Chebucto will be
reported when available.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Walt Disney Co on Monday agreed to buy Marvel Entertainment Inc for $4 billion in the year's biggest media deal, banking on Marvel's pantheon of superheroes to broaden its lineup of movie franchises that appeal to boys.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney adds Spider Man, Iron Man and Thor to its roster of classic characters like Mickey Mouse and Snow White, and will feature the super-heroes in movies before rolling out associated theme park rides, TV shows and merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the deal comes at a tough time in the entertainment business, with advertisers avoiding spending on new campaigns and consumers cutting back on everything from DVDs to travel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is also expensive. It values Marvel at 37 times its estimated 2009 earnings, and offers shareholders a 29 percent premium to Friday's closing price. Standard  Poor's reacted by placing Disney's credit rating on its negative watchlist, saying it may need to issue new debt even as earnings stagnate or fall in the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the risk of overpaying did not deter Disney from seeking out a deal to address an area of concern among investors: How can it better reach more young males.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This helps give Disney more important exposure to the young male demographic that they have sort of lost some ground with in recent years," said David Joyce at Miller Tabak  Co.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney has long been a blockbuster brand with girls thanks to characters such as "Hannah Montana," "Cinderella" and "Snow White," but has struggled to achieve the same kind of success with boys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Movies including "Iron Man 2," the sequel to the smash hit about a billionaire playboy with a high-tech suit of armor due to hit theaters in 2010, or 2011's "Spider-Man 4" and "Avengers", should help resolve that issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney will also be able to use its marketing and entertainment clout -- stretching from ABC to cable television to theme parks -- to promote and build characters such as Thor in ways Marvel never could.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal to buy the 70-year-old studio -- which began life as an arm of a pulp fiction publisher in 1930 before bankruptcy, then rose to prominence in the past few years following Spider-Man -- is Disney's largest since the $7.6 billion purchase of Pixar in 2006, and it made waves.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares in DreamWorks Animation SKG Inc spiked 6.5 percent on speculation it too may become a takeover target.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But analysts raised questions about companies like Viacom Inc, Discovery Communications Inc, and Hasbro Inc that have existing business partnerships with Marvel. Hasbro stands to lose its chance to acquire valuable content for a new TV venture with Discovery, given that Disney is likely to hoard Marvel content for itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;UNDER-PROMISING?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney agreed to pay a total of $30 per share in cash plus about 0.745 Disney shares for each Marvel share owned. The deal was approved by the boards of both companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal is expected to gain approval from antitrust regulators, said Evan Stewart, an antitrust expert with law firm Zuckerman Spaeder LLP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The shares of Marvel, which was founded in 1939 and rolled out its first blockbuster character, Captain America, in 1941, shot up to a high of $49.29 before falling a bit to close at $48.37 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney approached Marvel a few months ago "to get to know them," Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs told Reuters. The overture began with a meeting between Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger and Marvel CEO Ike Perlmutter and evolved into merger discussions over a series of meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We at Disney had admired them because of their position and asset base," Staggs said. "With conversations over time we came to believe in the value of a combination."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of Disney, which will acquire ownership of more than 5,000 Marvel characters, fell 3 percent to $26.04. The deal is expected to close by year-end, but will not add to Disney earnings until fiscal 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Though Disney stands to get a slice of some of Marvel's hottest, upcoming slate of movies -- including "Thor" and "Iron Man 2", it would not gain in the short term from lucrative theatrical distribution fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Paramount Pictures said in a statement its five-picture distribution deal with Marvel remains in force. And Sony Pictures, the division of Sony Co behind the "Spider-Man" movies, can continue to make movies in the franchise, under an existing agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The acquisition came as a surprise, even though Iger had mentioned recently the company would consider acquisitions that bolstered Disney brands across international markets and on new technology platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it could kick-start more mid- to small-sized deals in the media sector -- where stocks have outperformed the broader Standard  Poor's 500 this year -- few analysts see another bidder making a play for Marvel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A major reason is the presence of Marvel's Perlmutter, who owns 37 percent of the company and will oversee it within the Disney empire. Perlmutter will trade his stake in Marvel for a 1 percent stake in Disney, but will not receive a seat on its board of directors -- as did Pixar CEO Steve Jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney was advised on the deal by Goldman Sachs, Allen  Company and Guggenheim Partners, while Marvel worked with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney executives drew a number of parallels between the Pixar and Marvel deals, and suggested it would keep the Marvel brand intact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The goal here is not to rebrand Marvel," Iger said on a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caris  Co analyst David Miller said Disney was "sandbagging a little" by estimating the deal would not add to its earnings for another two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They said the same thing with the Pixar deal," said Miller, who has "above average" ratings on both Disney and Marvel. "They will make it accretive a lot sooner. They are underpromising, as they always do."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And what do the fanboys -- the ones who scrutinize every comic-book adaptation for faithfulness to the original -- say?.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Stan Lee -- the co-creator of Spider-Man and Chairman Emeritus of Marvel -- says don't worry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To me, becoming 'Disneyfied' is not a bad thing. I mean look at (Disney) movies like 'Pirates of the Caribbean,'" Lee, who parted ways with Marvel years ago said in a telephone interview with Reuters. "Disney knows how to do movies."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis in Los Angeles, Franklin Paul in New York and John Tilak in Bangalore; editing by Edwin Chan, Derek Caney, Andre Grenon and Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  SANTA CLARA, CA, Sep 01 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Mimosa Systems, the leader in next-generation email, file, and SharePoint
archiving solutions, today reported that its ecosystem of channel partners
are experiencing tremendous interest and revenue upside when selling the
Mimosa NearPoint(TM) for SharePoint for archiving, discovery and
recovery. The rapid and dramatic adoption of Microsoft SharePoint has
resulted in many opportunities for SharePoint archiving and is fueling
revenue growth for many of Mimosa's value added resellers and system
integrators focused on Microsoft SharePoint.

    Microsoft SharePoint sales broke the $1 billion revenue mark last year
with more than 100 million licenses sold, making SharePoint the "hottest
selling server-side product ever for the company" according to the New
York Times.(1) Growth for the popular content management and collaboration
application remains steady with the installed base of Microsoft Office
SharePoint Server or MOSS expected to grow at a remarkable average annual
growth rate of 25 percent over the next four years,(2) fueling revenue
growth for Mimosa Systems.

    "We are experiencing a surge of activity with SharePoint and expect it to
continue to empower operational efficiencies driven by collaboration,"
said Daniel Vogt, director of marketing for Statera. "Mimosa adds to the
equation with a technology platform that reinforces SharePoint's use in
the enterprise. Mimosa NearPoint for SharePoint strengthens business
continuity and provides policy-based centralized management across what
can become highly distributed pools of data. This can pose data
retention, discovery and item-level recovery challenges that are
extremely well addressed by Mimosa NearPoint for SharePoint -- making it
a significant value-add for any enterprise that has invested in
SharePoint."

    These impressive growth statistics indicate that SharePoint is quickly
becoming an enterprise standard for collaboration in much the same way
Microsoft Exchange is now the standard for enterprise email. However, as
SharePoint becomes the standard for collaborative portals, it will present
the same challenges originally found with Microsoft Exchange, in terms of
operational efficiency as well as Governance, Risk and Compliance. Any
company relying on SharePoint for enterprise collaboration, information
management and records management has to address recovery processes,
standardize retention/storage management policies, and put in place
systems to expedite eDiscovery. Mimosa NearPoint presents tremendous
revenue opportunities for value added resellers and system integrators
who are reselling Microsoft SharePoint to customers and are being asked
to address these business challenges.

    "The day Mimosa came out with NearPoint for SharePoint, it was clear the
company was way ahead of the game in terms of innovation. Mimosa NearPoint
for SharePoint does things that no other single archiving application can
do," said Rand Morimoto, president of Convergent Computing. "Backup only
protects the data, and just a few months ago we did a recovery that took
23 hours for us to get back a single document library that was lost. By
using Mimosa NearPoint for SharePoint archiving, we performed the same
recovery in just a few minutes directly to our SharePoint farm. This
'content-level recovery' is extremely important to anyone using
SharePoint, and a big selling point in our recent recommendations to our
customers of the product."

    Mimosa NearPoint provides a holistic solution to managing SharePoint data
with integrated recovery, storage management, and eDiscovery. NearPoint is
the only SharePoint management product to combine both archiving and
item-level recovery while maintaining easy end-user access to information.
In addition, Mimosa NearPoint offers the most comprehensive SharePoint
data capture available. Customers can capture all content types and
associated metadata, perform continuous capture, and preserve the
relationships between sites and content. This content can then be
offloaded from SharePoint to enable storage cost savings while
maintaining seamless end-user access via optional stubbing capability.
NearPoint also provides full-text indexing and global single-instancing
on all archived content. Moreover, Mimosa NearPoint also manages the
retention and disposition of SharePoint content across the archive in
accordance with organizational policies.

    "As experts in SharePoint infrastructure design, we see a real opportunity
with Mimosa NearPoint for SharePoint," said Ryan Williams, managing
consultant at Project Leadership Associates. "Not only is the Mimosa
SharePoint archiving solution significantly superior to other solutions,
there is no red tape with Mimosa. They match their product with partner
friendly personal service, without any plutocracy. We are eager to expose
this new technology to clients challenged with SharePoint recovery,
information discovery, and data retention requirements."

    "Enterprises want the advantages that SharePoint provides, but also
require capabilities found only through our strategic partner in this
area -- Mimosa Systems. Among a rich feature set, these include proactive
eDiscovery and retention management in the event of a litigation event,"
said Geoff Pearson, managing partner at KiZAN. "As a Microsoft Gold
Certified Partner we pride ourselves in enhancing the work environments of
our customers and Mimosa NearPoint for SharePoint's tight integration with
SharePoint has proven to be a 'must have' offering in our portfolio."

    Mimosa supports its channel partners through the comprehensive Mimosa
Partner Advantage Program. The program offers three tiers of participation
-- Referral, Preferred and Elite -- for value-added resellers, consulting
services partners and system integrators. The Mimosa Partner Advantage
Program is designed to provide comprehensive pre- and post-sales support
for Mimosa NearPoint for SharePoint. For more information, please visit

    "We are excited at the enormous growth opportunity for our partners in the
area of SharePoint archiving," said T.M. Ravi, CEO of Mimosa Systems. "The
astronomic success of SharePoint clearly establishes it as one of the
leading business applications of 2009. As this upward movement continues,
we are eager to work with both existing and new partners to provide them
with the channel enablement tools they need to seize this hot growth
opportunity now."

&lt;p&gt;LDL Cholesterol Levels Remain Among the Best Predictors of Cardiovascular
Events, According to a New Analysis of the Pfizer-Sponsored TNT Clinical Trial 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


For patients with established heart disease who were treated with a statin, 18
novel biomarkers including C-reactive protein (CRP) did not predict future
cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke, according to results of
an analysis presented today at the 2009 European Society of Cardiology Congress
in Barcelona, Spain. By contrast, traditional lipid risk factors were strong
predictors of cardiovascular events. The findings are based on a new post hoc
sub-analysis of patients treated with Lipitor&#174; (atorvastatin calcium) in the
five-year Treating to New Targets (TNT) study. 

These results follow on the heels of findings published recently in the Journal
of the American Medical Association suggesting that novel biomarkers such as CRP
provided minimal additional value beyond conventional risk factors for assessing
cardiovascular risk. "For patients with stable coronary disease who were already
on statin therapy, novel biomarkers do not appear to add predictive value over
traditional lipid markers such as LDL cholesterol," said Dr. John LaRosa,
president and professor of medicine at the State University of New York
Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, NY, and chair of the TNT steering
committee. "Today`s analysis adds to the body of evidence that `traditional`
risk factors, including elevated blood cholesterol and blood pressure, as well
as cigarette smoking, remain the highest priority targets for reducing
cardiovascular risk. Drugs such as atorvastatin, used in this study, have
demonstrated effectiveness in accomplishing this goal." 

To determine whether levels of biomarkers or lipids after an eight-week run-in
period on Lipitor 10 mg were predictive of an increased risk for future
cardiovascular events, a nested case-control analysis of the TNT trial was
performed. Patients included in the TNT trial had coronary heart disease and
were treated with Lipitor. For the analysis, data for 507 patients who
experienced a primary event (defined as cardiac death, heart attack, stroke or
resuscitated cardiac arrest) were compared with data for 1020 patients who did
not experience events. 

The 18 novel biomarkers were not predictive of risk for future cardiovascular
events in patients with stable coronary heart disease already on statin therapy.
Higher levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides and lower levels of HDL
cholesterol, however, were each strongly and significantly predictive of risk
for future events. 

About the TNT Study

The original TNT study was an investigator-led trial coordinated by an
independent steering committee and funded by Pfizer. The study enrolled 10,001
men and women with coronary heart disease aged 35 years to 75 years in 14
countries and followed them for an average of five years. After an eight week
run-in on Lipitor 10 mg, patients were randomized to receive either Lipitor 10
mg or Lipitor 80 mg. Primary study results were published in TheNew England
Journal of Medicine in 2005. 

The primary endpoint of the original TNT study was the time to occurrence of a
first major cardiovascular event, defined as death from heart disease, non-fatal
heart attack, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or fatal or non-fatal stroke. 

Lipitor 80 mg is not a starting dose. Lipitor is not approved in all countries
to reduce the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with existing heart
disease. 

Throughout the TNT study, Lipitor was generally well tolerated. 

Important U.S. Prescribing Information

LIPITOR is a prescription medicine that is used along with a low-fat diet. It
lowers the LDL ("bad" cholesterol) and triglycerides in your blood. It can raise
your HDL ("good" cholesterol) as well. LIPITOR can lower the risk for heart
attack, stroke, certain types of heart surgery, and chest pain in patients who
have heart disease or risk factors for heart disease such as age, smoking, high
blood pressure, low HDL, or family history of early heart disease. 

LIPITOR can lower the risk for heart attack or stroke in patients with diabetes
and risk factors such as diabetic eye or kidney problems, smoking, or high blood
pressure. 

LIPITOR is not for everyone. It is not for those with liver problems. And it is
not for women who are nursing, pregnant or may become pregnant. 

Patients taking LIPITOR should tell their doctor if they feel any new muscle
pain or weakness. This could be a sign of rare but serious muscle side effects.
Patients should tell their doctor about all medications they take. This may help
avoid serious drug interactions. Doctors should do blood tests to check your
liver function before and during treatment and may adjust the dose. Common side
effects are diarrhea, upset stomach, muscle and joint pain, and changes in some
blood tests.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Stan Lee, who co-created many of Marvel Entertainment Inc's most famous characters, gave Disney's takeover bid a thumbs-up on Monday and waved off fears the entertainment conglomerate might undermine decades-old comics mythology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lee, who helped dream up some of the most enduring icons in popular culture from Spider-Man to the Fantastic Four, dismissed notions the core young male audience -- notorious for attacking virtually every comic-book adaptation's faithfulness -- had anything to worry about.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"To me, becoming 'Disneyfied' is not a bad thing. I mean look at (Disney) movies like 'Pirates of the Caribbean,'" Lee, who parted ways with Marvel years ago, but remains its Chairman Emeritus, said in a telephone interview with Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney knows how to do movies. They know how to do colorful characters and I think the fans, if they think about it, they're going to love it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney agreed on Monday to buy Marvel for $4 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Former Marvel executive Shirrel Rhoades said on Monday that some Marvel readers were worried the "comic books will get watered down in a Disney-like way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But for Lee, that spells great things ahead for his creations, such as Thor, the Norse God of Thunder who will anchor a big-screen adaptation in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 86-year-old Lee is no longer involved in the day-to-day operations of the company he helped build into a comics titan from the unknown arm of a pulp-fiction publisher. These days he is the creative force behind his own media company, called POW! Entertainment, which itself has a business partnership with Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2011, Marvel Entertainment plans to release the movie "Thor," based on a Stan Lee character borrowed from European mythology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I was trying to think of something that would be totally different. What could be bigger and even more powerful than the Hulk? And I figured why not a legendary god," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To give Thor more rhetorical punch in the comics, Lee said he gave him dialogue borrowed from the Bible and Shakespeare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gareb Shamus, CEO of Wizard Entertainment and the organizer of several comic-book conventions, said Lee remains a legend in the comic book world and he described meeting Lee to coming face-to-face with a character from the pages of a comic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It doesn't matter where he goes, anywhere around the world, he's the man that created some of your best friends," Shamus added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Alex Dobuzinskis; editing by Edwin Chan and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Toymaker Hasbro Inc may end up one of the biggest losers after Walt Disney Co agreed to buy Marvel Entertainment, as it loses out on a rich source of content for its new TV channel and faces much tougher licensing negotiations in the long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hasbro's agreement with Marvel to make toys and games based on the latter's characters extends through 2017.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But what happens thereafter is a question mark, especially since Disney has a longer history with Hasbro's arch-rival Mattel Inc.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some analysts had hoped Hasbro, the power behind such franchises as Transformers and G.I. Joe, would be able to add some of Marvel's stable of 5,000-odd characters including Spider-Man and Iron Man to its newly launched TV venture with Discovery Communications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, Disney would most likely bring Marvel into its own vast entertainment network, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the near term, we expect Disney to deploy Marvel's content onto its young male focused cable network, Disney XD," UBS analyst Michael Morris said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As many of these deals conclude over time, we will have the flexibility to either bring them in-house or pursue third-party licensing agreements depending on how we feel we can create the most value," Disney Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs said in a conference call.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company is known to drive tough deals, so after it takes over Marvel's brands, Mattel and Hasbro likely face tricky licensing negotiations in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The squeeze is there from the retail side and now the squeeze will be there from the Disney side," said Jed Ferdinand, a licensing and intellectual property attorney for Grimes  Battersby LLP. "They command very favorable and strict terms from their licensing manufacturers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BIG TV LOSS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the biggest lost opportunity may be on TV -- analysts had expected Marvel's relationship with Hasbro to extend onto screens.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, Hasbro signed a deal with Discovery to develop a kids' TV network. Analysts say the Spidey-Mickey deal leaves the No. 2 U.S. toymaker in a spot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We view this as a lost opportunity for 3rd party content as we had thought it was probable that Marvel-related TV content over time would gravitate toward the Hasbro/Discovery joint venture given Hasbro's long-term licensing agreement with Marvel," Wells Fargo Securities analyst Tim Conder said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hasbro has its own programs tied to brands like G.I. Joe, Transformers and My Little Pony lined up for the network, but had mulled beefing up its slate further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Marvel was one of the many potential sources we were looking at for programing for the network and it's probably less likely now," Hasbro spokesman Wayne Charness said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TOUGHER LICENSING DEALS?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Media giant Walt Disney on Monday announced a $4 billion deal to buy Marvel, whose lineup includes such titans of the comic-book world as Wolverine, Iron Man and Thor besides Spider-Man and the Incredible Hulk.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Hasbro and Mattel face a tougher negotiator in deep-pocketed Disney when they try to secure lucrative contracts to churn out everything from toys to backpacks and lunch boxes, experts say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mattel has deals with Disney for Cars, Toy Story, Disney Princess, Mickey Mouse and Winnie the Pooh, to name a few. Mattel declined to comment on the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For toy companies, licensed products help bolster sales, particularly during challenging economic times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2008, brand owners collected $5.7 billion in licensing royalty revenue, but that was down 5.6 percent from a year earlier as tight consumer spending took its toll, a Licensing Industry Merchandisers' Association survey showed in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If toymakers are worrying what the Disney-Marvel deal means for the longer term, they may have company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Viacom unit Paramount Pictures has worldwide distribution rights for Marvel's 'Iron Man 2,' 'Thor,' 'Captain America,' 'Avengers' and 'Iron Man 3' movies, which are not affected by the deal, a Paramount spokesman said, adding that it looks forward to working with Disney after that.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Disney may have other plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The rationale for the deal is more consumer product license focused than film, as the next five films for Marvel remain with Paramount under their existing distribution agreement, though we expect films from Marvel following that to be distributed by Disney," Thomas Weisel analyst Benjamin Mogil said in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal could also be a chance for Disney to accelerate to date limited theme park exploitation by Marvel," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Aarthi Sivaraman in Seattle; Editing Bernard Orr)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Taking on corporate giants can feel like tilting at windmills, but John Kopchinski's six-year legal battle against Pfizer Inc just made him a rich man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gulf War veteran and former Pfizer sales representative will earn more than $51.5 million as a result of his whistleblower lawsuit against the world's biggest drugmaker and the record penalty the company must pay the U.S. government for its massive marketing transgressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unassuming Texas resident celebrated his windfall by having a family portrait photograph taken Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to be staying right here in San Antonio in the same house, and my wife tells me when we go to the movies we're still getting one tub of popcorn -- the large tub," Kopchinski said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kopchinski, appalled by Pfizer's tactics in selling the pain drug Bextra, filed a "qui tam" lawsuit in 2003, sparking federal and state probes that led to Wednesday's agreement by the company to pay $2.3 billion in civil and criminal penalties and plead guilty to a felony charge for promoting Bextra and 12 other drugs for unapproved uses and doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the Army I was expected to protect people at all costs," Kopchinski said in a statement. "At Pfizer I was expected to increase profits at all costs, even when sales meant endangering lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't do that," added Kopchinski, 45, who was fired by Pfizer in March of 2003, two years before the company pulled Bextra from the market over concerns it raised the risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his dismissal after raising his concerns with the company, Kopchinski had a baby son and his wife was pregnant with twins. He went from earning about $125,000 a year to living off his retirement fund before landing a job with an insurance company for $40,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a lot of stress on the family. I pretty much depleted my entire 401(k)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The last six years have been pretty hard, so going forward it's going to be pretty much easier," said Kopchinski, noting that college for his young children "is taken care of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erika Kelton, Kopchinski's lead attorney from the firm of Phillips  Cohen LLP, said large rewards are justified because of what whistleblowers must endure, often for many years, after complaints within the company go unheeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Particularly in pharma, it's no secret that it's an industry that can blackball former employees," Kelton said, "so the reward is important both to encourage people to step forward and to recognize that their contributions are huge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kopchinski and five other whistleblowers will earn more than $102 million in payments from the U.S. government under the False Claims Act through which individuals can reap rewards for exposing corporate wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The use of whistleblowers has really opened up the keys to the kingdom in terms of what's going on in these companies," said Dean Zerbe, senior counsel for the National Whistleblower Center and a partner at the law firm of Zerbe, Fingeret, Frank and Jadav in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You'd never find out what's happening without this kind of reward structure," Zerbe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kopchinski was hired by former Pfizer CEO Edward Pratt in 1992 after carrying out a correspondence with him while serving as a platoon leader in a military police company on the Saudi Arabia-Kuwait border during the Gulf War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a later Pfizer regime, he was selling the epilepsy drug Neurontin when a previous whistleblower suit was filed against the company over similar illegal promotion tactics that led to stiff penalties and a form of corporate probation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time he was told by managers that the Neurontin suit would be in the news and any physicians who asked questions should be told it was just complaints from a disgruntled former employee, Kopchinski said. Ironically, after filing the Bextra suit, "I was the disgruntled former employee," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you see here is a company which essentially had a culture of corruption," said Patrick Burns, a spokesman for Taxpayers Against Fraud, a U.S. nonprofit organization that helps connect whistleblowers with attorneys on False Claims Act cases. He called the $2.3 billion settlement "a jaw-dropping amount of money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the whistleblower rewards announced Wednesday are already having an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm seeing it first-hand myself. I've gotten phone calls this morning," said Zerbe, who was approached by an employee of a hospital who claimed that it was overbilling the government, including charging for products it had received for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential for huge rewards, however, life can be hellish for whistleblowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this was so easy everyone would be a millionaire," Burns said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, may pay up to 1 billion reais ($525 million) to buy Brazilian generic drugmaker Neo Quimica, stepping up smaller acquisitions in fast-growing emerging markets, newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said the company remains on the lookout for smaller deals, as it prepares to complete the acquisition of rival Wyeth. Part of those deals would help counter an expected decline in revenue stemming from the expiration of several drug patents, including cholesterol fighter Lipitor and Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between the two companies, which started early in 2009, were near conclusion, according to Estado, which cited industry sources it did not identify. A director at Neo Quimica declined to comment on the Estado story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said Pfizer would not comment on market speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neo Quimica, based in the Brazilian state of Goias, had revenue of 300 million reais last year, Estado said. Both companies mulled the setup of a joint venture, but instead agreed to a full takeover, Estado said, citing the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One advantage of Neo Quimica relative to other rivals is its extensive distribution network across Brazil and a recent factory upgrade that will help to more than double annual production, Estado said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares fell for a third day on Tuesday, losing 1.9 percent to $16.38 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=1.905 reais)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal, editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LIMA, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Two Peruvian soldiers were killed

three soldiers wounded in a clash that broke out a day earlier,
Defense Minister Rafael Rey said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One soldier on the helicopter was injured, bringing the

claimed only a handful of deaths among rebels. President Alan
Garcia is under increasing pressure to turn the tide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garcia has increased funding in the VRAE to wipe out the

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc agreed on Wednesday to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge relating to promotion of its now-withdrawn Bextra pain medicine and will pay a record $2.3 billion to settle allegations it improperly marketed 13 medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest drugmaker was slapped with the huge fines by the U.S. government after being deemed a repeat offender in pitching drugs to patients and doctors for unapproved uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer pleaded guilty in 2004 to an earlier criminal charge of improper sales tactics and its practices have been under U.S. supervision since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If another one of these charges crops up, it would raise questions whether Jeff Kindler is keeping everyone at Pfizer on a tight enough leash," said Miller Tabak analyst Les Funtleyder, referring to Pfizer's chief executive officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kindler had been Pfizer's general counsel from 2002 until taking the helm in 2006. Pfizer declined to comment when asked if he had negotiated the 2004 settlement, and whether he had recommended any safeguards at the time to prevent the kind of recurrent improprieties described on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company in January said it took a $2.3 billion charge late last year to resolve allegations involving Bextra and other drugs, but did not provide details at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The size and seriousness of this resolution, including the huge criminal fine of $1.3 billion, reflect the seriousness and scope of Pfizer's crimes," said Mike Loucks, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement includes a $1.3 billion criminal fine related to methods of selling Bextra, which was withdrawn from the market in 2005 on safety concerns. Pfizer acquired Bextra in its 2003 purchase of Pharmacia Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's marketing team promoted Bextra for acute pain, surgical pain and other unapproved uses, while its salesforce promoted the drug directly to doctors for those unapproved uses and dosages, according to the U.S. Department of Justice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company and Pharmacia also used advisory boards, consultant meetings and provided travel to lavish resorts to improperly promote Bextra to doctors and made misleading claims about the drug's safety and efficacy, the government said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement also includes $1 billion in civil payments related to so-called "off-label" sales of drugs -- meaning for uses not authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration -- and payments to healthcare professionals. Pfizer denied all of the civil allegations, except for acknowledging improper promotions of the antibiotic Zyvox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We regret certain actions taken in the past, but are proud of the action we've taken to strengthen our internal controls," said Amy Schulman, Pfizer's general counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Department officials said cracking down on fraud in the healthcare industry was a key priority and comes as President Barack Obama is trying to push through reforms of the $2.5 trillion healthcare system to clip soaring costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement and guilty plea are not expected to significantly hurt Pfizer's ability to sell drugs, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. "However, it could send the wrong message at a time when you're making some pretty critical negotiations with the U.S. government on healthcare reform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandra Jordan, a former federal prosecutor and professor at the Charlotte School of Law in North Carolina, said: "Pfizer can survive this and pay the money. If it had fought the government at trial and lost, and a judge imposed a criminal sentence, that could have resulted in a corporate death penalty. That would have put Pfizer out of business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement is the largest to date for improper marketing of prescription drugs, topping the $1.42 billion Eli Lilly and Co agreed to pay earlier this year for off-label sales of its Zyprexa schizophrenia drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it will pay $503 million to resolve practices involving Bextra, $301 million related to its schizophrenia drug Geodon, $98 million for Zyvox and about $50 million for its blockbuster Lyrica used to treat nerve pain and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the $2.3 billion fine, Pfizer said it would take new charges of up to $33 million to resolve state civil consumer fraud allegations related to promotions of Geodon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer ripped off taxpayers across the country to pad its bottom line," New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said most alleged improprieties took place during or before 2005. But some were as recent as 2007, while Pfizer was essentially still on probation for improper Neurontin promotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer did not specify whether it had disciplined any executives in connection with the latest infractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six whistleblowers, including John Kopchinski, a former sales representative who exposed Pfizer's Bextra marketing tactics, sparking the government probes, will be rewarded with more than $102 million under the False Claims Act. Kopchinski's share was expected to be more than $51.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2004 case, Pfizer agreed to pay $430 million to federal and state governments and pleaded guilty to criminal charges of illegally marketing epilepsy drug Neurontin for migraine headaches, pain and bipolar disorder. Pfizer obtained Neurontin in its 2000 acquisition of Warner Lambert Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the earlier settlement, Pfizer's marketing practices have been under federal supervision for the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new settlement, Pfizer must adhere to a specified compliance program for five more years. The pact will require it to post on its website information about payments to doctors such as travel, and set up a system for doctors to report questionable conduct by Pfizer's representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares fell 10 cents, or 0.6 percent, to close at $16.28 on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jeremy Pelofsky and Diane Bartz in Washington and Ransdell Pierson, Bill Berkrot, Lewis Krauskopf, Jonathan Stempel and Joan Gralla in New York; Editing by Maureen Bavdek and Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM has developed an Associate's degree program focused on green data centers that after 2 years or 36 credits would equip computer science students with the know-how to work in energy-efficient computer environments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Five ways to get affordable certification skills&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Big Blue collaborated with Metropolitan Community College (MCC) in Omaha, Neb., to create the curriculum for the institution's Data Center Management course track. IBM will provide hardware, software and online course materials to assist MCC in offering this degree program. A data center on campus will serve as the classroom in which students can learn virtualization and server consolidation, energy efficiency, business resiliency, and security and compliance skills as part of the degree program. The environment runs on IBM Power Systems servers running AIX, i and Linux technologies, according to IBM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Green has become essential to all IT organizations and this degree is designed to give students the skills they need to build more efficient data centers worldwide," says Mark Hanny, vice president of channels and alliances who runs IBM's Academic Initiative worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MCC made an ideal partner in this effort for IBM because its location "sits at an intersection of the fiber optic network running across the country" and several data centers have been located there -- driving up the demand for IT professionals with such skills in the area, Hanny says. For 12 years, MCC has also ranked among the top 10 community colleges nationwide for number of IT graduates, offering several computer courses and programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing a dramatic increase in demand here in Nebraska for specialists who understand how to help companies reduce the costs associated with running an energy-intensive data center," said Tom Pensabene, dean of IT at MCC, in a statement. "Now our students are getting exposure to leading-edge IBM technologies, increasing their changes of being hired for jobs in this growing area."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The courses offered as part of the 2-year, 36-course-hour Associates degree program include networking security, applied data center management, building a secure environment, virtualization, remote access and monitoring, among several others. The curriculum also includes 16 pieces of courseware around green technology, much of which IBM provides free of charge online.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The degree combines IT, data center and facilities management to prepare this generation of technical students with a mix of business and IT skills to a run a more energy-efficient data center," Hanny says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;A Long-time Advocate Against Unlawful and Irresponsible Drug Marketing Tactics,
AHF Lauds the U.S. Justice Department for Holding Pfizer Accountable
WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
As part of its ongoing campaign to lower drug prices and increase access, AIDS
Healthcare Foundation (AHF) today lauded the U.S. Justice Department`s crackdown
on Pfizer, Inc. for its fraudulent drug marketing practices. It was reported
today that Pfizer Inc. agreed to a $1.2 billion criminal fine, the largest in
U.S. history, to resolve an investigation over unlawful prescription drug
promotions, including the promotion of several drugs for the treatment of
medical conditions other than those the drugs had been approved for by federal
regulators-also known as "off-label" use. 

AIDS Healthcare Foundation believes that the fraudulent marketing practices
detailed in today`s announcement strongly echo AHF`s own 2007 lawsuit against
Pfizer, Inc., the manufacturer of the blockbuster erectile-dysfunction (ED)
drug, Viagra (sildenafil citrate), over its irresponsible marketing tactics
drug, which encouraged the drug`s off-label use. AHF sued the drug manufacturer
for "Unlawful, Unfair and Fraudulent Business Practices" and challenged "...the
unjust and illegal conduct of drug maker Pfizer Inc., whose unlawful and
deceptive marketing of its erectile dysfunction drug Viagra has caused an
increase in the spread of sexually transmitted diseases including but not
limited to HIV/AIDS.Pfizer has engaged in and continues to engage in this
conduct despite clear evidence of its illegality and harmful effects." AHF also
banned pharmaceutical sales representatives from Pfizer Inc. from calling on
AHF`s medical providers and staff at its healthcare centers. 

"AHF-a longtime advocate against harmful drug marketing practices-lauds the
actions of the U.S. Justice Department for holding Pfizer accountable for its
illegal and fraudulent actions," said Michael Weinstein, President of AIDS
Healthcare Foundation. "We believe that such practices are, unfortunately,
widespread within the pharmaceutical industry. The time has come for all drug
companies-not just Pfizer-to be held responsible for harm done to public health
in the name of exorbitant profit." 

According to an article in Bloomberg today (Pfizer Agrees to Record Criminal
Fine in Fraud Investigation): "Pfizer Inc. agreed to a $1.2 billion criminal
fine, the largest in U.S. history, and a felony plea by a subsidiary to close an
investigation into what government lawyers described as fraudulent marketing of
drugs&#8230;The four-year investigation uncovered a range of practices, including
kickback payments to doctors in the sale of nine other drugs, among them the
impotence drug Viagra and cholesterol pill Lipitor, officials said."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Taking on corporate giants can feel like tilting at windmills, but John Kopchinski's six-year legal battle against Pfizer Inc just made him a rich man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gulf War veteran and former Pfizer sales representative will earn more than $51.5 million as a result of his whistleblower lawsuit against the world's biggest drugmaker and the record penalty the company must pay the U.S. government for its massive marketing transgressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unassuming Texas resident celebrated his windfall by having a family portrait photograph taken Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to be staying right here in San Antonio in the same house, and my wife tells me when we go to the movies we're still getting one tub of popcorn -- the large tub," Kopchinski said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kopchinski, appalled by Pfizer's tactics in selling the pain drug Bextra, filed a "qui tam" lawsuit in 2003, sparking federal and state probes that led to Wednesday's agreement by the company to pay $2.3 billion in civil and criminal penalties and plead guilty to a felony charge for promoting Bextra and 12 other drugs for unapproved uses and doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the Army I was expected to protect people at all costs," Kopchinski said in a statement. "At Pfizer I was expected to increase profits at all costs, even when sales meant endangering lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't do that," added Kopchinski, 45, who was fired by Pfizer in March of 2003, two years before the company pulled Bextra from the market over concerns it raised the risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his dismissal after raising his concerns with the company, Kopchinski had a baby son and his wife was pregnant with twins.

I pretty much depleted my entire 401(k)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The last six years have been pretty hard, so going forward it's going to be pretty much easier," said Kopchinski, noting that college for his young children "is taken care of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erika Kelton, Kopchinski's lead attorney from the firm of Phillips  Cohen LLP, said large rewards are justified because of what whistleblowers must endure, often for many years, after complaints within the company go unheeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Particularly in pharma, it's no secret that it's an industry that can blackball former employees," Kelton said, "so the reward is important both to encourage people to step forward and to recognize that their contributions are huge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kopchinski and five other whistleblowers will earn more than $102 million in payments from the U.S. government under the False Claims Act through which individuals can reap rewards for exposing corporate wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The use of whistleblowers has really opened up the keys to the kingdom in terms of what's going on in these companies," said Dean Zerbe, senior counsel for the National Whistleblower Center and a partner at the law firm of Zerbe, Fingeret, Frank and Jadav in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You'd never find out what's happening without this kind of reward structure," Zerbe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kopchinski was hired by former Pfizer CEO Edward Pratt in 1992 after carrying out a correspondence with him while serving as a platoon leader in a military police company on the Saudi Arabia-Kuwait border during the Gulf War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a later Pfizer regime, he was selling the epilepsy drug Neurontin when a previous whistleblower suit was filed against the company over similar illegal promotion tactics that led to stiff penalties and a form of corporate probation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time he was told by managers that the Neurontin suit would be in the news and any physicians who asked questions should be told it was just complaints from a disgruntled former employee, Kopchinski said. Ironically, after filing the Bextra suit, "I was the disgruntled former employee," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you see here is a company which essentially had a culture of corruption," said Patrick Burns, a spokesman for Taxpayers Against Fraud, a U.S. nonprofit organization that helps connect whistleblowers with attorneys on False Claims Act cases. He called the $2.3 billion settlement "a jaw-dropping amount of money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the whistleblower rewards announced Wednesday are already having an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm seeing it first-hand myself. I've gotten phone calls this morning," said Zerbe, who was approached by an employee of a hospital who claimed that it was overbilling the government, including charging for products it had received for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential for huge rewards, however, life can be hellish for whistleblowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this was so easy everyone would be a millionaire," Burns said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Taking on corporate giants can feel like tilting at windmills, but John Kopchinski's six-year legal battle against Pfizer Inc just made him a rich man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gulf War veteran and former Pfizer sales representative will earn more than $51.5 million as a result of his whistleblower lawsuit against the world's biggest drugmaker and the record penalty the company must pay the U.S. government for its massive marketing transgressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unassuming Texas resident celebrated his windfall by having a family portrait photograph taken Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to be staying right here in San Antonio in the same house, and my wife tells me when we go to the movies we're still getting one tub of popcorn -- the large tub," Kopchinski said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kopchinski, appalled by Pfizer's tactics in selling the pain drug Bextra, filed a "qui tam" lawsuit in 2003, sparking federal and state probes that led to Wednesday's agreement by the company to pay $2.3 billion in civil and criminal penalties and plead guilty to a felony charge for promoting Bextra and 12 other drugs for unapproved uses and doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the Army I was expected to protect people at all costs," Kopchinski said in a statement. "At Pfizer I was expected to increase profits at all costs, even when sales meant endangering lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't do that," added Kopchinski, 45, who was fired by Pfizer in March of 2003, two years before the company pulled Bextra from the market over concerns it raised the risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his dismissal after raising his concerns with the company, Kopchinski had a baby son and his wife was pregnant with twins.

BofA to Repay TARP (in Part)

Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC) intends to pay back some of the bailout
money it has received from the government in its participation of the Troubled
Asset Relief Program (TARP). 

The government is also pushing the bank to pay at least $500 million to conclude
a tentative pact in which the government agreed to share losses on certain BofA
assets. 

The completion of the payments would enable BofA to reduce a part of the
government's involvement in its affairs. 

Some of the large financial firms that have already repaid government fund are
Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS), Bank of New York Mellon Corporation (NYSE: BK),
Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS) and U.S. Bancorp (NYSE: USB).

Here are highlights from Tuesday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Google Ropes in Sony

Google (Nasdaq: GOOG) recently struck a deal with Sony Corp. (NYSE: SNE),
according to which the latter will ship the Chrome browser pre-installed on some
of its PC models. The financial or other details of the transaction were not
disclosed. A Google spokesperson said that the deal was in the nature of a first
step and agreements with other leading PC-makers are expected to follow. 

We think this is an interesting move and could be leveraged to boost sales of
its Chrome operating system to be launched next year. Microsoft`s (Nasdaq: MSFT)
domination of the web browser space is largely attributable to its strategy of
bundling the Internet Explorer with its operating system. Since MSFT operating
systems continue to be the most commonly used, this is an obvious advantage.
While Microsoft, being the market leader, is hindered by anti-trust actions from
smaller players, Google Chrome is not likely to face this hurdle. 

However, we expect the company to face stiff competition not just from
Microsoft, but also Mozilla`s Firefox, Apple`s (Nasdaq: AAPL) Safari and Opera,
which is more commonly used as a mobile phone web browser. 

Sony`s share of the PC market has been shrinking and the company has dropped out
of the top five, based on shipments to the U.S. and worldwide (according to both
IDC and Gartner) to top companies such as Hewlett Packard Co. (NYSE: HPQ).

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Pfizer, the world's largest drug company, may pay up to 1 billion reais ($525 million) to buy Brazilian generic drugmaker Neo Quimica, stepping up smaller acquisitions in fast-growing emerging markets, newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last month, Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio said the company remains on the lookout for smaller deals, as it prepares to complete the acquisition of rival Wyeth. Part of those deals would help counter an expected decline in revenue stemming from the expiration of several drug patents, including cholesterol fighter Lipitor and Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Talks between the two companies, which started early in 2009, were near conclusion, according to Estado, which cited industry sources it did not identify. A director at Neo Quimica declined to comment on the Estado story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The newspaper said Pfizer would not comment on market speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Neo Quimica, based in the Brazilian state of Goias, had revenue of 300 million reais last year, Estado said. Both companies mulled the setup of a joint venture, but instead agreed to a full takeover, Estado said, citing the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One advantage of Neo Quimica relative to other rivals is its extensive distribution network across Brazil and a recent factory upgrade that will help to more than double annual production, Estado said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's shares fell for a third day on Tuesday, losing 1.9 percent to $16.38 in New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=1.905 reais)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Guillermo Parra-Bernal, editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Statements by President`s Correa`s Top Lawyer Raise Concerns about Prosecutorial
Independence
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The following is a statement by Charles James, executive vice president, Chevron
Corp. (NYSE:CVX), regarding the response by the government of Ecuador to
evidence filed Monday regarding judicial misconduct by the judge in a lawsuit
involving the company in that country and evidence of an apparent bribe scheme
associated with the case: 

"We welcome news of the decision by the Prosecutor General to open a formal
investigation into the evidence we presented to his office Monday, August 31. We
hope that his investigation will be thorough, independent and transparent, and
that he makes his findings public. 

"We are disappointed, however, that certain government officials, and persons
associated with the plaintiffs, have attacked Chevron for bringing evidence of
wrongdoing to light. When asked by a local reporter what the Ecuadorian
government should do, Alexis Mera, legal advisor to President Correa, stated
that the Prosecutor General should begin by investigating Chevron`s lawyers. In
the same response, Mr. Mera stated that the recordings have 'no legal value.' As
legal advisor to President Correa, Mr. Mera must recognize that his statements
to the media only raise further concerns of prejudgment and government
involvement in the Lago Agrio trial. Chevron has not asserted that Mr. Mera was
involved in wrongdoing as indicated in the video. However, Mr. Mera is directly
referenced in the transcripts and videos turned over as evidence to the
Prosecutor General on Monday (see transcript excerpts included below). Mr.
Mera`s apparent direct interest in the investigation is difficult to square with
the standards of impartiality and transparency we hope will characterize the
investigation by the Prosecutor General."

 Borja:      Yes, Aulo told me yesterday. I mean, as I told him, they did the transfer to buy the Apartment of Salinas from one day to the next. That`s how they did the transfer. And he has the account at Citi International, I mean, he can take it out here, right? And it`s already justified and all that shit, I mean, I don`t see the problem.  
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
 Garcia:     Now it`s just the process, Alexis Mera, in fact, has already given him instructions.

 Garcia:     The legal advisor to the president`s office. Instructions in the sense of how the money is going to be routed.

&lt;p&gt;Company Reaches Settlement with States on Related Matter
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Inc today announced that it has finalized a previously reported agreement
in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to settle an
investigation regarding past off-label promotional practices related to Bextra,
which Pfizer voluntarily withdrew from the market in 2005. The final agreement
also resolves other DOJ investigations involving alleged past off-label
promotional practices concerning Zyvox, Geodon and Lyrica, allegations related
to certain payments to healthcare professionals involving these and nine other
Pfizer medicines, and several related qui tam actions. Pfizer previously
disclosed a related $2.3 billion charge to its fourth-quarter and full-year 2008
earnings in connection with the DOJ agreement in principle on January 26, 2009.
No additional charge to the company`s earnings will be recorded in connection
with this settlement. 

In addition, the company has reached agreements with attorneys general in 42
states and the District of Columbia to settle state civil consumer protection
allegations related to its past promotional practices concerning Geodon. The
company will pay a total of $33 million to the settling states and will take a
charge in that amount to third-quarter 2009 earnings. 

"These agreements bring final closure to significant legal matters and help to
enhance our focus on what we do best - discovering, developing and delivering
innovative medicines to treat patients dealing with some of the world`s most
debilitating diseases," said Amy W. Schulman, senior vice president and general
counsel of Pfizer. "We regret certain actions taken in the past, but are proud
of the action we`ve taken to strengthen our internal controls and pioneer new
procedures so that we not only comply with state and federal laws, but also meet
the high standards that patients, physicians and the public expect from a
leading worldwide company dedicated to healing and better health. Corporate
integrity is an absolute priority for Pfizer, and we will continue to take
appropriate actions to further enhance our compliance practices and strengthen
public trust in our company." 

Under the agreement with the DOJ, Pfizer will pay a previously disclosed total
of $2.3 billion ($1.0 billion in civil payments related to a number of
medicines, and a $1.3 billion criminal penalty related only to Bextra), and a
Pfizer subsidiary, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, Inc., will plead guilty to one
criminal count of violating the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act related to its
past promotion of Bextra. A portion of the civil payments will be distributed to
49 states and the District of Columbia pursuant to agreements with each state`s
Medicaid division. 

The terms of the DOJ settlement require Pfizer to pay approximately $503 million
to resolve civil allegations concerning past promotional practices related to
Bextra. In addition, the company will make payments to resolve other civil
allegations involving past promotional practices as follows: approximately $301
million for Geodon, approximately $98 million for Zyvox, and approximately $50
million for Lyrica. The settlement also includes a civil payment of
approximately $48 million to resolve allegations relating to certain payments to
healthcare professionals involving nine other Pfizer medicines. 

Pfizer expressly denies all of these civil allegations, with the exception that
Pfizer acknowledges certain improper actions related to the promotion of Zyvox. 

As part of the DOJ settlement, Pfizer has entered into a Corporate Integrity
Agreement (CIA) with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The CIA institutes certain new
measures and requires Pfizer to continue maintenance of a corporate compliance
program for a period of five years. 

Pfizer`s existing compliance program includes a dedicated chief compliance
officer, corporate compliance committee, code of conduct, extensive compliance
training, policies and procedures regarding the appropriate promotion of
Pfizer`s products, auditing and monitoring, a compliance hotline and extensive
procedures to investigate and remediate potential issues of non-compliance with
company policy or applicable legal requirements. Pursuant to the CIA, Pfizer
will engage an Independent Review Organization (IRO) that will help the company
assess and evaluate its promotional and product-related business functions. 

The CIA memorializes additional voluntary initiatives that reflect the company`s
efforts toward greater transparency such as Pfizer`s plan, announced in February
2009, to disclose publicly its financial relationships with physicians, medical

&lt;p&gt;Company Reaches Settlement with States on Related Matter
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc today announced that it has finalized a previously reported agreement
in principle with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to settle an
investigation regarding past off-label promotional practices related to Bextra,
which Pfizer voluntarily withdrew from the market in 2005. The final agreement
also resolves other DOJ investigations involving alleged past off-label
promotional practices concerning Zyvox, Geodon and Lyrica, allegations related
to certain payments to healthcare professionals involving these and nine other
Pfizer medicines, and several related qui tam actions. Pfizer previously
disclosed a related $2.3 billion charge to its fourth-quarter and full-year 2008
earnings in connection with the DOJ agreement in principle on January 26, 2009.
No additional charge to the company`s earnings will be recorded in connection
with this settlement. 

In addition, the company has reached agreements with attorneys general in 42
states and the District of Columbia to settle state civil consumer protection
allegations related to its past promotional practices concerning Geodon. The
company will pay a total of $33 million to the settling states and will take a
charge in that amount to third-quarter 2009 earnings. 

"These agreements bring final closure to significant legal matters and help to
enhance our focus on what we do best - discovering, developing and delivering
innovative medicines to treat patients dealing with some of the world`s most
debilitating diseases," said Amy W. Schulman, senior vice president and general
counsel of Pfizer. "We regret certain actions taken in the past, but are proud
of the action we`ve taken to strengthen our internal controls and pioneer new
procedures so that we not only comply with state and federal laws, but also meet
the high standards that patients, physicians and the public expect from a
leading worldwide company dedicated to healing and better health. Corporate
integrity is an absolute priority for Pfizer, and we will continue to take
appropriate actions to further enhance our compliance practices and strengthen
public trust in our company." 

Under the agreement with the DOJ, Pfizer will pay a previously disclosed total
of $2.3 billion ($1.0 billion in civil payments related to a number of
medicines, and a $1.3 billion criminal penalty related only to Bextra), and a
Pfizer subsidiary, Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company, Inc., will plead guilty to one
criminal count of violating the U.S. Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act related to its
past promotion of Bextra. A portion of the civil payments will be distributed to
49 states and the District of Columbia pursuant to agreements with each state`s
Medicaid division. 

The terms of the DOJ settlement require Pfizer to pay approximately $503 million
to resolve civil allegations concerning past promotional practices related to
Bextra. In addition, the company will make payments to resolve other civil
allegations involving past promotional practices as follows: approximately $301
million for Geodon, approximately $98 million for Zyvox, and approximately $50
million for Lyrica. The settlement also includes a civil payment of
approximately $48 million to resolve allegations relating to certain payments to
healthcare professionals involving nine other Pfizer medicines. 

Pfizer expressly denies all of these civil allegations, with the exception that
Pfizer acknowledges certain improper actions related to the promotion of Zyvox. 

As part of the DOJ settlement, Pfizer has entered into a Corporate Integrity
Agreement (CIA) with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The CIA institutes certain new
measures and requires Pfizer to continue maintenance of a corporate compliance
program for a period of five years. 

Pfizer`s existing compliance program includes a dedicated chief compliance
officer, corporate compliance committee, code of conduct, extensive compliance
training, policies and procedures regarding the appropriate promotion of
Pfizer`s products, auditing and monitoring, a compliance hotline and extensive
procedures to investigate and remediate potential issues of non-compliance with
company policy or applicable legal requirements. Pursuant to the CIA, Pfizer
will engage an Independent Review Organization (IRO) that will help the company
assess and evaluate its promotional and product-related business functions. 

The CIA memorializes additional voluntary initiatives that reflect the company`s
efforts toward greater transparency such as Pfizer`s plan, announced in February
2009, to disclose publicly its financial relationships with physicians, medical
organizations and patient advocacy groups, including investigators who conduct
clinical research. Pfizer is the first biopharmaceutical company to commit to
reporting payments for conducting Phase I-IV clinical trials in addition to
disclosing payments for speaking and consulting. Although Pfizer was subject to
a prior CIA, it has consistently and voluntarily strengthened its compliance
program beyond those requirements, including enhancements to the company`s
comprehensive product risk assessment and mitigation process and compliance
monitoring operations.

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Sep 02 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Aberdeen Group, a Harte-Hanks Company (NYSE: HHS),
today announced the availability of a new online assessment tool designed
specifically for organizations seeking to improve their Green IT
capabilities, performance and ROI. The tool, which utilizes Aberdeen's
primary research in Green IT and Sustainability, helps companies of all
sizes identify potential areas for improvement, including server and data
center virtualization, energy efficiency, end-user collaboration, and
recommends steps that companies should take to address these capabilities
and achieve ROI from their Green IT investments.

    The tool automatically compares companies of a similar size. Large
companies are compared with other large companies while midsize firms are
compared with companies that have about the same number of employees.

    The assessment helps companies determine their Green IT posture by
benchmarking against Best-in-Class organizations, as identified through
Aberdeen's PACE(TM) (Pressures, Actions, Capabilities &amp; Enablers) research
model. By completing a 10-minute online survey, participants receive a
personalized summary of how they compare and can quickly identify the
Green IT strategies, capabilities, and technologies used by companies with
Best-in-Class performance. Participants can also receive an assessment of
over a dozen KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) associated with determining
the potential ROI that can be achieved from Green IT initiatives.

    "This assessment tool will help companies quickly identify opportunities
to improve their operational efficiency and provide them with a
competitive advantage," said Rich Lechner, IBM vice president of energy
and the environment. "IBM and Aberdeen have developed a simple way to help
companies get started saving money, attracting the best talent and gaining
new customers by focusing on sustainability."

    "Aberdeen is pleased to partner with IBM and enable organizations to make
timely, informed decisions on their Green IT strategies based on our
industry research," said Andrew Boyd, President of Aberdeen. "The
Assessment Tool Series, launched in 2004, has proven to be a very
effective format to share research in a very personalized way."

&lt;p&gt;SAO PAULO, Sept 2 (Reuters) - Pfizer (PFE.N), the world's
largest drug company, may pay up to 1 billion reais ($525
million) to buy Brazilian generic drugmaker Neo Quimica,
stepping up smaller acquisitions in fast-growing emerging
markets, newspaper O Estado de S. Paulo said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Last month, Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D'Amelio
said the company remains on the lookout for smaller deals, as
it prepares to complete the acquisition of rival Wyeth WYE.N.
Part of those deals would help counter an expected decline in
revenue stemming from the expiration of several drug patents,including cholesterol fighter Lipitor and Viagra.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Talks between the two companies, which started early in
2009, were near conclusion, according to Estado, which cited
industry sources it did not identify. A director at Neo Quimica
declined to comment on the Estado story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The newspaper said Pfizer would not comment on market
speculation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Neo Quimica, based in the Brazilian state of Goias, had
revenue of 300 million reais last year, Estado said. Both
companies mulled the setup of a joint venture, but instead
agreed to a full takeover, Estado said, citing the sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One advantage of Neo Quimica relative to other rivals is
its extensive distribution network across Brazil and a recent
factory upgrade that will help to more than double annual
production, Estado said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's shares fell for a third day on Tuesday, losing 1.9
percent to $16.38 in New York.

&lt;p&gt;SINGAPORE, Sept 2 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co said on
Wednesday it had hired seven new staff for its commodities and
energy sales and trading team as part of its Asian expansion,
signalling the start of an industry upturn after a year of
turmoil.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan's (JPM.N) move follows Bank of America Merrill
Lynch's (BAC.N) announcement on Tuesday that it had added five
senior staff to its Asia Pacific Commodities
team.[ID:nSIN477561]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an emailed statement, JPMorgan said it had appointed
Justin Hyde as as an Executive Director and head of Asia
Investor Sales and Structuring, moving from Barclays (BARC.L)
where he was Head of Asia Commodity Investor Solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Subhramit Das, who has eight years of experience in
derivatives sales and structuring, joins the bank as an
Executive Director and Senior Commodities Structurer from UBS
(UBSN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Motoki Iida, from Morgan Stanley, has been named Executive
Director and Japanese Oil Product Trader, while Ken Leask joins
as Executive Director and Crude Trader. Previously, Leask was
an Executive Director with Morgan Stanley.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; These new appointments come amid widespread anecdotal
evidence of more active hirings after a period of uncertainty
when companies froze their expansion plans in the wake of the
recession. [ID:nSP377504]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last month, JPMorgan's chief executive for the Asia Pacific
Global Commodities Group, Oral Dawe, told Reuters the bank was
looking to deepen its aggressive commodities market expansion
by trading physical base metals and coal, and re-entering
Australia after a five-year absence, with Asia the priority.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank has expanded its Asia-based personnel by 30
percent over the past 12 months, helping swell its global ranks
to 500, challenging entrenched giants Goldman Sachs (GS.N) and
Morgan Stanley (MS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan had added some 50 people last year in commodities
globally, with the total in Asia rising to 110.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; David Max Seng Wang also joins the bank as an Executive
Director and Senior Metals Marketer from Goldman Sachs, where
he spent the last eight years in the commodities derivative
sales businesses for energy, metals and mining and agriculture.
The bank also hired Damian Yang Meng Au as Executive Director
and Senior Coal Trader from Vitol Asia Pte Ltd, and Daniel
Soong as Executive Director and Senior Oil Derivatives Trader
from Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Asia is increasingly seen as a promising growth area for
energy and commodities in view of possible stricter regulatory
limits on U.S. futures trading, putting a premium on those with
regional expertise.

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI (Reuters) - JPMorgan's (JPM.N) China fund venture aims to triple its assets under management in five years and plans to start managing overseas investors' money as soon as this year, a senior executive said, potentially challenging foreign asset managers such as Martin Currie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;China International Fund Management Co initially plans to raise funds from overseas investors through foreign partner JPMorgan Asset Management UK, and invest the money in China under the Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (QFII) scheme, Chief Executive Officer Mandy Wang said at the China Investment Summit on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the proposal gets regulatory approval, China International could become the first China-based fund house to receive management fees from foreigners investing in yuan-denominated A shares. Currently, QFII money is managed by foreign firms such as Martin Currie and UBS (UBSN.VX), with domestic fund houses only providing advisory services.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most QFII managers are based in places like Hong Kong or London, and they don't have enough people on the ground in China," Wang said at the summit, held at the Reuters office in Shanghai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"China has great market potential, as well as a growing number of excellent researchers. We hope that we could start this business this year."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Five-year-old China International, jointly established by JPMorgan Asset Management and Shanghai International Trust Corp, which is Shanghai government-owned, is China's 10th biggest fund-management firm with 60.25 billion yuan ($8.82 billion) of assets under management as of June 30, according to Shanghai-based fund consultancy Z-Ben Advisors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=6.830 Yuan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Samuel Shen and Edmund Klamann; Editing by Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) is targeting China's retail, auto and insurance sectors as emerging industries that are growing faster than the country's overall economy, a senior executive in China told Reuters on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IBM's strategy dovetails with Beijing's efforts to shift its focus for economic growth toward domestic consumption and away from the past emphasis on the export sector, which has been shrinking sharply due to the global financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have identified the industries where we want to go deep on," Shirley Yu-Tsui, a vice president of strategy for IBM in greater China, said at the Reuters China Investment Summit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They could be small today, but we see them as big opportunities for us in the next five to 10 years," she said at the Reuters office in Beijing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;China became the world's largest auto market earlier this year and is still growing faster than the global industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM still expects the traditional sectors in China -- banking, telecom and government projects -- to continue to grow strongly, but other areas will become more important as China shifts its growth model toward consumption and away from exports.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at those three (traditional) sectors they are probably 67 percent of China's market opportunities," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But retailers, such as electronics retailer Suning Appliance Co Ltd, an IBM client that opened three stores in 2006 but added more than 100 stores last year, are growing faster, said Yu-Tsui.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Think about the pressure that puts on their back-office operations -- it's tremendous," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suning's competition is no longer just from domestic rivals, but also comes form the more sophisticated multinationals that are coming to China, she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They want IBM to be their partner so Suning can concentrate on growth," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Suning competes with Best Buy Co Inc (BBY.N), the biggest U.S. electronics retailer, and domestic rival GOME Electrical Appliances (0493.HK) for customers in China, the world's third-biggest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another key sector is railroads, in which consultancy McKinsey reckons foreign commercial participation is only about 1.5 percent currently, a sliver of what it could be as China modernizes and builds out its rail network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;IBM established its first rail innovation center in Beijing to help it tap into the country's planned $731 billion spending in the sector, investment that analysts say could account for more than half of the world's total railway equipment market in the next two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Kirby Chien; Editing by Ken Wills)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Windows Server 2008 R2 will help Microsoft narrow the feature gap with virtualization products from VMware and Citrix Systems, but its new Hyper-V software still won't be "production-ready" for most enterprise applications, according to Burton Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analyst company did a side by side comparison of VMware's vSphere 4, released in May, Citrix's XenServer 5.5, released in June, and Microsoft's Hyper-V Server 2008 R2, which is due to ship with its Windows Server OS upgrade in October. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite several improvements, Hyper-V will still lack three of the 27 features that Burton Group considers requirements for most enterprise applications running in production, Burton Group analyst Richard Jones said at VMworld Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burton Group compiled a list of criteria for running enterprise applications in a virtual environment, including features related to high availability, live migration, memory management, security, networking, storage, licensing and power management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just a few months ago, VMware was the only company that met all of Burton Group's must-have requirements. It added XenServer to the list in July following its release of XenServer 5.5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst company admits that its list of features won't be required for all scenarios, but it sees them as a good general guide. It also noted that Microsoft has won some customers for its existing Hyper-V products, especially among smaller businesses and for departmental use.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The features it still lacks for the enterprise, according to Burton Group, are the ability to prioritize virtual machine restarts; support for a minimum of two virtual CPUs per guest operating system; and the lack of a fault-tolerant management server.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first can be important because dependencies can exist between virtual machines, so companies may need to start them in a particular order, said Burton Group analyst Chris Wolf. The second translates to a lack of compute power: Microsoft supports more than two virtual CPUs with its newest OSes, but only two with Windows Server 2003, and one for all other operating systems, Wolf said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the third point, Microsoft's System Center Virtual Machine Manager can't run on a cluster of servers, Wolf said. "Microsoft will argue that you can put it in a virtual machine and fail the VM over [to another server], but that's not the point; it can't be made fault tolerant," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nevertheless, the upcoming Hyper-V release has some significant enhancements, including live migration of virtual machines; cluster shared volumes; support for third-party cluster file systems; hardware-assisted memory virtualization, and virtual storage hot-add, Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company also does better than Citrix on the list of features Burton Group considers "preferred" but not required. Hyper-V will lack 14 of the 42 preferred features, while XenServer lacks 17 and VMware seven. The picture is similar for "optional" features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft responded to the findings by highlighting customers that it says are using its product. &#8220;Our customers have their own scorecards, and Ingersoll Rand, Jackson Energy Authority, and the University of Miami have experienced success and cost savings through using our products,&#8221; the company said via email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burton Group found at least one "preferred" feature that both XenServer and Hyper-V have, but which VMware lacks: virtual storage disk compatibility. "VMware is proprietary; it doesn't support other hypervisors," Wolf said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Burton Group presented its findings at a VMworld session entitled "Hypervisor Competitive Differences: What the Vendors Aren&#8217;t Telling You." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's hard for customers to compare vendors' products using their data sheets because each tries to make its products look best, and sometimes the vendors say they have a certain feature even if it is poorly implemented, Jones said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Glemmestad, an IT engineer with Norwegian agricultural supplier Felleskjopet, said Burton Group's assessment made sense to him. He'd read that the analyst firm considers XenServer production-ready but came to the session to find out on what basis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His company mainly uses VMware, but it is considering XenServer to virtualize their XenApp servers, he said. &lt;/p&gt;

PlayStation 3 ahead of the critical shopping season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft plans to cut the price of the Xbox 360 Elite, which
comes with a 120-gigabyte hard disk drive, to 29,800 yen ($321)
on Sept. 10 from 39,800 yen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The price of the entry-level Xbox Arcade model will stay at

Xbox 360 model with a 60-GB hard drive, in line with its

euros to 249.99 euros in Europe. [ID:nN27198242]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sony, which competes head-on with Microsoft in terms of
functionality of their game consoles and target users, said two
weeks ago that it would launch a slimmer, cheaper version of the
PlayStation 3, in a bid to jump-start sales. [ID:nLI152101]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Following Microsoft's price cut announcements last week for
markets outside Japan, Nintendo Co Ltd 7974.OS said it has no
plan to lower prices of its top-selling Wii console.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Wii sells for 25,000 yen in Japan, compared with the new
Xbox 360 Elite price of 29,800 yen and 29,980 yen for the slimmer
PS3 model, which will hit store shelves on Thursday.

&lt;p&gt;VMware has defended its decision to place new restrictions on sponsors and exhibitors at this year&#8217;s VMworld conference, blaming the move on &#8220;shenanigans&#8221; pulled by Microsoft at last year&#8217;s VMworld in Las Vegas.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One year ago, Microsoft handed out casino chips directing VMworld attendees to a Web site titled &#8220;VMware costs way too much.&#8221; At the time, Microsoft was a &#8220;gold sponsor&#8221; of VMworld. But at this year&#8217;s show in San Francisco Microsoft is no longer a sponsor and claims that new VMworld rules prevent it from exhibiting the latest version of System Center Virtual Machine Manager on the show floor. Citrix has made similar complaints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But new VMworld policies are based on industry-standard contract clauses, and Microsoft has only itself to blame, says Ben Matheson, senior director of alliance marketing and global campaigns for VMware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;We&#8217;ve had to [change VMworld policies], to be quite honest, because of some of the shenanigans that our partners pulled last year, which we considered to be in pretty poor taste,&#8221; Matheson said during an interview at the conference this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matheson specifically referred to Microsoft&#8217;s casino chip ploy, and claimed that Microsoft representatives were kicked out of the Venetian casino, where the conference was being held, because the giveaway violated a Vegas rule against giving away poker chips. The chips were reportedly authentic $1 Venetian chips in a package that said &#8220;Looking for your best bet? You won&#8217;t find it with VMware.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;A sense of humor&#8217;s good,&#8221; Matheson says, &#8220;but it&#8217;s more of a concern of what length are they willing to go? And at our own event, which is meant to support VMware and our ecosystem of partners, do we really want them going to the next extreme? Who knows what they&#8217;re going to do next?&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This year, VMworld did not allow vendors to sponsor the show or occupy the larger booths on the exhibition floor unless they are members of VMware&#8217;s Technology Alliance Partner program. Citrix and Microsoft were thus limited to ten-foot-by-ten-foot booths.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware also introduced new language in its sponsor and exhibitor agreement, which seems to outlaw vendors from exhibiting products that compete against VMware. The language reads as follows: &#8220;Sponsors and exhibitors must market or demonstrate products on the exhibition floor and in the sessions which are complementary to VMware products and technologies. Complementary products and services are defined as products/services that do not overlap/substitute with VMware's products/capabilities, and help expand the reach and solution scope of VMware's capabilities solely as deemed by VMware.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Back in May, a VMware spokeswoman denied that the language is intended to restrict competitors, saying &#8220;competing vendors are allowed to exhibit, including exhibiting competing products.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, Microsoft and Citrix decided not to exhibit competing products at VMworld, and comments from Matheson this week indicate they may have made the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;If they want to show complementary technologies, products that work with VMware, they&#8217;re allowed to do that,&#8221; Matheson said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When asked if he considers Microsoft&#8217;s System Center Virtual Machine Manager to be &#8220;complementary&#8221; to VMware, Matheson responded: &#8220;I think it depends on what they&#8217;re going to showcase.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware says that Microsoft places identical limitations on vendors at their own conferences.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&#8220;It&#8217;s a standard piece of contract language,&#8221; Matheson said. &#8220;We&#8217;ve looked at their contracts and it&#8217;s the same exact verbage that they use.&#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Network World asked Microsoft for its own sponsor and exhibitor contract language last week and this week, but the company did not provide it. Microsoft also declined to respond to Matheson&#8217;s claim that Microsoft officials were kicked out of the Venetian last year for handing out poker chips.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Citrix denies that VMware&#8217;s new policies are standard and used its official company blog to publicly invite VMware to sponsor its Synergy 2010 conferences next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;AT VMworld this week, Citrix officials spent their time giving away T-shirts with slogans such as &#8220;Got Xen?&#8221; and &#8220;You can&#8217;t lock Xen in a 10X10.&#8221; The company exhibited an in-development desktop hypervisor on the show floor, but not its flagship XenServer virtualization product.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft mainly used its booth to promote various virtualization-related Twitter accounts, answer questions from customers, give away high-speed USB hubs and hold a contest for a Microsoft Zune giveaway.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Numerous customers asked to see demos of System Center, but were instead directed to online resources to get information, Microsoft technical product manager Edwin Yuen said. Microsoft also did not host any sessions at this year&#8217;s show, Yuen said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Follow Jon Brodkin on Twitter here&#160;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - The U.S. Court of Appeals has granted Microsoft Corp's request to stay an injunction imposed by a federal court that would have halted sales of some versions of its popular Word application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an order issued on Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit said Microsoft had met requirements to merit a stay of the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft asked for the stay two weeks ago, as it requested an expedited review of its appeal against a court ruling last month that found Microsoft was in breach of a patent held by a small Canadian software firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Court of Appeals granted the request for an expedited review and will hear arguments on the case on September 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On August 12, a U.S. district court in Texas ruled in favor of i4i Ltd in a long-running dispute against Microsoft, slapping more than $290 million in damages on Microsoft and issuing an injunction preventing the world's top software company from selling versions of Word that contain the disputed patent technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The patent in question relates to the use of XML, or extensible markup language, in the 2003 and 2007 versions of Word. The injunction was set to take effect in 60 days from the ruling, which would have been mid-October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are happy with the result and look forward to presenting our arguments on the main issues on September 23," said Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A representative for i4i was not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is: i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc v. Microsoft Corp, an appeal from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in case no. 07-CV-113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby, editing by Leslie Gevirtz)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; In an order issued on Thursday, the U.S. Court of Appeals
for the Federal Circuit said Microsoft had met requirements to
merit a stay of the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft asked for the stay two weeks ago, as it requested
an expedited review of its appeal against a court ruling last
month that found Microsoft was in breach of a patent held by a
small Canadian software firm.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Court of Appeals granted the request for an expedited
review and will hear arguments on the case on Sept. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Aug. 12, a U.S. district court in Texas ruled in favor
of i4i Ltd in a long-running dispute against Microsoft,
slapping more than $290 million in damages on Microsoft and
issuing an injunction preventing the world's top software
company from selling versions of Word that contain the disputed
patent technology. [ID:nBNG539206]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The patent in question relates to the use of XML, or
extensible markup language, in the 2003 and 2007 versions of
Word. The injunction was set to take effect in 60 days from the
ruling, which would have been mid-October.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are happy with the result and look forward to
presenting our arguments on the main issues on Sept. 23," said
Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A representative for i4i was not immediately available for
comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is: i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures
for Information Inc v. Microsoft Corp, an appeal from the U.S.
District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in case no.

&lt;p&gt;New User Account Control "Slider" is Not an Effective Enterprise Feature;
Introduces Options That Both Lessen Desktop Security and Increase Risk of
Malware Installation
PORTSMOUTH, N.H.--(Business Wire)--
As the October 22 release date of Microsoft Windows 7 approaches, BeyondTrust
Corporation, the first provider of Least Privilege Management solutions, is
urging enterprises to conduct a thorough investigation into the changes to User
Account Control (UAC) as they consider and prepare for deploying the new
operating system. Windows 7 will bring little relief for enterprises seeking to
deploy end users as standard users, i.e., users without administrator rights.
While changes to Windows 7`s UAC benefit the home user market, enterprises must
be aware that the new "slider" feature is only for administrators and may
increase security risks. 

Microsoft introduced UAC in Windows Vista to reduce the frequency that users run
with administrative privileges, thereby limiting the ability of malware to
install on desktop systems. Despite its good intentions, Vista`s UAC was widely
criticized due to its frequent user prompting, as well as application
compatibility issues for standard users. In response to the feedback that users
were forced to respond to too many prompts, Windows 7 features a new approach to
UAC, providing a four-position slider feature to control how often UAC pop-ups
occur. This feature is only available to users logged in with administrator
rights. The lowest setting disables UAC, a popular feature request by Vista home
users. Windows 7 introduces no new features to solve the application
compatibility issues experienced by standard users. 

"For enterprises, there is little benefit to the changes to User Account Control
in Windows," said John Moyer, CEO of BeyondTrust. "Windows 7 introduces cosmetic
changes to reduce the prompts that plagued Vista, but it does nothing to fix the
underlying productivity and usability problems for standard users, which is the
preferred and most secure configuration for a growing number of organizations.
Enterprises must recognize that Windows 7`s UAC slider puts end-users in charge
of the security decision of what to run with administrative privileges, which is
essentially an invitation for malicious users, hackers and malware." 

In order to take advantage of the new slider settings in Windows 7 UAC,
enterprises must deploy users as administrators, giving them full control to
make any changes to the operating system, such as unauthorized installations and
disabling of security measures such as antivirus software. As a result, the most
secure configuration option for enterprises remains running end-users as
standard users, with administrator rights removed. In fact, recent research by
BeyondTrust shows that 92 percent of all critical vulnerabilities announced by
Microsoft in 2008 could have been mitigated by eliminating admin rights. 

Despite growing CSO and CISO recognition of the need to deploy end-users as
standard users, and requirements by the Federal Government for the removal of
administrator rights under the Federal Desktop Core Configuration (FDCC)
mandate, Windows 7 includes no significant changes to UAC for standard users. As
a result, enterprises will still be unable to create policies that allow
standard users to transparently install and utilize approved applications that
require administrative privileges. Companies that seek the security benefits of
removing administrator rights from end-users will suffer the adverse
productivity and technical support impact of no longer being able to run
critical applications that require administrative privileges or install approved
software. 

For enterprises seeking to eliminate administrator rights on end-user systems
while transparently elevating permissions for authorized applications,
BeyondTrust Privilege Manager remains the best and most secure option. In fact,
Microsoft took the step of recommending Privilege Manager as part of a
"best-of-breed solution to the Least Privilege problem" for enterprises running
Windows Vista. BeyondTrust`s award-winning Privilege Manager software is
implemented as a Group Policy extension. Organizations simply specify the
privileges necessary for an application. These privileges will be added to the
application process when it is launched enabling end-users without
administrative privileges to run all authorized applications. Privilege Manager
reduces support costs and provides great flexibility for maintaining
standardized desktop configurations, such as those specified in the Federal
Desktop Core Configuration mandate.

evaluating Windows 7`s User Account Control, contact Dave Bowker or Tiffany
Archambault at (781) 684-0770 or beyondtrust@schwartz-pr.com.

About BeyondTrust

BeyondTrust Corporation, a pioneer in Least Privilege Management, enables
enterprises to move beyond the need to trust users with excess privileges or
administrator rights. BeyondTrust Privilege Manager was the first product to
enable the security best practice of Least Privilege in Windows environments by
allowing administrators to assign end-users permissions for required or selected
applications. With Privilege Manager organizations can remove administrator
rights and still allow end-users to run all required Windows applications,
processes and ActiveX controls. By eliminating the need to grant administrator
rights to end-users, IT departments can create a more secure, compliant and
standard environment. More than 500 organizations worldwide in virtually every
vertical industry rely on BeyondTrust Privilege Manager to secure their
enterprises. For more information, please visit www.beyondtrust.com.

&lt;p&gt;New Scrutiny of Chevron`s Own Conduct In Possible "Dirty Tricks" Operation

Oil Giant Hiding Witnesses; DOJ Pressed to Investigate Role of Chevron Legal
Team; Company Refusing to Turn Over Evidence
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
Significant flaws are emerging in Chevron`s version of events surrounding a
purported Ecuador bribery scandal where company officials are trying to taint a
long-running trial involving a potential $27 billion liability, representatives
of the Amazon indigenous communities said today. 

On Tuesday, representatives of the Amazon communities said the so-called bribery
scandal - which Chevron claimed implicated the judge overseeing the trial - had
all the telltale signs of a Nixon-style "dirty tricks" operation orchestrated by
persons working on behalf of the oil giant. It now turns out much of what
Chevron claims is not supported by the evidence or has been mischaracterized by
the company, said Steven Donziger, an American legal advisor to the indigenous
communities of Ecuador. 

The timing of the videotapes is also suspicious, given that the tapes had been
in Chevron`s possession for several weeks but were released on the eve of a
final judgment at the trial and the theatrical opening in New York on September
9 of an acclaimed documentary film, Crude. The film casts Chevron`s behavior in
Ecuador in a highly unflattering light, said Donziger. 

"Major holes are beginning to appear in Chevron`s dazzling story of corruption
and they are evident from a careful look at Chevron`s own materials," said
Donziger, who called on the U.S. Department of Justice to open an investigation
into possible legal violations, including any committed by Chevron officials and
its representatives in Ecuador. 

"It is clear from Chevron`s materials that the company has a significant level
of involvement with individuals trying to corrupt a foreign country`s judicial
system and implicate the elected President of Ecuador in a scandal -- all to
avoid paying a legal liability stemming from private litigation," said Pablo
Fajardo, the lead Ecuadorian lawyer on the matter. 

"What Chevron has done is a direct attack on the independence of Ecuador`s
judiciary, a direct attack on Ecuador`s elected President by claiming he was
involved in a bribery scheme, and an obvious interference in the sovereign
affairs of a foreign nation with whom the U.S. has diplomatic relations," said
Fajardo. 

A further analysis of the videotapes - which were first posted by the company on
YouTube on Monday of this week - reveals the following:

* There appears to be no firm evidence that Judge Nunez said he would rule
against Chevron, contrary to statements by the company in its press materials.
In fact, on 13 separate occasions Nunez rebuffed leading questions posed by
Borja and an American businessman, Wayne Hansen, asking how he would rule on the
case. Chevron chose not to include any of these statements by the judge in the
20-minute summary video it released to the media. 
* Judge Nunez himself says the tapes were spliced and manipulated. In fact, the
judge cannot be seen in the video at the moment one can hear "yes sir" in
response to a question about whether Chevron is guilty, suggesting that part of
the tape might have been spliced together. Yet that one comment, at best
ambiguous, is the centerpiece of Chevron`s media campaign on the issue that the
judge already has decided how he would rule. 
* The only evidence of bribery in the videos involved a Chevron contractor,
Diego Borja, and an alleged political party official in Ecuador -- not trial
judge Juan Nunez. This fact appears on its face to violate the Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act (FCPA), a U.S. statute which prohibits the bribery of foreign
officials by American businesses and their agents, said Donziger. Chevron
recently paid a $30 million fine for violating the FCPA in a scandal linked to
Iraq. 
* Chevron has stonewalled attempts to test the veracity of its claims. The
company has refused to turn over the tapes for independent forensic examination;
it has refused to make Chevron contractor Borja available for questioning by the
media; and it has refused to provide information about the whereabouts of
Hansen, the mysterious American businessman who Chevron says gave the company
some of the secret recordings. 
* Chevron also has refused to say how much it paid Borja, who was spirited out
of Ecuador and relocated in the U.S. under Chevron`s direction and provided what
Chevron described as "interim support". The company has refused to turn over the
contract it had with Borja, who worked for the company during the environmental
trial in Ecuador as recently as March of this year. 
* Chevron has failed to disclose the role in the scheme of its local counsel in
Ecuador, Adolfo Callejas; its former General Counsel in the U.S. and current
Executive Vice President, Charles James; or that of its chief outside counsel,
Tim Cullen, of Jones Day in Washington, D.C. All of these individuals need to be
questioned under oath, said Fajardo, because there is clear evidence from
Chevron`s own materials and public statements that they were connected to Borja
and Hansen or otherwise involved. 
* Cullen sent a letter on behalf of Chevron to Ecuador`s National Prosecutor
demanding a criminal investigation of the so-called bribe. But the letter
contained a significant number of exaggerations not supported by evidence - such
as the charge that government officials planned to craft the judge`s decision in
the case. "Cullen either needs to turn over evidence to support these wild
allegations, or he needs to withdraw them," said Fajardo. 
* Chevron has admitted in its materials that it was aware of the secret
recordings prior to the fourth and final meeting that was taped, which Chevron
says took place on June 15 of this year. Yet it was only at the fourth meeting -
where the Judge was not present - that bribes were directly discussed. Chevron
officials need to explain if they or anyone under their direction scripted,
planned, or influenced any aspect of the fourth meeting, said Fajardo.

Chevron should immediately make fully public its witnesses and evidence, not
wait for an official investigation, given that it already had released selected
portions of the evidence on YouTube. 

"Since Chevron wants a public trial of its evidence, it needs to make all the
evidence it has available to the public immediately," said Donziger. "You can`t
release selective portions and hide the embarrassing portions and expect to be
taken seriously." 

"The full facts regarding Chevron`s role and that of the judge must become
known," added Fajardo. "One thing the world cannot afford is to take Chevron`s
word at face value."

&lt;p&gt;  PARIS, Sep 03 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
SCOR Global Life SE, a subsidiary of SCOR SE, has added a new layer of
protection to its current four-year mortality swap transaction with the
financial services firm J.P. Morgan. Under the new, extended arrangement,
SCOR will be entitled to USD 75 million in the event of a rise in
mortality over the course of the period from 1 January 2009 to 31
December 2011 notably due e.g. to major pandemics, natural catastrophes
or terrorist attacks.

    The risk swap is indexed against a weighted combination of US and European
population mortality, measured over two consecutive calendar years.
According to the structure of the arrangement, a payment will be triggered
if, at any time during the period covered, the index exceeds 105%. At any
index level between the trigger point of 105% and the exhaustion point of
110%, J.P. Morgan will pay to SCOR a pro-rata amount of the notional swap
amount of USD 75 million, so that for example at an index level of 107.5%,
50% of the total amount becomes payable, and at an index level of 110% the
full amount will be paid out. The risk swap is fully collateralized and
thus SCOR bears no credit risk exposure.

    The previous four-year mortality swap with J.P. Morgan, which was signed
on 22 February 2008 provides for receipt of up to USD 100 million and EUR
36 million at any index level between the trigger point of 115% and the
exhaustion point of 125%. Both transactions are indexed against a weighted
combination of US and European population mortality, measured over two
consecutive calendar years.

    Jean-Luc Besson, Chief Risk Officer of SCOR Group, comments: "As a leading
global life reinsurer with strong stakes in mortality reinsurance
protection, we are taking the current threat of the Influenza A(H1N1)
virus seriously. Although we currently don't expect that the influenza
virus will significantly increase mortality levels, we are convinced that
pandemics could constitute material tail events for the insurance
industry and may have corresponding financial repercussions on both sides
of the balance sheet. With this second transaction with J.P. Morgan, SCOR
demonstrates its stringent risk management."

    Comparison of SCOR's mortality swaps with J.P. Morgan:


+------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
|                  |Existing Mortality  |New Mortality Swap  |

The table above illustrates the key differences compared to the
existing swap. Other key aspects of the Mortality Swap Extension
correspond to the existing arrangement, e.g. the underlying population
indices used to construct the mortality indices, the weights applied to
the indices and the averaging of the mortality indices over two years.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Taking on corporate giants can feel like tilting at windmills, but John Kopchinski's six-year legal battle against Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) just made him a rich man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Gulf War veteran and former Pfizer sales representative will earn more than $51.5 million as a result of his whistleblower lawsuit against the world's biggest drugmaker and the record penalty the company must pay the U.S. government for its massive marketing transgressions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The unassuming Texas resident celebrated his windfall by having a family portrait photograph taken Wednesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're going to be staying right here in San Antonio in the same house, and my wife tells me when we go to the movies we're still getting one tub of popcorn -- the large tub," Kopchinski said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kopchinski, appalled by Pfizer's tactics in selling the pain drug Bextra, filed a "qui tam" lawsuit in 2003, sparking federal and state probes that led to Wednesday's agreement by the company to pay $2.3 billion in civil and criminal penalties and plead guilty to a felony charge for promoting Bextra and 12 other drugs for unapproved uses and doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In the Army I was expected to protect people at all costs," Kopchinski said in a statement. "At Pfizer I was expected to increase profits at all costs, even when sales meant endangering lives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I couldn't do that," added Kopchinski, 45, who was fired by Pfizer in March of 2003, two years before the company pulled Bextra from the market over concerns it raised the risk of heart attacks and strokes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time of his dismissal after raising his concerns with the company, Kopchinski had a baby son and his wife was pregnant with twins. He went from earning about $125,000 a year to living off his retirement fund before landing a job with an insurance company for $40,000 a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was a lot of stress on the family. I pretty much depleted my entire 401(k)," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The last six years have been pretty hard, so going forward it's going to be pretty much easier," said Kopchinski, noting that college for his young children "is taken care of."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Erika Kelton, Kopchinski's lead attorney from the firm of Phillips  Cohen LLP, said large rewards are justified because of what whistleblowers must endure, often for many years, after complaints within the company go unheeded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Particularly in pharma, it's no secret that it's an industry that can blackball former employees," Kelton said, "so the reward is important both to encourage people to step forward and to recognize that their contributions are huge."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kopchinski and five other whistleblowers will earn more than $102 million in payments from the U.S. government under the False Claims Act through which individuals can reap rewards for exposing corporate wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The use of whistleblowers has really opened up the keys to the kingdom in terms of what's going on in these companies," said Dean Zerbe, senior counsel for the National Whistleblower Center and a partner at the law firm of Zerbe, Fingeret, Frank and Jadav in Washington.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"You'd never find out what's happening without this kind of reward structure," Zerbe said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kopchinski was hired by former Pfizer CEO Edward Pratt in 1992 after carrying out a correspondence with him while serving as a platoon leader in a military police company on the Saudi Arabia-Kuwait border during the Gulf War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under a later Pfizer regime, he was selling the epilepsy drug Neurontin when a previous whistleblower suit was filed against the company over similar illegal promotion tactics that led to stiff penalties and a form of corporate probation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time he was told by managers that the Neurontin suit would be in the news and any physicians who asked questions should be told it was just complaints from a disgruntled former employee, Kopchinski said. Ironically, after filing the Bextra suit, "I was the disgruntled former employee," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What you see here is a company which essentially had a culture of corruption," said Patrick Burns, a spokesman for Taxpayers Against Fraud, a U.S. nonprofit organization that helps connect whistleblowers with attorneys on False Claims Act cases. He called the $2.3 billion settlement "a jaw-dropping amount of money."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The size of the whistleblower rewards announced Wednesday are already having an impact.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm seeing it first-hand myself. I've gotten phone calls this morning," said Zerbe, who was approached by an employee of a hospital who claimed that it was overbilling the government, including charging for products it had received for free.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite the potential for huge rewards, however, life can be hellish for whistleblowers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If this was so easy everyone would be a millionaire," Burns said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Gary Hill.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) agreed on Wednesday to plead guilty to a U.S. criminal charge relating to promotion of its now-withdrawn Bextra pain medicine and will pay a record $2.3 billion to settle allegations it improperly marketed 13 medicines.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The world's biggest drugmaker was slapped with the huge fines after being deemed a repeat offender in pitching drugs to patients and doctors for unapproved conditions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, whose shares slid 0.5 percent, had pleaded guilty in 2004 to an earlier criminal charge of improper sales tactics and its marketing practices have been under federal supervision since then.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company in January said it took a $2.3 billion charge late last year to resolve allegations involving Bextra and other drugs, but did not provide details at the time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wednesday's agreement was unveiled by the U.S. Department of Justice and Health and Human Services Department. [ID:nN02539956]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The size and seriousness of this resolution, including the huge criminal fine of $1.3 billion, reflect the seriousness and scope of Pfizer's crimes," said Mike Loucks, acting U.S. attorney for the District of Massachusetts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement includes a $1.3 billion criminal fine related to methods of selling Bextra, which was withdrawn from the market in 2005 on safety concerns. Pfizer acquired Bextra in its 2003 purchase of Pharmacia Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer's marketing team promoted Bextra for acute pain, surgical pain and other unapproved uses, while its salesforce promoted the drug directly to doctors for those unapproved uses and dosages, according to the Justice Department.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company and Pharmacia also used advisory boards, consultant meetings and provided travel to lavish resorts to improperly promote Bextra to doctors and made false and misleading claims about the drug's safety and efficacy, the government said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement also includes $1 billion in civil payments related to so-called "off-label" sales of drugs -- meaning for uses not authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration -- and payments to healthcare professionals. Pfizer denied all of the civil allegations, except for acknowledging improper promotions of the antibiotic Zyvox.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We regret certain actions taken in the past, but are proud of the action we've taken to strengthen our internal controls," said Amy Schulman, Pfizer's general counsel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Justice Department officials said cracking down on fraud in the healthcare industry was a key priority and comes as President Barack Obama is trying to push through reforms of the $2.5 trillion healthcare system to clip soaring costs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement and guilty plea are not expected to significantly hurt Pfizer's ability to sell drugs, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said, "however, it could send the wrong message at a time when you're making some pretty critical negotiations with the U.S. government on healthcare reform."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sandra Jordan, a former federal prosecutor and professor at the Charlotte School of Law in North Carolina, said: "Pfizer can survive this and pay the money. If it had fought the government at trial and lost, and a judge imposed a criminal sentence, that could have resulted in a corporate death penalty. That would have put Pfizer out of business."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The settlement is the largest to date for improper marketing of prescription drugs, topping the $1.42 billion Eli Lilly and Co (LLY.N) agreed to pay earlier this year for off-label sales of its Zyprexa schizophrenia drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer said it will pay $503 million to resolve practices involving Bextra, $301 million related to its schizophrenia drug Geodon, $98 million for Zyvox and about $50 million for its blockbuster Lyrica used to treat nerve pain and seizures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of the $2.3 billion fine, Pfizer said it would take new charges of up to $33 million in the third quarter to resolve state civil consumer fraud allegations related to past promotions of Geodon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Pfizer ripped off taxpayers across the country to pad its bottom line," New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company said most of the alleged improprieties took place during or before 2005. But some are as recent as 2007, while Pfizer was essentially still on probation for improper Neurontin promotions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Six whistle-blowers, including John Kopchinski, a former sales representative who blew the whistle on Pfizer's Bextra marketing tactics, sparking the government probes, will be rewarded with more than $102 million under the False Claims Act.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kopchinski's share of the reward was expected to be more than $51.5 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer Chief Executive Jeffrey Kindler had been its general counsel from 2002 until taking the helm in 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer did not specify whether it had disciplined any executives in connection with the latest infractions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the 2004 case, Pfizer agreed to pay $430 million to federal and state governments and pleaded guilty to criminal charges of illegally marketing epilepsy drug Neurontin for migraine headaches, pain and bipolar disorder. Pfizer obtained Neurontin in its 2000 acquisition of Warner Lambert Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Due to the earlier settlement, Pfizer's marketing practices have been under federal supervision for the past five years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under the new settlement, Pfizer has entered into another Corporate Integrity Agreement with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, requiring it to adhere to a specified compliance program for five more years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The pact will require Pfizer to post on its Web site information about payments to doctors such as travel or honorarium, and set up a system for doctors to report questionable conduct by Pfizer's representatives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer shares were down 9 cents, or about 0.5 percent, at $16.29 in afternoon trading on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jeremy Pelofsky in Washington and Ransdell Pierson, Bill Berkrot, Lewis Krauskopf, Jonathan Stempel and Joan Gralla in New York; Editing by Maureen Bavdek)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Global services and manufacturing
activity expanded in August for the first time in fifteen
months, with factories leading the rebound, a survey showed on
Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Global Total Output index, produced by JP Morgan with
research and supply management organisations, rose to 52.1 in
August from 48.2 in July, above the 50 mark that divides growth
from contraction. That was also its highest level since December
2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Global Services index rose to 50.5 in August from 46.5
in July, with all national indexes increasing over the month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The PMI output index rose above the neutral level (50) for
the first time since May 2008, consistent with growth of global
GDP moving back into positive territory in the third quarter,"
said David Hensley, a director at JP Morgan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Earlier data showed the euro zone's dominant service sector
jumped back almost to recovery in August while in the UK the
service sector grew at its fastest pace in nearly two years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Figures released in the United States showed its services
sector shrunk again in August, but the non-manufacturing ISM
index still managed to climb to its highest level in nearly a
year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The global total employment index also increased to 46.1 in
August from 44.1 in July, still showing firms cutting jobs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The index combines survey data from countries including the
United States, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, China and Russia.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Nigel Davies; Editing by Ruth Pitchford)

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Sept 3 (Reuters) - U.S. energy company Chevron
(CVX.N) said its Nigerian onshore oil operations, which had

according to loading schedules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since then output looks to have recovered with preliminary
loading programmes showing around 127,000 bpd of Escravos
loading in September, rising to 153,000 bpd in October. This is
still far lower than peak Escravos production of more than
300,000 bpd.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria has more than 800,000 bpd of crude oil shut in
mainly due to sabotage attacks on oil facilities, according to
oil companies and industry sources.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a FACTBOX on Nigerian outages click [ID:nLB122853]

attendees an opportunity to pose their questions and IT pain points to
experts and proven thought leaders in the space," said Alex Bewley,

&lt;p&gt;PROVO, Utah--(Business Wire)--
Adaptive Computing, the company behind the Moab unified intelligent automation
technology, said today it plans to offer Moab Adaptive HPC Suite and Moab
Adaptive Computing Suite for IBM System x, BladeCenter and iDataPlex&#174; server
families to create dynamic, intelligent high-performance computing clusters in
data centers and cloud environments. 

As a fully qualified and supported option for IBM`s System Cluster 1350
solutions, Moab integrates IBM`s Extreme Cloud Administration Toolkit (xCAT)
monitoring and provisioning manager with its intelligent policy-based governance
capabilities. Together they deliver a unified intelligent operating environment
that optimizes infrastructure efficiency and responsiveness to dynamically
changing workload and organizational requirements. This reduces costs, improves
service levels and helps manage risk to ensure scalability and resource
availability. Customers also benefit as administration of large clusters is
simplified. 

"Reducing IT expenses is critical for companies striving to meet their financial
goals," said Herb Schultz, marketing manager, IBM Systems &amp; Technology Group.
"IBM and Adaptive Computing have been working together for years to provide our
clients with cluster solutions that dynamically manage resources to reduce costs
and simplify high-performance computing." 

xCAT has been used to deploy IBM Linux clusters since 1999 and today supports
the largest computing installation in the world, the IBM "Roadrunner" system at
Los Alamos National Laboratory. xCAT was open sourced by IBM in 2007 and has
since grown from its HPC heritage to support all kinds of scale-out solutions.
With the advent of cloud computing and the growing size of data centers, xCAT
has seen greater adoption over other solutions. xCAT can be a very effective
tool to control nearly every aspect of the infrastructure, and when combined
with Moab from Adaptive Computing to control job flow a true cloud-computing
environment is possible. With xCAT`s ability to collect power and temperature
information Moab can intelligently schedule workloads to save power. Because
xCAT can query the health of the hardware, Moab can query xCAT and place
workloads accordingly to improve service availability and performance. 

"Moab takes xCAT to the next level by leveraging xCAT`s client-server model to
take administration from manual and static to automated, assisted, and dynamic,"
said Egan Ford, executive IT specialist at IBM. "With Moab and xCAT together,
ultra-scale hybrid clouds of bare metal and virtual machines can be created to
maximize effective utilization while minimizing power consumed. And this is just
the beginning." 

Moab Adaptive Computing Suite for data centers and cloud and Moab Adaptive HPC
Suite for compute- and data-intensive applications enable a large pool of
diverse resources to be automatically and intelligently orchestrated to create
an environment that can immediately respond to changing workload requirements,
enforce service-level agreements (SLAs) and enable on-demand provisioning for
both in-house and cloud-based environments. 

"Building on the advanced capabilities of IBM technologies, the Adaptive
Operating Environment, powered by Moab, delivers a truly dynamic
infrastructure," said Michael Jackson, president of Adaptive Computing. "Moab`s
ability to determine and unify context across the entire data center, apply
policy and implement decisions automatically enables organizations and their
supporting infrastructure to work as one and act intelligently." 

About Adaptive Computing

Adaptive Computing provides intelligent automation software for data center,
cloud and HPC environments. The company`s infrastructure intelligence solutions,
powered by Moab, deliver policy-based governance, allowing customers to
consolidate and virtualize resources, allocate and manage applications, optimize
service levels and reduce operational costs. Adaptive Computing products manage
the world`s largest computing installations and are the preferred intelligent
automation solutions for the leading global data center vendors. For more

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, Sept 3 (Reuters) - Nomura Holdings (8604.T) cemented
its position at the top of the MA league tables in Japan by
bagging a mandate to advise Dainippon Sumitomo Pharma on its
$2.6 billion acquisition of U.S. drugmaker Sepracor Inc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; U.S. investment bank JP Morgan (JPM.N) also came out as one
of the winners as it landed an advisory role to Sepracor
SEPR.O, making it an adviser for Japan's two biggest deals so
far this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thomas Weisel Partners LLC, a Nomura partner in MA deals,
is also advising Dainippon Sumitomo, while Jeffries  Co is
working with JP Morgan in advising Sepracor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Dainippon, Japan's No.7 drugmaker by sales, said on
Thursday it would buy Sepracor in Japan's second largest
overseas acquisition this year, after Kirin Holdings' (2503.T)
buyout of Australian brewer Lion Nathan Ltd LNN.AX.
[ID:nT42454]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal should provide a boost for Nomura and JP Morgan
which have faced falling MA volumes in the uncertain economic
climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Japanese firms have spent $41 billion on acquisitions so
far this year slowing from $64.5 billion a year ago, according
to Thomson Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is positive news for Nomura that it has retained this

Ohno, a brokerage analyst at Credit Suisse Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nomura probably used its relationship with Sumitomo
Chemical Co (4005.T), which owns 50.1 percent in Dainippon
Sumitomo, to secure the latest mandate, some analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nomura is listed as the top relationship broker for
Sumitomo Chemical in a corporate guide book called Shikiho
published by Toyo Keizai.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nomura was the top adviser for Japanese companies' mergers

according to Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last year, Nomura advised Japanese drugmaker Daiichi Sankyo
in its purchase of a majority stake in Indian generic drugmaker
Ranbaxy Laboratories (RANB.BO) for around $5 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That deal proved to be a headache for Daiichi, which was
forced to write down its stake following a sharp slide in
Ranbaxy's stock, pushing it to a loss of more than $3 billion
in the past business year.

line, Disney Consumer Products (DCP) announced renowned jewelry designer and
Council of Fashion Designers of America winner, Tom Binns, as the first in a

In celebration of the forthcoming collection, DCP tipped its hat to fashion
staging an unexpected and most elaborate tea party at the MAGIC Marketplace, the
world`s most comprehensive fashion trade event, in Las Vegas this week.
Wonderland-influenced performers took the unsuspecting MAGIC crowd by surprise
as the maddest of tea parties came alive before their eyes showcasing fashion
inspirations similar to those releasing in Spring 2010 in conjunction with the
film. Proving that it was not just a figment of their imagination, a viral video
of this mad spectacle premiered today for all to view at
www.YouTube.com/DisneyLiving, DCP`s official YouTube Channel. 

"Disney fashion continues to be at the forefront of trends," said Pam Lifford,
executive vice president, global fashion and home, DCP. "Drawing inspiration
from such creative works of art as Alice In Wonderland and collaborating with
top designers like Tom Binns keeps Disney and our characters relevant with
tastemakers and serves up an aspirational halo effect with consumers and Disney
fans of all ages." 

The new Tom Binns Alice In Wonderland-inspired jewelry lines will feature two
collections influenced by key story characters including Alice, the Mad Hatter,
the Red Queen, the White queen and the White Rabbit. The Tom Binns for Walt
Disney Signature line will offer a limited edition collection of six jewelry
pieces designed in Binns' coveted over-the-top runway style. This high-end
collection will be available at luxury retailers and fine boutiques with a price
range from $1,000 to $3,000. Next up for the avid designer will be Tom Binns for
Disney Couture offering 35 pieces featuring Binns` unique flair in collaboration
with Lucas Design International, this collection will incorporate photo inlay
with lace accents and Swarovski crystal details. The retail price range starts
at $50 going up to $250; it will be available at department stores and specialty
boutiques. Both collections will make their retail debut Spring 2010 in the U.S.
and international markets. 

"This timeless story of Lewis Caroll married with the wonderful world of Disney
and Tim Burton`s interpretation offers so much philosophical fantasy and
peculiar surreal imagination," explained award winning designer Tom Binns. "It
opens up a labyrinth of doors for my particular way of seeing the world,
allowing me to express my fashion experience with my interest in art and cinema.
Alice is the perfect story to release that creativity and I cannot imagine a
better story to cultivate my relationship with Disney." 

As 2010 gets closer, DCP will announce the full line-up of designers and top
brands behind the Alice In Wonderland lifestyle program. In addition to
interpretive collections, the merchandise assortment will also include
character-driven lines from collectible toys to home d&#233;cor, stationery and

&lt;p&gt; * Judge Nunez denies misconduct, bribery accusations * Judge says recuses himself so investigation can proceed * Chevron says still wants investigation  (Adds Chevron comments, statement from Amazon Defense Coalition) By Alexandra Valencia QUITO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - An Ecuadorean judge presiding over a $27 billion lawsuit against Chevron Corp (CVX.N) recused himself from the case on Friday, days after the oil company accused him of misconduct and involvement in a bribery scheme. I decided to remove myself from this case so authorities can continue with their work, Judge Juan Nunez told Reuters by telephone. My conscience is clean. I have committed no wrong-doing. It is important that this is investigated. Ecuador's Attorney General Washington Pesantez began investigating the accusations against Nunez this week after Chevron gave Ecuadorean and U.S. authorities a secretly recorded video of Nunez talking of ruling against Chevron later this year. The U.S. company said at the time that it would ask for Nunez to be disqualified from the case. Pesantez warned Chevron on Friday against any attempts to undermine the legal process. He said a probe would determine the veracity of the video, and that he planned to call those involved to testify. Chevron is using the video to delegitimize the process being brought against it and create the pretext for not paying large damages in case they are found guilty, Pesantez said at a press conference. After Nunez recused himself, Chevron called for all of his rulings in the case to be annulled. We also hope that the removal of Judge Nunez is not an attempt to deflect attention from the serious indications of political interference with the case that appear in the video recordings, Chevron said in its statement. An independent and honest investigation of the evidence that Chevron brought forward remains just as important following Judge Nunez's removal. The 16-year-old case against Chevron is registered in the Ecuadorean oil town of Lago Agrio, where indigenous communities have accused Texaco, which was bought by Chevron in 2001, of damaging the environment and their health while operating petroleum facilities in the region. An expert appointed by the Ecuadorean court said last year that Chevron should pay around $27 billion, including more than $8 billion in unjust enrichment. MYSTERIOUS VIDEO TRIGGERS PROBES Chevron said on Monday the video, posted at TexacoEcuador YouTube channel, www.youtube.com/texacoecuador, shows a man at another meeting identifying himself as a representative of Ecuador's ruling party and discussing a $3 million bribe for contracts, of which Nunez would get a third. The plaintiffs, represented by U.S.-based lawyer Steven Donziger, have accused Texaco of dumping billions of gallons of polluted water in the jungle around where they live for more than two decades before the company left Ecuador in the early 1990s. The Amazon Defense Coalition, a plaintiffs' group, said on Friday that Nunez's decision to recuse himself clears the path for the legal proceedings to continue uninterrupted. But, the group said, The recusal does not change the overwhelming evidence against Chevron in the underlying case. Last Monday, Chevron said two meetings with Nunez and two meetings with purported party representative Patricio Garcia had been recorded by both Diego Borja, a local logistics contractor who has worked for Chevron, and American Wayne Hansen, who has no relationship with the company. Chevron said the meetings were recorded without its knowledge, through small cameras in a watch owned by Borja and a pen held by Hansen. The company said Borja brought the bribery scheme to its attention in June. Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson said on Monday that the two men had not explained why they recorded the meetings. Pablo Fajardo, a lawyer for the plaintiffs, said this week in a statement from the Amazon Defense Coalition that the timing of the release of the videos, months after Chevron said it had learned of them, appeared related to the impending judgment by Nunez. That's just one reason why this appears suspicious, Fajardo said. Chevron said neither man was paid, though the San Ramon, California-based company said it had assisted Borja with the costs of relocating out of Ecuador and other support because he and Chevron feared for his safety and that of his family. The company said that for security reasons it would not divulge Borja's whereabouts. The Amazon Defense Coalition said in a statement on Tuesday that Borja had worked for Chevron on the environmental trial during the final eight field inspections conducted in March, and that one of is cousins works for Chevron.

 (Adds attorney general's quotes, background, context)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alexandra Valencia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUITO, Sept 4 (Reuters) - An Ecuadorean judge presiding
over a $27 billion lawsuit against Chevron Corp (CVX.N) recused

an investigation into accusations of bribery and misconduct.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I decided to remove myself from this case so authorities

out an investigation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The attorney general and inspector general are responsible
for investigating cases involving corruption of public
employees and justice officials and demands made by foreign
companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; POLLUTION, HIDDEN CAMERAS, SECRETED PEOPLE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs, represented by U.S.-based lawyer Steven

two men had not explained why they recorded the meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Karen Hinton, a Washington D.C.-based spokeswoman for the

after an initial meeting at Alianza Pais's Quito offices with
Garcia, who said he was a representative of the party.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Garcia then arranged for Borja and Hansen to fly to Lago
Agrio to see Nunez, and the two men met Nunez again at a Quito
hotel in June, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said neither man was paid, though the San Ramon,

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX)issued the following media statement by Hewitt
Pate, vice president and general counsel, in response to news Judge Juan N&#250;&#241;ez
has recused himself from the Lago Agrio proceedings in Ecuador: 

"Judge N&#250;&#241;ez has correctly realized that his position has become untenable. No
judge who has participated in the type of meetings shown in the video recordings
could possibly have rendered a legitimate decision. But two major issues remain:


"It is important that prior rulings of the judge be annulled, including numerous
improper rulings to facilitate and shield from scrutiny the biased Cabrera
process. 

"We also hope that the removal of Judge N&#250;&#241;ez is not an attempt to deflect
attention from the serious indications of political interference with the case
that appear in the video recordings. Recent statements by government of Ecuador
officials indicate an intent to attack Chevron rather than investigate
potentially inappropriate actions by party officials such as Patricio Garcia and
Alexis Mera. 

"An independent and honest investigation of the evidence that Chevron brought
forward remains just as important following Judge N&#250;&#241;ez`s removal."

&lt;p&gt;  REDWOOD CITY, CA, Sep 04 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Check Point(R) Software Technologies Ltd. (NASDAQ: CHKP), the worldwide
leader in securing the Internet, today announced that Check Point IPS
solutions shield customers against exploits associated with the FTP
Service in Microsoft Internet Information Services vulnerability.
Successful exploitation of this unpatched vulnerability could allow
hackers to take over an affected company's systems.

    Although no Microsoft patch is currently available for this vulnerability,
Check Point Security Gateway R70 customers using the IPS Software Blade
are automatically protected. No action is required if they are using the
"Recommended Profile" setting. Check Point VPN-1(R) NGX R65, VSX(R) NGX
R65 and IPS-1(R) NGX R65 customers also have existing protections and
should check they are activated. See threat reference CPAI-2009-153 for
more information at:
http://www.checkpoint.com/defense/advisories/public/2009/cpai-03-Augb.html.

    Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) is a collection of Internet
services packaged with several versions of the Windows operating system.
IIS includes a FTP server service for exchanging and manipulating files
over a TCP computer network. The vulnerability is due to an error in IIS
that fails to do sufficient bounds checking when processing an FTP NLST
command. The vulnerability could allow remote code execution on affected
systems that are running the FTP service and are connected to the
Internet. Enterprise users at risk for this vulnerability have either IIS
5.0, IIS 5.1, or IIS 6.0.

    "Exploit code of this vulnerability is available in the wild, meaning
hackers could take the code and use it to exploit IIS and remotely control
a company's network," said Oded Gonda, vice president of network security
products at Check Point. "Check Point's IPS products continue to provide
protection against such vulnerabilities before they are even discovered,
giving our customers the peace-of-mind that their systems are always
secure."

    Check Point's IPS Software Blade, IPS-1 appliances, and SmartDefense are
supported by Check Point update services, which provide ongoing and
real-time updates and configuration advisories for defenses and security
policies. Check Point protections are developed and distributed by Check
Point's Security Research and Response Centers located around the globe.

    Based on the Software Blade architecture, Check Point IPS Software Blade
provides complete, integrated, next generation firewall intrusion
prevention capabilities at multi-gigabit speeds, with preemptive threat
coverage for clients, servers, OS and other vulnerabilities, malware/worm
infections, and more. Software Blades are independent and flexible
security modules that enable companies to select the functions they need
to build a custom Check Point Security Gateway.

Software Blade can visit:

&lt;p&gt; * E-mails, video evidence handed over&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron calls for probe of government officials&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Alexandra Valencia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; QUITO, Sept 7 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp on Monday presented
Ecuador's government with video tapes and e-mails it said
provided evidence of a bribery scheme linked to a $27 billion
environmental damages lawsuit against the U.S. oil company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judge hearing the case, Juan Nunez, last week recused
himself from the case just days after Chevron handed Ecuadorean
and U.S. authorities a secretly recorded video of the
magistrate talking of ruling against Chevron later this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ecuador's attorney general began investigating the bribery
and misconduct accusations against Nunez after the U.S. company
said it would ask for him to be disqualified from the case. The
judge says he committed no wrongdoing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said on Monday it provided Ecuadorean authorities
with videos and e-mails to support its accusations and a letter
requesting a probe into whether a presidential advisor and
officials attempted to influence the case's outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In a letter to Ecuador authorities, the company asked that
several important points be examined by the investigation into
the scheme, which implicated the judge hearing the case, as
well as ruling party and government officials," the company
said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has complained before about government interference
in the 16-year-old case, in which indigenous communities have
accused Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, of damaging the
environment and their health while operating petroleum
facilities in the region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; An expert appointed by the Ecuadorean court said last year
that Chevron should pay around $27 billion, including more than
$8 billion in unjust enrichment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said last week the video, posted at TexacoEcuador
YouTube channel, www.youtube.com/texacoecuador, shows a
man at another meeting identifying himself as a representative
of Ecuador's ruling party and discussing a $3 million bribe for
contracts, of which Nunez would get a third.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The plaintiffs have accused Texaco of dumping billions of
gallons of polluted water in the jungle around where they had
lived for more than two decades before the company left Ecuador
in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SECRET RECORDINGS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Amazon Defense Coalition, a plaintiffs' group, said on
Friday that Nunez's decision to recuse himself clears the path
for the legal proceedings to continue uninterrupted. But the
group said the recusal does not "change the overwhelming
evidence against Chevron."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said two meetings with Nunez and two meetings with
purported party representative Patricio Garcia had been
recorded by both Diego Borja, a local logistics contractor who
has worked for Chevron, and American Wayne Hansen, who has no
relationship with the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said the meetings were recorded without its
knowledge, through small cameras in a watch owned by Borja and
a pen held by Hansen. The company said Borja brought the
bribery scheme to its attention in June.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. company says that the two men had not explained
why they recorded the meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said neither man was paid, though the San Ramon,
California-based company said it had assisted Borja with the
costs of relocating out of Ecuador and other support because he
and Chevron feared for his safety and that of his family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the Amazon Defense Coalition said last week that Borja
had worked for Chevron on the environmental trial during the
final eight field inspections, and that one of his cousins
works for Chevron.

&lt;p&gt;Company Says Investigation Should Include Judge, President`s Adviser and Texas
Bank Account
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Lawyers for Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) provided evidence to Ecuador
authorities today, including video recordings and emails, to assist with the
investigation of a $3 million bribe scheme associated with an environmental
lawsuit against the company. 

In a letter to Ecuador authorities, the company asked that several important
points be examined by the investigation into the scheme, which implicated the
judge hearing the case, as well as ruling party and government officials. The
information provided today supports last week`s written notification to the
government about the existence of video recordings showing discussions of a
prejudged verdict against the company by the judge and details of how the bribe
would work. (Videos, emails and the letter sent to Ecuador authorities are
available on www.chevron.com/ecuador and on www.youtube.com/texacoecuador.) 

The letter requested:

* An investigation into the bribery scheme discussed in the videos and emails; 
* An investigation into the possible government involvement of Alexis Mera,
legal adviser to the president of Ecuador, and other government officials said
to be working to influence the outcome of the trial, including assisting the
judge to write an opinion against Chevron; 
* An investigation of transactions involving a bank account and the account
holder at a bank in Galveston, Tex., which was to hold the bribe payments; 
* An investigation into the relationship between Judge Juan Nunez and Richard
Cabrera, who submitted a report to the court on the case that Chevron disputes.
(The judge refused to allow Chevron to depose Mr. Cabrera and denied Chevron`s
attempt to obtain source materials and other alleged support for his
recommendations); 
* An investigation into any communication between any parties involved in the
Lago Agrio suit (including the plaintiffs, the court, the presidency or any
government entity) relating to the distribution, use or administration of any
damages relating to the damages awarded by the Lago Agrio court.

&lt;p&gt; (Refiles to fix date)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Long-term profitability at U.S.
and European investment banks is likely to fall by nearly a
third due to new regulatory measures, according to a JP Morgan
report cited in the Financial Times on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report obtained by the FT calculates that returns on
equity at investment banks will fall from 15 percent to 11
percent in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Traditional lending is predicted to suffer less as
regulators focus on high-risk activities, causing JP Morgan
(JPM.N) to conclude that investment banks are no longer an
attractive bet for shareholders, said the FT.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We switch our preference to quality traditional
credit-exposed banks from global investment banks," the FT
quoted the report as saying.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The investment bank industry faces a clampdown as world
leaders attempt to address the causes of the financial crisis
by imposing tougher capital requirements and other measures
designed to ensure greater stability and risk managment.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - A U.S. judge ruled on Tuesday that drugmaker Pfizer's trademark had been infringed when a man towed a decommissioned missile around Manhattan emblazoned with the words "Viva Viagra," the slogan for Pfizer's blockbuster impotence drug.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pfizer sued Arye Sachs after he parked the 20-foot-long (7-meter-long) decommissioned missile outside its headquarters in September 2008 in a stunt to promote his business selling outdoor advertising spots on retired military equipment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;U.S. District Judge William Pauley ruled in favor of Pfizer for trademark infringement claims. "If defendants intended this to be funny, Pfizer did not get the joke," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Pfizer, which has spent millions advertising and promoting Viagra, argued consumers could think Sachs' missile was an ad for the drug.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sachs had argued his use of the Viagra name was protected under free speech rights.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Christine Kearney, editing by Michelle Nichols and Cynthia Osterman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Die-hard fans of Walt Disney Co gather this week in California for the company's first-ever fan exposition and what Disney hopes will be a show of the durability of its brands in a tough time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Disney executives are likely to face fan queries about what the planned acquisition of Marvel Entertainment Inc, announced last week, would mean for its movie, theme park, toy and TV offerings in coming years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The event at the Anaheim Convention Center, adjacent to Disneyland, is one of the few put on by a corporation, rather than its fans, to celebrate its history and products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The September 10-13 event, called D23 Expo in a nod to the year Walt Disney founded his animation company, is expected to draw about 10,000 fans from all over the world for what Disney billed as unprecedented access to its archives as well as glimpses of upcoming films, TV shows, park rides and toys.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Expo has been more than a year in the making, spurred by repeated pleas by Disney fans to Chief Executive Bob Iger -- often at the company's annual meetings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"When Bob became CEO (in 2005) we almost immediately started getting feedback ... that they wanted to know why there wasn't an official fan club in our 85-year history," Steven Clark, head of D23 Expo, said in an interview. "It made sense to him and he said: 'What can we do?'"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Iger unveiled the Expo and a new website featuring news and a blog about the company, retrospectives and a collectibles store at this year's annual meeting in Oakland, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Top Disney executives, including Iger and the heads of the company's four main divisions, are taking the event seriously and plan glitzy presentations with celebrity guest stars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Every business unit at this company jumped on the bandwagon immediately. They saw the value in it," Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney wants the Expo to be "the ultimate fan experience" -- at $37 per day. "Our fans are our biggest evangelists," Clark said. "They have made Disney a part of their lives. They live it, they breathe it and they tell people about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to meet-and-greets with casts of Disney Channel and ABC television shows and Disney film stars, the company is making its Imagineers and other behind-the-scenes creative talent, and even a Disney family member, available at panel discussions and signings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the celebs slated to attend are "Cougar Town" star Courtney Cox, "Aladdin" actor Robin Williams, "Hank" star Kelsey Grammer and "FlashForward" star Joseph Fiennes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With its trademark showmanship, Disney is keeping the lid on some big surprises that will "boggle the mind," Clark said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney will screen chunks of upcoming films, including "The Princess and the Frog," "Prince of Persia," Tim Burton's "Alice in Wonderland" and 3D versions of the "Toy Story" films.

&lt;p&gt; * Chinese equipment helps catch more flights * Anti-drug chief says fighting drugs like never before * Says renewed cooperation with U.S. a decision for Chavez By Frank Jack Daniel CARACAS, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Less cocaine-laden airplanes are reaching Africa since Venezuela installed radars covering the Atlantic coast and its southern border, the South American nation's drugs czar said on Tuesday. Drug flights to West African countries such as Guinea Bissau became more common in 2007 and 2008, as traffickers took advantage of weak air control systems in Venezuela. We have taken actions and the effectiveness of those actions can be seen because cocaine trafficking from Venezuela to Africa has dropped, Col. Nestor Reverol, who heads Venezuela's national anti-drugs office, told Reuters. Reverol blamed flights of Colombian-made drugs through OPEC nation Venezuela on capacity lost when tension between Washington and President Hugo Chavez led to the removal of three U.S-owned radars a few years ago. Venezuela, which has thousands of miles of coastline and a rugged and porous border with Colombia, the world's top cocaine producer, ended cooperation with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration in 2005 after accusing it of spying. Reverol rejected U.S. accusations that high level former officials in the Chavez government were involved in drug trafficking with Colombia's FARC guerrillas. We have fought against drugs like never before since the DEA went, and we have shown that with actions, Reverol said. Venezuela bought 10 radars from China and installed six of them last year. It is also buying Chinese K-8 light attack planes to be used to pursue flights. They replace a purchase of Brazilian Super Tucanos blocked by a U.S. arms embargo. The United States says Venezuela let 300 tonnes of cocaine through the country in 2008. Chavez blames the multi-billion dollar industry on U.S. consumption. If you do the math, you can't say 200 tonnes, or 100 or 500 are coming through here, Reverol said, pointing to a U.S. inter-agency report that says less than 10 percent of Colombian cocaine headed north leaves via Venezuela. The national guard colonel is a loyal ally of the president and is credited in Venezuela with having made some progress in combating drugs. He has launched a 4-year plan to fight consumption, increase penalties for traffickers to a maximum 30 years in jail and allow the shooting down of suspected drugs flights. Tensions have flared between Venezuela and Colombia since July over a deal which gives U.S. soldiers access to more Colombian military bases to fight traffickers and rebels. AFRICA DROP The United Nations World Drug Report 2009 estimates that 40 percent of all the Colombian cocaine that travels to Europe passed through Venezuela in 2007, but said overall traffic has fallen since then because of a sharp output drop in Colombia. Reverol said a shift in Colombian coca leaf production from close to the border to the Pacific coast had also reduced the amount of traffic through Venezuela. The U.N. reported a substantive decrease in the number of shipments passing through Africa headed for Europe last year. The new radars are tracking parts of eastern Venezuela, where planes including private jets cross to the Atlantic or Caribbean to West Africa, as well as a southern region close to Colombia and favored by cartels to land light aircraft. The Chinese equipment cost $260 million and also replaces two U.S.-made Venezuelan radars that fell into disrepair because of Washington's arms embargo against the Chavez government. The embargo includes spare parts. Reverol said Washington took its radars away after a short-lived 2002 coup against Chavez that worsened ties. He said Venezuela cooperated with all countries except the United States on combating drug trafficking and did not rule out signing a new deal with Washington. You can't work with a colleague who criticizes you every day, Reverol said. With an army salute, he added: the Comandante, the president governs foreign relations, he decides. Despite the rhetoric, the two countries often collaborate on interdicting drugs in international waters and Venezuela extradites captured traffickers wanted in the United States.

Televisa expects advertising revenue to be unchanged in the
third quarter compared with a year ago despite a tough economy,
a top executive said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Televisa's (TLVACPO.MX) (TV.N) broadcast television
revenues, made up largely of advertising sales, in the
July-to-September period last year were 5.577 billion pesos

Televisa also expected to post unchanged total revenues for
full-year 2009, in line with previous forecasts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In such a difficult year, not decreasing is a great
result," Quintero told reporters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. recession has sent Mexico's economy into a slump

the next few months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Broadcast sales make up about 45 percent of Televisa's
total revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quintero said Televisa is exploring a new project in Russia

&lt;p&gt;  DURHAM, NC, Sep 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Open Invention Network (OIN), a collaborative enterprise that enables
innovation in open source, today announced the acquisition of 22
Linux-focused patents that were marketed and sold by Microsoft. The
patents were recently purchased by Allied Security Trust (AST) from
Microsoft to ensure the patents did not fall into the hands of
non-practicing entities (more information on non-practicing entities is
available at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patent_troll, among other sites)
that could seek to assert the patents against Linux products. OIN
subsequently acquired the Microsoft patents from AST.

    "Today's announcement evidences OIN's continued commitment to acquire
patents that may be relevant to Linux," said Keith Bergelt, Chief
Executive Officer of Open Invention Network. "We are pleased to have
purchased these patents and view this as a model of successful
collaboration among defensive patent organizations that share a common
goal of creating freedom of action for practicing entities across Linux
and the broader technology sector. The prospect of these patents being
placed in the hands of non-practicing entities was a threat that has been
averted with these purchases, irrespective of patent quality and whether
or not the patents truly read on Linux."

    "Allied Security Trust is pleased that Open Invention Network had interest
in acquiring the Open Source patent portfolio. OIN's purchase ensures that
these important patents will not be used by patent trolls or others
seeking to disrupt Linux and the many companies and individuals advancing
this important technology," said Dan McCurdy, Chief Executive Officer of
Allied Security Trust.

    About Allied Security Trust

    AST is a Delaware statutory trust currently with 15 member companies
headquartered in North America, Europe and Asia. The Trust provides
opportunities to enhance companies' freedom to sell products by sharing
the cost of patent licenses. To date, the Trust has invested $40 million
in patent purchases over its 30 months of operations. Through such
purchases, the Trust provides an excellent opportunity for patent holders
of all sizes to generate a return on their rights by selling patents to
the Trust.

    AST is not an investment vehicle. Its purpose is freedom of operation and
cost reduction. It generates no profits and does not engage in patent
assertions against other companies. AST maintains a "catch-and-release"
commitment that returns to the market in a timely manner patents acquired
on behalf of Trust members after licenses are secured. The Trust also
addresses the increasing need for innovative companies to defend against
costly patent law suits. For more information, visit
www.alliedsecuritytrust.com.

    About Open Invention Network

    Open Invention Network is a collaborative enterprise that enables
innovation in open source and an increasingly vibrant ecosystem around
Linux by acquiring and licensing patents, influencing behaviors and
policy, and protecting the integrity of the ecosystem through strategic
programs such as Linux Defenders. It enables the growth and continuation
of open source software by fostering a healthy Linux ecosystem of
investors, vendors, developers and users.

    Open Invention Network has considerable industry backing. It was launched
in 2005, and has received investments from IBM, NEC, Novell, Philips, Red
Hat and Sony. For more information, visit www.openinventionnetwork.com.

&lt;p&gt; * Sri Lanka revoked local UNICEF spokesman's work visa * Ban to raise issue with Sri Lankan President Rajapaksa By Louis Charbonneau UNITED NATIONS, Sept 8 (Reuters) - U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon criticized Sri Lanka on Tuesday for revoking the work visa of a spokesman for the U.N. children's foundation UNICEF, whom Colombo accuses of spreading rebel propaganda. The secretary-general strongly regrets the decision of the Sri Lankan government to expel Mr. James Elder, spokesman for UNICEF in Sri Lanka, U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq told reporters. He said Ban would raise the issue with Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa at the earliest opportunity. Sri Lanka's Foreign Secretary Palitha Kohona said on Monday that Elder's visa had been revoked because he had spread Tamil Tiger propaganda. UNICEF denied the allegation.[ID:nCOL462279] Last week U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice voiced grave concern about video footage aired by Britain's Channel 4 television showing what appeared to be the summary execution of unarmed, naked and blindfolded men in Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka also said on Monday that it had analyzed the Channel 4 footage and determined it was faked in a way that was typical of the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE), the rebels the government defeated in May after a 25-year war. It was not immediately clear if there was any connection between the issue of the video footage, which has angered the Sri Lankan government, and the decision to force out Elder.  Philip Alston, U.N. special rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or arbitrary executions, said last week that he hoped the United Nations would open an investigation to determine whether Sri Lankan soldiers did in fact summarily execute Tamils, which would be a violation of international law.[ID:nN01488204] Ban has not called for a separate U.N. investigation of the Channel 4 video footage, though he did raise the issue with Sri Lanka's Human Rights Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe. The Channel 4 footage can be seen here: (here+video+is+this+evidence+of+war+crimes+in+sri+lanka/3321087). Sri Lanka has repeatedly denied that it committed multiple human rights violations during the final months of its war against the LTTE, who had retreated to a narrow strip of coast in northeastern Sri Lanka along with hundreds of thousands of civilians. Western and U.N. officials said the Sri Lankan army was using heavy artillery to shell the LTTE, even though it knew the rebels were using the innocent civilians trapped in the area as human shields. The army rejected the charge. U.N. officials say that thousands of civilians were killed during the last months of the war.  (Editing by Alison Williams)

&lt;p&gt;Internet Simplifies the Application Process
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Requesting a charitable grant or community sponsorship from The Coca-Cola
Company just got a little easier. Global Community Connections (GCC), the
community engagement arm of The Coca-Cola Company, launched a paperless online
application system today that will make it simpler for nonprofit organizations
to request cash contributions, in-kind product donations, and community
sponsorships. 

The paperless system, developed by Massachusetts-based Cybergrants, the pioneer
of online grants management, will eliminate the manual processing of more than
10,000 paper applications received each year by the Company and its foundation. 

"The Coca-Cola Company is committed to giving back a portion of what we earn
each year to make a unique and sustainable difference in communities worldwide,"
said Ingrid Saunders Jones, senior vice president of Global Community
Connections for The Coca-Cola Company, and chair of The Coca-Cola Foundation.
"In 2008, The Company disbursed more than $82 million in charitable
contributions. The online application will simplify the request process, speed
the response time back to our community partners, and assist community
organizations in identifying our priority areas." 

As a global beverage and sustainability leader, The Coca-Cola Company regularly
evaluates its processes to ensure that those doing business with the Company do
so in an expedient and efficient way. This online application system creates a
single entry-point for nonprofit organizations around the world to apply for
support from The Coca-Cola Company, its global foundation or seven regional
foundations. The online application also provides information about the
Company`s priority community investment initiatives, such as water stewardship,
community recycling, active healthy living, and local level initiatives, such as
education, diversity or support for HIV/AIDS prevention. 

Organizations seeking support for community sponsorships, in-kind donations,
fundraising dinners and or cash contributions must complete the online
application at
www.thecoca-colacompany.com/citizenship/application_guidelines.Those submitting
paper applications will be asked to resubmit the application using the online

&lt;p&gt;GREAT NECK, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
Parker Waichman Alonso LLP represented a whistleblower in one of the lawsuits
involved in the recent $2.3 billion Pfizer settlement. The whistleblower lawsuit
alleged that Pfizer illegally promoted the off-label use of the antipsychotic
medication Geodon. 

The Parker Waichman Alonso lawsuit was one of nine settled by the U.S.
Department of Justice that charged Pfizer illegally marketed Geodon, as well as
the pain killer Bextra; Zyvox, an antibiotic; and Lyrica, an anti-epileptic
drug. The civil settlement also resolves allegations that Pfizer paid kickbacks
to health care providers to induce them to prescribe these, as well as other,
drugs. 

Under the terms of the settlement, Pfizer subsidiary Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn Company
Inc. has also agreed to plead guilty to a felony violation that it illegally
promoted the off-label use of Bextra. Pharmacia &amp; Upjohn will pay $1.3 billion
toward the total settlement. 

The $2.3 billion settlement is the largest healthcare fraud settlement in the
history of the U.S. Department of Justice. The Geodon portion of the settlement
was $301 million. 

"We are proud of our client and the other relators who stepped forward to expose
Pfizer's wrongdoing, and helped to make this settlement possible," said David
Krangle, an attorney with Parker Waichman Alonso LLP. "We are also proud that
our firm was able to play a part in obtaining justice for American taxpayers."

&lt;p&gt;System Administrators Can Recover User Documents Lost in Corrupted SharePoint
Databases and Rebuild Damaged Deployments Faster 
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
OfficeRecovery.com announces data recovery programs for SharePoint Server:
Document Recovery for SharePoint and Recovery for SharePoint. 

An integral part of a well thought out SharePoint disaster recovery plan, the
two products complement each other in bringing back user documents and helping
to rebuild the whole SharePoint environment. 

Document Recovery for SharePoint retrieves documents and files from corrupted
SharePoint databases. This reduces business downtime due to unavailability of
user documents stored in SharePoint. 

When salvaging the documents is not enough, Recovery for SharePoint can be
applied. This recovery tool processes damaged database and saves recovered data
into XML files that can be implemented into a new SharePoint database. 

The utilities do not rely on pre-existing backups. Instead, they use the
corrupted database as the source of recovered data, bringing back items in the
state they were immediately at the point of disaster. 

"Besides the traditional application of post-mortem retrieval of information
directly from the failed databases in enterprise IT environment, Document
Recovery for SharePoint also has valuable applications in computer forensics and
e-discovery," says Emil Sildos, Recoveronix CEO. 

Both utilities support SharePoint and Office SharePoint version 2007 (x64 and
x86), including Service Packs 1 and 2. 

Recovery for SharePoint is priced at US $399 for a standard license. The license
allows one installation of the product and use for one server. Other types of
licenses are Enterprise, allowing two servers, and 1-Year Service, a special
license for companies providing data recovery services. 

Free demo versions of both utilities are available at OfficeRecovery SharePoint
Server solutions page http://www.officerecovery.com/sharepoint/

OfficeRecovery.com is a trade name for Recoveronix, a software company in the
data recovery business since 1998. More than 40 products offered by Recoveronix
have provided millions of businesses and individuals the chance to regain data
accessibility and integrity after the event of data corruption.

&lt;p&gt; (Recasts, adds analyst comment and share movement)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEXICO CITY, Sept 8 (Reuters) - Mexico's peso strengthened
on Tuesday after Goldman Sachs said industrial activity
worldwide was outpacing expectations and the IMF said global
economic recovery may come three months earlier than forecast.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The peso MXN=MEX01 gained 0.67 percent to 13.271 per
U.S. dollar, while the IPC stock index .MXX rose 1.27 percent
to 28,947.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Helping fuel investor appetite for riskier assets, Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) raised its copper price forecast for end-2010 by
more than 30 percent on increasing evidence that a recovery in
global industrial activity is outpacing expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A document obtained by Reuters on Friday showed that the
International Monetary Fund had raised its economic activity
forecasts for this year and next. It is due to publish them
this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Investors are really upbeat about recent comments about
the economic recovery, the end of the financial crisis and
Goldman's report raising industrial metals prices on signs of
the sector's recovery," said Jaime Ascencio, an economist at
Actinver brokerage in Queretaro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in Mexican copper miner Grupo Mexico (GMEXICOB.MX)
added 2.70 percent to 23.23 pesos.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Wireless operator America Movil (AMXL.MX) rose 2.44 percent
to 30.67 pesos after Barclay's Capital initiated coverage of
Latin America telecommunications firms and placed an
"overweight" rating on America Movil.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mexico's government is expected to give lawmakers its 2010
budget and tax proposal on Tuesday, and investors have been
increasingly optimistic that the main opposition party will
back the administration's proposals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However concerns that the government could rely on raising
energy prices, which could push up inflation, kept bond
investors nervous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The government's benchmark 10-year peso bond MX10YT=RR
broke a three-session winning streak, pushing its yield up 3
basis points to bid 8.00 percent.

&lt;p&gt;Security Blanket Provides Government, Healthcare, Financial Services and other
Organizations the Flexibility to Manage Security within a Large Virtual
Environment
HERNDON, Va.--(Business Wire)--
Trusted Computer Solutions, Inc. (TCS), a leading developer of cross domain and
cyber security solutions, today announced that Security Blanket, the company`s
award-winning automated lock down solution, is now available for Red Hat
Enterprise Linux 5 operating systems running on IBM System z hardware. Security
Blanket provides mainframe users the ability to centrally manage multiple
virtual server configurations, assess their level of security against industry
standard security guidelines, and automatically configure their operating
systems (OS) to a state of lock down. Importantly, the virtual servers can be
associated with groups based on common functionality or security requirements,
making it simple to manage large virtual environments running on System z. 

"Mainframe environments, especially those within government, financial services
and healthcare, are recognizing the lower total cost of ownership achieved when
they migrate from UNIX to Linux. Our customers are recognizing significant
savings on hardware and software," said Shawn Wells, Director of Global System z
Sales and Strategy at Red Hat. "We are excited that TCS has made Security
Blanket available to our Red Hat Enterprise Linux mainframe customers, further
reducing costs by automating the OS lock down process." 

According to a recent global study commissioned by CA (NASDAQ:CA), large
enterprises continue to step up their investments in Linux on the mainframe in
order to deliver more value to the business while controlling IT costs. The two
main reasons cited by respondents for an increase of Linux on the mainframe are
the desire to take advantage of computing capacity available on their
mainframe`s central processors and their assessment that using Linux on the
mainframe would be more cost-effective than other platforms. 

"Organizations today are looking for higher utilization rates, decreased power
consumption, and the flexibility to shift capacity on demand," stated Ed
Hammersla, Chief Operating Officer for TCS. "The System z`s advanced
virtualization stack, which enables high sustained capacity utilization, is a
big draw for organizations seeking a consolidation platform. Security Blanket
now provides system administrators in System z environments with a solution that
automates the process of securing any number of virtual operating systems to
customized or industry standard levels of compliancy." 

TCS engaged in IBM`s Systems Application Advantage for Linux program (a.k.a.
Chiphopper) for developing and testing Security Blanket on the System z platform
and received official Chiphopper Assurance approval. With the addition of System
z, Security Blanket broadens the family of platforms it supports. The solution
also runs on x86 (both Linux and Solaris), SPARC, and VMWare vSphere. For more

&lt;p&gt;Alexander Seropian, Wideload CEO and Bungie Software Founder, To Assume Newly
Created Position as Vice President of Creative At Disney Interactive Studios
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Disney Interactive Studios announced today it has agreed to acquire Wideload
Games Inc., a Chicago-based producer and developer of original interactive
entertainment. As part of the agreement, industry veteran and creative visionary
Alexander Seropian, Wideload Games founder and CEO, will join Disney Interactive
Studios in the newly created role of vice president of creative, leading the
company`s global creative efforts. Seropian, who is relocating to Glendale,
Calif., is renowned as the founder of Bungie Software and was among the creators
of the highly successful Halo series - one of the most successful video game
franchises of all time. Seropian will report directly to Global Product
Development Senior Vice President Jean-Marcel Nicolai, and be tasked with
overseeing creative development across Disney Interactive Studios` portfolio of
video games. 

"Wideload Games is among the premier small creative game development studios in
the world. Wideload Games will be a great fit for our portfolio of internal
studios, and Alex joining the global product development team provides the
entire Disney game portfolio with a strong creative influence," said Graham
Hopper, executive vice president and general manager, Disney Interactive
Studios. "Alex has built his reputation around the power of original thinking.
In leading the studio that created Halo, he helped turn great storytelling,
exceptional design and polished gameplay into the `killer app` for Xbox. Alex`s
leadership of our creative community will enhance our ability to be a magnet for
the best talent in the industry and enable the company to take an even more
significant role in developing industry leading products." 

Seropian began his career in 1991 as founder and CEO of Bungie Software, which
created the Marathon and Myth computer game series. Seven years later, Bungie
Software made the Inc. 500 list of the fastest-growing private U.S. companies.
In 2000, Seropian negotiated the acquisition of Bungie Software by Microsoft
Corp., and then oversaw the development, production and delivery of the
critically acclaimed and highly successful game, Halo, the flagship title for
the 2001 launch of the Xbox video game system from Microsoft. In 2003, Seropian
founded Wideload Games, which has released the games: Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel
Without a Pulse, Hail to the Chimp,Texas Cheat `Em and Cyclomite.

"Joining Disney is an ideal next step, both for our studio and me," Seropian
said. "At Wideload, we`ve conscientiously built a forward-looking approach to
game development that borrows many techniques from the film industry. Now,
Wideload will be a part of one of the largest, most respected entertainment
companies in the world. I`m looking forward to Wideload`s continued success as a
part of Disney and I`m eager to bring all my experience to the creative
community at Disney Interactive Studios." 

Wideload Games president Tom Kang will continue to lead the studio as studio
director. As part of Disney Interactive Studios` network of global internal
development teams, Wideload Games will focus on creating new intellectual
properties for Disney that target a broad audience. The studio, which will
remain in its current Chicago location, is developing an unannounced original
family console game scheduled for release in 2010 from Disney Interactive
Studios. 

Wideload`s focus will continue to be developing original video game properties
using an innovative development approach that requires developing prototypes
with small core creative teams and ramping up for product development with
globally outsourced talent. To complement its console team and expand its
portfolio of original intellectual properties, Wideload Games established
Wideload Shorts in 2007 for the emerging online and handheld platforms. As part
of Disney Interactive Studios, Wideload Shorts will continue to create original
properties for casual, downloadable and mobile games. 

Founded in 2003, Wideload Games` core team of 25 full-time employees is
comprised of many industry veterans and executives, including former Bungie
Software personnel. In 2006, Tom Kang joined Wideload Games as president. Kang
previously was president and CEO of CSMG Inc., one of the fastest growing sports
management firms in the United States, which was acquired by Interpublic Group
and Creative Artists Agency. 

Terms of the agreement will not be disclosed.

&lt;p&gt;  IRVINE, CA, Sep 08 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Vision Solutions, a leading high availability, disaster recovery, and
data management solutions provider in IBM (NYSE: IBM) Power Systems
markets, today announces a a new white paper providing an extensive
end-to-end overview of data protection and recovery strategies for IBM
Power i and AIX environments.

    The 29-page paper, "Next-Generation Disaster Recovery and Availability
Technologies for IBM Power Systems," covers the spectrum of resilience and
recovery technologies to help managers of IBM i (i5/OS) and AIX
environments view and compare all available options in one place --
including  next-generation technologies such as continuous data
protection (CDP), automated journal recovery and IASP.

    "Our endeavor here is not only to give IT managers and operators of IBM i
and AIX environments a single source for comparing protection and recovery
technologies, but most importantly, to outline how each of these stack up
against each other in terms of recovery time and recovery point," says
Vision Solutions' Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer,
Alan Arnold.

    "Most small companies know they need to improve their recovery time and/or
data recovery point beyond tape saves but don't always know all of the
options that exist," adds Bill Rice, director of marketing communications
for Vision Solutions. "This new paper helps clarify the options based on
Vision's extensive experience and global leadership in the HA and disaster
recovery space."

    The paper covers both single-system and multiple-system
technologies/strategies, including: tape backups, journaling/logging,
hot/cold sites, RAID, disk mirroring, remote journaling, logical
replication, logical partitioning (virtual servers), local and remote
hardware mirroring, SAN copy services, managed journal recovery,
continuous data protection (CDP), high availability, IASP, clustering and
more.

    Also included in the paper are a series of diagrams -- one building on the
other -- that makes it easy to see how each technology and strategy
compares to the others in terms of improvements in recovery time and the
completeness of data recovery.

    Says Rice, "This document is an 'industry first' that provides managers of
IBM i and AIX environments an up-to-date overview of the many options for
adding resilience and recovery capabilities."

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Hollywood Reporter) - If you like stories with real-life good guys and bad guys, then "Crude" is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Joe Berlinger's latest documentary investigates the ongoing case environmentalists dub the "Amazon Cherynobyl," the horrifying, systematic destruction of a land and culture after the arrival of a multinational oil company. It opened Wednesday through First Run Features.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berlinger's reputation as a skilled filmmaker-journalist and the topical subject matter make "Crude" must-viewing for those who care about the planet. It wouldn't be surprising if the film has an impact on the legal wrangling in the courts, let alone popular knowledge and opinion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berlinger, who directed "Brother's Keeper," "Paradise Lost" and "Metallica: Some Kind of Monster," engages the viewer with the devastating effects of pollution on the rain forests of Ecuador by the oil company Texaco, which merged with Chevron in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berlinger covers both sides of the court case, in which oil field laborer-turned-lawyer Pablo Fajardo alleges decades-long ecological terrorism by Chevron (whose defendants claim the charges are fabricated to line the pockets of the environmentalist legal team).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It becomes obvious where Berlinger stands, which is understandable because it would have been naive for the director to try to stay neutral or artificially balance his inquiry (as the average oil company-sponsored mainstream TV news show would do). Still, thanks to Berlinger's tenacious, comprehensive, well-researched approach, it would be unwise to dismiss him as a mere muckraker.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If anything, Chevron damns itself through the interviews with the company's arrogant spokespeople. By contrast, the charismatic Fajardo becomes an actual media star (winning a CNN "Hero" award and landing in a spread in Vanity Fair) while also emerging as "Crude's" most winning onscreen player. (At one telling point, Fajardo looks at a photo of himself in the VF piece and shakes his head, regretting that the article does not instead include a picture of a sickened Ecuadorean family.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Berlinger could have given us a bit more of Fajardo's remarkable story, going from manual worker to lead attorney in this international case. It also is unfortunate the subtitles for viewers are small and often hard to read, making the English-language speakers more accessible (including the plaintiffs' consultant, American Steven Donziger, who appears frequently). And, though it is not the director's fault, we miss much of the central courtroom action because it has been blocked from view.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But minor flaws and all, "Crude" represents a crucial document as much as any evidence put forward in the courtroom itself.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by DGoodman at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Is oil giant Chevron afraid of a movie?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the stars of "Crude," a documentary about a $27 billion environmental lawsuit filed against the company on behalf of residents of Ecuador's Amazon, certainly thinks so. A spokesman for Chevron vehemently denies it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film's New York opening on Wednesday is the latest twist in a class action case that began 16 years ago, which argues that Chevron should compensate some 30,000 Ecuadoreans who live near waste pits left by oil exploration going back to the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Crude" shows villagers living by oil-slicked streams, washing clothes in contaminated water. One scene shows a newborn with head-to-toe skin rashes; others offer interviews with Ecuadoreans who contend those who use the water or live near it are prone to cancer, birth defects and other ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film is absorbing, in large part due to one of the personalities with the most screen time: Trudie Styler, who with her husband Sting founded the Rainforest Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Styler visited the affected area in Ecuador and her group donated rain-collection barrels so villagers can have clean water. She praised the film for its environmental message and vividly recalled the stench in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before you're smelling things, your eyes start to prick and to have a burning sensation and the closer you get to ... these contaminated areas where people are being forced to live, your nostrils fill up ... your saliva gets the taste of petroleum in it as well ... and then 20 minutes later you're getting this horrible headache," Styler told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEVRON DENIES RESPONSIBILITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies responsibility for the contamination and stepped up a media campaign last week, offering videotapes that the company said show the Ecuadorean judge in the case was involved in a bribery scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge recused himself from the case but said he did nothing wrong, and the Washington D.C.-based Amazon Defense Coalition that supports the plaintiffs said the video shows the judge resisted attempts to bribe him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Donziger, a U.S.-based consulting plaintiffs' attorney, questioned the timing of Chevron's latest campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the timing of the release of these videotapes -- which they've had, by their own admission, for months -- is directly related to the release of a film that they're scared about and they're hoping people don't go see," Donziger said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent Robertson, a spokesman for Chevron based in San Ramon, California, said the video was released last week because the company needed time to authenticate it, not because of the film's opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The film is long on emotion and short on facts," Robertson said by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there was no documented proof of a link between oil-related pollution in the Ecuadorean jungle and diseases suffered by the plaintiffs and said rulings by the judge who recused himself should be annulled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the petroleum Styler described in the area, Robertson said, "If you're seeing fresh oil today ... how can that be the responsibility of a company that stopped operating in 1990?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs allege that Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, dumped billions of gallons (liters) of polluted water in the jungle for more than two decades before the company left Ecuador in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sandra Maler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The Walt Disney Co has seen a firming in local ad markets and more activity by auto makers in national ad sales but still expects theme park hotel bookings for its September quarter to trend downward, Chief Financial Officer Tom Staggs told analysts on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Staggs also said he sees an opportunity for Disney to expand the international reach of Marvel Entertainment Inc's consumer products licensing business if its planned $4 billion acquisition of the comic-book company closes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs made the comments on Wednesday during an appearance at the Bank of America/Merrill Lynch 2009 Media, Communications  Entertainment Conference in Marina del Rey, California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's third fiscal quarter results, released July 30, showed continued stability at its two profit powerhouses -- theme parks and media networks -- but no return to growth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney missed revenue expectations and met profit forecasts mainly through cost cutting last quarter. It forecast a 7 percent drop in hotel bookings at its U.S. theme parks this quarter, after the effect of an extra week was excluded.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The trend in parks has been relatively stable. The volumes have held up pretty well," Staggs said on Wednesday. "The trends we have seen since the earnings call have been pretty consistent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the TV ad markets -- where Disney expected in July to make fewer advance sales as big advertisers sat on the sidelines -- Staggs said on Wednesday the company has "seen some encouraging signs, especially in national ad sales."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He declined, however, to comment on whether ad pricing had held up at just-concluded upfront sales for its ABC television network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;'SOME GOOD SIGNS'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's too early for me to declare victory but there are some good signs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local advertising markets, which had taken the brunt of the downturn in ad sales, "has firmed some" and national markets have started to see more interest from auto makers, whose absence had contributed heavily to the downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"On the national level, auto has gotten more active and that is a good sign," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As expected, Disney sold less advance ad inventory but still believes it is well positioned for spot sales if an expected uptick in prices materializes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney's ESPN cable sports network also saw "some signs of strength" in national ad sales but Staggs hedged on whether that portended a recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We like some of the trends we have seen ... this is a pretty tough marketplace we are coming off of, and I am hesitant to say the trends we are seeing are a permanent ... return to prosperity," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs also said there are opportunities for further cost savings at Disney's television network ABC, especially in the development and production of programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's something that's going to continue to happen over time, but there are opportunities for efficiency," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staggs talked about synergies in Disney's plan to incorporate Marvel into its robust merchandising and retail operation -- seen by analysts as a key part of the acquisition since the deal was announced last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;International markets of Disney consumer products accounts for close to 60 percent of sales, while Marvel's international merchandise revenues are "meaningfully under 50 percent," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'd look to move them more in the direction that we are," Staffs said. "There is room for growth internationally ... we have to be thoughtful about how we do it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gina Keating; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

consistent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the TV ad markets -- where Disney expected in July to
make fewer advance sales as big advertisers sat on the
sidelines -- Staggs said on Wednesday the company has "seen
some encouraging signs, especially in national ad sales."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He declined, however, to comment on whether ad pricing had
held up at just-concluded upfront sales for its ABC television
network.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 'SOME GOOD SIGNS'&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's too early for me to declare victory but there are
some good signs," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Local advertising markets, which had taken the brunt of the
downturn in ad sales, "has firmed some" and national markets
have started to see more interest from auto makers, whose
absence had contributed heavily to the downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "On the national level, auto has gotten more active and
that is a good sign," Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As expected, Disney sold less advance ad inventory but
still believes it is well positioned for spot sales if an
expected uptick in prices materializes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Disney's ESPN cable sports network also saw "some signs of
strength" in national ad sales but Staggs hedged on whether
that portended a recovery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We like some of the trends we have seen ... this is a
pretty tough marketplace we are coming off of, and I am
hesitant to say the trends we are seeing are a permanent ...
return to prosperity," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs also said there are opportunities for further cost
savings at Disney's television network ABC, especially in the
development and production of programs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's something that's going to continue to happen over
time, but there are opportunities for efficiency," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Staggs talked about synergies in Disney's plan to
incorporate Marvel into its robust merchandising and retail
operation -- seen by analysts as a key part of the acquisition
since the deal was announced last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; International markets of Disney consumer products accounts
for close to 60 percent of sales, while Marvel's international
merchandise revenues are "meaningfully under 50 percent,"
Staggs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'd look to move them more in the direction that we are,"
Staffs said. "There is room for growth internationally ... we
have to be thoughtful about how we do it."

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - The head of U.S. bank Goldman Sachs said on Wednesday that anger over bankers' pay was "understandable and appropriate," and that greater scrutiny of trade in complex instruments was needed to keep banks in check.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But with the banking sector bouncing back from the financial crisis, regulatory overkill could choke off economic growth, Lloyd Blankfein told an industry conference in Germany's financial hub.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think several months ago took the worst case off the table, and I think the financial markets are in recovery now. So I believe that the worst of this crisis is off the table," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He took a hard line on bankers' compensation, arguing there was scant justification for paying outsized bonuses when a bank had lost money for the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger over compensation was in many respects "understandable and appropriate," he said, adding that Goldman had a clawback tool which let the firm recover some of the bonuses paid if reputational or financial damage ensued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Multi-year guaranteed employment contracts should be banned entirely. The use of these contracts unfortunately is a common practice in our industry," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HOT TOPIC&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bankers' pay has been a hot topic at the two-day Banks in Transition annual conference, especially as some finance ministers from the Group of 20 countries want to explore ways to rein in bonuses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Martin Blessing, the head of Commerzbank, said it was time to end guaranteed bonuses for investment bankers, fuelling debate on what role payoffs play in destabilizing the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I have a feeling that in New York and London guaranteed bonuses are being paid again if people are changing jobs," said Blessing, who last year was the lowest-paid chief executive for a German blue-chip company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"And therefore I agree with (HSBC Chairman) Stephen Green, who said yesterday that bonus payments there should be abolished. I think this is correct," said Blessing, who faces a lawsuit from dozens of London bankers who say they did not get promised bonuses after Commerzbank bought Dresdner Kleinwort last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;REGULATION&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks are feeling the heat as regulators, central banks and national governments try to ensure free-wheeling banks do not again pose systemic risks to the financial system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Central bankers on Sunday proposed a new regulatory framework that would force banks to set aside more profits as a cushion against hard times.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Goldman's Blankfein acknowledged the financial system needed repair as policymakers tried to restore trust, he said they should not try to shelter the sector from the storm of the century and should focus on making trade in derivatives more open to scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will do more to enhance price discovery and reduce systemic risk than perhaps any specific rule or regulation," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Christoph Steitz and Jonathan Gould)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Is oil giant Chevron afraid of a movie?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the stars of "Crude," a documentary about a $27 billion environmental lawsuit filed against the company on behalf of residents of Ecuador's Amazon, certainly thinks so. A spokesman for Chevron vehemently denies it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film's New York opening on Wednesday is the latest twist in a class action case that began 16 years ago, which argues that Chevron should compensate some 30,000 Ecuadoreans who live near waste pits left by oil exploration going back to the 1960s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Crude" shows villagers living by oil-slicked streams, washing clothes in contaminated water. One scene shows a newborn with head-to-toe skin rashes; others offer interviews with Ecuadoreans who contend those who use the water or live near it are prone to cancer, birth defects and other ailments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The film is absorbing, in large part due to one of the personalities with the most screen time: Trudie Styler, who with her husband Sting founded the Rainforest Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Styler visited the affected area in Ecuador and her group donated rain-collection barrels so villagers can have clean water. She praised the film for its environmental message and vividly recalled the stench in the area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Before you're smelling things, your eyes start to prick and to have a burning sensation and the closer you get to ... these contaminated areas where people are being forced to live, your nostrils fill up ... your saliva gets the taste of petroleum in it as well ... and then 20 minutes later you're getting this horrible headache," Styler told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;CHEVRON DENIES RESPONSIBILITY&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron denies responsibility for the contamination and stepped up a media campaign last week, offering videotapes that the company said show the Ecuadorean judge in the case was involved in a bribery scheme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The judge recused himself from the case but said he did nothing wrong, and the Washington D.C.-based Amazon Defense Coalition that supports the plaintiffs said the video shows the judge resisted attempts to bribe him.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Steve Donziger, a U.S.-based consulting plaintiffs' attorney, questioned the timing of Chevron's latest campaign.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think the timing of the release of these videotapes -- which they've had, by their own admission, for months -- is directly related to the release of a film that they're scared about and they're hoping people don't go see," Donziger said in a telephone interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kent Robertson, a spokesman for Chevron based in San Ramon, California, said the video was released last week because the company needed time to authenticate it, not because of the film's opening.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The film is long on emotion and short on facts," Robertson said by telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He said there was no documented proof of a link between oil-related pollution in the Ecuadorean jungle and diseases suffered by the plaintiffs and said rulings by the judge who recused himself should be annulled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for the petroleum Styler described in the area, Robertson said, "If you're seeing fresh oil today ... how can that be the responsibility of a company that stopped operating in 1990?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The plaintiffs allege that Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, dumped billions of gallons of polluted water in the jungle for more than two decades before the company left Ecuador in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sandra Maler)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lending up more than 50 percent to begin fueling economic recovery
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Keeping credit flowing when businesses need it most, JPMorgan Chase made
approximately $15.1 billion in loans and lines of credit to 21,000 small- and
medium-sized businesses across the U.S. during the second quarter of 2009, the
firm announced today. JPMorgan Chase is committed to helping small- and
medium-sized firms during tough economic times, as they play a pivotal role in
fueling the nation`s recovery. 

"In the second quarter, our bank increased lending to the small- and mid-sized
companies that are at the very heart of our nation`s economy," said Todd Maclin,
CEO of Commercial Banking at JPMorgan Chase. "We`re proud that thousands of
businesses across the country are putting $15 billion in new capital to work
every day, keeping their operations running, investing for the future, and
creating jobs." 

Based on the company`s preliminary data, JPMorgan Chase`s lending to small- and
mid-sized firms increased by more than 50 percent from the first quarter,
including:

* $13.5 billion for 16,451 loans to mid-sized businesses, corporations and
government and nonprofit agencies - up nearly 54%; and 
* $1.5 billion for 4,177 small business loans - an increase of 32%.

Small- and medium-sized businesses are the cornerstone of the U.S. economy. More
than 98 percent of U.S. businesses have fewer than 100 employees, according to
the U.S. Census Bureau`s most recent data. Together, these firms employ nearly
42.7 million people and pay $1.5 trillion in salaries. 

JPMorgan Chase`s lending activity to small- and medium-sized businesses reflects
a national trend for the bank, which provided approximately $150 billion in
credit to consumers, corporations, small businesses, municipalities, and
non-profits in the second quarter. 

Chase is committed to lending to the businesses that keep the American economy
running. The bank was the largest auto lender in the country for the first half
of 2009. The bank provided $5.3 billion in auto loans and leases for more than
544,000 vehicles during the second quarter of this year, helping a vital sector
of the U.S. economy recover.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats with no changes to headline or text)
 (Adds details on Chevron, Angola oil output levels)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has
started pumping crude oil from the Tombua-Landana project
offshore Angola, with plans to raise output to 100,000 barrels
per day by 2011, the company said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chevron-operated, $3.8 billion development is located
in 1,200 feet (366 meters) of water 50 miles (80 kilometers)
offshore Angola in the Block 14 area, the company said in a
release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tombua-Landana began pumping oil on Aug. 19, a month ahead
of schedule, and is Chevron's largest project to begin
producing oil in 2009, the company said. A Chevron spokesman
declined to say what current production is as the ramping-up
process takes time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron holds a 31 percent interest in Block 14, while
Angola's state-run Sonangol has 20 percent, Italy's Eni
(ENI.MI) holds 20 percent, France's Total (TOTF.PA) has 20
percent and Portugal's Galp (GALP.LS) has 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron said it already produces 168,000 barrels of
hydrocarbon liquids per day in other Block 14 fields. The
company in July began production at another field, known as
Mamufeira Norte, in Angola's Block 0 area. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Tombua-Landana, with an estimated 350 million barrels of
recoverable reserves, is Chevron's third deepwater project in
the West African country, and one of a dozen projects it has
underway there overall, Chevron said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Angola's growing offshore oil sector is attracting billions
in investment from oil majors in the U.S., Europe and Asia. The
country currently holds the presidency of the Organization of
the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), and may already top
Nigeria as Africa's largest crude producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; According to analysts polled by Reuters, Angola likely
pumped around 1.78 million barrels a day in August, edging out
Nigeria's production of 1.75 million bpd, which has been
crimped by militant attacks in the Niger Delta region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Total said gas from the Block 14 project will be supplied
to the Angola Liquefied Natural Gas project being built nearby,
which is slated to start up in 2012. Total owns a 13.6 percent
stake in the LNG project, in which Chevron also holds a stake,
the companies said in a release.

&lt;p&gt;New Information Contradicts Earlier Claim by Oil Giant As Questions Grow About
Chevron`s Own Role

Chevron Refuses to Make Key Witnesses Available; Refuses to Release Second Video
to Public; Refuses to Disclose Details of Payments to Contractor


WASHINGTON--(Business Wire)--
American businessman Wayne Hansen, who secretly made a video recording which
implicates himself and a Chevron contractor in a bribery scheme related to the
company`s $27 billion liability in Ecuador, is connected to a consulting firm
that lists Chevron as a client and may have his legal fees paid by the oil
giant, according to news reports and a spokesperson for the rainforest
communities suing the company. 

Chevron`s ties to Hansen directly contradict repeated assertions by Chevron
lawyers and spokespersons that the company has no relationship to the American
businessman, said Karen Hinton, a spokesperson for the indigenous and farmer
communities suing the oil company in Ecuador. 

"Chevron needs to answer several critical questions to clarify its own role in
these events, and it also needs to explain why it has not previously disclosed
its connection to Hansen. If this is not the Wayne Hansen who recorded the tapes
that Chevron put on YouTube and released widely to the news media, then Chevron
should identify who the real Wayne Hansen is," said Hinton. 

Hansen has dropped out of sight since the scandal erupted last Monday when
Chevron posted the videos shot by Hansen and a former Chevron contractor, Diego
Borja, on YouTube. The videos show Hansen and Borja secretly filming themselves
and other persons with hidden cameras discussing a bribery scheme in which
Hansen would apparently be the beneficiary of a environmental clean-up contract
should Chevron lose the case. 

Chevron`s ties to Hansen raise further questions about whether the company in
any way facilitated the bribery scheme to undermine the 16-year litigation on
the eve of a final judgment, which was expected within weeks, said Hinton. The
judge in the trial, Juan Nunez, recused himself last week so Ecuadorian
authorities could investigate the matter. He was immediately replaced by a new
judge from the same court. 

The case is taking place in Ecuador at Chevron`s request after it was initially
filed in the U.S. Texaco (now Chevron) is accused in the suit of deliberately
dumping more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into Amazon waterways when
it operated a large oil concession from 1964 to 1990, creating what some experts
believe is the worst oil-related contamination on earth. In 2008, a
court-appointed Special Master and team of technical experts found damages could
be as high as $27.3 billion. 

The revelations about Hansen add to a growing list of questions about
inaccuracies in the videotapes and inconsistencies between Chevron`s assertions
and known facts. 

Bloomberg News is reporting that Hansen - who has not been available for
questioning -- has apparently hired an American lawyer. Chevron spokesperson
Kent Robertson said in the news article that the oil company "is considering"
paying his legal fees. 

See the Bloomberg article:
http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive=azwOVWeGukJI

Further, Hansen`s biography obtained on the Internet identifies him as the
former Chief Mechanical Engineer and Director of Energy Engineering at RJM
Associates, which lists Chevron as a client. The owner of that company, Richard
Miller, has longtime ties to Texaco and started his career with the company in
1967 -- coincidentally the same year Texaco dug its first well in Ecuador`s
Amazon. Chevron has failed to disclose its connection to Hansen in any of its
press materials. 

See the following links.
Hansen bio: http://www.eicconsultants.com/seminars/presenters/hansen.htm
RJM Associates web site: http://www.rjmanda.com/

Other key questions remain that only Chevron can answer, Hinton said. These
include whether Chevron or any of its officials - including those in its legal
office in Quito -- orchestrated the bribery scheme. Ecuadorian authorities are
expected to focus on this question as well as the role of Judge Nunez. 

Additional questions appear to contradict Chevron`s version of events:

* Chevron claims there were two hidden cameras - yet Chevron has released only
one video to the media, suggesting the two tapes were spliced together. Chevron
has refused to release the second videotape or explain how the tapes were
edited. 
* Chevron claimed it received the videotapes in early June, yet the fourth
meeting - the only meeting where a bribe was discussed - took place on June 15
and emails about the scheme were exchanged by Borja in late June well after
Chevron claims it learned of the activities. Chevron`s legal department needs to
disclose any contacts Chevron officials had with any participant in the final
meeting and whether Chevron officials scripted or in any way influenced that
meeting. 
* Chevron also has refused to fully explain its relationship to Borja. Chevron
has not disclosed how much money it paid to Borja, any other assistance it has
given him, when the company first had contact with him, and whether its
Ecuadorian legal team directed or otherwise influenced his actions. In its
initial press materials, Chevron did not disclose that Borja worked for the
company as late as March of this year during the environmental trial in
Ecuador.

Andrew Woods, an American legal advisor to the plaintiffs, also said it is clear
from the videotapes that Chevron`s contractor Borja taped himself offering a
bribe for a remediation contract - a fact which may have violated U.S. criminal
laws, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, if indeed Borja was acting on
behalf of Chevron or any other American entity. 

Lawyers for the Amazonian communities are urging U.S. authorities to fully
investigate the facts surrounding the videos given that many of the witnesses
from Chevron are in the U.S., and that Chevron itself has continually criticized
the Ecuadorian government for being biased against it in the trial and thus
would not accept any findings that did not comport with its wishes, said Hinton.
Already, Ecuador`s national prosecutor and Judicial Council have launched
separate investigations into Chevron`s allegations. 

On Saturday, the Los Angeles Times - the largest daily newspaper in Chevron`s
home state of California -- published an editorial calling for the company to be
included in any investigation of the facts surrounding the bribery scandal. It
also concluded it was unclear from the videotapes if Judge Nunez is even
implicated, as Chevron also repeatedly claims in its recent press materials. 

Lawyers for the plaintiffs said they did not expect the trial to be affected in
a significant way by the recusal, particularly since the vast majority of the
evidence - including 100% of the evidence used by the Special Master to assess
damages - had already been presented to the court before Judge Nunez took over
as presiding judge.

&lt;p&gt;The Story and Song From The Haunted Mansion and The Haunted Mansion
BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
On September 9, 2009 Walt Disney Records celebrates the 40th Anniversary of The
Haunted Mansion with two CD releases -- The Story and Song From The Haunted
Mansion and The Haunted Mansion. Both CDs were produced, fully restored and
compiled by Grammy&#174;-winning producer Randy Thornton. 

Forty years ago, 999 happy haunts took up residence in Disneyland at the
personal invitation of Walt Disney himself, who built an elegant mansion and
promised his ghostly guests creaking doors and creaking floors, replete with hot
and cold running chills. One of the most beloved attractions at Disney Theme
Parks, The Haunted Mansion gates and crypts creaked open in New Orleans Square
at Disneyland on August 9, 1969. The Story and Song From The Haunted Mansion was
a Disneyland Records Storyteller released the same year to commemorate the
opening of the attraction. Although intended as a promotional album, the
recording has become a cherished childhood memory for many Disneyland guests.
The release includes original scenes and effects that never made it into the
final attraction as it follows the story of two teenagers (voiced by Robie
Lester and a young Ron Howard) who take refuge inside the eerie mansion during a
mysterious rainstorm. The CD includes a bonus track, "Grim Grinning Ghosts," the
theme song to the attraction written by X. Atencio, with music by Buddy Baker.
The enhanced CD also includes a Digital Image Gallery (which can be accessed by
inserting the CD into a computer) of high quality images from Collin Campbell`s
original paintings for the album. 

The Haunted Mansion CD, exclusively available at Disney Theme Parks, guides the
listener through the attraction as it appears in its current&#8230;incarnation on
Track 1. Randy Thornton recreated the full audio experience of The Haunted
Mansion for the track. This meant layering ambient sounds and sound effects with
the score, character voices and songs found in the attraction. The result is an
immersive audio experience, as if you were actually riding through the
attraction in your doom buggy. Tracks 2 through 6 are highlights from the
attraction and/or from original recording sessions: Ghostly Music Box - "Grim
Ginning Ghosts" played from an authentic Porter Baroque music box; Otherworldly
Concerto - Assembled from recording sessions for the Haunted Mansion`s famous
pipe organ, which included many variations of the famous theme; A Swinging Wake
- The unearthly score from the rollicking graveyard scene; The Graveyard Band -
The philharmonic phantoms perform their own version of "Grim Grinning Ghosts";
999 Happy Haunts - The graveyard inhabitants come out of their creepy old crypts
for a rousing reprise of their favorite song. The CD concludes with Track 7,
Phantom Manor Suite from renowned composer John Debney. His sweeping orchestral
interpretation of Buddy Baker and X. Atencio`s classic score is from the
Disneyland Paris attraction. 

The Story and Song From The Haunted Mansion will be at Disney Theme Parks on
9/9/09 and available nationwide on 9/22/09; The Haunted Mansion will be
available exclusively at all Disney Theme Parks on 9/9/09.

&lt;p&gt;ANCHORAGE, Alaska--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Production Company announced today that it has completed drilling and
casing the surface section on the second well at Point Thomson. The well reached
its target surface-section depth of 4,875 feet. Both wells are planned to be
completed to their final depths by year end 2010. Additionally, construction
work is progressing on schedule with more than 80 barge loads of equipment and
material delivered to the site since mid-July. 

"We are progressing the development of Point Thomson consistent with the Alaska
Department of Natural Resources Interim Decision of January 2009 and the Plan of
Development submitted in February 2008," said Dale Pittman, Alaska production
manager for ExxonMobil. "We place the highest priority on safety and care of the
environment. We are on schedule to begin production at Point Thomson by year-end
2014." 

Point Thomson is a natural gas and condensate field located 60 miles east of
Prudhoe Bay on the North Slope of Alaska. It holds an estimated 8 trillion cubic
feet of gas - about 25 percent of the North Slope's proven gas resource - and
about 200 million barrels of condensate. Developing these resources presents a
number of challenges. In order to safely access the high pressure Point Thomson
reservoir, the Nabors 27E drilling rig was modified with approximately $35
million in upgrades. ExxonMobil staff and Alaskan contractors worked in 2008
through early 2009 to prepare the rig and pad for drilling. 

ExxonMobil will continue to bring innovative technology and world-class
management expertise to the project. Field development will include a gas
cycling plant designed to produce hydrocarbon liquids and re-inject natural gas
back into the reservoir, making Point Thomson the highest-pressure gas cycling
operation in the world. In addition to processing facilities, the development
will include a pipeline tie-in to the TransAlaska Pipeline System (TAPS) and
other ancillary facilities and infrastructure. Point Thomson owners committed
$120 million to the drilling and development activities in 2008, with additional
investments of about $250 million expected in 2009. Point Thomson gas is
critical to the success of a North Slope gas pipeline. 

In addition to ExxonMobil, other major Point Thomson owners participating in the
current drilling and development activity include BP Exploration (Alaska) Inc.
and ConocoPhillips Alaska, Inc. 

CAUTIONARY STATEMENT: Estimates, expectations, and business plans in this
release are forward-looking statements. Actual future results, including
resource recoveries, production rates, and project plans, schedules, and costs
could differ materially due to changes in market conditions affecting the oil
and gas industry or long-term oil and gas price levels; political or regulatory
developments; reservoir performance; timely completion of development projects;
technical or operating factors; and other factors discussed under the heading
"Factors Affecting Future Results" in the Investor Information section of our
website (www.exxonmobil.com) and in Item 1A of our most recent Form 10-K.
References to hydrocarbon resources, gas, barrels of liquid condensate, and
similar terms include quantities of oil and gas that are not yet classified as
proved reserves but that we believe will be produced in the future.

&lt;p&gt;DUBLIN--(Business Wire)--
Research and Markets
(http://www.researchandmarkets.com/research/c3ee7c/greece_food_and_dr) has
announced the addition of the "Greece Food and Drink Report Q4 2009" report to
their offering. 

Business Monitor International's Greece Food and Drink Report provides industry
professionals and strategists, corporate analysts, food and drink associations,
government departments and regulatory bodies with independent forecasts and
competitive intelligence on Greece's food and drink industry. 

Despite posting real GDP growth of 2.9% in 2008 it was forecast that the global
economic crisis would catch up with Greece in 2009. Indeed, BMI expects the
economic climate in Greece to continue worsening throughout the year and BMI
therefore retain their 2009 real GDP growth forecast of -3.5%. This below
consensus forecast is based on the assumption of sustained weakness in local and
international credit markets, plunging consumer confidence and a slump in key
industries such as tourism, shipping and construction. 

Indeed, first quarter results from some of the country's largest food and drink
players bear testimony to the fact that conditions are toughening. Greek-based
soft drinks bottler Coca-Cola Hellenic Bottling Company (CCHBC) announced that
during Q109, its net profit registered a higher-than-expected drop of 93%
year-on-year (y-o-y) to EUR1.9mn (US$2.5mn). The drop in net profit can be
attributed to the ongoing economic slowdown, which has adversely affected the
demand for soft drinks, along with the devaluation of foreign currencies in its
key markets. There were also reports during the quarter that CCHBC intends to
axe up to 130 jobs in its logistics division in Ireland as part of a cost
savings campaign. The company has cut 4,500 jobs across its business since the
second quarter of 2008. CCHBC is the world's second largest Coca-Cola bottler
and holds the franchise to bottle Coca-Cola products in most of Eastern Europe
and parts of Western Europe. This drop in earnings is particularly worrying for
the global soft drink industry, because it is so unusual. CCHBC operates in the
high growth Eastern European market and has a track record of posting
consistently strong results. Meanwhile, Delhaize owned retailer Alfa-Beta
Vassilopoulos (AB) also reported a 72% drop in first quarter net profit to
EUR2.1mn (US$2.9mn) due to slowing consumption. 

The prognosis for investment in the Greek food and drink sector over the longer
term still remains bright, as witnessed by the announcement during the quarter
that Belgian retail group Delhaize intends to take control of the remaining
shares not already held in the country's second largest retailer AB. Delhaize
currently owns 65.27% of AB and in mid May offered EUR30.5 (US$42.6) per share
for those outstanding, representing a premium of 22% on the closing price before
the bid was announced. At the end of June, Delhaize increased its voluntary
tender offer price for Greek retailer by 11.5% to EUR34 (US$47.8) per common
share, as it looks to buy up at least 90% of AB. 

As Greece's number two retailer (behind Carrefour) AB has the necessary size to
be able to compete aggressively on price during the current downturn and
therefore should be less impacted by increased price sensitivity than smaller,
less efficient operators. In addition, Delhaize's willingness to invest during
the economic downturn suggests a belief that Greece offers medium- and long-term
opportunities; a view supported by BMI's economic forecasts for the Western
European region. Prior to the onset of the global economic downturn, Greece was
one of the fastest growing economies in Western Europe and, overall, BMI expects
the country to be one of the quickest to recover as the global economic
situation picks up.

&lt;p&gt;   (Adds details about violation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON/NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - The Commodity
Futures Trading Commission said on Wednesday it imposed a
$300,000 penalty on a futures trading unit of investment bank
JPMorgan (JPM.N) for failing to adhere to rules governing
segregation of customer funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "J.P. Morgan Futures, Inc., a registered futures commission
merchant, drew upon customer segregated funds beyond its actual
interest, resulting in customer funds being commingled with its
funds," the CFTC said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the violation occurred in 2007 and involved
Treasury notes transactions that resulted in JPMF's segregated
accounts for its customer funds being overdrawn by
approximately $750 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At that time, JPMF did not have a process in place to
determine how expected withdrawals from the segregated accounts
would impact the amount required to be kept in segregation, the
CFTC said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Since the incident, however, JPMF has put in place a
segregation forecasting process to ensure compliance with the
law, the CFTC added.

&lt;p&gt;
HACKENSACK, N.J., Sept. 9, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- I.D. Systems, Inc.
(Nasdaq:IDSY), a leading provider of wireless Vehicle Management Systems (VMS),
today announced that its PowerFleet(tm) VMS has been selected by Procter &amp;
Gamble Manufacturing GmbH for deployment on a fleet of industrial trucks at a
production and distribution facility in Germany. The order was facilitated by
I.D. Systems' German subsidiary, I.D. Systems GmbH.

Procter &amp; Gamble Manufacturing GmbH is a subsidiary of Cincinnati-based Procter
&amp; Gamble Co. P is ranked 20th on the Fortune 500 list, 12th on BusinessWeek's
ranking of the 50 Most Innovative Companies, and 6th among Fortune Magazine's
"World's Most Admired Companies". P had $83.5 billion in fiscal 2008 revenues,
with approximately 138,000 employees in over 80 countries worldwide.

Vehicle Management Systems help improve workplace safety and security by
restricting vehicle access to trained, authorized operators, providing
electronic vehicle inspection checklists, and sensing vehicle impacts. A
wireless VMS also helps reduce fleet maintenance costs by automatically
uploading vehicle data, reporting vehicle problems electronically, scheduling
maintenance according to actual vehicle usage rather than by calendar or manual
data entry, and helping determine the optimal economic time to replace
equipment. In addition, a wireless VMS helps improve supply chain productivity
by establishing accountability for the use of equipment, ensuring equipment is
in the proper place at the right time, streamlining material handling work flow,
and providing unique metrics on equipment utilization.

"We are gratified that P, after a competitive review, determined that I.D.
Systems' PowerFleet VMS provides significant value and a high level of expected
return on investment," said Peter Fausel, I.D. Systems' executive vice president
of sales and marketing. "We take pride in the ability of our wireless technology
to help customers gain a competitive edge in their material handling operations.
PowerFleet first helps our customers identify opportunities to reduce costs and
improve operations, then provides the management tools to execute the actions
needed to achieve those objectives.

"We are also proud of our ability to deliver a wireless solution that precisely
meets our customers' technical needs," continued Fausel. "For example, for P,
we were able to configure our Vehicle Management System such that P drivers
could continue using their existing employee identification badges, and the
system could communicate over P's existing wireless network using advanced
Wi-Fi security protocols.

&lt;p&gt;Program Tailored to Educational Guidelines of Each State

Grand Prize Winning Class Will Enjoy Disneyland Celebration


BURBANK, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
With the school year in full swing, educators will have a new environmental
science learning tool to draw from as they develop their curriculums. Disney
today announced the nationwide launch of Disney`s Planet Challenge, a
project-based environmental competition for 4th - 6th grade classrooms that will
empower students to make a difference in school, at home and in their local
communities. With more than 15 years experience running highly-acclaimed
classroom environmental competitions in regional markets including California
and Florida (as "Disney`s Environmentality Challenge"), Disney developed the new
Disney`s Planet Challenge in response to growing demand across all 50 states.
Program collaborations with the National Science Teachers Association (NSTA),
the K-12 Alliance and state and federal government agencies ensure academic and
environmental excellence. Participation in the program is free, and enrollment
is open today at www.disney.com/planetchallenge. 

"Disney`s environmental legacy is carried forward today in our ambitious
environmental goals that not only focus on how we operate our businesses, but on
how we inspire others to learn about the planet and take action as well," said
The Walt Disney Company`s senior executive vice president and chief financial
officer, Tom Staggs, who oversees the company`s environmental efforts. "Disney`s
Planet Challenge is an excellent example of how our unique connection to
children can give us the opportunity to inspire a new generation of
environmental stewards." 

To ensure Disney`s Planet Challenge promotes excellence in science education and
adheres to the specific educational standards of each state, Disney is
collaborating with NSTA and the K-12 Alliance. Disney has also worked closely
with the U.S. and California Environmental Protection Agencies, U.S. Department
of Fish &amp; Wildlife and the California Department of Education to achieve the
highest in environmental standards. 

"Educators are always looking for fresh, interesting ways to motivate their
students," said Dr. Francis Eberle, executive director of NSTA. "Disney`s Planet
Challenge is a motivational tool for educators that not only promotes science
learning, but also promotes critical thinking, teamwork and environmental
responsibility. We are pleased to be collaborating with Disney and we look
forward to bringing Disney`s Planet Challenge to our vast network of teachers
nationwide." 

For the project, students are asked to identify an environmental issue in their
local community and come up with a solution that they manage and document from
start to finish. Past examples range from implementing campus-wide water
conservation programs and electronics recycling drives to protecting local
habitats. Classrooms will develop a portfolio that will be evaluated on
environmental-relevance, student learning, changes in practices and attitudes,
community involvement, lasting benefits to students, school and/or community and
originality. 

"From a curricular perspective, the program extends beyond science, covering
social studies, civics and writing," said Sylvia Rodriguez, the 2008 5th grade
teacher of the winning Disney`s Environmentality Challenge class in California.
"The benefits also go beyond school; the students and even the parents develop a
real sense of community." 

The Disney`s Planet Challenge web site provides tailored lesson plans customized
to reflect the curriculum standards of each state for each grade level (grades
4-6). Teachers can easily find and download relevant lessons to help them link
their class project to their state standards. The web site also includes a range
of multimedia features that allow students to tap into their digital creativity
and create an online portfolio by uploading class work, videos, photos, charts,
news articles and other documents. Classrooms that choose to maintain digital
portfolios have the environmentally friendly option for a paperless submission
via the web site. 

National, regional and state winners will receive an array of Disney prizes
including a class celebration at Disneyland for the national grand prize
champion. The winning class will also have a chance to meet a Disney Channel
star and the class and its winning project may be featured on the Disney
Channel. Other prizes include thousands of dollars in classroom grants, class
screenings of the next Disneynature film, Oceans, and more. Additionally,
winning teachers will receive a one year NSTA membership. The grand-prize
winning educator will also receive an expense paid trip to the national 2011
NSTA conference where he or she will be recognized at the NSTA awards banquet.

Disney continues to grow its portfolio of environmentally inspirational
programs. Earlier this year, Disney launched "Disney`s Friends for Change:
Project Green" (www.Disney.com/projectgreen) to inspire kids outside of the
classroom. The campaign features Disney`s top talent including Miley Cyrus, the
Jonas Brothers, Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato and asks young people to band
together and take simple actions in their daily lives to help the planet.
Participating kids get to help Disney decide how to donate more than $1 million
to environmental charities over the next year.

&lt;p&gt; * Hires JPM media banker to run practice&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Cohen worked on deals such as Tribune, Marketwatch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Megan Davies&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Private equity firm Blackstone
Group (BX.N) has hired JPMorgan (JPM.N) media banker Peter
Cohen as head of its global media advisory practice, it said on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohen worked on deals such as advising Sam Zell on his
acquisition of media group Tribune, and Dow Jones on its
acquisition of Marketwatch.com, Blackstone said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His appointment comes amid upheaval in the media industry,
where traditional media companies have been struggling with
falling advertising revenues and competition from new media.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cohen specialized in the publishing and information
services industries at JPMorgan but his role at Blackstone,
which is a new position, will be much broader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think that now things are beginning to stabilize and
valuations have obviously come way down, there's at least that
sense of stability that will allow people to do some deals,"
Cohen told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Those could include deals coming out of bankruptcies or
restructurings, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I also think that a lot of businesses, especially even
local media businesses, which weren't necessarily great merger
candidates in the past, will merge just for the cost savings,"
he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He also sees the potential for divestitures of non-core
assets by businesses and the chance for large-scale
transactions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blackstone said in its second-quarter earnings release that
fee income from its corporate and MA advisory services
business increased $13 million versus the previous year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The MA advisory group, headed up by John Studzinski, has
large assignments including advising insurer AIG (AIG.N) on its
restructuring.

&lt;p&gt;SANTA CLARA, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Enteros, Inc., an industry leader in Enterprise Production Performance
Management, today announced the extension of support for its Load2Test 2.0
Framework to ADO.NET. This latest addition to the Enteros load testing offering
comes in both 32- and 64-bit capacity, enabling organizations additional
supporting technology to improve server performance and meet the stringent SLAs
for critical business line applications. 

With the new functionality in Load2Test, connections to the database directly
are no longer needed as it can communicate within the middle tier of ADO.NET
calls from applications to data sources. When bottlenecks and performance
degradation are found, Load2Test can easily and efficiently find the location of
the ADO.NET calls and identify them for immediate remediation, ensuring little
to no down time. 

Customers using the .NET Framework for its application development platform can
now have the scalability for testing in both the staging and production portions
of the development lifecycle. Unlike other load testing solutions, Load2Test
uses real production data that provides a complete picture of overall system
performance. 

ADO.NET is a set of computer software components that can be used by programmers
to access data and data services from sources such as Microsoft SQL Server as
well as those exposed through OLE DB and XML. It is a part of the base class
library that is included with the Microsoft .NET Framework and is commonly used
by programmers to access and modify data stored in relational database systems
as well as non-relational sources. Users of ADO.NET can not only connect to a
database, but can also execute commands and retrieve, manipulate and update
data. 

"Load testing continues to be a key indicator for future performance of critical
business systems," said Ron Warshawsky, CTO, Enteros. "The Microsoft .NET
Framework is one of the leading development platforms for high performance
production data and applications. Providing ADO.Net support ensures that
investments made in this modern architecture support business lines and meet the
rigorous demands placed on today`s sytems."

&lt;p&gt;CHEVY CHASE, Md.--(Business Wire)--
With a shared interest in the protection of the environment, the Toyota USA
Foundation and The Coca-Cola Foundation will fund the expansion of 4-H`s youth
water quality and conservation programming, called 4-H2O. Today, Toyota and
Coca-Cola collectively donated an additional $850,000 - $600,000 from Toyota and
$250,000 from Coca-Cola - to expand this important work into five new states -
bringing the total program participation to 10 states. 

"We could not ask for better partners than The Coca-Cola and Toyota USA
Foundation as we continue to strengthen and broaden our exciting environmental
education efforts," said Donald T. Floyd, Jr., president and CEO of National 4-H
Council. "With this continued generous support, we will expand our efforts into
five new states and reach more than 40,000 additional 4-H youth and mentors
through active new 4-H2O projects." 

4-H2O Community Projects

Through the Toyota`s continued support, 4-H will expand the reach of 4-H2O
Community Projects. Currently serving communities in California, Kentucky,
Michigan, Mississippi and West Virginia, 4-H2O Community Projects will now add
Texas. Each state has chosen communities where 4-H youth identify and implement
local water-related projects. From beach cleanup efforts to water-quality
testing in major bodies of water, youth bring their findings to community
leaders for discussion and review of potential solutions for their community. In
2008, 4-H2O Community Projects reached over 73,000 community members in five
states and created 46 local partnerships. 

Additionally, the grant from Toyota will assist the growth of 4-H2Onlineto reach
200,000 youth. The Web site serves as the interactive hub for 4-H2O programming
around the nation, where youth share their experiences and what they have
learned about water conservation and water quality testing. For example, 4-H
youth in Kentucky collaborated with Montana State University to develop a
vodcast documenting their trip to the Georgetown, Kentucky Toyota plant and
discussing the water management techniques they learned from the environmental
engineers there. Funds will support the capabilities of 4-H2Online to host
additional youth vodcasts, 4-H curriculum guides and online educational
activities. 

"We are excited to expand our relationship with 4-H as they grow these excellent
water conservation programs for our young people," said Pat Pineda, group vice
president of philanthropy at Toyota Motor North America. "It is rewarding for
our company to support an organization like 4-H that has such a tremendous
impact on America`s youth and its future." 

4-H2O: Replenish

The Coca-Cola Foundation has generously provided the funding to launch 4-H2O:
Replenish. This exciting water conservation project will serve Arizona,
Oklahoma, Georgia and Wisconsin. In each of these four states, 4-H, the National
Water Program and the Land Grant Universities are working together to find ways
to educate communities on useful water-saving techniques. Through demonstration
sites for items such as rain barrels and rain gardens, community members will
learn how to best save water. In Oklahoma, for example, one of the 10 4-H2O:
Replenish sites in the state collected 14,000 gallons of rainwater in May alone,
and used it in an irrigation system serving a community vegetable garden. 

4-H2O: Replenish has a total projected reach of 37,000 youth and 50 million
gallons of water saved. 

"Water stewardship is a global initiative for The Coca-Cola Company and
partnering with 4-H will allow us to localize that initiative and connect with
America`s youth in a meaningful way," said Ingrid Saunders Jones, chair of The
Coca-Cola Foundation. "Coca-Cola is proud to work with an organization like 4-H
that is making a difference in local communities by engaging young people and
focusing on conserving one of our planet`s most valuable resources, water."

Toyota 4-H2O Community Projects

California:

* San Mateo, Sacramento, and Orange Counties in California are participating
through 4-H clubs, in school and afterschool activities, and camping. The
project`s goal is to increase youth understanding of the linkage between
urbanization and health of local streams, creeks, and the ocean by testing local
waterways. They also aim to reduce overall water consumption in community homes
through public presentations and educational workshops.

Kentucky:

* Counties participating are using Watershed Watch, utilizing hands-on water
testing and analysis to determine the impact of non-point source pollution in
watersheds in their communities. Along with water testing, 4-H2O Community
Project participants use GPS units to conduct a community survey of waterways,
detailing the quality of individual streams.

Michigan:

* Some of Michigan`s projects work both in school programming and with 4-H clubs
with a focus of water-related clean up efforts and educational programming. 4-H
youth focus on how every day actions taken impact for better or for worse the
water resources that surround them.

Mississippi:

* Fourteen counties in Mississippi participating are using the Adopt-A-Stream
program. 4-H`ers identify water chemistry and quality in their local waterways
in the program. Some Mississippi Toyota 4-H2O Community Project communities use
GPS units to mark the water quality samples and for other community conservation
projects, such as marking storm drains.

Texas:

* Bexar County, Texas focuses on teaching youth about water origin, usage,
pollutants, and conservation in an in school setting for elementary school
students. High school students are trained in science classes to teach water
concepts at water fairs to younger 4-H`ers as well as other community members.

West Virginia:

* Four community clusters in West Virginia are participating through afterschool
programs and state-wide through camping programs. Program participants develop a
locally relevant action plan to initiate positive change associated with water
quality and conservation. They then present their findings of research and
action plan to local communities via local board meetings, area 4-H Days, county
fairs, and other relevant local venues.

4-H2O:Replenish Project, sponsored by the Coca-Cola Foundation

Arizona:

* Eight communities are building rain water harvesting systems in their areas.
The state has also sponsored an art contest for 4-H youth to design art for the
large rain barrels in the eight communities.

Georgia:

* In Georgia, all five 4-H centers, with annual visitors reaching 38,000, will
be utilized in this project. New water-saving technology will be implemented and
4-H visitors will be encouraged to bring their learning back home with them to
implement in their communities.

Oklahoma:

* Ten counties are constructing various water harvesting and saving systems,
from six thousand gallon rain barrels, to drip irrigation in community gardens.
These large-scale projects are leading to learning that youth and community
members can take home with them to implement on a smaller scale.

Wisconsin:

* For this project, Wisconsin is building ten rain gardens across the state with
4-H youth, with a goal of saving at least 120,000 gallons of water. Along with
the rain gardens, youth will learn how to build rain barrels to water their
gardens, saving even more water along the way.

&lt;p&gt;Presentation "Colors Outside the Lines" of Typical Web Services Interoperability
Testing
WAKEFIELD, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
The Web Services Interoperability Organization (WS-I; http://www.ws-i.org) today
announced that Christopher Ferris will speak on its behalf at the Software
Testing Analysis &amp; Review Conference (STARWEST; http://www.sqe.com/starwest/) to
be held in Anaheim, California, October 5-9. 

WS-I is an open industry organization chartered to establish and document Best
Practices for Web Services interoperability. Ferris, an IBM Distinguished
Engineer, is CTO of Industry Standards, Software Group Standards Strategy
organization. 

Ferris` presentation, "Coloring Outside the Lines: Web Services Interoperability
Testing," will illustrate how WS-I testing tools can help determine when Web
services implementations exceed what the Web services community has agreed upon
as the foundations for interoperability. The session, scheduled for 3 p.m. on
Wednesday, October 7, will show attendees how to go beyond the test designs of
conventional applications to help ensure that their Web services operate as
expected. 

"Web services interoperability testing is complex, subjective and unlike
traditional testing in many ways, and WS-I's carefully developed materials and
tools can be of significant assistance," said Ferris. "The STARWEST attendees in
particular will appreciate the value of assessing specific Web services
instances against the WS-I Profiles requirements to ensure that they can
interoperate with other conformant services." 

Involved in the architecture, design and engineering of distributed systems for
most of his 25-plus-year career in IT, Ferris is also actively engaged in open
standards development for XML and Web services. He currently represents IBM as
an alternate on the WS-I Board of Directors. He is the former chair of the WS-I
Basic Profile WG, and he served as editor for the WS-I Basic Profile 1.2 and
2.0. He co-chaired the W3C Web Services Policy WG and served as chair of the W3C
XML Protocols WG. In addition to representing IBM on the OASIS WS-RX TC, Ferris
is a former elected member of the OASIS Technical Advisory Board (TAB).

&lt;p&gt;Sept 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded U.S chemicals
maker DuPont (DD.N) to "neutral" from "buy," saying the shares
appear fairly valued at current levels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Analyst Robert Koort noted that DuPont shares have risen
nearly 89 percent in the past six months, significantly
outperforming the SP 500 .SPX and chemical sector average.
The SP 500 has risen 50 percent over the last six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We attribute DuPont's outperformance to strong signs of
recovery in its key end markets including auto, housing, and
electronics leading to more inspiring earnings rebound
prospects," Koort said in a research note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Increased investor confidence in the company's cost cutting
efforts and the appeal of DuPont's healthy dividend yield of 5
percent also contributed to the recent rally in the company's
shares, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While we expect improving incremental margins as the global
economy turns, we believe the stock now effectively discounts
the pending recovery, Koort said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst also said he believes Dow Chemical Co (DOW.N)
offers investors the best cyclical leverage and more attractive
incremental margin potential.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; DuPont shares were trading down 2 percent at $31.15, while
Dow shares were up almost 3 percent at $22.44 in morning trade
on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Dish Network Corp (DISH.O) to "sell" from "neutral," and said the company faces the most difficult operating trajectory amongst the cable and satellite companies under its coverage. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;    Goldman also said that the company has routinely shown an appetite to spend on initiatives with unproven near to medium-term returns. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Capital allocation remains a significant question mark, as we do not believe a bull case around free cash flow yield can be relied on by investors," it added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Dish also continues to be distracted by its ongoing litigation with TiVo Inc (TIVO.O). &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Earlier this month, a U.S. district court awarded TiVo nearly $200 million in damages in its long-running patent case with Dish and EchoStar Corp (SATS.O). [nN04180323] &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    The brokerage, which assumed coverage of U.S. cable and satellite sector with a "cautious" view, also upgraded Time Warner Cable Inc (TWC.N) to "neutral" from "sell." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    "Among cable operators, we believe Time Warner Cable offers an interesting opportunity for shareholder returns given its free cash flow generation ability," Goldman said in a note to clients. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    Shares of Dish Network were trading down 14 cents at $17.05 Wednesday morning on Nasdaq, while those of Time Warner were up 67 cents at $38.59 on the New York Stock Exchange. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Shrutika Verma in Bangalore; Editing by Maju Samuel) &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ((shrutika.verma@thomsonreuters.com; within US +1 646 223 8780; outside U.S +91 80 4135 5800; Reuters Messaging shrutika.verma.reuters.com@reuters.net)) Keywords: DISH/RESEARCH GOLDMAN  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(C) Reuters 2009.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 9 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities upgraded United
Parcel Service Inc (UPS.N) to "overweight" from "neutral,"
saying there was a significant upside potential for the stock
as it does not fully reflect anticipation of a turn in the
economy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "UPS stock has lagged too much, and the stock does not
reflect the boost a turn in the U.S. economy would provide to
UPS earnings performance and to the stock," analyst Thomas
Wadewitz wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; UPS shares were up $1.20 at $55.30 in early trade Wednesday
on the New York Stock Exchange. The shares have gained 5
percent in the last three months, trailing the broader SP Air
Freight  Logistics Index .GSPAC that gained 9 percent during
the period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "While underperformance versus higher beta names makes
sense to some extent, we believe that UPS' earnings will
respond earlier in the cycle relative to many industrials, and
the underperformance appears overdone," Wadewitz wrote.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is room for UPS shares to reflect a stronger
expectation of a turn in cycle in order to be consistent with
the anticipation reflected in other industrial and transport
stocks, the analyst said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Incremental demand improvement trends seen in rail weekly
volumes, International Air Transport Association monthly
freight data and truckload company comments, together with
likely improvement in parcel express volumes, will also help
UPS, the analyst said in the note.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Chief Executive LLoyd Blankfein urged policymakers keen to rebuild confidence in financial markets to refrain from creating a system "designed solely around protecting us from the 100-year storm."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although the economic shocks in the wake of the collapse of Lehman Brothers almost a year ago bring about a natural desire for wholesale reform, "taking risk completely out of the system will be at the cost of economic growth," Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We know from economic history that innovation and the new industries and new jobs that result from it require risk taking," he said in remarks prepared for delivery at a banking conference in Germany's financial capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He acknowledged that the financial industry had let the growth and complexity of new instruments "outstrip their economic and social utility as well as the operational capacity to manage them."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But reforms should aim to retain the economically viable attributes of markets while mitigating systemic risk by introducing the right infrastructure and incentives, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman supports a move to bring derivatives out of the so-called "shadow banking" world by trading them on exchanges and clearing the trades via centralized clearing houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This would increase transparency for the products that are mostly traded bilaterally and force market participants to enforce margin requirements, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This will do more to enhance price discovery and reduce systemic risk than perhaps any specific rule or regulation," Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Banks should also seek to use standardized, rather than customized, products whenever possible, he said, adding that customized derivatives should need higher capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some aspects of the market -- such as credit default swaps -- were good, Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blankfein suggested that regulators ensure that exposures of a financial institution should be reflected on their balance sheet, abolishing off-balance sheet investment vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He urged financial firms to use fair value accounting methods to measure potential exposures. By forcing financial institutions to recognize losses immediately, risks to the system would become visible sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Instead, positions were not visible, so they were often ignored -- as were the risks -- until the losses grew to a point that solvency became an issue," Blankfein told bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Regulators needed to be more proactive in talking with market participants about where they see concentrations in risk, and to improve coordination on a national and international level, Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Turf battles between regulators shouldn't be allowed to overwhelm a focus on what's in the system's best interest," Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Anger over compensation was in many respects "understandable and appropriate," Blankfein said, adding that Goldman had a clawback tool which let the firm get back some of the bonuses paid if reputational or financial damage ensued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Multi-year guaranteed employment contracts should be banned entirely. The use of these contracts unfortunately is a common practice in our industry," Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Multi-year contracts are "bad for the long-term interests of our industry and the financial system," he said, adding that bankers need to do a better job of understanding when incentives begin to work against the public interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Goldman Sachs CEO says risk taking required&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says guaranteed bonuses bad for the financial system&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says financial instruments too complex to manage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Says aspects of markets that work need to be retained&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Adds quotes and background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FRANKFURT, Sept 9 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) Chief
Executive LLoyd Blankfein urged policymakers keen to rebuild
confidence in financial markets to refrain from creating a
system "designed solely around protecting us from the 100-year
storm."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Although the economic shocks in the wake of the collapse of
Lehman Brothers almost a year ago bring about a natural desire
for wholesale reform, "taking risk completely out of the system
will be at the cost of economic growth," Blankfein said.     &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We know from economic history that innovation and the new
industries and new jobs that result from it require risk
taking," he said in remarks prepared for delivery at a banking
conference in Germany's financial capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He acknowledged that the financial industry had let the
growth and complexity of new instruments "outstrip their
economic and social utility as well as the operational capacity
to manage them".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But reforms should aim to retain the economically viable
attributes of markets while mitigating systemic risk by
introducing the right infrastructure and incentives, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman supports a move to bring derivatives out of the
so-called "shadow banking" world by trading them on exchanges
and clearing the trades via centralised clearing houses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This would increase transparency for the products that are
mostly traded bilaterally and force market participants to
enforce margin requirements, he added. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "This will do more to enhance price discovery and reduce
systemic risk than perhaps any specific rule or regulation,"
Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Banks should also seek to use standardised, rather than
customised, products whenever possible, he said, adding that
customised derivatives should need higher capital requirements.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some aspects of the market -- such as credit default swaps
-- were good, Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Blankfein suggested that regulators ensure that exposures of
a financial institution should be reflected on their balance
sheet, abolishing off-balance sheet investment vehicles.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; He urged financial firms to use fair value accounting
methods to measure potential exposures. By forcing financial
institutions to recognise losses immediately, risks to the
system would become visible sooner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Instead, positions were not visible, so they were often
ignored -- as were the risks -- until the losses grew to a point
that solvency became an issue," Blankfein told bankers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regulators needed to be more proactive in talking with
market participants about where they see concentrations in risk,
and to improve coordination on a national and international
level, Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Turf battles between regulators shouldn't be allowed to
overwhelm a focus on what's in the system's best interest,"
Blankfein said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Anger over compensation was in many respects "understandable
and appropriate", Blankfein said, adding that Goldman had a
clawback tool which let the firm get back some of the bonuses
paid if reputational or financial damage ensued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Multi-year guaranteed employment contracts should be banned
entirely. The use of these contracts unfortunately is a common
practice in our industry," Blankfein said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Multi-year contracts are "bad for the long-term interests of
our industry and the financial system", he said, adding that

&lt;p&gt;Sept 9 (Reuters) - JMP Securities upgraded Goldman Sachs
Group Inc (GS.N) to "market outperform" from "market perform,"
and said it expects the company's fixed income segment to
benefit from less competition.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The competitive landscape has changed dramatically with the
elimination of Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns, as well as
massive downsizing in fixed income at UBS (UBSN.VX) and
Citigroup Inc (C.N), analyst Michael Hecht said in a note to
clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe it will now take more time than we previously
expected for key competitors to re-risk and rebuild their fixed
income businesses than previously anticipated," Hecht said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; With an improved macroeconomic outlook, the analyst said
Goldman should see significant growth in its equity sales and
trading, prime brokerage, asset management, principal
investing, underwriting, and mergers and acquisition segments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman currently has excess liquidity of $171 billion on
which the company is earning very low interest rates, Hecht
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With this much dry powder, once Goldman resumes its
buyback (which we expect by early 2010 at the latest), this
could prove to be a significant return on tangible equity
enhancer," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the second half of 2009, the analyst sees Goldman
earning $10.60 per share, up from his prior view of $8.14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company were up 73 cents at $167.95 in
trading before the bell on Wednesday. They closed at $167.22 on
Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For related alerts, please double-click [ID:nWNAB7716]

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
J.P. Morgan announced today the formation of the Prime-Custody Solutions Group,
a team responsible for delivering the firm`s integrated prime brokerage and
custody platform to clients. The unit will serve hedge funds and asset managers
seeking a combination of prime brokerage capabilities and securities services. 

"Challenging market conditions have underscored the importance of partnering
with a prime brokerage that can safeguard assets in a separate depository," said
Devon George-Eghdami, managing director and head of the new unit. "Building on
our industry-leading prime brokerage and custody businesses, we are expanding
our product offering and delivering those shared benefits to clients in a more
efficient manner," she said. 

George-Eghdami, previously the head of Hybrid Capital Trading, is based in New
York and will report jointly to Michael Minikes, CEO of J.P. Morgan Clearing
Corp. within Prime Services, and Sandie O`Connor, global head of Financing and
Markets Products within Treasury &amp; Securities Services. 

J.P. Morgan`s creation of the Prime-Custody Solutions Group comes at a time when
hedge funds are launching long-only funds and seeking structures that allow them
to house certain assets with custodians, while traditional asset managers are
executing long/short strategies that require financing through a prime broker.
Among other benefits, J.P. Morgan`s integrated approach is designed to
streamline client onboarding, improve execution and collateral management,
reduce financing costs, and consolidate reporting. 

Since 1997, Bear Stearns was one of the only prime brokers that had offered
custody benefits to clients. Since being acquired by J.P. Morgan, the prime
brokerage has thrived. Clients now have access to the products and trading
capabilities of J.P. Morgan`s Investment Bank as well as Treasury &amp; Securities
Services` custody, fund services and agency lending offerings. J.P. Morgan`s
Treasury &amp; Securities Services division houses $13.7 trillion in assets under
custody. 

J.P. Morgan`s prime brokerage and custody businesses are widely recognized as
industry leaders. The firm received 75 "Best in Class" awards and nine "Top
Ratings" in Global Custodian`s 2009 Prime Brokerage Survey, as voted on by
investors. Additionally, Eurekahedge named J.P. Morgan the #1 prime brokerage in
North America earlier this year, based on a 19% market share of assets under
management. Also in 2009, J.P. Morgan was named Global Custodian of the Year and
Fund Administrator of the Year: Europe by ICFA Magazine, Securities Lending
Manager of the Year by Global Pensions, and Best Overall Hedge Fund Administator
by HFMWeek. 

JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) is a leading global financial services firm

estimated at 350 million barrels. 

"Today`s announcement further demonstrates the depth of Chevron`s upstream

suppliers to complete the manufacture of key multi-million dollar project
components," said Ali Moshiri, president of Chevron Africa and Latin America

&lt;p&gt;Luncheon Seminars Scheduled for Irvine, CA and San Diego, CA
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Lieberman Software Corporation, in conjunction with Microsoft and Lumension,
will present "Securing Your Infrastructure: Privileged Identity Management &amp;
Data Protection" in Irvine, CA on October 8, 2009 and San Diego, CA on October
9, 2009. The seminars will provide insights for IT professionals and executives
looking to improve data security, deliver efficient access control, and lower
the cost of regulatory compliance in their Microsoft infrastructure. 

During these luncheon seminars Windows security experts will show how Microsoft
System Center, when combined with security management solutions from Lieberman
Software and Lumension, can enable an organization to:

* Improve security by assuring that only authorized individuals can access
sensitive data whenever there are new hardware and application deployments or
changes in staff job roles; 
* Protect corporate assets by strengthening the security of so-called
"super-user" credentials present on every server, workstation, database,
application and network appliance. 
* Raise IT staff efficiency by extending the Microsoft management infrastructure
to automate data protection and privileged account management workloads; 
* Reduce the cost to comply with major regulatory compliance mandates including
Sarbanes-Oxley, PCI DSS, HIPAA and more.

Lieberman Software developed Enterprise Random Password Manager, the first
privileged identity management solution to fully integrate with Microsoft System
Center. This integration allows IT staff to monitor and control all of their
organization's privileged account credentials in the familiar System Center
interface, reduce the threat of data breaches caused by insecure credentials and
the risks of failed compliance audits. 

"IT professionals who manage large, multi-platform enterprises are challenged by
a constant threat of new security vulnerabilities that can expose important
data, cause system instability and extended downtime, and violate compliance
mandates," said Jane Grafton, director of business development at Lieberman
Software. "These professionals need to remain current on the most advanced
solutions and methods for securing the powerful privileged accounts that control
access to IT resources. Our joint seminar with Lumension and Microsoft provides
this information." 

The Irvine seminar will occur on October 8 from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM PST.
Registration is available here. The San Diego seminar is scheduled for October 9
from 10:00 AM to 12:30 PM PST, and registration can be found here.

&lt;p&gt;The CoSign&#174; digital signature platform enables compliant signature-based
approvals within SharePoint workflows. The newly released CoSign for SharePoint
module further extends the capabilities of SharePoint by enabling list items,
document libraries and PDF signing within the familiar SharePoint interface.
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
ARX, Inc., a leading provider of digital signature solutions (standard
electronic signatures), announced today the release of the second generation of
the CoSign for SharePoint module. The product is an advanced functionality
plug-in that has been developed with WSS3.0 SDK. It is seamlessly integrated
with both Windows SharePoint Services (WSS) and Microsoft Office SharePoint
Server (MOSS), enabling out-of-the-box deployments. 

The CoSign Central digital signature platform integrates with SharePoint
seamlessly and enhances SharePoint`s capabilities by enabling it to provide
compliant signature-based approvals within workflows (which SharePoint calls
"Collect Signatures" workflow). CoSign Central provides digital certificates
(digital IDs) for end-users through a centralized network-attached appliance,
including centralized control over authorized signers (through Microsoft Active
Directory&#174; or other directory services). When implemented with SharePoint,
CoSign Central features appear as a natural part of the familiar SharePoint and
Microsoft Office interface. 

CoSign is the most widely-deployed SharePoint-integrated digital signature
solution on the market, with dozens of SharePoint integrated installations and
10s of thousands of users so far. Ensuring compliance with rigorous standards of
the most tightly regulated industries and geographies, CoSign enables
organizations to take full advantage of their investment in Microsoft SharePoint
2007, eliminating the need to reintroduce paper for signature based approvals.

Thenewly released CoSign digital signature for SharePoint module provides all
the benefits of the CoSign Central infrastructure (i.e., workflow integration,
signer control, enhanced security, and external trust) within the SharePoint
environment. In addition, CoSign for SharePoint enables users to digitally sign
PDF documents hosted on SharePoint Document Libraries and SharePoint List items
centrally located on the SharePoint server via the SharePoint web-based user
interface, without requiring the user to check the documents out to a local PC.

signature-based approval workflows within SharePoint. 

"Being pioneers in integrating a compliant digital signature solution into
SharePoint has provided us with insights into the need for digitally signing
PDF`s, lists and libraries from within the SharePoint environment," said Gadi
Aharoni, CEO of ARX."We`re proud to be the first in the market to extend
SharePoint`s capabilities with these useful features."

&lt;p&gt;  SAN JOSE, CA, Sep 09 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Xsigo Systems, Inc., the technology leader in data center I/O
virtualization, today announced that it has joined the Microsoft System
Center Alliance Program to enhance and support Microsoft System Center
Virtual Machine Manager 2008 (VMM). Xsigo will extend VMM management
capabilities, allowing customers to monitor and manage network and
storage connections, eliminate performance bottlenecks, and optimize
virtual machine placement -- all from within the Microsoft management
framework.

    "By extending the flexibility and enterprise-scalability of Microsoft
System Center Virtual Machine Manager, Xsigo virtual I/O helps further
reduce costs and centralize management of both the physical and virtual IT
infrastructure," said JD Marymee, director of strategic partner alliances,
Management and Services Division, Microsoft. "We are pleased to work with
Xsigo to extend the capabilities of the System Center solutions and help
our mutual customers further improve data center efficiency."

    The objective of Xsigo's partnership with System Center Alliance is to
extend the capabilities of Microsoft's System Center products by providing
continuous monitoring and proactive management for server connectivity. As
the program's first I/O virtualization provider, Xsigo is uniquely
positioned to monitor network and storage connections and to recommend
parameters such as optimal virtual machine placement and quality of
service settings to help ensure application performance and availability.

    The Microsoft System Center Alliance selects partners with the best
knowledge of specific applications, platforms, systems, or devices, and
then provides the framework to embed that knowledge into System Center
products. As an innovator in I/O virtualization, Xsigo offers a unique
platform to enhance System Center Products and to ensure that customers
have a holistic solution for managing their environment.

    "IT managers must assimilate huge amounts of information and make critical
operating decisions, sometimes in seconds. The System Center Alliance
provides a unique opportunity to assist those managers with real-time
recommendations," said Bruce Fingles, Xsigo's vice president of product
management and IT. "By joining the System Center Alliance, Xsigo can now
give IT managers the tools and information they need, from within the VMM
framework, to optimize data center operations by making well-informed
decisions about infrastructure management."

    Xsigo's flagship product, the Xsigo I/O Director, is purpose built to
deliver dynamic connectivity, allowing data center users to connect any
server to any network or storage device in seconds, without the
restrictions of I/O cards, cables, and switch ports. Benefits of the
solution include:


--  Dynamically configures storage and network connectivity to any server
    in real-time
--  Provides 1G Ethernet, 10G Ethernet, and Fibre Channel connections
--  Eliminates 70% of the cards, cables and switch ports
--  Reduces I/O capital costs by 50%
--  Allows connectivity changes to be completed in seconds rather than
    hours or days
    

    
Xsigo virtual I/O also eliminates performance bottlenecks with dynamic
bandwidth allocation that delivers performance on-demand to I/O
connections over a high-speed 20Gbs fabric. Embedded quality-of-service
features enhance application performance by reducing the risk of I/O
resource contention.

Toshiba to Outsource Chipmaking

The technology leader in high definition products and the world's no. 2
manufacturer of NAND flash memory chips, Toshiba Corp., plans to outsource a
part of the production of its next-generation 28-nanometer (nm) system chips.
Toshiba currently manufactures chips at its plant in Oita, southern Japan and
plans to outsource to expand its production if capacity is insufficient. 

According to sources, Toshiba is holding discussion with Singapore`s Chartered
Semiconductor Manufacturing Ltd. (Nasdaq: CHRT) and Advanced Micro Devices
(NYSE: AMD) to spin off Globalfoundries Inc. and proceed with its outsourcing
plan. This will help the company to reduce costs and fulfill customer supply
orders. 

Last year, Toshiba formed a joint venture with Sony (NYSE: SNE) and SCEI
(Toshiba owned 60% while Sony and SCEI owned 20% each) for the production of
high-performance semiconductors, which include the Cell/B.E. processor, the RSX
graphics engine and SoCs (System-on-Chip) for applications in digital consumer
products. Moreover, to ramp up chip production, it bought Sony`s SoC line for
about 90 billion yen ($968 million). 

Toshiba competes with International Business Machines (NYSE: IBM), which has
technology alliances with Chartered Semiconductor, Globalfoundries, Infineon
Technologies, Samsung Electronics, NEC Electronics and STMicroelectronics (NYSE:
STM) for developing 28 nm chips.

&lt;p&gt;Unprecedented Event Hits New York and Los Angeles Nov. 25-Dec. 13, 2009,
Celebrating Disney`s Newest Animated Musical "The Princess and The Frog"

Bicoastal Event to Feature Film Screening and Once-in-a-Lifetime Experience with
Disney`s Nine Princesses, Plus Games, Disney Movie Archives and How-to
Presentations from Disney Animators
BURBANK, Calif. &amp; NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
In celebration of Disney`s newest animated musical "The Princess and The Frog,"
Walt Disney Studios is opening its Burbank gates to the public for a
once-in-a-lifetime advance special engagement, welcoming Disney fans to
experience its newest animated musical comedy Nov. 25-Dec. 13, 2009. The advance
special engagement will also be featured in Clearview`s historic Ziegfeld
Theatre in New York City. Following the film, fans on both coasts will also be
treated to The Ultimate Disney Experience, an exciting extravaganza that will
feature-for the first time ever-all nine of the Disney princesses (including the
film`s Princess Tiana, Disney`s newest princess), as well as exciting Bayou
games, movie archives, how-to presentations from Disney animators, Studio tours
(for L.A. guests) and more. Tickets went on sale at midnight last night. 

"We`re welcoming families to our Studio to see where Walt Disney made real movie
magic," said Dick Cook, chairman of The Walt Disney Studios. "Our Studio is not
open to the public, so it`s an unprecedented opportunity for Disney fans to
experience a movie right here on the Disney lot where we`ve filmed Disney
classics like `Mary Poppins,` `Princess Diaries,` `Pirates of the Caribbean` and
many more. In fact, Walt built the original theater on the Studio lot back in
1940; it opened just in time for special audiences to view his `Fantasia.` With
a newly renovated, state-of-the-art theater, the Studio will open its gates once
again, inviting audiences to not only see our newest animated musical, but to
take part in a one-of-a-kind experience after the movie. We`re bringing the same
exciting experience to New York City at the historic Ziegfeld Theatre and
Roseland Ballroom." 

Themed to the film`s setting, New Orleans, The Ultimate Disney Experience will
feature something for the whole family.

* PRINCESS POWER -- All nine of the Disney princesses will come together for the
first time ever, welcoming Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Cinderella, Belle,
Ariel, Pocahontas, Jasmine, Mulan and of course, Disney`s newest princess,
Tiana. 
* FUN `N GAMES -- The Experience will feature opportunities to swing on ropes,
climb trees, play games and race through the Bayou Adventure, plus a New
Orleans`s Bead Toss, Naveen`s Leap Frog, video games and more. 
* HOLLYWOOD HEIRLOOMS -- Disney movie archives will be on display for the first

&lt;p&gt;TELLURIDE, Colo. (Hollywood Reporter) - The turmoil at Walt Disney Studios during the past two decades is a great subject for a documentary, and a pair of insiders have delivered a surprisingly hard-hitting and revealing study with "Waking Sleeping Beauty."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic is a bit specialized to draw a wide audience, but those who see the movie will definitely enjoy the intrigue depicted.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the early 1980s, the Mouse Factory was a pretty moribund operation. Walt Disney himself had lost interest in animation during the last years of his life, when he became obsessed with the studio's theme parks and live-action movies like "Mary Poppins." After Walt's death in 1966, the studio muddled along, but by the time the studio released the disastrous "Black Cauldron" in 1985, some were questioning whether the empire would survive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Walt's nephew, Roy E. Disney, decided to shake up the company by bringing in new blood, and that is how Michael Eisner, Frank Wells and Jeffrey Katzenberg ended up on Dopey Drive. The film touches on the company's successful ventures into adult comedies like "Down and Out in Beverly Hills," but the main emphasis of the doc is on the animation renaissance that really took hold with the release of "The Little Mermaid" in 1989.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Don Hahn, who directed the movie, and Peter Schneider, who produced, were both top dogs at Disney in the '80s and '90s, so they bring their firsthand knowledge to bear. The film depends on reminiscences from many of the players, including Katzenberg, Eisner and Roy Disney. Hahn also decided to avoid talking-head interviews; instead, we hear the voices of the interviewees over actual footage from the period being described. Somehow, Hahn and Schneider persuaded Eisner and Katzenberg to share their opinions of the other, which certainly are not flattering but might have mellowed a bit with the passage of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among the highlights of the film are the caricatures done by the Disney animators of all the squabbling principals, including Schneider. The film's point of view is that the Disney renaissance culminated with the making of "The Lion King," the most successful picture in the studio's history, which Katzenberg opposed at the outset. The film also suggests that the helicopter-crash death in 1994 of CEO Frank Wells, who helped to temper the fierce egos at the studio, led to the company's gradual decline. Some might question that judgment, but it receives a convincing airing here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The portraits of all the principals are surprisingly rounded. The most poignant sections are devoted to Howard Ashman, the lyricist of "Mermaid," "Beauty and the Beast" and "Aladdin," who died in 1991 of AIDS. In the film's view, he was one of the unheralded but dominant figures in the studio's creative resurgence. Although the footage isn't always of the best technical quality, the editing by Ellen Keneshea, Vartan Nazarian and John Damien Ryan helps to provide the needed energy. "Beauty" might not be the last word on the Disney animation wars, but it's a most entertaining and enlightening intro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by DGoodman at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO (Reuters) - Hershey Co (HSY.N) could make a bid to take over British-based chocolate and chewing-gum maker Cadbury PLC CBRY.L without the Milton Hershey Trust having to give up its controlling stake in the U.S. company, J.P. Morgan said in a research note on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"While we continue to regard Hershey as an unlikely bidder for Cadbury, an offer from the Pennsylvania chocolate maker is not out of the question," analyst Terry Bivens wrote in a research note.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cadbury is in play after Kraft Foods Inc KFT.N disclosed on Monday that it had proposed an offer then valued at $16.7 billion for Cadbury -- an offer Cadbury's board rejected. The value of that offer has declined some this week, as Kraft's shares have fallen and the British pound has appreciated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One potential outlet for Cadbury has been seen as a tie-up with Hershey. But the Hershey Trust, which holds a majority of the voting shares in Hershey, has said that it is required to keep control of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A source familiar with the situation told Reuters on Tuesday that JPMorgan (JPM.N) was advising Hershey on a possible strategy regarding Cadbury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hershey couldn't immediately be reached for comment on Thursday and has in the past declined comment on Cadbury.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his note, Bivens said that Hershey could issue as many as 460 million shares of Class A stock without compromising the trust's majority position, which is based heavily on Class B super-voting shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For example, an 800-pence bid from Hershey, or roughly 8 percent higher than Kraft's initial proposal, could consist of roughly $6 billion in cash and, at an assumed Hershey share price of $33, entail the issuance of some 362 million shares of Common A," Bivens wrote. "The resultant cash EPS dilution, however, would be a considerable 22 cents in 2010, but turn accretive in 2011, by our numbers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hershey shares were down 26 cents or 0.6 percent at $40.23 on the New York Stock Exchange. Kraft fell 60 cents or 2.2 percent to $26.25; the shares traded at $28.32 on September 4, the trading day before its bid for Cadbury was disclosed. In London, Cadbury shares were down 0.5 percent at 782 pence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Brad Dorfman, editing by Gerald E. McCormick)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;  PHOENIX, AZ, Sep 10 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
NASCAR enthusiasts Jami and Jack Prince live only 45 minutes down the
road from NASCAR driver Michael Waltrip, yet they may as well live worlds
apart. However the Princes will soon get to experience Michael's world
firsthand and Michael theirs, thanks to Best Western's second annual "Fan
Swap" when they will swap jobs with each other for a day.

    Jami and Jack Prince of Tega Cay, S.C., outbid dozens on eBay to earn this
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work at Michael Waltrip Racing for a day
and then travel with the team to the races in Richmond with a top bid of
$5,515. Organized by Best Western International, The Official Hotel of
NASCAR(R), and Michael Waltrip Racing, the "Fan Swap" charity auction
benefits World Vision, Best Western's official charity partner dedicated
to alleviating the causes of poverty and injustice among children and
families around the world.

    "We are huge Michael Waltrip fans and cannot wait to see what it takes for
him and his team to run Michael Waltrip Racing and race every weekend in a
different part of the country," said Jami Prince. "We are even more
excited to have Michael come down to visit us and see how we live and
work. I'm certain he will have a fun, yet challenging time taking care of
our two kids and running the house while I'm at work -- I just hope he
knows how to cook!"

    As part of their prize, the Princes will spend a day at Raceworld USA, the
headquarters of Michael Waltrip Racing in Cornelius, N.C., working as
Michael would for the day. The duo will get to experience the inner
workings of owning a race team and all the work that goes into preparing
for race weekend. At Raceworld, they'll enjoy an exclusive tour of
Waltrip's private office and pick-up some official Michael Waltrip racing
gear. Later that day, Jami and Jack will travel with the whole race team
to Richmond, Va., where they will stay at a Best Western hotel for the
weekend and get VIP treatment at the September 11th and 12th races.

    In return, Waltrip will travel to the Prince's hometown and "swap" jobs
with Jami and Jack Prince and work as both a retired stay-at-home dad and
a new home realtor for a day. Part of Michael's duties will include
escorting prospective home buyers around in the Best Western No.99 street
car and showing them a model home. The "swap" will also consist of Michael
picking up the Prince's children from school in the street car and helping
them with their homework when they get home from school.

    "Swapping jobs with fans is a fun experience for me," said Michael
Waltrip. "If there's one thing that's been important to me over the course
of my career, it's been the ability to personally interact with fun and
loyal fans. The Best Western 'Fan Swap' gives me the opportunity each year
to get to know my fans a little better, as well as give back to a good
cause."

    All proceeds from the "Fan Swap" auction will be used to purchase
backpacks and school supplies through World Vision's SchoolTools program.
Best Western's owners and staff will pack the backpacks during their
annual convention this fall, and distribute to children in need
throughout the United States.

&lt;p&gt;IBM Statement of Direction for ESCON Heightens Requirement for I/O Planning 
BOULDER, Colo.--(Business Wire)--
Optica Technologies ("Optica") announces that it is collaborating with IBM to
promote an infrastructure simplification and planning approach known as Managed
Evolution for System z. Managed Evolution enables customers to invest in the
latest System z technology, FICON, while preserving the ability to connect their
mainframes to existing, mature storage and communications devices that require
the older ESCON and bus/tag channel protocols. By leveraging the principles of
Managed Evolution, System z users can create a cost-effective and flexible
infrastructure and maintain the mature devices essential for driving stable,
cash-generating business applications. 

IBM announced on April 28, 2009 its intent to phase out the availability of the
older ESCON channels on System z. System z10 EC and System z10 BC will be the
last servers to support greater than 240 ESCON channels. This announcement
elevates the importance of System z infrastructure planning to ensure a smooth
transition from the older to the newer technology for host to device
connectivity. 

Optica`s exclusive Prizm FICON to ESCON Converter ("Prizm") is the
implementation platform for Managed Evolution. Prizm is an inline appliance that
provides the physical and logical connection of the older ESCON and
bus/tag-based devices to FICON channel infrastructures. Optica recently
completed rigorous interoperability testing in IBM`s Poughkeepsie solutions lab
with Prizm receiving a comprehensive qualification for attachment to all ESCON
device types. 

Michael Dailey, Vice President of Worldwide Sales for Optica, said, "Optica has
enjoyed a long-term strategic relationship with IBM. We're delighted to
collaborate with the System z brand to help customers design and deploy
current-generation dynamic infrastructures. Now that Optica has received the
most extensive IBM qualification available for third-party solutions, customers
can confidently leverage Prizm to support a wide variety of mature devices that
remain crucial to their unique business requirements." 

Mark Anzani, VP and Chief Technology Officer, System z, made the following
comments: "As customer infrastructures evolve, conditioning the environment to
support the deployment of new technology in a seamless manner is critical.
Customers need to evaluate a variety of variables including physical
infrastructure, data models, application placement, structure and workload
trends to manage this transition effectively. Our strategic cooperation with
Optica allows our mainframe customers to leverage all of the benefits of FICON
on System z while maintaining access to ESCON devices that are required to
support key applications. Working closely with Optica, we're helping customers
simplify the transition to new System z platforms, while maximizing the value of
their investment in peripheral devices."

&lt;p&gt;First Set-Top Boxes Based on Sigma`s SMP8654 Will Be Delivered by Samsung
MILPITAS, Calif. &amp; AMSTERDAM--(Business Wire)--
Samsung Electronics and Sigma Designs (Nasdaq: SIGM), a leader in digital media
processing SoCs for consumer electronics, today jointly announced that Samsung
will be delivering the SMT-E7200 line of set-top box products, based around
Sigma`s SMP8654 media processor system-on-chip (SoC), and supporting Microsoft`s
Mediaroom client. 

The new SMT-E7200 from Samsung ushers in a new generation of IPTV set-top boxes
which provide a substantial improvement in performance and cost-effectiveness.
These set-top boxes are initially targeted for deployment in Europe and are
currently being integrated to run the Microsoft Mediaroom client. 

"Samsung`s top goal is to ensure satisfied telco operators by providing the
highest quality and performance available in a Mediaroom set-top box," said Mr.
Hee-Won Park, vice president of digital set-top box R, Samsung Electronics.
"Microsoft has established a unique level of quality and service with its
Mediaroom IPTV platform, as their top tier telco customer base indicates. By
using Sigma`s SMP8654 SoC, our SMT-E7200 set-top box delivers an outstanding
high definition user experience along with the dependability of the number one
component supplier to this market." 

Sigma`s SMP8654 builds on the successful legacy of its predecessor, the SMP8634.
With over 50% more processing power, lower cost, and an enhanced set of
peripherals, the SMP8654 represents a "second-generation" SoC for the Mediaroom
ecosystem. 

"We are proud of the success we have achieved with Microsoft and are excited to
be working together with Samsung, one of the world`s foremost manufacturers of
consumer products and solutions," said Ken Lowe, vice president of strategic
marketing, Sigma Designs. "We believe that Samsung has the business and
technical strengths to become a substantial force in the set-top box market and
will enhance the range of solutions available for the Mediaroom ecosystem." 

Microsoft`s Mediaroom platform has achieved unparalleled success in establishing
the premier solution for IPTV deployments of all sizes. Mediaroom is the world`s
most deployed IPTV platform, with a global customer base delivering services to
more than 3.5 million subscriber households. The ongoing subscriber momentum for
Mediaroom-powered services demonstrates a growing demand from consumers for new
ways to watch TV beyond what traditional cable and satellite providers offer
today. As this demand increases, Microsoft continues to bring new life to its
vision for connected TV by unlocking additional avenues for consumers to
experience TV on their own terms. 

"We believe that a continually growing ecosystem reinforces quality of service
for Microsoft Mediaroom-powered offerings by providing service provider
customers and set-top box OEMs additional choices in SoCs," said Steve Koepp,
Sr. Manager, Business Development of Microsoft`s TV, Video &amp; Music business. 

About Sigma`s SMP8654 System-on-a-Chip Solution

Sigma`s SMP8654 media processor integrates a complete complement of
next-generation capabilities for a single-chip system-on-chip (SOC) solution
with a multi-core architecture, powerful multimedia processing, robust content
security system, and a full complement of peripherals. The SMP8654 features a
powerful 500-Mhz Mips host CPU, a second processor called the IPU for offloading
burdensome real-time tasks, and a third processor dedicated to managing security
functions. Its advanced decoder engines support high definition video decoding
of H.264 (MPEG-4 part 10), Windows Media&#174; Video 9, VC-1, MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 (part
2), the new AVS standard, and can support up to 16 independent streams on screen
in different formats. High-performance graphics acceleration, multi-standard
audio decoding, advanced display processing capabilities, and HDMI 1.3 output
round out its multimedia core. Powerful content security is ensured through a
dedicated secure processor, on-chip flash memory, and a range of digital rights
management (DRM) engines for high-speed payload decryption. Additional functions
include dual 32-bit DDR-2 memory controllers, dual Gigabit Ethernet controller,
dual USB 2.0 controller, NAND flash controller, and SATA controller provide for
a single-chip solution for most set-top boxes and consumer players.

&lt;p&gt;LAGOS, Sept 10 (Reuters) - ExxonMobil (XOM.N) has awarded a
contract to build a 500 megawatt (MW) power plant in
electricity-starved Nigeria, the local unit of the U.S. energy
firm said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The company said it also awarded a contract for a 56 km
transmission line that will convey electricity from the plant to
be built at its Qua Iboe oil export terminal in the southern
state of Akwa Ibom to the national power grid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It did not say who the contracts had been awarded to.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; When completed the plant should help ease the country's
power crisis, considered one of the main brakes on economic
growth for Africa's top oil and gas producer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The project ... demonstrates our support of increasing
power generation in Nigeria in line with the federal
government's desire to boost electricity supply," the company's
Managing Director Mark Ward said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The front-end engineering and design contract for the
project, which is a joint venture with state-run oil firm NNPC,
is expected to be completed in 12 months, ExxonMobil said,
without stating the cost.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria has been keen to raise domestic power generation
through independent power projects, but the lack of a strong
regulatory framework has attracted little new private sector
investment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the world's eighth-biggest oil exporter has recently
made increasingly strident public demands for Western oil firms
to help raise domestic gas use, saying the time has come for
companies that have seen decades of profit to help resolve its
chronic power crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation of about 140 million
people, has the capacity to generate around 3,000 MW, but
generation often plunges to less than 1,000 MW, largely due to a
lack of maintenance at power stations. South Africa, with a
third of Nigeria's population, has over 10 times the capacity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tume Ahemba; Editing by Nick Tattersall)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(For more Reuters Africa coverage and to have your say on the

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--

for 2009, Order Optimizer was selected from a field of vendors for its renowned
usability, extensive protocol library, and rapid implementation. 

Dr. Judi Binderman, interim chief medical information officer noted, "having
looked at a number of order entry systems, it was clear Order Optimizer knows
how physicians work and think. Equally important, the rapid, seven week
implementation means we will be live with a fully customized order entry
solution in Q4 of this year - much more quickly than we thought possible."

power of the secure internet to provide merged evidence-based protocols and

allows physicians to practice consistent, high quality medicine inside and
outside the hospital walls, around the clock. Additionally, Order Optimizer
helps hospitals meet the 2011 requirements of the American Recovery and
Reinvestment Act`s (ARRA) HITECH program enabling facilities to generate at
least 10% of orders electronically, achieve electronic prescribing for all order
types including medications, implement drug-drug, drug-allergy, drug-formulary
checks, record vital signs, maintain lists of current problems, active
medications, and medication allergies, and incorporate laboratory test results
into the ordering process. 

"We are pleased to partner with JPS to fulfill their top clinical priority -
giving busy doctors ease of access to merged evidence-based protocols and
clinical decision support at the point of care. Order Optimizer positions JPS to
meet its ARRA "meaningful use" milestones, without implementation risk or
capital expenditures. Web-based delivery, and continuously updated protocols are
the right answer to the very difficult topic of computerized order entry,"
states Order Optimizer President, Robert Weathersby.

How IBM will prosper following the current financial crisis and the
opportunities that this will create for other companies 

Executive Abstract

This report discusses how the current global financial crisis will affect IBM
and the rest of the IT industry. Will IBM`s position in the market be
strengthened or weakened by this crisis? What new business strategies and
tactics will IBM create? How will it respond to the collapse of major industry
segments, high levels of unemployment, and historically low level of consumer
confidence? On the other hand, how will IBM`s competitors fare? Will they gain
or lose ground? 

This report takes a detailed look at IBM and its strategies and its market
position based on a comparison to its major competitors. It provides a
historical view that covers the period 2004 to 2008 along with a projection for
2009. It also provides a forecast for the years 2010 through 2013 and describes
new business strategies. 

These comparisons are made for four enterprise products and services
categories:

* Enterprise Services includes enterprise consulting services that are generally
oriented toward IT but may also include general business consulting as provided
by IBM and its competitors included in this report. 
* Outsourcing Services includes the operation of systems and applications to
support enterprises from IBM or its competitors` data centers or at customers`
facility. 
* Application Software includes the middleware, data management, and application
software products that are provided to enterprise customers. 
* Enterprise Systems includes the hardware computing and storage systems that
include supercomputers, mainframes, servers, and storage systems. It also
includes retail point of sale (POS) systems. 
* Global Financing includes the financing of computer systems and software along
with the disposal of systems that are being replaced.

The report exmines IBM`s key strategies, including its "smart" business
strategies, its environmental sustainability and energy efficiency strategies,
and its global emerging country strategies. It discusses IBM`s position compared
to its competition in addressing the important global and emerging country
markets. The report includes a discussion of how IBM serves more than 50 of its
most important customers. 

The report also defines strategies that companies can use to compete with IBM
that include taking IBM head on along with niche and regional strategies that
focus on specific opportunity areas. The report also discusses the strategies
that IBM/s competitors in Japan can use to improve their competitiveness against
IBM. 

Section 10 includes a description of 21 of IBM`s major competitors. The
companies included were selected because they were identified by IBM or by the
author as major competitors in the enterprise IT market.

&lt;p&gt;Survey Reveals Exchange Management Issues and the Key Drivers for Exchange
Archiving
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Metalogix Software, a leading provider of email archiving solutions for
Microsoft Exchange as well as migration, management, and recovery solutions, for
Microsoft SharePoint, today announced findings from a recent survey which shows
that mailbox quotas and .PST management issues are the headaches Microsoft
Exchange administrators worry about most. The Metalogix poll, which received
participation from more than 800 administrators, asked respondents to name their
greatest challenges with their Microsoft Exchange environment, revealing the
major drivers for email archiving. 

Key findings in the Metalogix survey show that the greatest challenges
administrators have in managing Microsoft Exchange include:

* Mailbox quotas (39%) 
* .PST maintenance, proliferation, corruption and cost (37%) 
* Disaster recovery and recovery concerns (34%) 
* Exchange backups (31%) 
* Retaining emails for internal inquiries or investigations (28%) 
* Overworked and slow Exchange servers (21%)

"The results of this survey show that the proliferation of Microsoft Exchange as
today`s primary business communication infrastructure is crushing Exchange
administrators with the sheer volume of data it produces," said Chris Risley,
CEO, Metalogix. "This places tremendous burdens on both the end user and the
administrator, escalating data retention issues and driving increasing needs for
Exchange archiving solutions." 

To maintain their infrastructure and gain control over mounting storage volumes,
Exchange administrators often impose strict mailbox quotas on end users. Users
often respond by employing local .PST file storage to retain their email data.
These underground archives are not the best primary storage location for mailbox
data for a variety of reasons. PST files:

* Need to be stored locally on users` workstations 
* Are not supported over the network 
* Consume more drive space than equivalent content on an Exchange server 
* Cannot support Single Instance Storage (SIS) 
* Cannot be accessed from multiple sources simultaneously 
* Lack strong security

The proliferation of .PST files in turn creates several management issues for
Exchange administrators. The first is assuring that corporate data is protected
in the event of disaster. The second is eDiscovery readiness because .PST files
make it difficult for administrators to demonstrate compliance with government
regulations and corporate governance policies. These two issues are creating a
"perfect storm" for Exchange administrators that email archiving solutions can
defuse by protecting, retaining, discovering and recovering critical email data.


To address these issues, Metalogix offers the award-winning Professional Archive
Manager for Exchange. This powerful email archiving software solution simplifies
and speeds up the process of archiving and retrieving email. The archived emails
are as fully accessible as non-archived email with a few simple clicks.
Professional Archive manager for Exchange utilizes integrated HSM (Hierarchical
Storage Management) to direct all .PSTs, emails and their attachments to a
central storage medium. Single Instance Storage (SIS) removes duplicates, stores
the original email and its attachments onto a less expensive storage unit, and
optionally leaves behind a link on Exchange. Compression further reduces the
size of the content in the archive. Featuring fast installation, low
maintenance, and superb technical support, Metalogix Professional Archive
Manager for Exchange is the email archiving solution of choice for more than a
thousand customers and has successfully archived billions of emails.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 10 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs added Blackstone Group
(BX.N) to its "Americas conviction buy list," and raised its
price target on the asset manager's stock, citing a better MA
cycle and an improving lending and investing environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman also removed Och Ziff Capital Management (OZM.N)
from the list, but retained its "buy" rating on the company's
stock and raised its price target to $13 from $12, saying it
views trends in Och-Ziff's business as favorable and current
valuation as attractive.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the strength and consistency of Och-Ziff's
investment results throughout 2009 bodes well for the firm's
client retention and new business prospects in 2010 and beyond
as hedge fund industry flows stabilize," the brokerage said in
a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analysts at Goldman view Blackstone as capable of seizing
MA and restructuring opportunities via a growing advisory
business, and see robust earnings possibilities in its
distressed funds and fund-of-funds businesses, which they feel
are taking market share and driving assets under management
(AuM) levels higher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman expects Blackstone's advisory business to account
for about 35 percent of revenue in 2009.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Blackstone benefits from improving capital market trends...
with ample dry powder to deploy," the brokerage said, and
raised its price target on the company's stock to $18 from
$16.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Blackstone's shares were up 4 percent to $13.53 in trading
before the bell. Och-Ziff's shares closed at $11.24 on
Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Brenton Cordeiro in Bangalore; Editing by

&lt;p&gt;Chief Economist for IBM Speaks on Moving Forward in Today`s Economy at Utah
Technology Council (UTC) Breakfast Event
SALT LAKE CITY--(Business Wire)--
There is reason to be optimistic about the direction of the U.S. and world
economies, says Dr. Philip Swan, chief economist for IBM. Swan spoke to members
of the Utah Technology Council (UTC) recently to discuss the economic situation.


"The main thing I want to emphasize is that our financial system did not
collapse; it merely seized up," said Swan. "Although the current economic crisis
has caused some serious problems, it is well on its way to recovery. Key
economic indicators are beginning to show positive signs." 

Two of the indicators Swan highlighted are:

* An increase in manufacturing - Inventory liquidation is helping to increase
manufacturing. Manufacturing is the biggest and most important element in the
economy. As inventory decreases, companies are able to manufacture more of their
products. 
* Employee hours produced are up - This illustrates companies are giving the
employees they have more work hours. As these hours continue to grow, companies
will need to hire more people to accommodate these additional hours, which will
cause unemployment to decrease.

Swan also emphasized the important role IT companies will play in the economic
recovery. 

"As the economy improves, companies throughout the nation will see productivity
increase," he continued. "IT companies will play the most important role in the
recovery as they provide the lion`s share of this increased productivity to the
economy." 

Swan is responsible for interpreting the global economic outlook and its risks,
including implications for the rapidly-growing information technology industry.
He assesses the capital investment environment with focus on IT hardware,
software and services spending, including designing and conducting special
studies to assess the impact of economic issues and events of significance to
IBM. 

Dr. Swan is currently a member of the industry economics panel of the
President`s Council of Economic Advisors and chairs the business and industry
economic policy committee of the international Organization for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD). He was recently a member of the U.S. Census
Advisory Group representing the American Economic Association. 

"It is very important for Utah technology companies to know that economic
conditions are improving," said Richard Nelson, President and CEO of UTC. 

"For the most part, Utah`s tech industry has remained healthy and as a result
has built a high level of confidence in our ability to leverage our recognized
technology expertise to right the economy and increase future productivity."

Australia get developed, that would bring more than enough
supplies to meet demand," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Gorgon, which will be underpinned by 40 trillion cubic feet
of gas resources off western Australia, would be Australia's
largest-ever resources development and is expected to create
about 6,000 jobs at its peak and inject about A$33 billion ($28
billion) into the economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron has not announced an estimated cost for the

Lending up more than 50 percent to begin fueling economic recovery
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Keeping credit flowing when businesses need it most, JPMorgan Chase made
approximately $15.1 billion in loans and lines of credit to 21,000 small- and
medium-sized businesses across the U.S. during the second quarter of 2009, the
firm announced today. JPMorgan Chase is committed to helping small- and
medium-sized firms during tough economic times, as they play a pivotal role in
fueling the nation`s recovery. 

"In the second quarter, our bank increased lending to the small- and mid-sized
companies that are at the very heart of our nation`s economy," said Todd Maclin,
CEO of Commercial Banking at JPMorgan Chase. "We`re proud that thousands of
businesses across the country are putting $15 billion in new capital to work
every day, keeping their operations running, investing for the future, and
creating jobs." 

Based on the company`s preliminary data, JPMorgan Chase`s lending to small- and
mid-sized firms increased by more than 50 percent from the first quarter,
including:

* $13.5 billion for 16,451 loans to mid-sized businesses, corporations and
government and nonprofit agencies - up nearly 54%; and 
* $1.5 billion for 4,177 small business loans - an increase of 32%.

Small- and medium-sized businesses are the cornerstone of the U.S. economy. More
than 98 percent of U.S. businesses have fewer than 100 employees, according to
the U.S. Census Bureau`s most recent data. Together, these firms employ nearly
42.7 million people and pay $1.5 trillion in salaries. 

JPMorgan Chase`s lending activity to small- and medium-sized businesses reflects
a national trend for the bank, which provided approximately $150 billion in
credit to consumers, corporations, small businesses, municipalities, and
non-profits in the second quarter. 

Chase is committed to lending to the businesses that keep the American economy
running. The bank was the largest auto lender in the country for the first half
of 2009. The bank provided $5.3 billion in auto loans and leases for more than
544,000 vehicles during the second quarter of this year, helping a vital sector
of the U.S. economy recover.

&lt;p&gt;Three Deals Confirm Supply of Gorgon Gas to World`s Largest LNG Markets
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that Australian subsidiaries of
Chevron have signed three binding long-term Sales and Purchase Agreements (SPAs)
for Chevron`s share of liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the Gorgon project. The
agreements are for a total supply of nearly 3 million tons per annum (MTPA) of
LNG to Osaka Gas, Tokyo Gas, and GS Caltex. 

Chevron will supply Osaka Gas 1.375 MTPA of LNG for 25 years. Osaka Gas will
also purchase 1.25 percent equity in the Gorgon Project. Tokyo Gas will be
supplied 1.1 MTPA over 25 years and will purchase a 1 percent equity stake.
Supply from both agreements is expected to commence in the second half of 2014. 

Chevron Australia Pty Ltd and Chevron International Gas Inc., have also signed
separate agreements with GS Caltex Corp. for 0.5 MTPA of LNG for up to 20 years.
The LNG to GS Caltex will be supplied from the Gorgon project and other gas
within the global Chevron portfolio. GS Caltex is 50 percent owned by Chevron. 

"We are pleased to welcome Osaka Gas and Tokyo Gas as foundation customers and
equity participants in Gorgon. This builds upon our longstanding relationship
with these companies and represents a major step towards the successful
commercialization of the Gorgon Project," said Jim Blackwell, president, Chevron
Asia Pacific Exploration and Production Company. 

"Securing sales agreements with three major customers in Japan and Korea is a
significant milestone in Chevron`s efforts to commercialize our equity natural
gas and grow our LNG business," said John Gass, president, Chevron Global Gas. 

"With Osaka Gas and Tokyo Gas, we have as foundation customers two of the most
experienced LNG buyers in the largest LNG market in the world," Gass said. He
added, "The agreements with GS Caltex provide our initial entry into the
important Korean LNG market and GS Caltex`s first expansion from refining,
petrochemicals and power into LNG." 

Chevron expects further sales of Gorgon LNG to be executed in the coming months.


The Gorgon project is operated by Chevron Australia Pty Ltd (50 percent)* in
joint venture with the Australian subsidiaries of ExxonMobil (25 percent) and
Shell (25 percent). The project`s scope includes a three-train, 15 MTPA LNG
facility; a carbon dioxide injection project expected to be the world`s largest;
and a domestic gas plant. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who
operate across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and
transports crude oil and natural gas; refines, markets and distributes
transportation fuels and other energy products; manufactures and sells
petrochemical products; generates power and produces geothermal energy; provides

including biofuels and other renewables. Chevron is based in San Ramon, Calif.

&lt;p&gt;Company Says Decisions Regarding Cabrera`s $27 Billion Damages Report Are
Tainted and Unusable
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Lawyers for Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) have filed a motion with the Provincial
Court of Sucumbios in Ecuador to annul all rulings made by the judge who last
week stepped down from presiding over an environmental lawsuit against the
company in Lago Agrio. 

Judge Juan N&#250;&#241;ez appeared at meetings arranged by representatives of the
government and ruling Alianza PAIS party, who as part of a multi-million bribe
scheme, sought to assure prospective environmental remediation contractors that
they could get remediation work arising from an adverse judgment against
Chevron. In those meetings, Judge N&#250;&#241;ez confirmed that he would find Chevron
liable and order it to pay money to the government, even though the trial is
still ongoing and evidence is still being received. His involvement in the
meetings was revealed in video recordings made by the businessmen and released
to the public and authorities in Ecuador and the United States by Chevron last
week. 

Following release of the videos, and purportedly at the request of Prosecutor
General Washington Pesantez, Judge N&#250;&#241;ez asked to be removed from the case. 

Chevron contends that a number of Judge N&#250;&#241;ez`s rulings explicitly facilitated
and shielded from scrutiny the $27 billion damages report filed in the case by
Richard Cabrera, a mining engineer with no relevant experience in either oil
field operations or oil field remediation. Cabrera was paid by the plaintiffs
and worked closely with them in drafting his report. Chevron lawyers argue that,
among other things, N&#250;&#241;ez unjustly sided with the plaintiffs by arbitrarily
denying Chevron`s challenges to the report, preventing a rigorous examination of
the numerous fundamental flaws of the work process and research that supported
his disputed recommendations. The company asserts that the Cabrera report is not
based on valid scientific evidence or law. 

Lawyers for Chevron filed motions with the court this week to have Judge N&#250;&#241;ez`s
rulings annulled and to formally seek recognition from the court that N&#250;&#241;ez
should be recused. 

Chevron`s court filing seeking the annulment states: "Judge N&#250;&#241;ez is biased and
has engaged in improper behavior while presiding over this case.... Judge
N&#250;&#241;ez`s acts are expressly prohibited by the Constitution and the law, and
therefore, constitute a flagrant violation of Chevron`s rights." 

The filing points out in conclusion that if Judge N&#250;&#241;ez`s rulings were allowed
to stand, "Chevron would be denied the right to impartial justice and due
process guaranteed by the Constitution." 

Chevron has raised numerous significant complaints about the Cabrera report,
including:

* Unsupported findings of contamination: Cabrera didn`t visit all the sites but
declares all are in need of remediation; his testing didn`t include a single
water sample from a municipal water supply, drinking water well, river or stream
yet claims that all drinking water systems should be replaced; 
* Grossly inflated cost estimates for soil remediation: Cabrera says pit
remediation will cost $2.7 billion, or about $3million per pit, but the current,
actual costs are $85,000 per pit; 
* Unsubstantiated cancer claims: Not one medical record or name is associated
with the cancer claims in his report and the cancer rate he claims is more than
250 times higher than the official rate published by the Government of Ecuador;
Cabrera copies passages from the plaintiffs` filing almost word-for-word and
assesses $9.5 billion in damages without naming a single victim; 
* Non-existent unjust enrichment claims: Cabrera assesses $8.3 billion for
unjust enrichment even though the company earned less than two percent of the
$25 billion in total revenue generated by the consortium with Petroecuador over
25 years; the unjust enrichment concept has no basis under Ecuador law.

&lt;p&gt;New Packaging Options for Coca-Cola Products
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
Coca-Cola, the world`s most recognized brand and the sparkling beverage of
choice for U.S. Hispanics, is rolling out new marketing programs to encourage
Hispanic consumers to pursue their dreams and connect with multicultural teens.
In addition, the Company is offering new packaging options to give them more
convenient ways to enjoy their favorite beverage. 

"Central to Destapa La Felicidad is the simple idea that Coke is always there,
inviting people to take a break and refresh their dreams," said Reinaldo Padua,
assistant vice president, Hispanic Marketing, Coca-Cola North America (CCNA).
"With the addition of new marketing and promotional programs, we are inviting
Hispanic consumers to open a Coke and open happiness." 

The two programs - the "Ingl&#233;s sin Barreras" promotion for Hispanic adults and
"Coca-Cola Secret Formula" for teens - will debut throughout the remainder of
2009. 

Ingl&#233;s sin Barreras Promotion

To help Hispanics fulfill their dream of learning English, Coca-Cola is creating
an exclusive partnership with Lexicon Marketing, the developer and marketer of
Ingl&#233;s sin Barreras (English without Borders), the bestselling video-based
English learning program in the U.S. Coca-Cola will feature in-store promotions
that provide consumers with opportunities to obtain English learning premiums
such as bilingual English-Spanish mini-dictionaries and a special DVD lesson
from the Ingl&#233;s sin Barreras collection. The program will be rolled out to more
than 11,000 convenience retail and grocery stores located in Hispanic areas
across the country beginning September 1. 

In addition to the in-store promotions, Coca-Cola is creating an innovative
mobile phone points collection platform that allows consumers to accumulate
points by texting their My Coke Rewards product codes. Upon registering,
consumers will receive 100 free My Coke Rewards points towards their first
Ingl&#233;s sin Barreras volume. Each time consumers amass 700 My Coke Rewards
points, they will have the opportunity to redeem their points for one of the 12
volumes in the Ingl&#233;s sin Barreras collection. This year-long promotion will be
supported with television, radio and newspaper advertising. 

As part of the partnership, Coca-Cola will sponsor Latinos sin Barreras, a
contest hosted by Lexicon. Consumers will have the opportunity to submit stories
detailing their success in the U.S. to MundosinBarreras.com and each month
registered users will select a winner to receive various prizes. In addition,
the winner will be entered for the grand prize, a free trip to Los Angeles to be
featured in one of Lexicon`s commercials aired nationwide on Hispanic television
networks. 

"With our Ingles sin Barreras promotion we are reaching Hispanic consumers in a
powerful and cultural way. Offering them the opportunity to achieve their dream
of learning English is what Destapa La Felicidad is all about," said Padua. "We
are committed to providing Hispanic consumers with relevant programs that
emphasize Coca-Cola`s role during every occasion, from meals with the family to
watching a soccer match with friends to a refreshing break while learning
English with Ingles sin Barreras." 

Reaching Out to Multicultural Youth: Coca-Cola Secret Formula

Secret Formula, a component of the Open Happiness/Destapa La Felicidad marketing
and advertising campaign, was launched at the beginning of 2009 to establish a
direct dialogue with teens. The program celebrates the secret ingredients that
make Coca-Cola one of the most delicious and special beverages on the planet.
Through a series of advertisements, secret ingredients such as "Swelter
Stopper", "Movie Improver", "Burger Betterer" and "Harmonizer" showcase how
Coca-Cola makes a teen`s daily life more fun. "Fanhancer" is the newest secret
ingredient in the program and expresses how Coca-Cola provides teens, in
particular multicultural teens, with the extra spark and refreshment that real
fans need to chant, scream, holler or cheer for their favorite team, musician or
celebrity. 

With the addition of "Fanhancer", the program made its debut in the Hispanic
market through a media partnership with Univision Network that rolled out during
the recent live broadcast of Premios Juventud (Youth Awards). Coca-Cola and
Univision also created "Secretos de Premios Juventud" (Secrets of Premios
Juventud), a section on Univision.com where fans had access to exclusive
behind-the-scenes interviews with celebrities that attended "Premios Juventud." 

To capture the "Fanhancer" experience, Coca-Cola brought together 17 teens from
all ethnicities to create a series of videos and images that highlight how they
express their individualism, personality and "fanitude." The visual creative
will appear on Univision.com, BET.com, ESPN.com, AOL Latino.com and other online
media sites as part of the program`s effort to reach teens. The program will
feature digital and point-of-sale executions and also will be linked to
MyCokeRewards.com. 

Package Diversity: Coca-Cola "Para Todos"

In addition to these programs, the second half of 2009 promises to be an
exciting one for CCNA as the Company rolls out a series of new package sizes.
Some of the new options include a 16-ounce plastic bottle for 99 cents, a
50-ounce twin pack and a 2-liter contour plastic bottle featuring the brand`s
iconic curvy shape. With Coca-Cola`s new packaging diversity approach, Hispanic
consumers will be able to enjoy their favorite Coca-Cola product in the package
and price that best fit their needs. This initiative is being supported by
point-of-sale and a new television commercial titled "Para Todos" (For
Everyone). The commercial highlights how Coca-Cola is available for each
consumer and each occasion in a multitude of packages. The new television
commercial debuted during the live broadcast of Univision Network`s new reality
show "Viva el Sue&#241;o."

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
Options trading surged on Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG) on Thursday, as more than
120,400 contracts changed hands. This volume was nearly five times the
security's average daily trading volume of 24,748 contracts, according to data
from WhatsTrading.com. In addition, roughly 68% of the volume crossed the tape
on the call side. 

Drilling down on the action, we find that the September 57.50 call added more
than 10,000 contracts, while the October 60 call shed roughly 5,000 positions.
This leaves the stock's Schaeffer's put/call open interest ratio at 0.54. This
reading is lower than 93% of all those taken during the past 52 weeks. In other
words, options players have been more optimistic toward the shares only 7% of
the time during the past year.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - A U.S. court of appeals on Friday overturned a $358 million damages award against software maker Microsoft Corp in a long-running patent dispute with French telecoms equipment firm Alcatel-Lucent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which handles many patent and trademark cases, held that Microsoft did indirectly infringe Alcatel's patents, but ordered that the damages portion of the case be retried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last year, a U.S. federal court jury awarded Alcatel-Lucent $358 million in damages from Microsoft for violating patents relating to technology that allows users to enter dates into calendars, known as the "Day" patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alcatel-Lucent officials were not immediately available for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokesman said the company would comment after reviewing the court's order.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby and Jonathan Stempel; Editing by Phil Berlowitz)&lt;/p&gt;

segments, high levels of unemployment, and historically low level of consumer
confidence? On the other hand, how will IBM's competitors fare? Will they gain
or lose ground? 

This report takes a detailed look at IBM and its strategies and its market
position based on a comparison to its major competitors. It provides a
historical view that covers the period 2004 to 2008 along with a projection for

that IBM/s competitors in Japan can use to improve their competitiveness against

&lt;p&gt;  SAN MATEO, CA, Sep 11 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
DotNetNuke Corp., the company behind the most widely adopted web content
management system (CMS) and application development framework for
building web sites and web applications on Microsoft .NET, today
announced that Shaun Walker, Co-Founder and Chief Architect, has joined
the CodePlex Foundation interim Board of Directors. Publicly announced on
September 10, 2009, the CodePlex Foundation was created to enable the
exchange of code and understanding among software companies and open
source communities. With his extensive professional experience
implementing large-scale open source software solutions for private and
public organizations, and his commitment to DotNetNuke, the most
successful open source community project on the Microsoft platform,
Walker will bring a unique, practical open source perspective to the
board.

    News Highlights


--  Due to differing views on development methodology and intellectual
    property, software developers often under-participate in open source
    projects. The CodePlex Foundation was created to address these critical
    challenges, complement existing open source foundations, and create a
    positive dialogue between software companies and open source developers
    engaging in open source projects.
--  The CodePlex Foundation, founded and funded by Microsoft, was named
    after the company's open source project hosting web site "CodePlex." The
    Foundation, which received $1 million from Microsoft, will remain license-
    and project-agnostic, enabling the neutral exchange of code and knowledge
    between software companies and open source communities. The licensing
    agreements and the processes that Foundation members have pioneered will be
    made available to the community at large and will be instrumental to
    software companies looking for a way to contribute to open source projects.
--  Sam Ramji will serve as interim President of the Foundation and will
    be supported by an interim Board of Directors that includes Shaun Walker,
    Co-Founder and Chief Architect of DotNetNuke Corporation; Bill Staples,
    General Manager of Microsoft Corporation's Web Platform and Tools
    Engineering Teams; Stephanie Boesch, Director of Program Management at
    Microsoft Corporation; Britt Johnston, Microsoft SQL Business Product Unit
    Manager; and Miguel de Icaza, Vice President of Developer Platform at
    Novell Inc.

    Shaun Walker, Co-Founder and Chief Architect of DotNetNuke Corp.:

    "The CodePlex Foundation's mission to enable the exchange of code and

better understanding between these two groups is vital for the future
growth and success of the open source movement. I look forward to joining
the distinguished group of software experts on the Board to foster better
collaboration and knowledge sharing between these ecosystems."

    Sam Ramji, Senior Director of Platform Strategy at Microsoft, President,
CodePlex Foundation:

    "Today, software developers under-participate in open source projects,
often due to cultural differences between software companies and open
source communities or differing views on software development methodology
and intellectual property. The CodePlex Foundation was designed to foster
more collaboration between these groups and I look forward to working with
Shaun to help change practices where it makes sense to do so, and foster
greater shared understanding between these stakeholders."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co is expanding its U.S. commercial banking business, even amid the recession, and is considering a return to commercial real estate next year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As other banks have labored to lay off commercial real estate exposure -- the cause of the most recent slew of loan losses for many financial institutions -- JPMorgan's Texan head of commercial banking, Todd Maclin, believes there may be an opportunity in this business next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"These assets are rapidly re-pricing, there are a number of distressed sellers, there are a number of financial institutions that are overexposed, and from our past experience those sorts of things generally translate into an opportunity as you approach the bottom," he told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan has benefited from its limited exposure to commercial real estate relative to peers -- in the second quarter, it accounted for just $12.3 billion of JPMorgan's total $109 billion in commercial banking loans -- and under Chief Executive Jamie Dimon, the bank is known as a cautious risk taker and one of the best survivors of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I wouldn't say we've put our toes in the water but maybe we've taken our shoes and socks off," said Maclin, talking on the phone from Long Island where he was visiting clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WAMU&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commercial banking division, which provides lending, treasury and other bank services to clients including corporations, not-for-profit entities and municipalities, has already expanded this year, largely by taking market share from rivals and making the most of its nearly year-old Washington Mutual acquisition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under 53-year-old Maclin, the unit lent $15 billion to small- and mid-sized companies in the second quarter -- a more than 50 percent increase on the first quarter -- even as other lenders such as CIT Group struggled to lend money while battling rising loan losses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's been a lot of flight-to-quality; people are definitely moving business to our firm," said Maclin.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's acquisition of Seattle-based thrift Washington Mutual's bank assets last September brought the second-largest U.S. bank an established branch network on the west coast and this is another way that Maclin's division is looking to expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Maclin transferred eight bankers from Chase to former Washington Mutual markets -- predominantly Florida, Georgia, California, Washington and Oregon -- and the bank also hired 40 local bankers and associates to build up middle-market and commercial banking business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's definitely a full-fledged recession going on in (some of) those markets, but we find there are a number of companies that are concerned about their banks and looking for an alternative," Maclin said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Commercial loan losses have been rising -- the unit reported net charge-offs of $181 million in the second quarter, up from $49 million in the same period a year earlier -- but what Dimon likes to refer to as a "fortress balance sheet" has put the bank on more solid ground than rivals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In particular, JPMorgan's commercial bank, in partnership with its investment bank, has recently scooped up various deals providing financing to hospitals, colleges and local governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"By keeping our nose clean, we're open for business right now at a time when frankly a lot of our competitors are distracted," said Maclin. "If you keep your wits about you during the boom periods then it really pays off in the downturn."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sept 11 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) is very
well positioned to further capture market share, Citigroup
analysts said, as they raised their outlook and price target to
account for strong capital markets activity, declining systemic
risks and improving deal pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Third quarter is benefiting from slightly better than
expected July and August, and we expect a strong September,"
analysts, including Keith Horowitz, wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; They raised earnings estimates for the U.S. bank to $4 a
share from $3.20 for the third quarter, and to $4.75 from $4.25
for the fourth quarter, on higher trading revenue and better
principal investment results.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman ranked No. 1 in core fixed income, currency and
commodities, and equity trading fees among top global banks,
according to Citigroup analysts' first half of 2009 scorecard.
"We expect (Goldman's) leadership to continue near term," they
said. In addition, recent deal announcements are boosting
Goldman's merger and acquisition pipeline, setting up for
better advisory fees in the first half of next year, the
analysts said. Citigroup analysts reiterated their "buy"
recommendation on the stock, and raised their price target on
Goldman shares to $215 from $175.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Prominent banking analyst Meredith Whitney on Thursday said
she still has a buy on Goldman and that the company "still has
a lot of gas in its tank."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman in July reported robust net earnings of $3.4
billion for the second quarter, soon after repaying a $10
billion bailout received from the U.S. Treasury's Troubled
Asset Relief Program.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of the company closed at $174.87 Thursday on the New
York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Hollywood Reporter) - Timothy Dalton, a former James Bond and a Shakespearean actor to boot, will voice a worthy thespian hedgehog named Mr Pricklepants in Disney/Pixar's "Toy Story 3."&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Walt Disney Animation and Pixar Animation Studios chief creative officer John Lasseter on Thursday showed a five-second clip of the newly created character as part of a two-hour presentation at Odeon Leicester Square, the biggest cinema in the U.K. The footage was greeted with hoots of appreciative laughter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasseter also revealed that the voices of Billy Connolly, Emma Thompson and Julie Walters will ring out alongside Reese Witherspoon's in Pixar's "first fairy tale" outing. "The Bear and the Bow," set in Scotland, features a feisty princess and is "more about girl power" than princes, Lasseter said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Addressing an audience of 1,500-plus journalists and Disney staff, Lasseter revealed the storyline for his sequel to "Cars," which takes the U.S. automobiles on a tour of the globe, stopping off in Japan, France, Germany and Italy before hitting the roads of London at the film's climax. The Hawaiian-shirted Lasseter also showed artwork and storyboards from the upcoming movie, due to roll out around the world in the summer of 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lasseter also introduced and screened the first 30 minutes of "The Princess and the Frog," a return to hand-drawn animation at Disney. Lasseter said the picture, set in New Orleans with a score by Randy Newman, promises to return to the quality and classic filmmaking techniques first employed by Walt Disney.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another return to classic Disney territory, Lasseter unveiled drawings for the big-screen outing of "Winnie the Pooh," first made as a mini-feature in the 1960s. Lasseter said Disney veteran animator, writer, director and producer Burny Mattinson, who worked on the first adaptations of A.A. Milne's books 35 years ago, is aboard as lead story artist.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Sheri Linden at Reuters)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG, Sept 11 (Reuters) - Wall Street bank Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) has hired two India analysts from its rivals as it
looks to strengthen its industry coverage of Asia's
third-biggest  economy, said a source briefed on the
appointments on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Tabassum Inamdar, a former analyst at UBS (UBSN.VX)
(UBS.N), has agreed to join Goldman as its Indian financial
services research analyst. She will start in December, the
source said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Inamdar, rated by many industry magazines as one of the top
India equities analysts last year, will also serve as a
managing director at Goldman, the source added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Former Morgan Stanley (MS.N) India analyst Sachin
Salgaonkar has joined Goldman as a vice president for research
in India's telecoms sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A Goldman Sachs spokesman in Hong Kong confirmed two
appointments for the India research team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bankers and dealmakers have expected deal flows to pick up
in major Asian economies such as China and India, which are
helping pull the world out of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some buyout funds remain cautious on India's economic
prospects, with analysts predicting domestic industry
consolidation may accelerate before a new wave of foreign
investment.

&lt;p&gt;SAN DIEGO (Hollywood Reporter) - Disney has struck a deal with Viz Media to bring the anime series "Naruto Shippuden" to the Disney XD digital cable network beginning next month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Shippuden" is the sequel to the popular Japanese import and picks up with the ninja lead characters now in their teens. The original "Naruto" series has been airing on Cartoon Network since 2005.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It may be new to the Disney audience, but "Naruto" has proven to be a strong license in gaming and online. Subtitled episodes of the show were among the top streams on both Hulu and Joost earlier this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Disney XD is a growing destination for our key demographic, boys 6-14, and we're looking forward to bringing the adventures of 'Naruto Shippuden' to our lineup," said Tracy McAndrew, director, acquisitions and co-productions, Disney-ABC Cable Networks Group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ANAHEIM, California (Reuters) - Mickey Mouse's house and his Toon Town world will make way next year for a vastly larger Fantasyland, in the biggest-ever expansion of the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida, Walt Disney Co said on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Fantasyland expansion, whose price tag was not disclosed, will open in two stages in 2012 and 2013 and builds on the popularity of the Disney Princess and Fairies franchises, which have topped $4 billion in global retail sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney theme parks Chairman Jay Rasulo said the Fantasyland project, which breaks ground next year, will be paid for from funds designated for the theme park division's annual capital expenditures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans call for four Disney Princess characters -- Cinderella, Sleeping Beauty, Belle from "Beauty and the Beast" and Ariel from "The Little Mermaid" -- to be featured in "fantasy lands" where park visitors engage in dancing, storytelling or a birthday party with costumed characters from the films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The expansion includes two new dining spots -- Gascon's Tavern and the 552-seat Beast's Castle. A new underwater ride based on "The Little Mermaid, will be built both in the Florida Fantasyland and at the ongoing expansion of California Adventure in Disneyland.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second phase of the Fantasyland expansion will be an oversized world based on the fairy world of Pixie Hollow from "Peter Pan," but no other details were available because the attraction was still in early development stages, Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of the Fantasyland expansion, Disney plans to double the size of the popular Dumbo ride to add a covered "three-ring circus" waiting area with interactive games and a play area.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Disney Imagineers, who design rides and attractions, said the Toon Town attraction would be dismantled and its popular Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse houses relocated to another section of Walt Disney World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rasulo also announced an upgrade to the Star Tours rides at Disneyland in Anaheim and Disney's Hollywood Studio in Florida to open in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Star Tours simulates a ride through space aboard spacecraft like those in the original "Star Wars" film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The updated version features new digital 3D effects and projectors that let ride operators vary "destinations," as well as upgrades to the Star Speeder cabins, Rasulo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Editing by Peter Cooney)&lt;/p&gt;

double the size of the popular Dumbo ride to add a covered
"three-ring circus" waiting area with interactive games and a

to open in 2011.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Star Tours simulates a ride through space aboard
spacecraft like those in the original "Star Wars" film.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The updated version features new digital 3D effects and

&lt;p&gt;TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - Honduran de facto ruler Roberto Micheletti said on Saturday the United States has revoked his visa to pressure him to step down and reinstate exiled President Manuel Zelaya, who was ousted in a June military coup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Micheletti, however, was defiant of the latest move by Washington, which said earlier this month it was cutting more than $30 million in aid to the poor Central American country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We will not back down. Dignity does not have a price in our country," Micheletti told Honduran radio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked if he his visa had been canceled, Micheletti said: "Yes."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We received letters from the U.S. Consulate in Honduras which say that because of the what happened on June 28, our visas have been suspended," Micheletti said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Micheletti has not visited the United States since the June 28 coup. A month after the coup, the U.S. State Department said it had revoked the diplomatic visas of four members of Honduras' de facto government, but did not name them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Zelaya was ousted after he angered the judiciary, Congress and the army by seeking constitutional changes that would allow presidents to seek re-election beyond a four-year term.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Honduran Congress named Micheletti to be interim president, and the country's Supreme Court said it had ordered the army to remove Zelaya.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The State Department said last week that it could not, for now, regard as legitimate Honduran elections scheduled for November because of Zelaya's overthrow.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Marcia Villa, a Honduran lawmaker and ally of Micheletti, said several top members of Micheletti's government, Honduran Supreme Court justices and a group of Honduran businessmen had also lost their U.S. visas.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Some Latin American leaders have suggested Washington apply more pressure, but some U.S. Republican lawmakers believe it has already done too much for Zelaya, an ally of Venezuela's socialist and anti-U.S. president, Hugo Chavez.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Gustavo Palencia; editing by Mohammad Zargham)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) announced today that the Gorgon liquefied
natural gas (LNG) project has been approved for development by the project
participants. 

The final investment decision for Gorgon was announced by representatives from
the Gorgon joint venture (ExxonMobil 25 percent interest, Shell 25 percent
interest and Chevron 50 percent interest and Operator) at a ceremony in Perth
attended by the Premier of Western Australia, Hon. Colin Barnett MLA and the
Federal Minister for Resources and Energy, Hon. Martin Ferguson MP. 

The decision follows recent execution of LNG sales and purchase agreements with
PetroChina International Company Limited and Petronet LNG Limited of India for
ExxonMobil`s equity share of LNG in the Gorgon Project. 

"With global demand for LNG forecast to triple by 2030, the Gorgon Project will
be a critical supply source in meeting this future demand, particularly for the
economies in the fast growing Asia-Pacific region," said Neil Duffin, president
of ExxonMobil Development Company. "The supply of cleaner-burning natural gas
will also be critical in helping minimize global emissions." 

Duffin said the final investment decision on Gorgon is a significant milestone.
"With our commitment to the Gorgon Project along with the ongoing development of
Australia`s world class oil and gas fields in Bass Strait, ExxonMobil continues
to be a strong contributor to Australia`s energy development and economic
progress," he said. 

"ExxonMobil is proud to be a participant in the Gorgon Project with our
co-venturers, Chevron and Shell. Together, with support from the Australian and
Western Australian Governments, we are committed to the successful development
of the Gorgon resources, which includes a large scale carbon capture and storage
project." 

The Gorgon LNG Project is among a growing ExxonMobil portfolio helping to meet
the energy needs of Australia and the rest of the world. The greater Gorgon area
is estimated to have resources of 40 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. First
LNG sales are targeted for 2014 and domestic gas in 2015.

&lt;p&gt;Emerges as One of the World`s Largest Natural Gas Developments

Project Will Be a Global Leader in Applying Underground Carbon Dioxide Injection
Technology
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) today announced that its subsidiary, Chevron
Australia Pty Ltd, will proceed with the development of the Gorgon natural gas
project offshore Western Australia. Development proposals for the project were
approved today by the Western Australian State Premier the Hon. Colin Barnett,
MLA, and production licenses were granted by the Australian Minister for
Resources and Energy the Hon. Martin Ferguson AM, MP. 

"With a total resource base of more than 40 trillion cubic feet of gas and an
estimated economic life of at least 40 years, Gorgon will be a major contributor
to our company`s future growth," said Chevron Chairman Dave O`Reilly. 

"Gorgon adds significant long-term reserves and production for Chevron,
bolstering our strong resource replacement and underscoring the importance of
Australia to our growing natural gas business," said George Kirkland, executive
vice president, Global Upstream and Gas, Chevron Corporation. 

The Gorgon Project, operated by the Australian subsidiary of Chevron (50
percent1) in joint venture with Australian subsidiaries of ExxonMobil (25
percent) and Shell (25 percent), is currently estimated to cost AU$43 billion
(US$37 billion) for the first phase of development. First gas is planned for
2014. 

The Greater Gorgon Area`s projected natural gas resources are equivalent to 6.7
billion barrels of oil. The project`s scope includes a three-train, 15
million-metric-ton-per-year liquefied natural gas (LNG) facility and a domestic
gas plant. 

The project underwent a rigorous and thorough environmental assessment that
culminated with some of the most stringent conditions imposed on a major project
anywhere in the world. The project is expected to have the world`s largest
carbon dioxide injection system and be a global leader in underground carbon
dioxide injection technology. 

Chevron Corporation is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies,
with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company's success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of approximately 62,000 employees who

&lt;p&gt;PERTH, Sept 13 (Reuters) - U.S. oil major Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) and partners have given the green light to develop the
Gorgon liquefied natural gas (LNG) project in Australia, a
source briefed on the decision said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron and partners, including ExxonMobil Corp (XOM.N) and
Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), will be holding a signing ceremony
with the Australian government and making the announcement on
Monday, the source told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron could not be reached for comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project, which the government has estimated to cost
about A$50 billion ($43 billion), will be Australia's largest
ever resource project and is expected to create 6,000 jobs at
its peak and generate about A$300 billion of export revenue over
25 years.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The proposed 15 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) project,
which comprises three production trains and a gas plant, will be
built on the environmentally sensitive Barrow Island Reserve off
the coast of western Australia.

&lt;p&gt;BEIJING, Sept 13 (Reuters) - A former employee at one of
beverage giant Coca-Cola Co's (KO.N) Chinese bottling plants is
being held by police in connection with a corruption
investigation, a spokesman for the firm said on Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The detainee worked at Shanghai Shenmei Beverage  Food Co
Ltd., but the company declined to give further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We can confirm that a former employee at our Shanghai
(Shenmei) bottling plant has been detained by the police," said
Kenth Kaerhoeg, group communications director, Coca-Cola
Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our bottler is actively cooperating with the police
investigation in strict compliance with relevant laws and
regulations."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chinese language National Business Daily reported the
corruption covered about 10 million yuan ($1.47 million).
Kaerhoeg declined to comment on the amount of money involved.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola currently operates 38 bottling plants in China,
employing 30,000 people directly. Its business in China grew by
19 percent in 2008, making it the company's third-largest
market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The news of the detention comes around a month after the
formal arrest of four employees of Anglo-Australian miner Rio
Tinto RIO.AS (RIO.L) on suspicion of obtaining commercial
secrets and bribery [ID:nLC395883].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Stern Hu, a Chinese-born Australian who is Rio Tinto's head
of iron ore marketing, was one of the group and the move and
his detention in particular provoked an international outcry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has warned China it
had significant economic interests at stake in detaining Hu and
that the world was watching how it handled a case that has
highlighted the risks of doing business in the world's
third-largest economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, Australia has insisted the case would not harm
trade relations with China. China is Australia's biggest trade
partner.

Here are highlights from Friday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Citigroup Wins Lawsuit Dismissal

Citigroup Inc.`s (NYSE: C) officers and directors (including Chief Executive
Officer Vikram Pandit) won the dismissal of a lawsuit claiming they breached
their duty to the bank by manipulating the market for auction-rate securities
(ARS). 

On Sep 10, U.S. District Judge Laura Taylor Swain in New York dismissed the
derivative lawsuit on procedural grounds because the plaintiffs failed to ask
the bank to bring the case itself. She gave the plaintiffs an opportunity to
file a new complaint. 

In a derivative lawsuit, shareholders seek to recover damages from the company
instead of being paid to individual shareholders. Damages would be sought from
executives or board members. The judge's written ruling said the pension fund
could file an amended complaint by Oct 1, but failure to do so would result in a
judgment dismissing the complaint. 

Plaintiffs led by the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees Retirement System
claimed that Citigroup was exposed to billions of dollars in settlements, fines
and lost business after the defendants rigged the market in ARS to hide the lack
of liquidity. The defendants included board members Michael Armstrong and former
Chairman Win Bischoff. 

ARS are debt instruments whose rates are reset in periodic auctions. The credit
crisis of 2007 put increasing pressure on the ARS market and by February 2008
the $330 billion market collapsed after brokerages stopped supporting the
auctions. 

A number of brokerage firms including Citigroup, UBS AG (NYSE: UBS), Credit
Suisse Group AG (NYSE: CS), Goldman Sachs Group Inc. (NYSE: GS) have already
agreed to buy back tens of billions of dollars in securities from investors
after investigators found they didn't properly inform clients about the risks,
or that the market was crumbling, increasing their losses. 

In Aug 2008, Citigroup was the first firm that agreed to buy $7.3 billion of the
debt from individual investors and pay $100 million in fines. The bank also
pledged to help 2,600 institutional customers unload $12 billion of securities.
In Oct 2008, Bank of America Corporation (NYSE: BAC) settled with regulators and
agreed to buy back $4.5 billion in securities from its clients.

&lt;p&gt;Innovative Online Campaign Incorporates Twitter Content, Live News Updates,
Ticket Purchase Functionality and More Across Microsoft Properties to Drive
Ticket Sales in Rough Economy
LOS ANGELES--(Business Wire)--
Interpolls, a leading rich media technology company, announced today that it is
teaming with Southwest Airlines and Microsoft to launch the newest online
elements to Southwest`s ongoing "Grab Your Bag, It`s On" advertising campaign. 

The national campaign - currently running on the Microsoft Mobile platform,
billboards, magazines and exclusive Fox Sports online properties - is aimed at
the frequent business traveler, motivating them to "punch this economy in the
nose" and book that needed travel. Southwest and Interpolls are extending the
campaign to websites including MSN, MSNBC and Windows Live. The partners are
also rolling out new features and functionality on Fox Sports` online "OT" show
and Pro Football Pick `em game. 

For the first time, Southwest is incorporating Interpolls` Rich Media Widget
technology into its online advertising initiatives, enabling users to "grab" the
campaign-themed widget from popular sites, "share" it with friends, and "place"
the widget on personal pages such as Facebook, MySpace, iGoogle, Xanga, Windows
Live Spaces, and more. The widget component will extend the reach of the
campaign virally among users and influencers, also building upon Southwest`s
renowned approach to social marketing that currently leverages sites such as
Twitter and Facebook. 

The Rich Media Widget ad unit includes creative and content features such as a
Southwest current promotional Bags Fly Free video, sweepstakes information, an
instant booking form, Click `N Save newsletter sign-up, Twitter content and
connectivity, along with live news and video blog feeds, all within a single ad
unit. By navigating through each of the widget`s tabs, users can review the
latest benefits of flying with Southwest through its Rapid Rewards program,
sign-up for deals through email and even click through to enter to win a free
ski trip for four to Lake Tahoe. 

"Southwest Airlines is leveraging a 360-degree approach to engage the business
traveler through Microsoft Mobile, a partnership with Fox Sports and now, online
with Interpolls` Rich Media Technology," said Sandra Howard, Director of
Advertising for Southwest Airlines. "It`s an innovative way to truly surround
and engage our target audience with Southwest`s unique message that we know what
they need to get business done and we are with them every step of the way." 

In addition, Southwest and Interpolls are partnering with MSNBC to introduce a
new, large format ad unit, the Adslice, that acts as a "slice" between two
sections of content on the MSNBC web page. The Adslice unit will include content
functionality similar to that of the Rich Media Widget and will allow the user
to click to grab the Widget from its pickup page. Furthermore, Southwest and
Interpolls will roll out a Windows Live Messenger component that enables users
to share the widget with their Messenger friends, prompting them to follow
Southwest for details on the season`s best deals. 

"By utilizing Interpolls rich media technology, Southwest is able to engage
their audience with a real-time call to action, while leveraging several
impactful approaches within a single ad unit," said Peter Kim, President and
CEO, Interpolls. "Additionally, the viral nature of the Rich Media Widget
ensures Southwest is able to meet its objective of increasing branding and
awareness beyond its standard media buy."

&lt;p&gt;IRVING, Texas (USA)--(Business Wire)--
Die Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) hat heute bekannt gegeben, dass das
Fl&#252;ssigerdgasprojekt (LNG, Liquefied Natural Gas) Gorgon durch die
Projektbeteiligten zur Erschlie&#223;ung zugelassen wurde. 

Die letztendliche Investitionsentscheidung f&#252;r Gorgon wurde von Vertretern des
Gorgon-Joint-Ventures (Anteil ExxonMobil 25 Prozent, Anteil Shell 25 Prozent und
Anteil Chevron als Betreiber 50 Prozent) anl&#228;sslich einer Zeremonie in Perth
bekanntgegeben, an der auch der Premierminister von Westaustralien, Hon. Colin
Barnett MLA und der Bundesminister f&#252;r Ressourcen und Energie, Hon. Martin
Ferguson MP teilnahmen. 

Die Entscheidung folgte dem vor Kurzem erfolgten Abschluss von LNG-Kaufvertr&#228;gen
mit der PetroChina International Company Limited und der indischen Petronet LNG
Limited &#252;ber den Anteil von ExxonMobil am Fl&#252;ssigerdgas im Rahmen des
Gorgon-Projekts. 

&#8222;Laut Prognosen wird sich die weltweite Nachfrage nach Fl&#252;ssigerdgas bis zum
Jahr 2030 verdreifachen. Damit wird das Gorgon-Projekt zu einer ma&#223;geblichen
Bezugsquelle bei der Erf&#252;llung dieser zuk&#252;nftigen Nachfrage, insbesondere in den
L&#228;ndern des schnellwachsenden Wirtschaftsraums Asien-Pazifik", sagte Neil
Duffin, President der ExxonMobil Development Company. &#8222;Die Lieferung von
sauberer verbrennendem Erdgas wird dar&#252;ber hinaus dazu beitragen, die weltweiten
Emissionen zu reduzieren." 

Duffin sagte, dass die letztendliche Investitionsentscheidung &#252;ber das
Gorgon-Projekt ein bedeutender Meilenstein sei. &#8222;Durch unseren Einsatz f&#252;r das
Gorgon-Projekt und die kontinuierliche Erschlie&#223;ung der erstklassigen
australischen &#214;l- und Gasfelder in der Bass-Stra&#223;e leistet ExxonMobil weiterhin
einen wichtigen Beitrag zur Energieentwicklung und zum wirtschaftlichen
Fortschritt in Australien", f&#252;gte er hinzu. 

&#8222;ExxonMobil ist stolz darauf, sich mit seinen Partnern Chevron und Shell am
Gorgon-Projekt beteiligen zu k&#246;nnen. Gemeinsam und mit der Unterst&#252;tzung durch
die australische und westaustralische Regierung haben wir uns der erfolgreichen
Erschlie&#223;ung der Gorgon-Ressourcen verschrieben, wozu auch ein gro&#223;angelegtes
CO2-Abscheidungs- und -speicherungsprojekt geh&#246;rt." 

Das Gorgon-LNG-Projekt ist Teil eines wachsenden ExxonMobil-Portfolios, das dazu
beitr&#228;gt, den Energiebedarf in Australien und dem Rest der Welt zu decken. Im
Gro&#223;raum des Gorgon-Bereiches gibt es sch&#228;tzungsweise 1,13 Billionen Kubikmeter
Erdgas. Erste LNG-Ums&#228;tze sind f&#252;r 2014 und Erdgas-Verk&#228;ufe f&#252;r 2015 geplant. 

&#220;ber ExxonMobil

ExxonMobil, das gr&#246;&#223;te b&#246;rsennotierte internationale &#214;l- und Gasunternehmen,
nutzt Technologien und Innovationen, um dazu beizutragen, dass der weltweit
wachsende Energiebedarf gedeckt wird. ExxonMobil verf&#252;gt &#252;ber eine
branchenf&#252;hrende F&#252;lle an Ressourcen, ist der gr&#246;&#223;te Veredler und Vermarkter von
Mineral&#246;lprodukten und sein Chemieunternehmen ist eines der gr&#246;&#223;ten der Welt.

the death.

is the best fit to help them accelerate their operation," says Geoff Ables, CEO

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co agreed to buy carbon offset aggregator EcoSecurities for 122.9 million pounds ($204 million) on Monday, trumping a bid from the firm's co-founder, to boost its carbon-credit trading business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J.P.Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., a subsidiary of the bank, said its 100 pence-a-share bid, made through Carbon Acquisition Company, had the backing of shareholders representing 19.9 percent of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said EcoSecurities had successfully realized value from sourcing, developing and trading emission reductions, and it noted the firm had recorded its first period of profitability in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer represents a 120 percent premium to the group's share price before the start of the offer period on June 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like JPMorgan is backing the current management to take the business private," said Ken Rumph, an equity analyst at Nomura Code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland-based EcoSecurities Group Plc develops clean energy projects under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism, which allows companies to export cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to emerging countries like China and India, where such reductions are cheaper to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EcoSecurities shares were up 11.5 percent at 101.5 pence by 1411 GMT (10:11 a.m. EDT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon Acquisition Company said the acceptances included 13.6 million shares held by current and former directors and 9.9 million shares owned by Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the offer statement, Carbon Acquisition said the acceptances would remain binding in the event of a competing offer being made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a scorched earth, blocking tactic (and) it's a problem for Guanabara if these blocking minority figures are holding out," Rumph added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EcoSecurities rebuffed on September 1 a revised 90 pence-a-share offer from Guanabara Holdings, set up by EcoSecurities co-founder and former president Pedro Moura Costa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board of Guanabara said Monday afternoon it noted Carbon Acquisition's offer and will make a further announcement following a review of its own position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It remains to be seen if Guanabara will improve its offer and bid something closer to our 'bare-bones' valuation of 114 pence per share," said Mirabaud's Agustin Hochschild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Guanabara reached a deal with then rival bidder EDF Trading, a unit of French utility EDF, offering it the option to purchase a portion of EcoSecurities' pre-2012 offset portfolio if Guanabara's bid was successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.6027 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;

Three Ventura 901 solutions provide visually lossless compression for
contribution and primary distribution applications where compression had
previously not been allowed. With JPEG2000 compression at the contribution
level, downstream distribution quality encoders with low bit rate outputs are
now fed with the highest quality video signals for increased compression
efficiency. The result is improved efficiency throughout the entire video
transmission and distribution chain. VS901 modules provide maximum integration
and fewer components through use of state-of-the-art FPGAs, resulting in the
lowest power consumption and highest port density in the industry. 

VS901-TAED-27

The ASI/SDTI version of the VS901 family of JPEG2000 encoder/decoders provides a
single platform that can be user configured as a JPEG2000 encoder, or as a
JPEG2000 decoder, and to have the JPEG2000 video transported over selectable
interfaces to both 270 Mbps DVB-ASI or SDTI transport. Designed as a true
network interface, VS901-TAED-27 encoder accepts HD-SDI, SDI, SDTI, or DVB-ASI
at its inputs and automatically detect between these formats applying JPEG2000
compression as needed. 

VS901-SED-12

The SDH/SONET version of the VS901 family of JPEG2000 encoder/decoders provides
a single platform that can be user configured as a JPEG2000 encoder or as a
JPEG2000 decoder over a 622Mbps STM-4 / OC-12c network interface. The
VS901-SED-12 accepts a single channel of HD-SDI which is JPEG2000 compressed or
two channels of SDI, SDTI, or DVB-ASI by passing JPEG2000 compression behaving
as a true two channel 270 Mbps multiplexer. 

VS901-IED-GE

The IP version of the VS901 family of JPEG2000 encoder/decoders provides a
single platform that can be user configured as a JPEG2000 encoder or as a
JPEG2000 decoder over a 100/1000 Base-T Ethernet network interface. The
VS901-IED-GE encoder can accept HD-SDI, SDI, SDTI, and DVB-ASI at its inputs and
auto detect between these formats, automatically applying JPEG2000 compression
as needed. In addition, the VS901-IED-GE is entirely SMPTE 2022 compliant for
the encapsulation of MPEG-2 Transport Streams over IP with Forward Error
Correction. 

Recent industry developments point to the growing importance of JPEG2000
technology and Nevion`s position in that growth. "Increased development in
contribution video, primary distribution and archiving, along with its use in
digital cinema, have contributed to the wide acceptance of JPEG2000," said Dr.
Chin Koh, director of product management for Nevion`s Ventura product family.
"In addition to creating the most scalable and flexible JPEG2000 solutions,
Nevion is currently active on committees across the industry to establish
JPEG2000 standards across networks and applications." 

The VS901 series features the lowest constant latency for a guaranteed 45 ms
complete encode and decode cycle, and the highest level of integration in the
industry. Changes or additions to functionality are easily achieved through
remote software upgrades. Upgrades are completed without the need to remove the
card from its chassis and with limited interruption to service, thus reducing
onsite staffing costs. All VS901 modules are certified to stringent US-based
carriers` NEBS Level 3 requirements for operation in harsh environments. 

"Broadcasters are overwhelmingly recognizing-and choosing-the benefits of
JPEG2000," said Eugene Keane, president of Nevion USA. "The VS901 series
delivers integrated benefits like no other JPEG2000 products in the industry,
offering low latency, high value and resource savings that are unmatched in
today`s market."

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON Sept 14 (Reuters) - Biofuels company Mascoma
Corp said on Monday it has entered a two-year
feedstockagreement with a unit of Chevron Corp (CVX.N) that
will help it make advanced cellulosic ethanol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Mascoma hopes to produce commercial levels of cellulosic
ethanol, an advanced biofuel made from the woody bits of
nonfood crops, by 2013. It already makes small amounts of the
fuel at a pilot plant in Rome, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the agreement Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV), a
unit of Chevron, will provide lignocellulosic feedstock to
Mascoma, which will then covert them to cellulosic fuel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mascoma will then supply CTV with lignin, an energy-rich
chemical compound derived from woody biomass, which the company
will then evaluate for potential uses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The upgrading of our byproduct lignin to high value
transportation fuels is an important step in our effort to
prove the effectiveness of integrated biorefineries," Jim
Flatt, the president of Mascoma said in a release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Mascoma would not immediately say how much money was
involved in the agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil companies have been forming links with companies that
make ethanol and biodiesel as U.S. mandates call for increasing
amounts of biofuels to be mixed into the country's gasoline and
diesel.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Currently no commercial levels of cellulosic are made in
the United States, though the government requires the blending
of 100 million gallons of the fuel in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Timothy Gardner; Editing by David Gregorio)

 (Updates with analyst comments, stock price, byline)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Juan Lagorio&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N), the world's
largest payment network, said its U.S. payment volume fell less
in August than in July as more consumers used their debit cards
-- a sign the industry may be stabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa's U.S. payment volume declined 1 percent in August
compared with a year earlier. In July the drop was 2 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; U.S. credit volume declined 10 percent in August, compared
with a 9 percent contraction in July. But debit volume grew 7
percent in August, compared with a 4 percent increase in July,
Visa said in a regulatory filing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Instead of putting on credit, people just used the debit
card instead. Consumers are more focused on controlling how
much they have," said Robert Dodd, an analyst at Morgan Keegan
 Co. He said the Visa results were in line with his
expectations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa is partially insulated from the global credit crisis
because it processes transactions rather than extends credit.
However, revenue growth has slowed along with transaction
volume as consumers try to reduce their debts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Early this year, debit payment volumes exceeded credit
payment volumes in the United States for the first time in
Visa's history. The trend has intensified in recent months as
more debt-burdened consumers leave their credit cards at home.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cross-border payment volume on a constant-dollar basis fell
7 percent in August, compared with a 6 percent decline in
July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, global processed transactions grew 9 percent in
August, following a rise of 8 percent in July.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There have been some signs that you hit and passed the
bottom, and generally it makes me feel better about the card
market as a whole," Dodd said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa shares were up 12 cents to $72.41 in early trading on
the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp.marketed i4i Inc.'s XML software to potential customers at the same time it planned to drive the small company out of business by infringing on its patent for the technology, according to court documents filed last week.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a brief submitted to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal District in Washington, Toronto-based i4i argued that an injunction blocking Microsoft from selling current versions of Word should stand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Federal Judge Leonard Davis issued the injunction in August, barring Microsoft from selling Word 2003 and Word 2007 after Oct. 10. The decision came about three months after a Texas jury found that Microsoft had illegally used patented i4i technology to build XML features into its word processing software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The jury had awarded i4i $200 million, but Davis increased the amount to just under $300 million when he issued the injunction.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, the three-judge appeals panel decided to stay the injunction while it weighs Microsoft's appeal .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I4i filed the patent infringement lawsuit in 2007. The new i4i brief charges that in 1991, "at the same time Microsoft was praising the improved functionality that i4i's product brought to Word, and touting i4i as a 'Microsoft Partner,' Microsoft was working behind i4i's back to make i4i's product obsolete."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the brief, just days after a 1991 meeting in which Microsoft had sought to find ways to work with i4i, Microsoft executives discussed XML plans for Word that would eventually "make obsolete any competitive attempts by third parties to conquer that market."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft must file its rebuttal to i4i's brief by Sept. 14; the appeals court is slated to hear oral arguments from the two sides on Sept. 23.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked to comment on i4i's briefs, a Microsoft spokesman said, "We're looking forward to the hearing on the merits of our appeal."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This version of the story originally appeared in Computerworld 's print edition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LEBANON, N.H.--(Business Wire)--
Mascoma Corporation today announced that it has entered into a feedstock
processing and lignin supply agreement with Chevron Technology Ventures (CTV), a
division of Chevron U.S.A., Inc. 

Under terms of the agreement, CTV will provide various sources of
lignocellulosic feedstock to Mascoma. Mascoma will then convert the feedstock to
cellulosic ethanol through its proprietary process, which produces lignin as a
by-product. Mascoma will provide this lignin to CTV for evaluation. 

"This is an important moment for us at Mascoma," said Dr. Jim Flatt, President
of Mascoma. "The upgrading of our byproduct lignin to high value transportation
fuels is an important step in our effort to prove the effectiveness of
integrated biorefineries. It has been our goal all along to make our process as
integrated and sustainable as possible." 

Lignin is a complex chemical compound derived from woody biomass. After biomass
has been converted through Mascoma`s proprietary Consolidated Bio Processing
method, which breaks down the sugars in the cellulose and turns it into ethanol,
energy-rich lignin is left over. 

The project will last for two years, and Mascoma is hopeful that the developed
technology may be suitable for a wide variety of feedstocks. 

In December 2008, Mascoma began creating ethanol from cellulosic biomass with
positive results at its demonstration facility in Rome, New York. The company,
in collaboration with its commercialization subsidiary Frontier Renewable
Resources, is in the process of financing its first full-scale ethanol facility
in Kinross, Michigan. The company plans to break ground on that facility during
the first half of 2010. 

About Mascoma

Mascoma Corporation is an innovative biofuels company committed to developing
environmentally sustainable, low cost, low carbon biofuels from cellulosic
biomass. The company`s Consolidated Bioprocessing method converts non-food
biomass feedstocks into cellulosic ethanol through the use of a patented process
that eliminates the need for costly enzymes and additives. The company`s
corporate office and R laboratories are based in Lebanon, New Hampshire.
Mascoma is producing cellulosic ethanol on a demonstration scale at its facility
in Rome, New York. Its affiliate, Frontier Renewable Resources, is developing a
commercial scale production facility in Kinross, Michigan. For more information,

&lt;p&gt;HOUSTON--(Business Wire)--
ExxonMobil Chemical will host Tire Symposium 2009, in Chengdu, China, October
18-20, for companies, organizations and media interested in learning about new
tire innerliner technologies and opportunities for the Chinese tire industry. 

Sponsored exclusively by ExxonMobil Chemical, the event will feature product
marketing and technology specialists describing tomorrow`s tire innerliner
technologies that have the potential to significantly improve today`s tire
performance. Exxcore DVA resin-based innerliners, for example, have the
potential to reduce tire weight while being up to 10 times more effective at
retaining air than conventional innerliners of the same thickness. This
leading-edge inflation pressure retention (IPR) can result in tires that last
longer, handle better and contribute to improved fuel economy and reduced carbon
dioxide (CO2) emissions. 

Symposium speakers will focus on the technical advantages of new innerliner
technologies as well as economic and manufacturing considerations. The
conference also will provide a view on the global energy outlook and information
about global tire market trends, regulatory changes and technology advances in
halobutyl rubber technology. It also will highlight production process
improvements and announced facility expansions that are part of the Company's
commitment to reliable supply to support industry growth. 

"This event will give Chinese tire manufacturers a close-up view of innerliner
technology that will influence the tire industry and tire manufacturing," said
John W. Lyon, global vice president, Global Butyl Polymers Business Unit,
ExxonMobil Chemical. "We think it's the perfect opportunity for Chinese
companies to gain additional information to help put themselves at the forefront
of trends and technology that can help them be more successful." 

Tire Symposium 2009 will be held at the Shangri-La Hotel, 9 Binjiang Dong Road,
in Chengdu. Additional information and conference registration forms are
available at www.tire-symposium.com.

be shared among industry, government and academia. Meeting market demands
for higher service quality and innovation while increasing the efficiency
of service delivery requires deep insight into advances in information
technology and management sciences. This Collaboratory will expand our
expertise in these areas to further differentiate IBM's services offerings
in the global marketplace."

    The newly established Collaboratory for service science will initially
have a team of 10 full-time researchers, five each from ISB and IBM
Research - India. The team will focus on developing foundational
techniques in service science, including the modeling, measurement, and
optimization of "service systems."

    Service research is multi-disciplinary and many variations exist today
within the domains of management, operations research, and economics to
name a few. While most of the existing work has focused on
business-to-consumer services, the focus of this research is on
business-to-business services.

    ISB and IBM

    In February 2007, IBM and ISB signed an MoU for joint research on Service
Science, Management, and Engineering (SSME) in India. In May 2008, IBM
India and ISB signed the first Open Collaborative Research agreement in
Asia aimed at improving the competitiveness of the services sector in the
region. The joint research resulted in holding workshops, publishing
research papers and tutorials in the area of service science. This
Collaboratory is the next step forward in their joint exploration of the
area of service science.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 14 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs raised its price targets
on several European auto makers, saying the sector can continue
to outperform, helped by potential positive 2010 earnings
surprises that could come from an increase in sector
consolidation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "The industry is emerging from the current crisis in a
substantially weaker financial position," analyst Stefan
Burgstaller said in a note dated Sept. 11 to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analyst believes the industry is likely to enter a new
phase of consolidation with original equipment manufacturers
(OEMs) striving to achieve critical relevant scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the relative performance of the European
automotive sector since March is the result of two drivers,"
Burgstaller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "With volume declines stabilizing, car companies were able
to arrest the cash burn. Furthermore, car companies benefited
from government incentive schemes, which led to better capacity
utilization in the second quarter and improved working capital
levels," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  Burgstaller reinstated Fiat FIA.MI as "buy", and raised
French car parts maker Valeo (VLOF.PA) to "neutral" from
"sell". He also upgraded Autoliv (ALIVsdb.ST), world no. 1 air
bag and seat belt maker, to "buy" from "neutral."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The DJ Stoxx European Autos Index .SXAP was down 1.85
percent at 228.59 by 0900 GMT on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;   For more details on price target changes, please double

&lt;p&gt;Oil Giant Trying to Block Investigation of Its Own Role in Doctoring Videos and
Facilitating Misconduct, Says Amazon Defense Coalition
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Chevron has arranged for two prominent criminal defense attorneys in the San
Francisco Bay Area to represent the men who secretly videotaped a purported
bribery scheme in Ecuador, apparently to block an investigation to determine the
company`s own role in orchestrating the incident to disrupt a trial where
Chevron faces a $27 billion liability, according to news reports and the Amazon
Defense Coalition. 

The attorneys, Cristina Arguedas and Mary McNamara, are well-known in the San
Francisco Bay Area for representing high-profile clients. Arguedes currently
represents baseball great Barry Bonds on perjury and obstruction of justice
charges, while McNamara represented Victor Conte in the BALCO drug scandal that
ensnared Marian Jones and implicated several top U.S. track stars. 

Chevron has confirmed that Arguedes represents Diego Borja, a Chevron contractor
who the plaintiffs claim tried to bribe an Ecuadorian official as part of an
illegal sting operation. McNamara represents Wayne Hansen, described by Chevron
as an American businessman who with Borja also shot secret video of a purported
bribery scheme where he was trying to secure an environmental clean-up contract
should Chevron lose the case. 

Chevron has acknowledged that it will consider paying the legal fees for the two
men, according to news reports that quote Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson.
Chevron had not previously disclosed it had helped Borja and Hansen secure
lawyers or pay their legal fees. 

On August 31, the day Chevron released the tapes, it claimed in a press release
that it had "no relationship" with Hansen and had only helped Borja relocate to
the United States. 

The latest developments underscore that Chevron has dirty hands in the matter
and is trying to make it as difficult as possible for its role in the bribery
scheme to be investigated, said Karen Hinton, a spokeswoman for the Amazon
communities suing the company in Ecuador, where the oil giant faces a $27.3
billion liability. Chevron posted the secret videos on YouTube on August 31,
just weeks before an expected final judgment in the trial, instead of turning
them over to authorities. The company first had possession of the tapes in early
June. 

It is generally accepted in the legal profession that a corporation will pay the
fees of a criminal defense lawyer to represent an individual who has information
that could implicate the company in wrongdoing, with the hope that the person
will be discouraged from testifying against the company, said Hinton. 

"The fact that Chevron secured the services of these prominent attorneys raises
a serious question about whether it is doing so pursuant to some agreement it
had with Borja and Hansen," said Hinton. "Since Chevron had vigorously denied
any relationship with either of these men, it should explain why it appears to
be paying these very expensive criminal defense lawyers to represent them." 

"The key question that needs to be investigated by U.S. authorities is whether
Borja and Hansen acted on behalf of Chevron to contrive evidence that would
disrupt and delay a trial, so the company could avoid paying a liability,"
Hinton added. "If that`s the case, Chevron would have an interest in shielding
them from investigators. What better way to do that than to make sure they have
lawyers paid for by Chevron?" 

Chevron is accused in the lawsuit -- which is being held in Ecuador at the
company`s request -- of dumping billions of gallons of waste into Amazon
waterways when Texaco (bought by Chevron in 2001) operated an oil concession
from 1964 to 1990. A court-appointed Special Master found that 100% of Chevron`s
former well sites in Ecuador are highly contaminated with cancer-causing toxins.
The Special Master also found that Chevron`s own evidence proves the case
against the company. 

The YouTube videos show Hansen and Borja discussing a $3 million bribe with an
Ecuadorian man, Patricio Garcia, who claimed he was connected to Ecuador`s
government. The ostensible purpose of the bribe was for Hansen to secure a
contract to perform environmental remediation should Chevron lose the case,
according to the oil company. But Chevron has presented no evidence Garcia was
connected to Ecuador`s government, although he appears to have been a former
low-level official of the governing party. 

"Offering a bribe to Garcia to influence Ecuador`s government is like trying to
influence the White House by offering a bribe to a maintenance worker at the
Democratic National Committee," said Hinton. "There is no logic to it unless it
was part of a script contrived by Chevron." 

Chevron has produced no independent evidence to confirm the men were actually
trying to bribe the official, as opposed to stage-managing a meeting to create
"evidence" Chevron could use to blemish the trial. More suspicious is that there
appears to be no logical reason to discuss a remediation contract given that the
appeals process will delay a final judgment for years, and that no determination
has been made that the judge would have any role in awarding or approving
remediation contracts, said Andrew Woods, an American lawyer who advises the
plaintiffs. 

Several sources, including trial judge Juan Nunez, have charged Chevron with
doctoring the tapes by splicing them together. Though Chevron has said both
Borja and Hansen were taping, the company has released only one video. The
evidence that Judge Nunez said he would rule against Chevron appears fabricated,
as the judge is off camera at the time and on 13 other occasions had told Borja
and Hansen that he had not decided how he would rule. 

Hinton pointed out that Chevron thus far has refused to release the full tapes,
allowed access to the person who edited them, revealed the name of a forensics
expert who examined the tapes, or clarified the role of its own lawyers in
scripting the meetings that were taped. It also has provided no information on
Hansen`s relationship to the company or his work history, or specified how much
it has paid Borja to come to the U.S. And now, the two key witnesses - Borja and
Hansen -- are unavailable for questioning because Chevron has arranged for them
to have criminal defense lawyers, said Hinton. 

"This looks more and more like a scheme planned down to the last detail at the
highest levels of Chevron`s headquarters in the U.S.," said Hinton. "It is clear
that the only possible way to get to the truth of what happened is through an
investigation from U.S. authorities that includes questioning of Chevron`s own
lawyers." 

Laurie Levenson, a former federal prosecutor who teaches at Loyola Law School in
Los Angeles, was quoted by Bloomberg on September 9 as saying that Borja and
Hansen could face penalties for secretly recording the meetings. 

In relation to McNamara`s representation of Hansen, Levinson told Bloomberg:
"Either Chevron has turned into the biggest Good Samaritan out there or they
have allied interests with this man &#8230;. The ball is in Chevron`s court to give a
better explanation of whether they`ll pay his legal costs out of the goodness of
their heart or as part of a contractual arrangement." 

On her website, Arguedas says she has represented "dozens of high-profile
clients-many of whom prefer to remain anonymous-charged with public corruption,
securities fraud, intellectual-property theft, environmental offenses, sex
crimes, drug manufacturing and trafficking, and murder, as well as hundreds of
lesser-known individuals accused of far less serious crimes." McNamara is
described on her firm`s website as a "Northern California Super Lawyer".

The Amazon Defense Coalition represents the plaintiffs in the lawsuit and dozens
of rainforest communities and five indigenous groups that inhabit Ecuador`s
Northern Amazon region. The mission of the Coalition is to protect the
environment and secure social justice through grass roots organizing, political

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co agreed to buy carbon offset aggregator EcoSecurities for 122.9 million pounds ($204 million) on Monday, trumping a bid from the firm's co-founder, to boost its carbon-credit trading business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;J.P.Morgan Ventures Energy Corp., a subsidiary of the bank, said its 100 pence-a-share bid, made through Carbon Acquisition Company, had the backing of shareholders representing 19.9 percent of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It said EcoSecurities had successfully realized value from sourcing, developing and trading emission reductions, and it noted the firm had recorded its first period of profitability in the first half.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The offer represents a 120 percent premium to the group's share price before the start of the offer period on June 4.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It looks like JPMorgan is backing the current management to take the business private," said Ken Rumph, an equity analyst at Nomura Code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ireland-based EcoSecurities Group Plc develops clean energy projects under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism, which allows companies to export cuts in greenhouse gas emissions to emerging countries like China and India, where such reductions are cheaper to make.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EcoSecurities shares were up 11.5 percent at 101.5 pence by 1411 GMT (10:11 a.m. EDT).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Carbon Acquisition Company said the acceptances included 13.6 million shares held by current and former directors and 9.9 million shares owned by Credit Suisse.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the offer statement, Carbon Acquisition said the acceptances would remain binding in the event of a competing offer being made.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a scorched earth, blocking tactic (and) it's a problem for Guanabara if these blocking minority figures are holding out," Rumph added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EcoSecurities rebuffed on September 1 a revised 90 pence-a-share offer from Guanabara Holdings, set up by EcoSecurities co-founder and former president Pedro Moura Costa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The board of Guanabara said Monday afternoon it noted Carbon Acquisition's offer and will make a further announcement following a review of its own position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It remains to be seen if Guanabara will improve its offer and bid something closer to our 'bare-bones' valuation of 114 pence per share," said Mirabaud's Agustin Hochschild.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, Guanabara reached a deal with then rival bidder EDF Trading, a unit of French utility EDF, offering it the option to purchase a portion of EcoSecurities' pre-2012 offset portfolio if Guanabara's bid was successful.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.6027 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cypress Further Distinguishes Itself by Earning a Microsoft Competency in
ISV/Software Solutions, Business Intelligence and SOA and Business Processes
NORTH RICHLAND HILLS, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Cypress Software Systems LP, a developer of credit risk management technology
for banks, credit unions and other financial institutions, announced it has
attained Gold Certified Partner status in the Microsoft Partner Program with
competency in ISV/Software Solutions, Business Intelligence and SOA and Business
Process. 

As a Gold Certified Partner, Cypress has demonstrated proficiency with Microsoft
technologies and a proven ability to meet customer needs. Microsoft partners
receive a rich set of benefits, including access, training and support that give
them a competitive advantage in the marketplace. 

"Achieving Gold Certified Partner status is a considerable achievement for
Cypress, and illustrates our commitment to industry-best development standards
and excellent customer service," said Stephen G. Sargent, president and CEO of
Cypress Software Systems. "This accomplishment also assures our clients that our
Mark IV, BizMark and AppMark loan automation software meet and exceed the design
and programming principles established by Microsoft. In addition, the benefits
provided through the membership will further enhance future offerings and
positively impact our client base." 

"Customers are looking for partner companies that can bridge the gap between
their business demands and technology capabilities," said Allison Watson,
corporate vice president of the Worldwide Partner Group at Microsoft Corp. "They
need to trust in a company that can act as an expert adviser for their long-term
strategic technology plans. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners, which have
certified expertise and direct training and support from Microsoft, can build a
positive customer experience with our technologies. Today, Microsoft recognizes
Cypress Software Systems as a new Gold Certified Partner for demonstrating its
expertise in providing customer satisfaction using Microsoft products and
technology." 

As one of the requirements for attaining Gold Certified Partner status, Cypress
had to declare a Microsoft Competency. Microsoft Competencies are designed to
help differentiate a partner`s capabilities with specific Microsoft technologies
to customers looking for a particular type of solution. Each Competency has a
unique set of requirements and benefits, formulated to accurately represent the
specific skills and services that partners bring to the technology industry.
Within select Competencies, there are Specializations that focus on specific
solution areas that recognize deeper expertise within that Competency. Serving
as a specialized path to earning those Competencies, Specializations give direct
access to the tools and resources that support that specific area of focus. 

The ISV/Software Solutions Competency recognizes the skill and focus partners
bring to a particular solution set. Microsoft Gold Certified Partners that have
obtained this competency have a successful record of developing and marketing
packed software based on Microsoft technologies. 

The Business Intelligence Competency is designed for partners that specialize in
Microsoft Business Intelligence Platform and Performance Management. These
partners are fully equipped to help customers leverage the data they`re already
collecting to build more-effective business strategies. For customers, accurate
business intelligence often equals a competitive advantage, which is why robust
business-intelligence solutions are always in demand. 

The SOA and Business Process Competency is for systems integrators, solutions
and services providers, and software developers with proven proficiency in
implementing and deploying integrated, interoperable, and agile solutions that
connect information, systems, people, and processes. 

Cypress` products include Mark IV, a loan software platform that automates the
consumer loan application and decisioning process. With Mark IV, service
associates electronically input application information while interviewing
customers. The software then quickly retrieves credit reports, efficiently
reviews sources of repayment, and deploys the institution`s loan policies. The
result is a fast, quality loan decision. 

Similarly, the company`s BizMark software processes small business loan
applications, enabling lenders to efficiently handle small business commercial
credit requests for lines of credit, term loans, corporate leases and corporate
credit cards. The software gathers principal and financial statement data;
retrieves and interprets consumer and business credit reports; performs ratio
analysis; and scores the results. 

Cypress` AppMark product is designed for community banks with assets of $250
million or less, automating all aspects of the consumer loan application process
from data entry to underwriting to decisioning. The software is hosted and
delivered through Cypress` application service provider (ASP) network,
eliminating the need for Cypress clients to purchase additional hardware,
software and IT staff to run and maintain the application. 

The Microsoft Partner Program was launched in October 2003 and represents
Microsoft`s ongoing commitment to the success of partners worldwide. The program
offers a single, integrated partnering framework that recognizes partner
expertise, rewards the total impact that partners have in the technology
marketplace, and delivers more value to help partners` businesses be successful.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp. called the claim by Canadian developer i4i Inc. that it plotted to drive the company out of business "distorted," and "a breathless tale" that was not supported by the evidence, according to a court documents.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the least, Microsoft told the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal District, it deserves a new trial. "At minimum, a new trial is warranted," the company said in a reply brief filed Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Microsoft also pressed the appeals court for a complete reversal, saying that decisions made by the Texas lower court led "to erroneous verdicts of infringement and validity, and grossly unsupportable damages."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's response brief saved its most blistering words for i4i, the Toronto-based company that in 2007 said Microsoft illegally used its patented technology to add XML editing, and "custom" XML features, to Word 2003, and later, to Word 2007.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Having little to rebut Microsoft's arguments on the merits, i4i devotes the majority of its brief to a distorted presentation of irrelevant 'evidence'," read Microsoft's brief. "i4i labors mightily to paint Microsoft pejoratively, portraying it as a once-close 'business partner' that supposedly stabbed i4i in the back and 'usurped' i4i's patented invention."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, i4i claimed Microsoft marketed the former's XML software to potential customers at the same time it planned to make that software obsolete by building similar features into Microsoft Word using its technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Within days of a 2001 meeting between representatives of the two companies, according to an internal e-mail, someone at Microsoft said, "[I]f we do the work properly, there won't be a need for their [i4i's] product," i4i said as it linked the two events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's nothing but a tall tale, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Unfortunately for i4i, the truth is both comparatively mundane and innocent: After a handful of unfruitful meetings, i4i and Microsoft went their separate ways and Microsoft later released the custom XML functionality for Word that it had told i4i it was developing," the company's lawyers said in the brief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's reply was the latest round in a patent infringement case that started two years ago when i4i accused the software maker of using its technology in Microsoft's popular Word software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last May, a Texas jury said Microsoft was guilty of patent infringement, and awarded i4i $200 million in damages. In August, U.S. District Court Judge Leonard Davis added more than $90 million in additional damages and interest to Microsoft's bill, then issued an injunction that would have prevented it from selling Word 2003 and Word 2007 as of Oct. 10.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft quickly won a fast-track appeal after warning the three appellate judges that the injunction would create sales chaos for the company and its partners, including Hewlett-Packard Co. and Dell Inc., the world's two largest computer makers. The injunction, said Microsoft, meant it might have to pull Word, and the Office 2003 and Office 2007 suites, off the market for months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, the court of appeals suspended the injunction while it hears and decides Microsoft's appeal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of Microsoft's brief was a recitation of points made last month in its request for an appeal, when it lambasted Davis for his handling of the case and called the verdict a "miscarriage of justice." Microsoft again hit on some of the same points, criticizing Davis' rulings during the trial and arguing that i4i's patent was obvious, and thus not protected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the company's lawyers also disputed claims made by i4i in the brief it submitted Sept. 8, particularly the conclusion that Microsoft had schemed to tout i4i's software on the one hand, and use its technology in Word on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Most of the evidence demonstrates only that i4i attended certain meetings with Microsoft," the company said. "There is absolutely no evidence in this record from which a juror reasonably could infer that Microsoft had knowledge of the contents of the [i4i] patent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nor should the injunction against selling current versions of Word stand, said Microsoft. "Even assuming that i4i had shown both competition and harm tied to that competition, an injunction is inappropriate because i4i has not shown that whatever harm it has suffered is irreparable and cannot be remedied by money damages," Microsoft stated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Today's reply brief is an opportunity to reinforce our key assertions in this case," said Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz on Monday. "We believe the district court erred in its interpretation and application of the law in this case [and] we look forward to the September 23 hearing before the U.S. Court of Appeals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kutz's reference was to the oral hearing scheduled for next week, when both parties will present their arguments before the panel of three judges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i4i was unavailable for comment on Microsoft's brief.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Represents the Largest, Long-Term LNG Sale Signed Between Australia and Korea
PERTH, Australia--(Business Wire)--
Australian subsidiaries of Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) and Korea Gas
Corporation (KOGAS) have signed a Heads of Agreement (HOA) in Perth last night
for the delivery of 1.5 million tonnes per annum (MTPA) of Liquefied Natural Gas
(LNG) for 15 years from the Gorgon project. 

As part of the arrangement, Chevron and KOGAS have an option to extend the
agreement for a further five years. The parties are also discussing LNG sales
and an equity purchase from Chevron`s Wheatstone project, to be located in the
western Pilbara region about 200 kilometres south of the Wheatstone natural gas
field. 

Chevron Australia Managing Director Roy Krzywosinski, welcomed KOGAS as a major
customer of the Gorgon project, which received approval to start construction
earlier this week. 

"This agreement represents the largest, long-term LNG sale between Australia and
Korea, and the first long term sale between KOGAS and an Australian supplier.
Korea is the world`s second largest importer of LNG and is a desirable market
for LNG," said Krzywosinski. 

"The sale of Gorgon LNG to Korea reflects Australia`s growing reputation as an
LNG supplier. We expect to build on this relationship with KOGAS as we move
forward with our Australian LNG projects." 

This announcement follows Sale and Purchase Agreements with GS Caltex, Osaka Gas
and Tokyo Gas, which were announced on 10 September 2009. Chevron expects
additional agreements for the sale of Gorgon LNG to be executed in the coming
months. 

KOGAS was incorporated by the Korean Government in 1983 and has grown to become
the largest single LNG buyer in the world. It operates three LNG import
terminals as well as a gas pipeline network spanning more than 2700 kilometres
across Korea. 

The Gorgon project is operated by Chevron Australia Pty Ltd (50 percent) in
joint venture with the Australian subsidiaries of ExxonMobil (25 percent) and
Shell (25 percent). The project`s scope includes a three-train, 15 MTPA LNG
facility; a carbon dioxide injection project expected to be the world`s largest;
and a domestic gas plant. 

Chevron is one of the world's leading integrated energy companies and through
its Australian subsidiaries, has been present in Australia for more than 50
years. With the ingenuity and commitment of more than 1,400 people, Chevron
Australia leads the development of the Gorgon and Wheatstone natural gas
projects; manages its equal one-sixth interest in the North West Shelf Venture;
and operates Australia`s largest onshore oilfield on Barrow Island and the
Thevenard Island oilfields. The company is also a participant in the Browse
liquefied natural gas development and is a significant investor in exploration
offshore northwest Australia, one of Chevron`s four global focus areas for
exploration. 

In addition, Chevron`s Perth-based Global Technology Centre provides technology
support and solutions to the company`s operations in Australia and around the
world. www.ChevronAustralia.com

&lt;p&gt;DeviceAnywhere`s Test Center Solution Significantly Reduces the Amount of Time
Required by Microsoft to Deploy and Maintain Quality of Service in Windows Live
for Mobile
SAN MATEO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
DeviceAnywhere&#8482;, the industry leader in end-to-end mobile application testing
and development, today announced that Microsoft&#174; is using DeviceAnywhere Test
Center&#8482;, a SaaS platform, to manage the testing associated with its
pre-deployment process and post-deployment support for Windows Live for mobile.
DeviceAnywhere`s solution enables Microsoft to support their browse linking
agreements and provide a quality experience for its partners by identifying and
solving issues that may be specific to the operator`s network or suite of
devices. 

"DeviceAnywhere`s solution has saved our department a lot of time and headaches
by eliminating most of the tedious, manual tasks associated with our in-house
mobile testing process. We no longer have to chase down lost devices and SIMs,
dig through boxes of chargers, or even track multiple phone bills and expense
reports," said Mark Boyce, Mobile Browse Program Manager of the Windows Live
Deployment team at Microsoft. "Moreover, from the troubleshooting perspective,
we`ve significantly reduced the amount of time it takes to get to the root of
most issues-and solve them-now that we have real-time access to DeviceAnywhere`s
broad set of devices and networks." 

Since replacing their in-house `Device Cabinet` and integrating DeviceAnywhere`s
Test Center solution into their testing process, Windows Live`s deployment team
now has remote access to more than 2,000 real devices, available on over 30
global carriers and network providers. This real-time interaction with live
devices has given the Windows Live Deployment team members the newfound ability
to reproduce issues reported from the field using the same model of device on
the same network, investigate and develop against specific devices when needed,
or even access services from various networks around the globe without roaming
charges. Additionally, DeviceAnywhere provided a convenient interface for
Windows Live program managers to demo new designs across multiple devices. 

"We are pleased to support the continued success of Windows Live for mobile to
help users benefit from the same excellent, online experience on mobile devices
as they enjoy when plugged into their home computer," said Faraz Syed, CEO and
Co-Founder of DeviceAnywhere. "DeviceAnywhere Test Center provides a SaaS
solution that allows Microsoft to maintain this high level of quality by
enabling live testing on a wide range of networks and devices, while
considerably reducing the physical management and maintenance overhead
associated with in-house efforts."

&lt;p&gt;Web Help Desk announces out-of-the-box integration with Microsoft System Center
Configuration Manager (SCCM), formerly Microsoft Systems Management Server (SMS)
FREMONT, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Web Help Desk, a leading provider of practical, flexible and comprehensive ITSM
help desk software,announces out-of-the-box integration with Microsoft System
Center Configuration Manager (SCCM), formerly Microsoft Systems Management
Server (SMS). Theseamless integration delivers scheduled imports of hardware and
software asset discovery data from Microsoft SCCM or SMS to the Web Help Desk
database, providing instant access to up-to-date SCCM asset data within the Web
Help Desk browser-based interface.

This unique approach to out-of-the-box integration conserves IT budget resources
by removing the need to purchase expensive, proprietary discovery modules from
the help desk vendor. The availability of validated asset data directly within a
service request ticket creates an efficient "one stop shop" for ITSM
fulfillment.

Joel Gibby, Systems Specialist with Camas School District #117 in Camas,
Washington proclaimed, "The Web Help Desk SMS integration setup couldn't be
easier. We simply put in our SMS server IP, database name, username and
password. The level of integration is great - if an asset discovered by SMS has
a last logged on user, it will show up under that user's assets in Web Help
Desk." Mr. Gibby continued, "All installed software on an asset is listed, along
with IP, MAC, model number, serial number, disk and memory usage. Web Help Desk
even tells you how to setup RC.EXE, so that you can launch SMS Remote Tools
directly from the help desk software. I'm impressed. This level of integration
really jump-started our use of the asset management features within Web Help
Desk."

The inclusion of Microsoft SCCM and SMS integration into the application`s
feature set solidifies Web Help Desk`s commitment to cross platform
compatibility and vendor neutrality. Web Help Desk currently provides support
for all modern web browsers, virtually any server-side operating system and most
major databases. This flexibility allows organizations to maximize their
existing infrastructure and provides peace of mind that any future
infrastructure changes will not disrupt their Web Help Desk deployment.

"This hardware and software data is already available in your SCCM or SMS
deployment. Why not make it easily accessible to your service desk tickets,
where it's most needed?" explained Terry Siddall, VP at Web Help Desk. "Having
this asset information within the service request ticket makes perfect sense,
but buying another help desk vendor's discovery system to provide the same
information you've already paid for does not."

Microsoft SCCM integration is available to on-premise licenses running on
Windows Server, Mac OS X, Linux or Unix, and on Web Help Desk SaaS hosted plans
as well.Learn more at www.WebHelpDesk.com.

About Web Help Desk:

management solution for ITSM professionals who seek to simplify and automate
their increasingly complex service environments. The extensive feature set of

&lt;p&gt;  SAN RAMON, CA, Sep 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Sabrix, Inc., a leading provider of transaction tax management for
companies of all sizes, today announced that SDI Industries
(http://www.sdiindustries.com), a leading logistics solution provider,
has saved tens of thousands of dollars annually using Sabrix Managed Tax
Service (MTS) integrated with Microsoft Dynamics NAV.

    Prior to Sabrix, SDI Industries (SDI) utilized a laborious, manual process
requiring 40 hours a month to meet their sales and use tax compliance
obligation, including an intensive reconciliation process at the end of
each month. Despite this investment of time and resources, the process was
error prone including overpayment of tens of thousands of dollars in sales
tax and significant re-work based on SDI's clients highlighting
discrepancies.

    "As we proceed with Sabrix, this type of on-demand service will help us
continually and cost-effectively stay in compliance and fine-tune our tax
management environment," said Mark A. Conrad, Chief Financial Officer of
SDI. "Sabrix is providing excellent value. The implementation and
integration could not have gone any better and now we don't have to sweat
over sales tax compliance and the associated costs and distractions
anymore."

    In 2008, SDI embarked on remedying the issue by installing a new
accounting system, Microsoft Dynamics NAV that could easily integrate
with a robust sales and use tax solution. After evaluating multiple
market alternatives, SDI concluded that an outsourced approach that
entrusted their sales and use tax compliance to proven experts offered
greater value than continuing to manage it in-house using software and
their own resources. SDI selected Sabrix MTS, an outsourced sales and use
tax service that includes an on-demand version of the same trusted tax
platform that powers over $1.7 trillion in transaction taxes for
companies of all sizes, combined with professional services from a
multidisciplinary team of tax experts and SAS 70 certified processes.
Other solutions provided software, but did not alleviate the need for
internal staff with tax and technical expertise to manage it.

    Facing a very short window to get its new tax system up and running, SDI
worked with Microsoft partner OfficeOps to accelerate the integration
process.

    "Sabrix has clearly invested in understanding Dynamics NAV and has built a
sophisticated integration that is optimized to work with the specific
capabilities that NAV offers. As a result, implementations are designed to
be fast, smooth and easy, allowing NAV customers to easily add sales and
use tax compliance capability with minimal disruption to their existing
processes," said Jack Gentle, CEO of OfficeOps. "SDI's combined solution
was in the testing phases within two weeks and was fully operational in
under a month."

    Benefits achieved by SDI by using Sabrix MTS integrated with Microsoft
Dynamics NAV include:


--  Streamlined tax process -- Sabrix MTS automated SDI's entire sales and
    use tax process, from rules-based tax determination to applying up-to-date
    tax rates.  The first month alone, SDI shaved 25 hours from the
    reconciliation process and at least 10 hours on management of day-to-day
    tax processes.
--  Ensured tax accuracy -- SDI now has confidence that its tax

&lt;p&gt;  SHELTON, CT, Sep 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
CYA Technologies, an enChoice(R) company, today announced the
availability of CYA SmartRecovery(TM) version 3.3 for IBM(R) FileNet(R)
P8 4.5. This release of CYA SmartRecovery(TM), which enables hot,
synchronized backups and granular recovery of ECM system information, is
offered with an optional Records Retention Module (RRM). The RRM destroys
content and metadata stored within CYA backups in alignment with policies
set in FileNet Records Manager.

    "The development of the RRM was driven by our customers, who need it to
ensure that records are destroyed after retention periods required by
corporate, industry, and government policies such as Sarbanes-Oxley have
expired," said Mike Fernandes, director of product management and services
for CYA. "This release gives P8 4.5 users peace-of-mind that their
information assets are fully recoverable in their original states at the
object level -- but only for as long as they want them to be after
mandated retention periods."

    CYA SmartRecovery helps address issues associated with P8 repository
corruptions, meeting stringent service levels, and managing shrinking
backup windows. CYA's experience with P8 clients has shown that:


--  Existing backup strategies often do not enable the business to meet P8
    uptime requirements;
--  Existing backup strategies can result in repository corruptions if
    backups are performed hot, because content and metadata are not captured in
    a synchronized manner; and
--  Existing backup strategies cannot meet required recovery times for
    information that has been lost or corrupted due to logical failures.
    

    
This release enables IBM FileNet P8 4.5 customers to perform hot,
synchronized backups and granular recovery of P8 repository information.
CYA SmartRecovery's application-aware technology works seamlessly with
existing backup technologies to ensure 24x7 data accessibility and
integrity, help meet or exceed stringent service level agreements, and
safeguard organizations against the ramifications of logical failures by
enabling one, several, or thousands of objects to be quickly restored back
into the repository in their original state, while P8 stays online.

&lt;p&gt;  SAN RAMON, CA, Sep 15 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Sabrix, Inc., a leading provider of transaction tax management for
companies of all sizes, today announced that SDI Industries
(http://www.sdiindustries.com), a leading logistics solution provider,
has saved tens of thousands of dollars annually using Sabrix Managed Tax
Service (MTS) integrated with Microsoft Dynamics NAV.

    Prior to Sabrix, SDI Industries (SDI) utilized a laborious, manual process
requiring 40 hours a month to meet their sales and use tax compliance
obligation, including an intensive reconciliation process at the end of
each month. Despite this investment of time and resources, the process was
error prone including overpayment of tens of thousands of dollars in sales
tax and significant re-work based on SDI's clients highlighting
discrepancies.

    "As we proceed with Sabrix, this type of on-demand service will help us
continually and cost-effectively stay in compliance and fine-tune our tax
management environment," said Mark A. Conrad, Chief Financial Officer of
SDI. "Sabrix is providing excellent value. The implementation and
integration could not have gone any better and now we don't have to sweat
over sales tax compliance and the associated costs and distractions
anymore."

    In 2008, SDI embarked on remedying the issue by installing a new
accounting system, Microsoft Dynamics NAV that could easily integrate
with a robust sales and use tax solution. After evaluating multiple
market alternatives, SDI concluded that an outsourced approach that
entrusted their sales and use tax compliance to proven experts offered
greater value than continuing to manage it in-house using software and
their own resources. SDI selected Sabrix MTS, an outsourced sales and use
tax service that includes an on-demand version of the same trusted tax
platform that powers over $1.7 trillion in transaction taxes for
companies of all sizes, combined with professional services from a
multidisciplinary team of tax experts and SAS 70 certified processes.
Other solutions provided software, but did not alleviate the need for
internal staff with tax and technical expertise to manage it.

    Facing a very short window to get its new tax system up and running, SDI
worked with Microsoft partner OfficeOps to accelerate the integration
process.

    "Sabrix has clearly invested in understanding Dynamics NAV and has built a
sophisticated integration that is optimized to work with the specific
capabilities that NAV offers. As a result, implementations are designed to
be fast, smooth and easy, allowing NAV customers to easily add sales and
use tax compliance capability with minimal disruption to their existing
processes," said Jack Gentle, CEO of OfficeOps. "SDI's combined solution
was in the testing phases within two weeks and was fully operational in
under a month."

    Benefits achieved by SDI by using Sabrix MTS integrated with Microsoft
Dynamics NAV include:


--  Streamlined tax process -- Sabrix MTS automated SDI's entire sales and
    use tax process, from rules-based tax determination to applying up-to-date
    tax rates.  The first month alone, SDI shaved 25 hours from the
    reconciliation process and at least 10 hours on management of day-to-day
    tax processes.
--  Ensured tax accuracy -- SDI now has confidence that its tax
    determinations and calculations are correct and that it is not over-
    charging or under-charging its clients.
--  Fast, seamless integration with Microsoft Dynamics NAV -- Sabrix MTS
    was up and running and fully integrated with Microsoft Dynamics NAV in
    record time, with a seamless flow of information across the integrated
    environment.
--  Cost-effective, on-demand expert service -- Sabrix's team of tax
    experts is available to back up SDI's transaction tax management process,
    on demand.  This includes providing expert advice on complex taxability
    issues and extends to nexus studies and audit support.

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day
the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting
stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Fannie Mae (FNM), Freddie Mac (FRE), Bank of America (BAC), J.P. Morgan (JPM)

Here are highlights from Monday`s Analyst Blog:

Obama On the Street

"Fannie Mae (FNM) and Freddie Mac (FRE) had been taken over by the government.
Other large firms teetered on the brink of insolvency. Credit markets froze as
banks refused to lend not only to families and businesses, but to one another.
Five trillion dollars of Americans' household wealth evaporated in the span of
just three months.That was just one year ago."

What a difference a year makes. 

A huge part of the problem is that the response to the "too big to fail" problem
was to make the biggest institutions even bigger, as Bank of America (BAC)
swallowed Countrywide and Merrill, J.P. Morgan (JPM) gobbled up Bear Stearns and
Wells Fargo (WFC) snacked on Wachovia. Higher capital requirements across the
board, and especially for the largest firms, would help provide more stability
to the system. However, another approach that might work better would be some
anti-trust type actions to break up the TBTF institutions into several smaller
firms, so if one of them went under it would not be a big problem for the
system.

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Fomento Economico Mexico (FMX) as the Bull of
the Day and Valero Energy (VLO) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on Boeing (BA), Coca Cola (KO) and Aflac (AFL). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Fomento SAB (FMX)

We are reiterating our recommendation on Fomento Economico Mexico (FMX) shares
given its relative immunity from the global economic downturn. Being a producer
of a low-cost, daily use product, and focused on domestic markets, FMX is less
exposed to the global economic downturn. 

We are also optimistic about the joint venture between Jugos del Valle and the
Coca-Cola company. The company has been successful in boosting its Brazilian
business and the Oxxo stores continue to grow fast. 

Our baseline outlook reflects continued economic growth in Latin America. We
consider Latin America to be one of the most attractive areas for the beverage
industry, due to positive demographics. 

Bear of the Day: 

Valero Energy (VLO)

We reiterate our Underperform rating for Valero (VLO) shares as a combination of
weak demand, excess production capacity and narrowing crude quality spreads are
expected to weigh on near-term margins. 

In addition to the near-term margin issues, commissioning of new refineries and
extension projects indicate future struggle as global demand for almost all fuel
products (except gasoline) is trending down. 

The medium to long-term outlook also remains cloudy, with unfavorable regulatory
changes (growing biofuel mandates) weighing on demand growth and limiting margin
gains. Being the largest independent refiner, Valero remains particularly
exposed to this unfavorable macro backdrop. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Deficit Not As Bad As Feared

Since the end of WWII, Consumption has only averaged 64.7% of the economy. If
consumers are not spending, then businesses are not going to invest to increase
capacity. And anyway, in recent decades when businesses have invested to
increase capacity, they have not done so in the U.S. -- they have spent the
money in Asia. Thus I (Investment) also falls. 

We have made good progress on improving the (X-M) or net exports part of the
equation, even if we have seen a little bit of back-sliding in the last two
months. However, with so much of our imports (M) being oil, it is hard to see
how over the medium-term we can make up the difference entirely through slowing
imports and expanding exports (X). 

A weak dollar will help in that regard, but unless we have a complete collapse
of the dollar (which has lots of other problems) I don`t see it doing the trick,
especially given the magnitude of the needed consumer deleveraging. However,
dollar weakness will greatly benefit U.S. exporters such as Boeing (BA) and
those firms like Coca Cola (KO) and Aflac (AFL) that get most of their earnings
from abroad.

&lt;p&gt;   * New Zune on sale Tuesday, ahead of shopping season&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;* 32 gigabyte version cheaper than comparable Apple iPod&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;* No plans for a "Zune phone"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE, Sept 15 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O)
launched a slimmer, revamped version of its Zune handheld music
and video player on Tuesday as the software giant makes its
latest attempt to compete with Apple Inc's (AAPL.O) ubiquitous
iPod.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The touch-screen Zune HD, which features a radio receiver
and wi-fi, is priced just below Apple's comparable iPod Touch
in the hopes of grabbing market share as the U.S. holiday
shopping season nears.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device, which goes on sale on Tuesday, has a claim of
technical superiority over Apple's iPods, with a
state-of-the-art organic light emitting diode screen and
ability to relay high definition video to a television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But it will struggle to make an impact on the stylish iPod,
which took the digital music player mainstream when launched in
2001 and now controls more than 70 percent of the market. The
original Zune did not come onto the market until 2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft announced the pricing of the new models last
month, pitching its black 16 gigabyte model at $219.99 and
platinum 32 gigabyte version at $289.99. Customized red, green
and blue colors are also available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, that was well below $399 Apple charged for the
32 gigabyte iPod Touch, but Apple has since cut prices and is
now offering an updated version of the same memory size for
$299. Apple also now offers a 64 gigabyte Touch a video camera
on its iPod Nano model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are no plans to add a camera to the Zune, marketing
manager Brian Seitz said on Monday. He also said there were no
plans to create a Zune phone, which might rival Apple's popular
iPhone, despite recurring talk in the tech industry. He did,
however, say that Zune's capabilities could be added to other
platforms, including Windows Mobile, suggesting that a
smartphone with a Zune function may yet be realized.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's player is backed by the Zune Marketplace, which
rivals Apple's iTunes store, where users can stream, buy or
rent music, videos and films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The device features only a handful of applications, such as
MSN weather and some video games, but it is planning to add
applications featuring social networking sites Twitter and
Facebook in November. Unlike Apple, Microsoft does not have an
open marketplace for application development, and is not
charging for them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing Bernard Orr)

to initiate action against Chevron in the United States for
possible violations of U.S. law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S.-based oil company already faces a $27 billion
environmental lawsuit in the Andean country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; That lawsuit began 16 years ago, when Ecuador's indigenous

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - The government will have another month to seek an indictment against or reach a settlement with a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) programmer accused of stealing trade secrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;U.S. Magistrate Judge James Francis has delayed further proceedings by 30 days until October 16 to let the government and the former programmer, Sergey Aleynikov, continue talks, a spokeswoman for prosecutors in the case said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a court filing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph Facciponti said talks to resolve the case were held as recently as September 14 and that justice would be served by allowing more time. Talks were previously extended on August 3 and August 17.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is common for prosecutors to ask to extend a deadline for seeking an indictment, while plea negotiations are taking place. The request does not mean a settlement is forthcoming.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prosecutors have accused Aleynikov of downloading stolen Goldman proprietary code onto a home computer, a theft that could cost the Wall Street bank millions of dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov has told investigators Goldman knew he had worked on the relevant code from home previously without complaint and that he had no intent to steal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The FBI arrested Aleynikov on July 3 at Newark Liberty International Airport. He was later freed on $750,000 bail following several days of detention.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a hearing on August 10, Aleynikov's lawyer said she would seek a "deferred prosecution" agreement for her client. Such agreements let accused persons escape criminal charges so long as they do not break the law for some period of time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Aleynikov worked at Goldman in New York for two years before joining Chicago-based Teza Technologies LLC in June. Teza suspended him following his arrest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is U.S. v. Aleynikov, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York (Manhattan), No. 09-mag-01553.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel; editing by Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are in touch with Microsoft Corp and Yahoo Inc about their search engine deal, a source familiar with the situation said, with the talks seen more as exploratory than indicating any competition concerns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"There are ongoing informal discussions between the European Commission and Microsoft and Yahoo on their search engine partnership," the source said on Tuesday, without giving further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Antitrust experts said it was too early to say if the European Union executive could proceed to a formal probe. Regulators could have begun with a formal probe, so the informal start could be seen as a good sign for the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft confirmed discussions were taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we said when the agreement was announced, we anticipated that this deal will be closely reviewed in the United States and EU, and discussions in both geographies continue," said Microsoft spokesman Jack Evans. "We remain hopeful the deal will close in early 2010."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the Commission were not immediately available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo struck a 10-year Web search deal in July, seeking to challenge market leader Google Inc, which had 67.5 percent share of the worldwide search market in July, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;By combining their search engines, Yahoo and Microsoft, the number two and three players, would hold roughly 30 percent of the U.S. search market, making their combined audience a more attractive place for marketers to spend their ad dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last week, U.S. antitrust authorities requested more documents from the companies, indicating the possibility of a months-long review. Both companies have said they do not expect an antitrust review to be completed until early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yahoo shares were up 3.3 percent to $16.95 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq. Microsoft's stock was off 6 cents, or less than 1 percent, to $25.14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is also unclear whether the companies need approval from the European Commission or from national regulators in EU countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For high-profile cases which could raise complex issues, companies might want to get some reassurance from the Commission on whether there could be any competition concerns," said a Brussels-based antitrust lawyer who declined to be named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has expressed confidence that it can persuade regulators that a stronger rival for Google is in the best interests of the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Alexei Oreskovic in San Francisco; editing by Elaine Hardcastle, Tim Dobbyn and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;BRASILIA, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Brazil's antitrust regulator
said on Wednesday it had overruled action by a government agency
against Brazil's largest credit card processor VisaNet for alleged
anti-competitive practices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Justice Ministry's Secretariat of Economic Defense in
August had suspended a contract between Sao Paulo-based VisaNet
 VNET3.SA and Visa Inc (V.N) that it alleged gave the former
exclusive rights to grant retailers access to its credit card
payment system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the antitrust regulator Cade said on Wednesday that the
probe against VisaNet that is being conducted by the secretariat
will continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares in VisaNet rallied 6.6 percent to 16.90 reais.
Elsewhere in the sector Redecard RDCD3.SA, Brazil's
second-largest credit card processing company, jumped 2.3 percent

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON, Sept 16 (Reuters) - A top lobbyist for Wall
Street giant Goldman Sachs (GS.N) has been barred from
communicating with members and staff of the U.S. House of
Representatives Financial Services Committee, an aide to the
panel's chairman said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Democratic Representative Barney Frank has banished
Goldman's Michael Paese, a former committee staffer, from
dealing with the panel while it considers a long list of
financial reform proposals, some directly impacting Goldman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Mr. Paese left our offices in September 2008, and was not
allowed to communicate with any committee members or staff for
a period of one year due to normal ethics restrictions that
apply to all House and Senate employees," said Frank aide
Steven Adamske in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Out of an abundance of caution due to the nature of
financial regulation reform, the chairman has extended Mr.
Paese's recusal for another year," Adamske said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Frank's committee is dealing with a heavy load of proposed
legislation put forward by the Obama administration to tighten
regulation of banks and capital markets following the worst
financial crisis in generations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In an example of the Washington-Wall Street revolving door
culture, Paese was the committee's deputy staff director before
he quit to work for the Securities Industry and Financial
Markets Association as a lobbyist. Goldman hired him in April.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Paese could not immediately be reached for comment at
Goldman's Washington, D.C., office. A spokesman for the firm in
New York also could not immediately be reached.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finance, insurance and real estate firms spend more money
lobbying officials in Washington than any other sector of the
U.S. economy, according to the Center for Responsive Politics,
a non-partisan campaign finance and lobbying watchdog group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Within that sector, Goldman is a powerhouse. Since 1989 its
employees, their family members and political action committees
have donated $31.2 million to U.S. political candidates --
topping all other banks and financial firms, the center said.

Morgan</headline><body>


&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Joy Global (Nasdaq: JOYG) as the Bull of the
Day and Zions Bancorporation (Nasdaq: ZION) the Bear of the Day. In addition,
Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Fannie (NYSE: FNM), Freddie (NYSE:
FRE) and J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

We are confident about the long-term fundamentals of the mining industry, which
is further supported by a sustainable secular shift in commodity demand in the
emerging economies. This will provide Joy Global (Nasdaq: JOYG) substantial
growth potential once the global economy emerges from the ongoing turmoil. 

Joy Global aims at maximizing operating efficiency and useful life of mining
equipment through value-added aftermarket services, which gives the company
significant edge over its competitors. Additionally, the stable revenue stream
from the high-margin aftermarket operations help Joy Global offset its cyclical
original equipment business. 

Of late, Joy Global management has implemented several strategies to optimize
cost-structure and realign production capacity to cope with the slowing customer
orders and stay competitive amid the ongoing global slowdown. The company is
pushing its overall inventory and working capital efficiency. Moreover, Joy
Global is looking at increasingly relocating production capacity to low-cost
regions like China, Poland, and South Africa. These actions will improve
operational efficiency, boost profitability and also solidify long term
viability of the company. 

Bear of the Day: 

Given the high competitive pressures in the banking industry, we expect
continuous deposit pricing pressures as well as growth in higher cost funding
accounts to weigh on Zions Bancorporation's (Nasdaq: ZION) net interest margins
(NIM), creating headwinds on the revenue front. 

Loan growth has remained solid, but slowing growth in core deposits could cause
a negative mix shift, another setback for the NIM. Management expects deposit
growth to continue to lag loan growth and that a portion of future loan growth
may be funded from alternative higher cost funding sources. 

The growth through acquisition model exposes the company to the risk of
overpaying for targets. We are concerned about Zions commercial real estate
(CRE) exposure. CRE represents over one-third of Zions overall loan portfolio.
Continued weakness in the residential development and construction activity in
the southwest has resulted in further deterioration of credit metrics in the
past several quarters. Given the sluggish economic conditions, we expect credit
to further deteriorate across the industry in the coming quarters. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Obama and Market Regulation

Some of the proposals that President Obama has made sound reasonable and
possibly workable, but the real devil is in the details. He will attempt to
solve the 'too big to fail' problem by requiring the bigger, TBTF banks to hold
higher levels of capital than smaller non-systemically important banks. The big
question is how much higher? 

If it is only a nominal difference, then the big banks will be in a great
position. The Federal government will be in effect guaranteeing the debt of
those banks (just like it did for Fannie (NYSE: FNM) and Freddie (NYSE: FRE)
before taking them over). This will result in a much lower cost of capital for a
TBTF bank like J.P. Morgan (NYSE: JPM) than for your average mid sized bank. The
big banks will then be free to take the money and pile it all on 23 red on the
roulette wheel (metaphorically). If they win, the bank makes a fortune, which it
will then share generously with its top executives. If they lose, the taxpayers
will pick up the tab if the amount lost exceeds the bank's capital. Debt
obligations of the big banks will be almost as safe as treasuries.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 16 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp's (XOM.N)
idled 115,000 barrel-per-day gasoline-making fluid catalytic
cracker will likely be down for nearly two months for planned
maintenance at its 562,500 bpd Baytown, Texas, refinery,
traders said Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A company spokeswoman declined to discuss the duration of
the work on the unit, which began shutting on Tuesday,
according to a company announcement that day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Oil traders said the largest U.S. refinery may keep the
unit offline for about 60 days of maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "I think (work will last) 60 days," said one Gulf Coast
cash oil trader, seconding views from other market players.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Exxon officials say customers' needs will be met during the
unit's outage but declined to discuss turnaround specifics.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We never discuss duration of turnarounds so can't provide
any information to that effect," Neely Nelson, a spokeswoman
for the refinery, told Reuters in an email.

&lt;p&gt; * EU regulators in touch with Microsoft, Yahoo on deal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * U.S. regulators deepened review last week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Commission not available for comment
 (Adds Microsoft confirmation, comment)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRUSSELS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are
in touch with Microsoft Corp  (MSFT.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O)
about their search engine deal, a source familiar with the
situation said, with the talks seen more as exploratory than
indicating any competition concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There are ongoing informal discussions between the
European Commission and Microsoft and Yahoo on their search
engine partnership," the source said on Tuesday, without giving
further details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Antitrust experts said it was too early to say if the
European Union executive could proceed to a formal probe.
Regulators could have begun with a formal probe, so the
informal start could be seen as a good sign for the deal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft confirmed discussions were taking place.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"As we said when the agreement was announced, we anticipated
that this deal will be closely reviewed in the United States
and EU, and discussions in both geographies continue," said
Microsoft spokesman Jack Evans. "We remain hopeful the deal
will close in early 2010."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the Commission were not immediately
available to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft and Yahoo struck a 10-year Web search deal in
July, seeking to challenge market leader Google Inc (GOOG.O),
which had 67.5 percent share of the worldwide search market in
July, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By combining their search engines, Yahoo and Microsoft, the
number two and three players, would hold roughly 30 percent of
the U.S. search market, making their combined audience a more
attractive place for marketers to spend their ad dollars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, U.S. antitrust authorities requested more
documents from the companies, indicating the possibility of a
months-long review. Both companies have said they do not expect
an antitrust review to be completed until early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares were up 3.3 percent to $16.95 in afternoon
trading on Nasdaq. Microsoft's stock was off 6 cents, or less
than 1 percent, to $25.14.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is also unclear whether the companies need approval from
the European Commission or from national regulators in EU
countries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "For high-profile cases which could raise complex issues,
companies might want to get some reassurance from the
Commission on whether there could be any competition concerns,"
said a Brussels-based antitrust lawyer who declined to be
named.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Microsoft has expressed confidence that it can persuade
regulators that a stronger rival for Google is in the best
interests of the market.

&lt;p&gt;SGI Sets World Records in Standard Performance Evaluation Corporation (SPEC)
Benchmarks
FREMONT, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
SGI (NASDAQ:SGI) today announced that the SGI Altix 4700 platform, powered by
Dual-Core Intel Itanium Processor 9040 (1.6GHz), outperformed top competitors
including HP, IBM and Sun in all relevant Standard Performance Evaluation
Corporation (SPEC) benchmarks for performance and scalability. The SGI world
records were recently achieved at the Leibniz Supercomputing Centre (LRZ) in
Garching, Germany, and prove SGI to be the leading single-system image (SSI)
platform in the world, surpassing competitor performance by more than five times
in some cases. 

"SGI Altix outperformed HP, IBM and Sun," said Mark J. Barrenechea, president
and CEO of SGI. "Our customers require the fastest compute and storage systems
possible. For floating point arithmetic, we were five times faster than IBM, and
for Java, we were four times faster than Sun. SGI is pleased with setting these
world records in very relevant technology areas." 

SGI Altix 4700`s dominance in the three SPEC benchmarks illustrates that:

* SGI is more than five times faster than its next closest SSI competitor in the
SPECfp_rate_base2006 floating point performance benchmark. Altix 4700 proved 5.7
times faster than the Sun SPARC Enterprise 9000, its next closest SSI
competitor; IBM and HP products trailed further behind. 
* SGI performed over four times better in the SPECint_rate_base2006 integer
performance benchmark. Altix 4700 proved 4.3 times faster than the Sun product,
its next closest SSI competitor. 
* SGI outperforms IBM by almost three times in Java performance with SPECjbb2005
benchmark. Altix 4700 is the leader in Java performance as measured by
SPECjbb2005, outperforming IBM by 2.8 times. 
* SGI has five times higher aggregate memory bandwidth than its next closest
competitors. Altix 4700 has the highest aggregate memory bandwidth in the world,
five times higher than its next closest competitors, NEC and IBM.

"The results of these SPEC benchmarks are impressive, and SGI Altix has proven
to be a powerhouse among scale-up architectures for some of the most complex
real-world HPC applications in the world," said Steve Conway, IDC`s research
vice president of HPC. "For example, one Fortune 500 company we recently visited
reserves Altix for the firm's toughest jobs while assigning other work to
standard clusters. These SPEC benchmarks are an absolute home run and solidify
Altix`s position as a leading platform in its space." 

SGI Altix is a large, shared-memory SSI architecture that powers some of the
most important systems in the world, facilitating research in such fields as
global warming, fraud detection and homeland security. The SGI benchmarking
experts used an SSI node with 1024 Itanium cores and 4TB of memory with Novell`s
SuSE Linux Enterprise 10 operating environment to achieve these results in three
SPEC benchmarks: SPECjbb2005, SPECint_rate_base2006 and SPECfp_rate_base2006.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Sep 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
iYogi, the on-demand tech services company with a unique global delivery
model, announced today the results of a consumer poll regarding support
concerns and predictions for the upcoming launch of the new Microsoft
Windows 7 operating system. Based on responses from more than 1,000
Windows XP and Windows Vista users, 52 percent think that moving to a new
operating system and moving their data is a hassle, suggesting some real
frustrations on the near horizon. Nearly half (47 percent) think
upgrading to Microsoft Windows 7 may require a call to technical support
-- potentially causing a huge backlog of support needs, as up to 40
million copies of Windows 7 are expected to be sold in 2009, according to
IDC.

    "We predict that more than 40 percent of XP users will generate support
calls and inquiries globally this year and even more in 2010 as mass
adoption kicks in and people face the prospect of dealing with an entirely
new interface," said Vishal Dhar, President Marketing &amp; Co-founder of
iYogi. "We estimate twice as many support calls for current Windows XP
users than Windows Vista users, since Microsoft Windows XP users will
require a 'clean' install including migrating applications, settings and
drivers -- a potentially arduous, time-intensive task."

    Additional survey findings reveal:


--  58 percent of users think they will or may upgrade to Windows 7, an
    encouraging number considering some of the backlash surrounding Vista
--  Only 39 percent of users are aware that Windows 7 is launching soon,
    suggesting an increased flurry of help questions in the coming months as
    more people become aware of the upgrade options
    

    
iYogi has more has more than 90,000 annual subscribers and provides
thousands of single incident sessions every day on a 24/7 basis. Its
Global Delivery Platform delivers on the highest customer satisfaction
benchmarks in the industry and gets smarter with every customer

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. consumer spending will remain lackluster for the rest of 2009, Visa Inc's (V.N) chief executive said on Wednesday, as Americans struggle with the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, the world's largest payment network said payment volume fell less in August than in July in the United States, in a sign the contraction of the sector may be stabilizing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the way to recovery still looks challenging, Chief Executive Joseph Saunders said at a Barclays Capital conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What persists is a resistance to spend more money," said Saunders, who added he did not expect a significant uptick in consumer spending for the rest of 2009.

&lt;p&gt; * EU regulators in touch with Microsoft, Yahoo on deal&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * U.S. regulators deepened review last week&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Microsoft, Commission not available for comment
 (Adds attorney comments, background, stock prices)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Foo Yun Chee&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BRUSSELS, Sept 16 (Reuters) - EU antitrust regulators are
in touch with Microsoft Corp  (MSFT.O) and Yahoo Inc (YHOO.O)

search deal in July, seeking to challenge market leader Google
Inc (GOOG.O), which had 67.5 percent share of the worldwide
search market in July, according to comScore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By combining their search engines, Yahoo and Microsoft, the

competition than U.S. regulators, said Stephen Paul Mahinka, an
antitrust attorney at Morgan Lewis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; What is more, Mahinka said, the Commission has a history of
enforcement with Microsoft's business practices, which makes it
not surprising that its plan to partner with Yahoo on search
would face some scrutiny.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While Mahinka said it was impossible to tell whether the
talks might delay approval of the deal, regulators at the very
least do not appear to be completely opposed to the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's more positive than the alternative," a formal review,
he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Yahoo shares were up 3.3 percent to $16.95 in afternoon

&lt;p&gt;  SHENYANG, CHINA, Sep 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Today, IBM (NYSE: IBM), the City of Shenyang, and China's Northeastern
University announced they are embarking on a major "smart city"
collaboration effort focused on enabling Shenyang to improve the lives of
its citizens by meeting its environmental responsibility goals.

    An industrial hub in northeast China with a concentration of heavy
industry manufacturing and mounting environmental pressures, Shenyang
aims to be the country's model city for environment protection and
development, and lead China in innovation related to environmental
responsibility and creating a city for citizens and businesses to thrive
in. Shenyang seeks to be an example for cities around the world to
follow. Throughout China, the government is focused on creating a
harmonious society, and environmental responsibility is critical to
reaching that goal.

    "We believe our collaboration with IBM and Northeastern University will
play a critical role in meeting our city's environmental goals," said
Yingjie Li, the Senior Mayor of Shenyang. "Furthermore, we expect this
collaboration will help incubate environmental solutions for use in other
cities in China, contributing to the national government agenda of
building a harmonious society in China and even in other countries."

    IBM, the City of Shenyang, and Northeastern University have established
the Shenyang Eco-City Research Institute -- a Collaboratory -- to advance
technology solutions that enable cities to conserve natural resources,
reduce carbon emissions, and create a healthy environment in which
citizens can live and work. A Collaboratory is a laboratory where IBM
Researchers co-locate with a university, government, or commercial
partner to share skills, assets, and resources to achieve a common
research goal.

    In establishing this Collaboratory, technologists and environmental
specialists from IBM, Shenyang, and Northeastern University will partner
to advance smart, eco-city technology solutions to help Shenyang achieve
its goals, but also to create solutions to help other cities be more
environmentally responsible.

    "Our aim is to gain new knowledge through real-world Research to further
advance our smart city technology solutions, so that we can improve our
ability to help cities around the world meet their sustainability goals,"
said Thomas Li, director for IBM Research - China.

    The Collaboratory will focus on advancing technology solutions that:
significantly reduce carbon emissions, conserve energy, manage water
efficiently, effectively track food from farm to fork, enhance the
intelligence of transportation and traffic systems, create environmental
emergency response plans, and allow a proactive approach to environmental
responsibility vs. reactive. Many of these solutions will involve advanced
analytics and information management, areas in which IBM has unique
expertise. IBM will also bring to bear its expertise and experience in
areas such as: smart water management, traffic and transportation
management, food traceability, greenhouse gas reduction, and more.

    For example, the Collaboratory will apply water management solutions from
IBM Research to analyze the immense amount of data that is produced from
the city's water systems, in order to gain real-time understanding about
water quality, energy utilized for water management, and more. Through
this analysis, the city will be able to make more proactive decisions
about water, cut down on expense and energy-usage related to water
management, and maintain high water quality to provide the best possible
service to citizens.

    To this collaboration, IBM will provide Research scientists and technology
solutions, Shenyang will provide environmental experts as well as critical
city data and insight, and Northeastern University will contribute
research experts. Each party will gain new understanding related to smart
cities and environmental responsibility.

    "All of us at the Northeastern University are extremely excited as this
collaboration offers us an opportunity of a lifetime to contribute to the
environmental protection of Shenyang, China and other countries," said
Yicheng He, Chancellor, Northeastern University. "We are grateful to the
Shenyang Government for giving us the opportunity, and are confident that
our researchers and developers can improve their skills by working with
the researchers from IBM's Research Lab in China and other countries."

    The collaboration will also focus on improving communication between
public and private sector entities, and creating methods for
organizations in a city to share data to make environmental management
and decision making more effective. IBM analytics and dashboard solutions
will be applied to helping public and private sector entities share data
and make collaborative decisions.

    "Whereas as generations before us pursued the moon race, our generation is
faced with the earth race, and collaboration is critical to the mission of
saving our planet," said Sharon Nunes, Vice President for Big Green
Innovations at IBM. "We expect this collaboration to not only provide
benefit to Shenyang, IBM and Northeastern University, but believe it will
contribute greatly to cities around the world and our planet as a whole."

    A recent report from the IBM Institute for Business Value, "A Vision of
Smarter Cities," outlines the new central role that cities are playing in
the world economy and the associated need for cities to address their
sustainability challenges by transforming their core systems --
individually as well as holistically.

&lt;p&gt;  LOS ANGELES, CA, Sep 16 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Platinum Studios, Inc. (OTCBB: PDOS) has partnered with Disney Channel
star David Henrie to star in the theatrical adaptation of the Platinum
Studios' comic book "The Weapon." Henrie stars in Disney Channel's
"Wizards of Waverly Place," which won an Emmy on Saturday for Outstanding
Children's Program. In addition, "Wizards of Waverly Place: The Movie"
was cable television's most-watched program of the year with over 11.4
million viewers. "The Weapon" hails from Platinum Studios' large
multi-universe library of over 5,600 comic characters, which rivals that
of Marvel, recently acquired by Disney for $4 Billion, and of the
recently revamped DC Entertainment, owned by Warner Bros. Today, publicly

exploitable comic book characters in the world, independent of Hollywood
studio ownership. From its universes of comic book characters, Platinum
Studios has projects in development at multiple studios, including Disney,
Sony, Universal and DreamWorks.

    Henrie will play martial arts enthusiast and inventor Tommy Zhou, who has
developed a ground-breaking portable innovation. But is Tommy's invention
manufactured or an ancient mystical technique? An evil order wants it and
will stop at nothing to get it.

    The comic book-to feature film adaptation will be produced by its creator,
Platinum Studios Inc. chairman and CEO Scott Mitchell Rosenberg. Producer
Jim Henrie ("The Beautiful &amp; The Damned," "The Good Life," "Fake") will
also serve as producer, and former Universal Pictures senior executive
Randy Greenberg of The Greenberg Group, who brought the parties together,
will serve as an executive producer. Greenberg was instrumental in
bringing all financing and producing parties together for Platinum
Studios' recent feature film "Dead of Night," a collaboration with Hyde
Park Entertainment and Omnilab Media that is currently in post-production.

    Platinum Studios' film and TV division is developing "Cowboys &amp; Aliens"
with producers Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard and Brian Grazer and
DreamWorks, Universal Pictures, Imagine Entertainment and Kurtzman/Orci
(the writing team behind the "Transformers" franchise and the resurrected
"Star Trek" franchise). In addition, Platinum is developing "Unique" with
"Harry Potter" producer David Heyman at Walt Disney Pictures, "The
Witchblade" with "Wanted" executive producer Marc Silvestri, Top Cow
Productions, Inc. and Arclight Films, "Atlantis Rising" with DreamWorks,
and an untitled project at Sony Pictures Animation.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 16 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded General Mills

Americas buy list, saying revenue growth at the food company
could moderate and no longer outshine peers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "In addition, GIS lacks significant exposure to emerging

Yoplait yogurt said first-quarter earnings were running ahead
of its target as commodity cost inflation has eased.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Like most food companies, General Mills saw earnings
pressured in recent years as prices for commodities like wheat
and oil soared. But since then, prices of many commodities have
eased, and food companies are benefitting from price increases
taken when costs were on the rise. [ID:nN10377290]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; General Mills shares closed at $60.30 Tuesday on the New

&lt;p&gt;JOHANNESBURG--(Business Wire)--
As South Africa prepares for the 2010 FIFA World CupTM, international travelers
are already indicating a desire to visit the Republic. Both international
arrivals and spending by international Visa cardholders were up last year
compared with the year prior. In 2008, international arrivals increased 5.5
percent with 9.5 million visitors compared to 9.1 million in 2007.1 Today Visa
Inc. (NYSE: V) issued its Tourism Outlook: South Africa, a new report
highlighting international Visa cardholder spending in South Africa. 

In 2008, the Visa network saw increased transaction volume and total number of
transactions by international visitors in South Africa. More than 13 million
transactions were made by international visitors on their Visa cards, up 11
percent from 2007 and representing $1.8 billion in tourism revenues. The
prevalence of European and American travellers is consistent with key trends in
Visa card spending; in 2008, nearly half of transaction volume from
international visitors to South Africa was from U.S. and U.K. cardholders who
contributed over $812 million to the South African economy. Germany, France and
Australia were significant contributors to South Africa inbound tourism in 2008
as well as in 2007. 

In 2009, these trends are continuing. Through the first quarter of 2009,
international Visa cardholders spent approximately $500 million in South Africa,
which is roughly equal to spending over the same period last year. One area of
notable increase is from visitors from Mozambique, which accounted for $21
million - a 160 percent increase over the first half of 2008. 

While South Africa has been a popular African tourism destination of late,
traveler interest in the nation has increased as the 11 June kickoff date of the
2010 FIFA World CupTM approaches. 

"The 2010 FIFA World CupTM will provide a significant opportunity to position
South Africa as a desirable leisure destination. As travellers are discerning in
their choice of destinations and time of year for travel, Visa`s insight into
tourist behavior and attitudes in South Africa and globally can support the
tourism providers in capturing tourism revenues," says Charles Niehaus, MD of
Visa Sub-Saharan Africa. "Visa is committed to providing a reliable global
payment acceptance network for our cardholders. Visa is similarly dedicated to
supporting state and local governments in their efforts to grow tourism revenues
by providing tourism data and insights that show where and how visitors spend
their money," continues Niehaus. 

In addition to actual Visa card spend by international visitors into South
Africa, the Visa Tourism Outlook survey evaluated travel intentions and
attitudes among 5,539 travellers from 11 nations who have traveled
internationally in the past two years. According to Visa`s survey of
international travellers, one in three are likely to visit South Africa in the
future, and there is broad awareness of the many assets South Africa has to
offer - from rich local culture to natural beauty and interesting things to do -
from visiting beaches to safari. 

The 2010 Opportunity

The 2010 FIFA World Cup provides South Africans with an opportunity to showcase
their country to the world, and an opportunity to attract visitors and tourism
revenues. According to the Visa International tourism survey, 14 percent of
respondents said they are likely to attend the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Respondents
from across the globe are interested in attending the 2010 World Cup, with the
most interest coming from Brazil (46 percent), China (31 percent), South Korea
(12 percent), Mexico (11 percent), Russia (11 percent) and the United States (9
percent). 

The majority of respondents who are likely to attend the FIFA World Cup are also
interested in visiting other parts of South Africa. While in South Africa, those
who plan on attending are interested in taking part in other experiences in
South Africa as well as watching the FIFA World Cup matches. Sixty-one percent
of respondents said they would be interested in going on a safari, while others
were interested in visiting key landmarks (54 percent) and a beach holiday in
Cape Town or along the Garden Route (45 percent). 

Retail Purchases Top South Africa Inbound Tourism Spending

Over the past two years, retail purchases continued to account for the largest
share of tourism spend on Visa cards in South Africa, followed by lodging.
General retail purchases, such as clothing and food, represented 49 percent of
Visa transactions by international travellers within South Africa in 2008,
totaling more than $892 million. Lodging also continues to be a major
expenditure for international travellers, representing 13 percent of Visa
transaction volume in 2008. 

International Tourists` Attitudes and Intentions

The Visa survey provided a number of key learnings on attitudes and intentions
among international travelers for 2009 and 2010. On average, international
respondents indicated they intend to take three trips in the next two years. In
the next two years, the U.S., France, Italy, Spain, U.K. and Canada will be the
most popular destinations with international respondents. 

In response to the economic environment, 52 percent of respondents plan to
travel during the off-peak season for lower prices. 

VisaVue&#174; Travel Reports

June saw Visa launch VisaVue&#174; Travel Reports, a strategic tool for the tourism
industry based on analysis of Visa cardholder spending patterns worldwide.
Visa`s network of 28 million merchants and 1.7 billion cards provides a unique
and global view into international tourist spending. VisaVue&#174; Travel Reports
evaluates spending of both leisure and business travellers worldwide, and it
analyzes purchase patterns based on travellers` origin country and across
various merchant categories - from airlines to restaurants.

About Tourism Outlook: South Africa

For the Visa international tourism survey, 5,539 adult consumers aged 18+ were
interviewed as part of an online panel survey hosted by GMI (Global Market
Insite, Inc). Field work took place between December 11, 2008 and January 8,
2009. During the research process, questions are posed to a panel of consumers
and data is collected until various predefined sampling quotas are reached. The
results are then analyzed and sig-tested at a 95 percent confidence level. For
this summary, the main differences that are interesting and statistically
significant have been described accordingly. 

Visa cardholder spending data cited is based upon a review of tourism spending
on Visa-branded payment cards by international visitors from key source
countries while visiting South Africa during the calendar years 2008 (January 1
- December 31, 2008) and 2007 (January 1 - December 31, 2007). These findings
are based upon VisaVue&#174; Travel data. Visa introduced the VisaVue&#174; Travel tourism
reports to a pilot group of U.S. tourism organizations in 2008 and is now
available to a broader audience of state and convention and visitors bureau
destination marketing entities.

consumidores hispanos de manera &#250;nica y relevante a sus necesidades y
aspiraciones. `Destapa la Felicidad` consiste en ofrecerles la oportunidad de
lograr su sue&#241;o de aprender ingl&#233;s", dijo Padua. "Estamos comprometidos a

Coca-Cola en todo momento, desde las comidas con la familia a mirar un partido
de f&#250;tbol con amigos, hasta un descanso refrescante mientras aprenden con Ingl&#233;s

Llegar a j&#243;venes multiculturales: La F&#243;rmula Secreta de Coca-Cola

La F&#243;rmula Secreta, una parte de la campa&#241;a de mercadotecnia y publicidad Open

un di&#225;logo directo con los adolescentes. El programa celebra los ingredientes
secretos que hacen que Coca-Cola sea una de las bebidas m&#225;s deliciosas y
especiales del planeta. A trav&#233;s de una serie de anuncios, ingredientes secretos

"Fanhancer" es el ingrediente secreto m&#225;s reciente del programa y expresa c&#243;mo
Coca-Cola proporciona a los adolescentes, especialmente a los j&#243;venes
multiculturales, la chispa y el refresco adicional que los verdaderos fan&#225;ticos
necesitan para gritar o aclamar por su equipo, celebridad o artista favorito. 

Con "Fanhancer", el programa debut&#243; en el mercado hispano a trav&#233;s de una
sociedad de medios con Univisi&#243;n, la cual se lanz&#243; durante la reciente
transmisi&#243;n en vivo de los Premios Juventud. Coca-Cola y Univisi&#243;n tambi&#233;n

los fan&#225;ticos han accedido a exclusivas entrevistas entre bastidores con las
celebridades que asistieron a los "Premios Juventud". 

Para captar la experiencia "Fanhancer", Coca-Cola reuni&#243; a 17 adolescentes para
crear una serie de videos e im&#225;genes que destacan c&#243;mo expresan su
individualismo, personalidad y "fanitude" (actitud de fan&#225;tico). La creaci&#243;n
visual aparecer&#225; en Univision.com, BET.com, ESPN.com, AOL Latino.com y otros
sitios de comunicaci&#243;n en l&#237;nea como parte del esfuerzo del programa para llegar
a los adolescentes. El programa tendr&#225; ejecuciones digitales y material de punto
de ventas, y tambi&#233;n estar&#225; vinculado con MyCokeRewards.com. 

Diversidad de envases: Coca-Cola "Para Todos"

Adem&#225;s de estos programas, la segunda mitad del 2009 promete ser emocionante
para CCNA, ya que la compa&#241;&#237;a est&#225; lanzando una serie de empaques en nuevos
tama&#241;os. Algunas de las nuevas opciones incluyen una botella pl&#225;stica de 0,47
litro (16 onzas) que se vender&#225; a 99 centavos, un paquete doble de 1,47 litro
(50 onzas) y una botella pl&#225;stica contorno de 2 litros que tiene la forma
curvil&#237;nea ic&#243;nica de la marca. Con la propuesta de la nueva diversidad de
envases de Coca-Cola, los consumidores hispanos podr&#225;n disfrutar su producto
favorito de Coca-Cola en el envase y al precio que satisfaga mejor sus
necesidades. Esta iniciativa est&#225; siendo respaldada por mensajes en los puntos
de venta y un nuevo comercial en televisi&#243;n llamado "Para Todos". El comercial
destaca el modo en que Coca-Cola est&#225; disponible, para cada consumidor y en cada
momento, en una infinidad de envases. El nuevo comercial de televisi&#243;n debut&#243;

 Enea Announces Support for new IBM
PowerPC(R) 476FP Core in the LSI Multicore Platform

    Integrated Solution Will Deliver the Performance and Reliability Required
in Next-Generation Network Equipment

    Enea(R) (Nordic Exchange/Small Cap/ENEA), a global software and services
company focused on solutions for communication-driven products, today
announced that the Enea OSE(R) real time operating system supports the
new IBM PowerPC(R) 476FP Core that will be used in the LSI(TM) Multicore
Platform. The innovative LSI Multicore Platform utilizes the new PPC476FP
as one of its key building blocks providing communications infrastructure
equipment developers with a high-performance foundation for building a
broad range of next-generation network equipment.

    "Enea is pleased to be a multicore RTOS partner for LSI's new
communication processing solution" said Mathias Bath, senior vice
president of marketing at Enea. "Customers are looking to reduce the time
it traditionally takes to assemble their own components when starting a
new project. The combination of OSE, the PPC476FP Core and the LSI
Multicore Platform will give a tangible edge by delivering extreme
performance while increasing developer efficiency and reducing design
complexity."

    "Next-generation networking systems require powerful multicore
communications processing technology," said Tareq Bustami, multicore
product marketing director, Networking Components Division, LSI. "The LSI
Multicore Platform powered by the PPC476FP Core technology combined with
the Enea OSE provides a highly integrated, scalable solution that reduces
risk and development time, enabling OEMs to get to market faster."

    Enea OSE is a modular, high-performance, full-featured, real-time

utmost in availability and reliability. To take advantage of the latest
multicore processors, Enea OSE is configured with a unique and innovative
kernel design that combines the advantages of both traditional Asymmetric
Multiprocessing (AMP) and Symmetric Multiprocessing (SMP) while avoiding
the disadvantages inherent in both programming models. OSE's pre-emptive
real-time response, memory protection, supervision, error handling and
run-time program loading make it ideal for building fault-tolerant
distributed systems based on multicore architectures that require true
deterministic real-time behavior with five nines or higher availability.

regulators are talking on an informal basis with Microsoft
(MSFT.O) and Yahoo (YHOO.O) on the companies' search engine
deal, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

documents from the companies, indicating the possibility of a
months-long review. Both companies have said they do not expect
an antitrust review to be completed until early 2010.

July, seeking to challenge market leader Google (GOOG.O).

deal, a source familiar with the situation said on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "There are ongoing informal discussions between the European
Commission and Microsoft and Yahoo on their search engine
partnership," the source, who did not want to be identified due
to the sensitivity of the case, told Reuters. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The source declined to provide details.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last week, U.S. antitrust authorities requested more
documents from the companies, indicating the possibility of a
months-long review. Both companies have said they do not expect
an antitrust review to be completed until early 2010.
Microsoft and Yahoo struck their 10-year Web search deal in
July, seeking to challenge market leader Google (GOOG.O).

&lt;p&gt; * Axtel shares gain 11 pct over three sessions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Company to offer TV, Internet, telephone bundles&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Axtel sells $300 million in notes
 (Adds note issuance, analyst's quote)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Noel Randewich&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; MEXICO CITY, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Mexican telecommunications
provider Axtel's stock rose for a third straight session on
Thursday on its plans to offer satellite television, upping the
competition against media giant Televisa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The stock (AXTELCPO.MX) rose 4.63 percent to end at 9.72
pesos, bringing its gain over the past three trading days to
about 11 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Also on Thursday, Axtel said it sold $300 million of
10-year senior notes and will use the proceeds to pay down
other debt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axtel announced earlier this week it had received
permission to offer direct-to-home satellite television and that
it would offer triple play packages of television, phone and
Internet in early 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Triple play bundles are meant to lower delivery costs and
shore up customer loyalty and are the holy grail of Mexico's
telephone and cable television industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axtel is Mexico's No. 2 fixed-line telephone company but is
far behind industry leader Telmex TELMEXL.MX, controlled by
billionaire Carlos Slim. Telmex commands about 80 percent of
the market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ACQUISITION EYED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axtel's planned move into satellite television follows the
entry this year of Dish Mexico -- a venture between MVS
Comunicaciones and set-top provider EchoStar (SATS.O) -- which
forced Televisa (TLVACPO.MX) to cut prices for its Sky satellite
service. A package offered by Axtel could shave profit margins
further.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many of Axtel's mostly middle class clients likely already
subscribe to some sort of pay TV, Manuel Jimenez, an analyst at
Mexico City brokerage Ixe, warned in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Axtel will have to offer very attractive television
packages to be able to gain clients, which won't be easy," he
said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Keen to bolster competition, President Felipe Calderon is
expected soon to ask legislators to amend a law to allow
foreign investors to take controlling stakes in the fixed-line
telephone industry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Whenever the foreign ownership regulation does change in
Mexico, it could make Axtel a more interesting asset for
someone like Telefonica (TEF.MC) than it was before this
license," JP Morgan said in a note to clients this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Axtel offers voice and Internet services in 39 cities in
Mexico.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; So far, Mexico's government has refused to allow former
state monopoly Telmex to offer television.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Critics warn that letting Telmex move into the television
market too soon would endanger the survival of small cable
television and video companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of fixed-line operator Axtel also got a boost on
Thursday after Santander raised its rating on the stock to "buy"
from "hold."

&lt;p&gt;BOSTON--(Business Wire)--
TiE Boston, General Catalyst Partners and Goodwin Procter launched TiE-ENTER
(Entrepreneurs` Exceptional Resource) on Tuesday, September 15, 2009 with a
standing room only event at the Harvard Business School in Cambridge, MA.
TiE-ENTER aims to foster and support a culture of entrepreneurship in New
England, with a primary focus on first-time entrepreneurs, especially
undergraduate, graduate students at universities and young professionals. 

The launch event was an interactive discussion around the theme of "Finding and
pursuing a BIG Idea" featuring three successful entrepreneurs:  Jeff Taylor,
Founder, monster.com, Paul English,  CTO/Co-Founder kayak.com and Chris Hughes, 
Co-founderfacebook.com and mybarackobama.com. Over 350 attendees from diverse
universities witnessed great energy, excitement and humor as the packed room
came alive with the speakers giving sound nuggets of advice to the budding
entrepreneurs. 

The event began with panelists narrating their experience of building companies
and generated broad audience participation interlaced with geeky humor. Jeff
Taylor invited those present to pitch their entrepreneurial ideas and get
feedback from the audience. By the end of the evening time ran out but not the
ideas. Audience participated in a lively discussion on a wide spectrum of ideas;
ranging from medical devices, RFID kits, applications for iPhones, Biofuels,
real-estate bidding, and financial trading to online brokerage services and even
tagging of laundry. 

The panelists provided some great takeaways for the entrepreneurs in the room.
These included the importance of focusing on one business idea at a time,
understanding the market that is being targeted, and having a functional
platform. As Paul English said to those looking to provide a very broad based
solution, "platforms don`t exist without killer apps."  He continued that
"location based services" is going to be a huge field and is worth exploring.
Chris Hughes stressed the importance of the human side of the equation, "knowing
how people think and what they want is - very important". All three speakers
noted that the following merits are important in finding and executing on a big
idea: (a) the product should have utility, (b) it should be simple, (c) it
should be real-time and provide immediate feedback, and (d) it should be
designed iteratively in quick cycles. Jeff Taylor concluded, if you have the
passion for an idea you consider to be big (a monster idea), follow your heart
and don`t be dissuaded by those who just don`t get it. Be relentless in the
evangelism of your idea.

&lt;p&gt;  ST. LOUIS, MO, Sep 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
KnowledgeLake, Inc., a leading provider of document imaging and capture

&lt;p&gt;  WASHINGTON, DC, Sep 17 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Judicial Watch, the public interest group that investigates and
prosecutes government corruption, announced today that it has uncovered
documents from the Treasury Department related to the March 2008
government-brokered acquisition of Wall Street firm Bear Stearns by JP
Morgan Chase and Co. The documents include "confidential" term sheets
describing the deal, released to the public for the first time, along
with behind-the-scenes email correspondence between Treasury officials
indicating that JP Morgan officials believed Bear Stearns to be "nearly
worthless" just hours before the acquisition deal was announced. The
documents were obtained by Judicial Watch in response to a December 8,
2008, Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request.

    On Sunday, March 16, 2008, JP Morgan announced that it had acquired
troubled Wall Street firm Bear Stearns for a price of $2 per share, a
fraction of the firm's $30 market price on Friday, March 14. The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York (NY FRB) supported the deal with $30 billion in
funding at the direction of then-Treasury Secretary Henry "Hank" Paulson.

    In addition to the "confidential" term sheets uncovered by Judicial Watch,
the documents also include email correspondence indicating that the
acquisition of Bear Stearns was very much in doubt just hours before the
deal was announced to the press on Sunday night, March 16. According to an
email sent Sunday morning by NY FRB official Michael Holscher to then-head
of the NY FRB and current Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner, titled
"JPM
Findings":


   JPM [JP Morgan] has discovered a large (50bn) structured mortgage
   position funded by BSC [Bear Stearns Capital], as well as other
   risk positions that are making them balk on the deal.  I have
   asked for a report on their findings to assess the exposures.
   They also indicated that BSC's risk positions are exactly what
   JPM has avoided in recent years. They estimate the book value
   of the firm to be nearly worthless... and that risks on other unknowns
   are to the downside. They inquired about options that the federal
   government may have to bail out/ purchase BSC, we indicated that
   options are extremely limited.

    
Ultimately JP Morgan received the guarantees it needed from the
Treasury Department to consummate the deal to obtain the "worthless" Bear
Stearns later that evening. These FOIA documents were initially withheld
from Judicial Watch in March and were only released after an
administrative appeal to the Treasury Department. Nonetheless, Treasury
has redacted information from many of these new documents and withheld
many documents in their entirety. Separately, Judicial Watch is pursuing
a FOIA lawsuit for Vern McKinley, who is seeking documents on the
government's contention that a Bear Sterns' collapse would have caused a
"contagion" in the financial system. This lawsuit was highlighted in a
September 13 editorial in The Wall Street Journal.

    "The public has a right to know the full truth about the federal
government's unprecedented intervention into the financial markets, and
that is what we are delivering through our open records requests. These
Treasury documents, despite the improper redactions, provide a fascinating
backdrop to the Bear Stearns deal, and what a scam it was. The federal
government's $30 billion Bear Stearns bailout was designed to help stave
off chaos in the financial markets. And this bailout did nothing to stave
off the economic crisis. Since Bear Stearns, the federal government has
committed trillions of taxpayer dollars to prop up other 'worthless'
financial institutions with no end in sight," stated Judicial Watch
President Tom Fitton.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeating to additional subscribers)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 17 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said Thursday
operations were returning to normal at a gasoline-making fluid catalytic
cracker unit at its 238,600 barrel-per-day refinery in Joliet, Illinois
following a snag.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In the course of planned maintenance on a diesel hydrotreater, we
experienced an issue with the FCC that required the unit to be taken
offline for a minor equipment repair," Exxon spokesman Kevin Allexon said
in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Operations are returning to normal and all customer needs are being
met," he said, adding that the FCC incident occurred late Monday night into
early Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Allexon also said there was no effect on production from a small fire
at a storage tank at the refinery early Monday morning. The tank containing
residual from process operations caught fire, Allexon said, adding that
refinery firefighters contained it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "There were no injuries and no impact to production," he said, noting
that an investigation was underway to determine the cause of the fire.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation (DTCC) announced today it had
selected IBM`s new Telecom Expense Management solution to help DTCC in managing
its multi-million dollar telecommunications spend. 

IBM`s Telecom Expense Management Services is designed to help clients address
the complexities of managing telecommunication ordering, inventory and invoice
acquisition and validation of services provided by their telecom vendors. The
service includes consulting, assessments, historical audits and mobile savings
analysis. By providing a centralized solution, IBM helps clients bring together
diverse information and processes to streamline business processes and to
identify and obtain telecom cost savings. 

"IBM`s solution provided DTCC with a better grasp of our inventory and telecom
spending so that we could identify significant savings opportunities and make
more informed decisions about these expenses," said Michael Obiedzinski, DTCC
vice president, Network Services. 

By utilizing IBM`s Telecom Expense Management services, DTCC expects to improve
the management of order, inventory, bill payment, cost recovery and vendor
management, ultimately resulting in an expected return on investment to the
company of more than 20 percent annually by improving process and business
controls. 

DTCC provides the principal post-trade infrastructure for the U.S., as well as
services for global markets, clearing and settling trades for equities,

$1.88 quadrillion in securities transactions, or about $7.5 trillion daily. DTCC
has operating facilities in multiple locations in the United States and
overseas. 

Because of the vital role DTCC plays in both U.S. and global financial services,
it depends on keeping its telecommunications and data communications services up
and running at all times and maintains multiple service contracts with
telecommunications providers. 

"A company can gain greater understanding of its assets and capacity by better
aligning its telecom investments," said Laurence Guihard-Joly, vice president of
Integrated Communications Services in IBM`s Global Technology Services. "By
providing a centralized, proactive telecom expense management solution, we are
helping DTCC reduce its telecom costs and streamline corporate controls and
audit compliance for a critical set of IT and business resources- both fixed and
mobile communications resources." 

IBM Telecom Expense Management services for mobile communications help clients
optimize their spending on mobile services by automating and standardizing
business processes. The services are delivered through a web-based portal for
end-user mobile services and device ordering based on a company`s mobile policy
and selected vendors and devices. This centralized solution provides, often for
the first time, user and management reporting on mobile services inventory,
usage and expenses across all their vendors to provide corporate visibility and
controls.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs removed cruise company
Carnival Corp (CCL.N) from its "conviction sell" list, but
maintained its "sell" rating on shares of Carnival and Royal
Caribbean Cruises Ltd (RCL.N), saying that cruise stocks will
continue to be relative underperformers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Lack of pricing power due to oversupply, reduced booking
visibility and the fuel conundrum will lead to their continued
underperformance, analysts led by Steven Kent wrote in a note
to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We think cruise will underperform hotels based on relative
supply characteristics," Kent said, adding that the
underperformance could take time to play out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, the analysts raised their price target on Carnival
stock to $27 from $22 and that on Royal Caribbean to $18 from
$10, on valuation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The analysts said Carnival is expected to order new ships
and the possibility of an impact from H1N1/on board illness and
higher oil prices would be additional negatives for the shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But we do not have near-term visibility on these issues,"
the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carnival shares were up 22 cents at $33.44, while Royal
Caribbean shares were down 5 cents at $23.74 in trading before
the bell Thursday. They closed at $33.22 and $23.79
respectively Wednesday on the New York Stock Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;New GroundWork Connector Extends Microsoft System Center Operations Manager
Coverage
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
GroundWork Open Source, Inc. (GWOS, www.gwos.com), the leader in commercial open
source systems and network management software, today announced the availability
of the GroundWork Connector for Microsoft System Center Operations Manager. GWOS
is the first open source company to join Microsoft System Center Alliance as a
member. 

With more than 1,500 plugins available, GroundWork Monitor integrates with
Microsoft System Center Operations Manager and extends monitoring and management
coverage to the industry`s largest collection of non-Windows systems,
applications and devices.

from Microsoft System Center Operations Manager and displays it within
GroundWork Monitor Enterprise. Combining Microsoft Systems Center Operations
Manager with GroundWork Monitor Enterprise delivers customers a deeper
visibility into the availability and performance of all critical infrastructures
on a single console. This connector gives insight into applications, databases,
virtual machines and network devices that may be running on Linux, Unix, Windows
or embedded operating systems. 

"Despite being an open source company, about half of the operating systems
managed by GroundWork Monitor are running Windows," said David Dennis, senior
director of marketing and business development. "The combination of Microsoft
System Center Operations Manager and GroundWork Monitor provides a full-featured
alternative to traditional `Big 4` systems management frameworks from HP, IBM,
CA and BMC, but with greater openness and at a much lower price point." 

To emphasize the strategic importance of this integration, GWOS has also become
a member of the Microsoft System Center Alliance. GWOS is the only open source
software vendor currently listed in the Member Directory:

&lt;p&gt;Experts from Microsoft, InishTech and Vi. Labs to Share Key Requirements for
Maximizing Software Revenue and Guarding Intellectual Property
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
V.i. Laboratories, Inc. ("V.i. Labs"), a leading provider of piracy business
intelligence and software protection solutions, will host an online discussion
on the key requirements for maximizing software revenue and protecting
intellectual property (IP) in .NET environments by combining licensing
technology, software protection, and tamper detection and reporting. 

On Thursday, September 24, 2:00 p.m. EDT/11:00 a.m. PDT, Microsoft Business
Development Manager Terry Clancy, InishTech Strategic Accounts Director Bob Cadd
and V.i. Labs Vice President of Products Victor DeMarines will discuss how
software vendors, enterprises and technology providers are increasingly turning
to the Microsoft .NET platform to create and deploy new innovations. 

The presentation will focus on the key requirements for ensuring that
organizations maximize the revenue or value derived from these applications and
protect the IP contained within them. This is especially important because .NET
applications are more susceptible to being decompiled and reverse engineered, so
organizations need to consider implementing granular licensing processes and
protection of sensitive software IP. 

"The development of software on the Microsoft .NET platform lends itself to be
easily decompiled into source code," said DeMarines. "This is a primary concern
for software vendors, because it leaves the intellectual property at risk for
code theft, tampering and piracy. This webinar will provide informative
information to those developing in the .NET platform." 

Webinar attendees will learn:

* About the latest trends in .NET adaptation 
* How to implement a tamper-resistant license system to maximize customer
revenue and prevent overuse within an install base 
* Secure valuable IP within .NET code and prevent it from being decompiled 
* Implement piracy detection and reporting to gain business intelligence and
identify unauthorized use

&lt;p&gt;Sept 17 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs downgraded Medco Health
Solutions MHS.N to "neutral" from "buy" on valuation and said
anticipation over a potential captive pharmacy benefit manager
(PBM) acquisition has been adding support to the company's
shares.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "But given the size of potential opportunities any upside
would likely be modest, in our view," said the brokerage, which
has a six-month price target of $56 on the stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said Medco would be most interested in an
acquisition of either Aetna Inc's (AET.N) or Cigna Corp's
(CI.N) PBM businesses, having missed out on acquiring
Wellpoint's NextRx.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In April, Express Scripts Inc (ESRX.O) agreed to buy health
insurer WellPoint Inc's (WLP.N) NextRx prescription business
for $4.68 billion, becoming the No. 2 U.S. pharmacy benefit
manager while gaining more leverage in driving down drug
prices. [ID:nBNG245941]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs reinstated Express Scripts with a "buy"
rating and WellPoint with "neutral," saying the NextRx deal
could bring the pharmacy benefit manager greater synergies than
anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On WellPoint, the brokerage said a key near-term positive
for the company was a very strong free cash profile, which was
offset by its high sector-relative exposure to impact from
health reform.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman set a six-month price target of $90 on Express
Script stock and a price target of $52 on WellPoint.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Consumer Prices Up Slightly

With the drop in home prices over the last year (heck, the last 3 years) one
might expect that the cost of housing might be coming down, but "not true," say
the government stats. That is because in the CPI, the price of a house is
completely irrelevant to housing prices. Rather they assume that you rent your
house to yourself, and so it is based on a survey of people asking them what
they thought it would cost to rent an equivalent house in their own
neighborhood. 

This owners equivalent rent (OER) rose 0.1% for the month and is up 1.7% year
over year. OER is by far the single biggest item in the CPI, at 21.4%. If you
add in the regular rent that people pay to their landlords, it adds another 8.3%
of the index. 

Since OER and regular rent are neither food nor energy, they make up an even
bigger part of core inflation, about 28.5% for OER and 11.1% for regular rent,
or almost 40% overall. Given the commentary from REITs that specialize in
apartments -- such as Equity Residential (EQR) and Apartment Investors (AIV) --
about getting lower effective rents, I suspect that both the OER and regular
rent components of CPI are too high. 

DB2: IBM`s New Weapon

International Business Machines (IBM) is getting plenty of new SAP Business
Applications clients who are switching from other database software to IBM`s
DB2. This new database software provides an attractive alternative because of
its lower cost, advanced analytical capability and higher transactional
performance. 

IBM claims that customers are slowly moving to its DB2 Database from Oracle
(ORCL), which is arguably the world`s biggest supplier of database software, to
derive higher performance at a lower cost. 

Recently, Coca Cola Bottling Co. (COKE) moved from Oracle to IBM DB2 Database
for implementation of the SAP ERP application. While DB2 reduces storage
requirements by almost 40%, IBM is also of the opinion that it lowers the time
of batch runs by more than 65% and thus improves overall supply chain efficiency
of the customer. 

Leading Brazilian engineering, construction and development group Rossi
Residencial saw a 50% jump in data volume after shifting to shifted to IBM DB2
for implementation of SAP application. DB2 gives the company a comprehensive,
updated view of operations and entails lower maintenance and operational cost.

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

BofA to De-TARP in Installments

The Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Bank of America Corporation (BAC) said
Tuesday that the bank is expected to repay the bailout money it has received
from the government in relation to its participation in the Troubled Asset
Relief Program (TARP) in installments. 

The government is also pushing the bank to pay at least $500 million to conclude
a tentative pact in which the government agreed to share losses on certain BofA
assets. 

The installment payments would enable BofA to gradually reduce government
involvement in its affairs. 

However, unlike the other banks, BofA does not intend to repay its entire $45
billion support from the TARP in lump sum, as it has faced mounting loan losses
as more customers default. But it may start with the repayment of $20 billion,
which it received as part of the total aid to absorb loss-making investment bank
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. 

During an investor presentation, CFO Joe Price said that the bank is also taking
steps to reduce or eliminate its reliance on other government lending and
support programs that were placed during the height of the credit crisis to help
stabilize financial markets. 

Some large financial firms that have already repaid government fund are JPMorgan
Chase &amp; Company (JPM), Morgan Stanley (MS), Bank of New York Mellon Corporation
(BK), Goldman Sachs (GS), among others.

stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include:
Salesforce.com (CRM), Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), International Business

Here are highlights from Wednesday`s Analyst Blog:

Salesforce Wins Gov`t Contract

Salesforce.com (CRM) recently said that its cloud computing applications were
selected by the General Services Administration`s (GSA) cloud computing
storehouse named Apps.gov. This online cloud computing site introduced by GSA
will help US government organizations to buy and use the cloud computing
applications already agreed upon by GSA. 

Salesforce.com enters the Government cloud computing segment in a big way with
this deal, although many cabinet-level government agencies are already using the
company`s services. The positive news comes just after the company`s
introduction of Service cloud 2, an enhanced version of service cloud computing
that provides better solutions to customers. This includes Salesforce knowledge,
Salesforce Answers and Salesforce for Twitter. Salesforce is thus blazing all
guns to make its cloud computing services available to customers across all
segments. 

Historically, Salesforce has achieved success in all cloud computing deals with
government organizations. NASA uses Salesforce`s CRM applications in its
partnership program with companies, federal agencies and non-profit
organizations to get a macro view of its interactions with these agencies, while
the US Army uses Salesforce CRM for recruitment to save time and resources. This
apart, the US Department of State's Office of Nonproliferation and Disarmament
Fund avails Force.com services for providing up to date budget information to
program managers around the globe. 

Government organizations are clearly benefiting from the cloud computing
services, saving time by reducing cost of additional hardware and software and
without incurring any additional employee cost. Going forward, these benefits
should draw the attention of other government customers around the world,
generating additional demand for companies like Salsforce.com in the cloud
computing segment. 

On the other hand, big companies like Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL),
International Business Machine (IBM) and Google (GOOG) are also entering this
segment to get a share of this growing market, offering Salesforce.com tough
competition.

2.0.


PARIS--(Business Wire)--
PTC (Nasdaq: PMTC), the Product Development Company, accentue sa collaboration
avec Microsoft dans le domaine des r&#233;seaux dits `sociaux`. PTC estime que le
march&#233; est &#224; l`aube d`un tournant majeur en termes de d&#233;veloppement produits. Ce
tournant sera marqu&#233; par l`association des r&#233;seaux sociaux &#224; l`univers du
d&#233;veloppement produits : un concept d&#233;nomm&#233;Social Product Development. 

&#171; La collaboration repr&#233;sente depuis toujours une composante cl&#233; du
d&#233;veloppement produits. Les technologies d`aujourd`hui mettent l`accent sur la
possibilit&#233;, pour les entreprises, de partager informations et connaissances
entre les membres d`une &#233;quipe au sein d`un environnement s&#233;curis&#233; et convivial
&#187;,explique Rob Gremley, Executive Vice-President Communication et Marketing de

technologies &#224; des fins professionnelles. 

Pour Kathleen Winder, Directrice de SharePoint Collaboration
Partnerships,Microsoft. &#171; Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 (MOSS) associe
le Web 2.0 aux technologies de r&#233;seaux sociaux pour renforcer la collaboration
dans un environnement professionnel. PTC apporte de son c&#244;t&#233; une valeur ajout&#233;e
au d&#233;veloppement produits gr&#226;ce &#224; sa solution Windchill ProductPoint, qui &#233;tend
la plate-forme Microsoft Office SharePoint Server et permet ainsi l`utilisation
structur&#233;e de donn&#233;es CAO et produits &#187;

La technologie de PTC destin&#233;e &#224; prendre en charge le Social Product Development
se compose de trois couches logicielles regroup&#233;es en une seule plate-forme
int&#233;grale, s&#233;curis&#233;e et facile d`utilisation :

* Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 (MOSS) pour la documentation, la
collaboration et le r&#233;seau social ;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has approved a proposal to allow shareholders to vote on its executives' compensation, as U.S. corporations' pay policies come under scrutiny in the wake of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shareholders will be allowed to vote every three years on the pay of Microsoft executives, starting with the annual meeting on November 19, the world's biggest software company said in a regulatory filing on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The votes will not be binding, but Microsoft said that, in the result of a "significant negative" vote, it would "consult directly with shareholders to better understand the concerns that influenced the vote."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Congress has been discussing legislation on so- called "say on pay" measures to give shareholders more involvement in executive pay in the wake of scandals over massive bonuses paid to failing firms in the past few years, but so far none has been made law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it adopted the vote after discussions with shareholders, including Walden Asset Management, Calvert Investments and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, which had submitted similar proposals for "say-on-pay" votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill to give shareholders annual nonbinding votes on executive pay earlier this summer, but legislation has since stalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks have attracted the most scrutiny of their pay packages, but Microsoft said it wanted to be transparent in its governance to foster investor trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the interest in executive pay, we think it makes sense to encourage more dialogue with our shareholders on our compensation approach," said Brad Smith, Microsoft general counsel, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is not known for its huge pay packages, although many of its employees and executives have become millionaires through owning Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Steve Ballmer was paid only $665,833 in salary for fiscal 2009, which ended in June, according to Friday's filing, only slightly up from the previous year's $640,833.

CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks.com releases the latest Industry Outlook. Today, Zacks Equity Research
discusses the Coal Industry, including Peabody Coal (NYSE: BTU), Arch Coal Inc.
(NYSE: ACI), Rio Tinto (NYSE: RTP) and Walter Energy (NYSE: WLT). 

A synopsis of today`s Industry Outlook is presented below. The full article can
be read at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2678. 

The larger coal players with strong balance sheets will be able to capitalize on
the current market environment in the form of acquisitions. With asset prices
coming down from mid-'08 levels and smaller producers feeling the strain on
margins, this represents opportunities to acquire reserves on the cheap. 

In particular, we like companies with exposure to the international coal markets
as well as the Powder River Basin (PRB) in the U.S. Companies like Peabody Coal
(NYSE: BTU) and Arch Coal Inc. (NYSE: ACI) look attractive currently. Both have
recently engaged in long-term growth acquisitions. 

Peabody is the largest pure-play coal producer, with significant leverage to the
Australian export market. Due to the high quality of coal produced and its
proximity to Asia (emerging markets), Australian seaborne coal trades at a
premium to all other coals. 

Peabody would benefit especially when China and other Asian emerging markets
begin to rebound. The stimulus packages enacted by the federal government during
the recent months should start to pay dividends toward the end of '09. 

Arch Coal has a significant amount of reserves and is a top-three producer in
the PRB. In our opinion, PRB coal will be in great demand over the coming years.
The significant coal-fired power plant build-out will increase annual thermal
coal demand by more than 60 MM tons; approximately 50% of this new demand will
be met by PRB supply. Its likely acquisition of Rio Tinto's (NYSE: RTP) Jacobs
Mine will increase ACI's PRB market share while gaining operating synergies. 

We also like companies with leverage to metallurgical coal markets. When the
global economy starts to turn around, likely in the beginning of 2010, demand
for steel and metallurgical coal should rise. Companies like Walter Energy
(NYSE: WLT) should fare well in this environment.

&lt;p&gt;  NEW YORK, NY, Sep 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Information Builders, an independent leader in business intelligence (BI)
solutions, today announced support for IBM System z/OS computer Integrated
Information Processor (zIIP) in FOCUS 7.6.10 and WebFOCUS 7.7. Information
Builders' zIIP chip support represents the first and only BI platform
optimized for the popular mainframe environment.

    The zIIP chip was designed to handle the workloads of Business
Intelligence, and other data intensive applications. Specialized mainframe
processors like the zIIP allow users to offload work that might otherwise
run on the mainframe's general purpose chips.

    "By extending support for the IBM zIIP, Information Builders is providing
mainframe users a dramatic performance and cost advantage to expand their
operations in the zIIP mainframe environment," said Robert Hoey, GM, Major
Markets, Systems &amp; Technology Group, IBM. "It represents the latest of
many levels of support and interoperability Information Builders offers
to IBM customers."

    For mainframe operations looking for ways to drive greater value and
performance, Information Builders has optimized FOCUS and WebFOCUS for the
zIIP environment. The new versions perform the same mission critical tasks
and maximize processing power, reduce execution and response time, while
delivering consistent application performance and solid customer service.
By enabling efficient BI operations on the mainframe, Information Builders
gives customers real-time, dynamic reporting, with enough processing power
to deliver large 'customer facing' applications, without incurring extra
costs for setting up infrastructure or buying new machines or databases.

    Leveraging the zIIP, Information Builders helps enhance mainframe
operations of FOCUS and WebFOCUS by improving resource optimization to
reduce latent workload demand which the Central Processor can now absorb
and by stimulating visible performance improvement.

    About 80% of the new FOCUS and WebFOCUS processing is zIIP-enabled,
including computations, report formatting, aggregation, screening
criteria, styling, and transaction processing. Information Builders new BI
applications divert as much processing as possible to the zIIP and
monitors and adjusts to optimize zIIP utilization. zIIP is accessible to
mainframe FOCUS as of release 7.6 available Q3, 2009 and WebFOCUS 7.7,
available Q4, 2009.

    "Information Builders is dedicated to helping customers enhance value and
optimize their BI deployments," said Information Builders founder and CEO
Gerald Cohen. "By extending FOCUS and Web FOCUS to support the zIIP chip,
we have dramatically recalculated the economics of mainframe business
intelligence. Finally, business intelligence applications can leverage the
genius of the zIIP environment without compromising accessibility or
performance."

&lt;p&gt;Key Study Results Will Be Presented Across 5 Compounds and 9 Tumor Types
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Oncology will present data from across its portfolio, including results
from long-term follow-up of Aromasin&#174; (exemestane tablets) in a study of early
breast cancer,1 updated study results from a Phase 3 study of Sutent&#174; (sunitinib
malate) in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET),2 and early-stage research of
investigational agents PF-023410663 and figitumumab (CP-751,871)4 in patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These data, and over a dozen additional
abstracts covering Pfizer agents, will be presented at the ECCO 15/ESMO 34
bi-annual meeting in Berlin, Germany from September 20 to September 24. 

"Pfizer is conducting research to identify clinical benefits for targeted
patient populations with investigational compounds like cMET/ALK inhibitor,
while continuing to study drugs like Aromasin through their entire life cycle to
ensure we provide maximum support and information to patients and healthcare
providers about our cancer products," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice
president of clinical development and medical affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology
Business Unit. 

Featured Data Highlights

At the meeting, Pfizer will present new 91-month median follow-up data from the
Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES) study (Abstract #5010; September 22) which is
evaluating the clinical benefits of switching women to Aromasin after two to
three years of tamoxifen versus continuing women on tamoxifen for a full five
years of therapy.1 IES, a randomized, double-blind, multinational trial of
postmenopausal women with hormone sensitive early breast cancer,5 enrolled 4,724
patients. IES is a landmark trial with the longest follow-up of endocrine
treatment in the adjuvant switch setting.6

New study results from an expansion cohort of a Phase 1 study evaluating the
investigational agent PF-02341066 in patients with NSCLC carrying the ALK
(anaplastic lymphoma kinases) fusion gene will be highlighted in the "Best of
2009" Presidential Plenary session Thursday, September 24 (Abstract #6G).3
PF-02341066 is a selective ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor of both
c-MET/HGF receptor and ALK tyrosine kinases and their oncogenic variants.
PF-02341066 is the first agent in clinical development that selectively targets
a unique genetic feature found in several types of cancer, echinoderm
microtubule-associate protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK translocation, present in
approximately 3 - 7 percent of NSCLC patients.7

In addition, final results will be presented from a Phase 3 trial (Abstract
#6.502, September 23), which was discontinued in January 2009 following the
recommendation of an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) after
finding no evidence of improvement in the primary endpoint of survival in
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with axitinib and gemcitabine,
compared to gemcitabine alone.

About Sutent (sunitinib malate)

Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or
intolerance to imatinib mesylate and advanced / metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(RCC). 

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important Sutent (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in advanced RCC and GIST clinical trials were
fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia,
abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin
discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding. 

About Aromasin (exemestane tablets)

Aromasin is the only aromatase inhibitor indicated for sequential therapy in
postmenopausal women with HR positive early breast cancer after two to three
years of tamoxifen for a total of five years of adjuvant therapy. The use of
Aromasin in this setting is supported by the landmark IES trial. Aromasin is
also indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal
women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. 

Important Aromasin (exemestane tablets) Safety Information

Aromasin should not be used in women who are premenopausal, are nursing or
pregnant, have a known hypersensitivity to the drug, or are taking
estrogen-containing agents. Dose modification is recommended for patients who
are receiving certain medications, including strong CYP 3A4 inducers. In
patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving Aromasin than
either tamoxifen or placebo. Reductions in bone mineral density over time are
seen with the use of Aromasin.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
In the course of routine surveillance, Fitch Ratings affirms the 'AA-' rating on
Fort Walton Beach, Florida's (the city) $10.9 million of outstanding utility
system (the system) revenue bonds. The bonds are payable from a senior lien on
and pledge of the net revenues of the water and sewer systems. The Rating
Outlook is Stable. 

The 'AA-' rating reflects the system's good financial performance, manageable
capital plan, conservative budgeting practices and stable and diverse service
area. Credit concerns include limited rate flexibility, though projected rate
hikes are modest which will help to keep rates affordable. Financial performance
in terms of debt service coverage and liquidity is projected to decline over the
next five years, thus, maintenance of adequate financial metrics commensurate
with the rating category is essential to the rating. 

Financial performance has been very strong, with senior annual debt service
(ADS) coverage levels averaging 7.0 times (x) over the fiscal 2004-2008 period.
Projected ADS coverage for the system over the next five years is projected to
decline to an average of 3.1x. However, the city employs conservative budgeting
practices and has historically exceeded projections. Financial margins have also
been very solid, averaging 604 days cash on hand. With the city's continued
practice of cash-funding its capital plan, reserves are projected to slightly
decline though to still good levels. User charges approach Fitch's affordability
threshold at 1.9% of median household income. However, rates remain competitive
for the region and are below Okaloosa County's user charges on a combined basis.


The system's five-year capital improvement plan (CIP) totals a manageable $15
million. The city estimates that only 15% of the CIP will be debt-funded with
the remainder to be paid for with cash. With modest service area growth, capital
needs are minimal and focus primarily on system maintenance. 

The utility system's service area includes the city, the town of Cinco Bayou and
the unincorporated area of Eglin Heights (water service only). In fiscal 2008,
the system served approximately 8,900 water customers. Little future growth is
anticipated as the service area is largely built out. The city has ample
existing water supply drawn from the nine Floridian Aquifer wells. The city owns
and operates one wastewater treatment plant, which has a 4.5 million gallon per
day treatment capacity. However, beginning in March of 2010, the city will
transfer its wastewater flows to Okaloosa County. The wastewater treatment plant
will be decommissioned and the city will no longer provide wastewater treatment
services. 

Fort Walton Beach is located on the gulf coast of Florida's panhandle, in
Okaloosa County. The area economy is focused on military operations; Eglin and
Hurlburt Air Force Bases are located within the county. Unemployment estimates
for July were below state and national levels at 7.1%. Income levels are above
state but below national levels. 

Fitch's rating definitions and the terms of use of such ratings are available on
the agency's public site, 'www.fitchratings.com'. Published ratings, criteria
and methodologies are available from this site, at all times. Fitch's code of
conduct, confidentiality, conflicts of interest, affiliate firewall, compliance
and other relevant policies and procedures are also available from the 'Code of
Conduct' section of this site.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) said Friday a
gasoline-making fluid catalytic cracker and associated units were back
fully at its 238,600 barrel-per-day refinery in Joliet, Illinois following
a snag this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The FCC and all associated units have resumed normal operations,"
Kevin Allexon, a company spokesman, told Reuters in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The FCC was taken offline after an issue late Monday night into early
Tuesday morning in the course of planned maintenance on a diesel
hydrotreater, the oil major has said.

&lt;p&gt;TOKYO, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) said it
agreed to sell part of its stake in Japan's Sanyo Electric Co
Ltd 6764.T into a planned tender offer by Panasonic Corp
(6752.T), locking in 59 billion yen ($648 million) in profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Panasonic, which vies with Sony Corp (6758.T) for the
position as the world's largest consumer electronics maker,
plans to take over Sanyo, pending approval from anti-monopoly
regulators in the United States, China and Europe.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman became a major shareholder of Sanyo when it, along
with Daiwa Securities SMBC and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Co,
bailed out the world's largest rechargeable battery maker in
2006.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Of the 178.6 million preferred shares Goldman bought in
Sanyo for 700 yen each, it is now set to sell 96.7 million
shares to Panasonic, Goldman said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Panasonic is offering 1,310 yen for each preferred share, or
an 87 percent premium to Goldman's purchase price.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The U.S. bank also said it has converted the remaining 81.9
million preferred shares into 819 million common stock,
representing a 13 percent stake in Sanyo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Kiyoshi Takenaka; Editing by David Cowell)

&lt;p&gt;  WESTPORT, CT, Sep 18 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Pansoft Company Limited (NASDAQ: PSOF) today announced that on September
17, 2009 in Beijing Pansoft held a successful joint press conference with
Microsoft. Mr. Francis Sun, General Manager of the Greater China Region
of Microsoft Business Solutions (MBS) and Mr. Guoqiang Lin, CEO of
Pansoft, hosted the "ERP Innovation for Chinese Group Corporations"
conference. There were more than 30 major media firms that attended the
meeting.

    Pansoft signed a Solution Provider Agreement (SPA) with Microsoft China,
Co., Ltd. on May 11, 2009 to develop a centralized financial and
accounting solution for Microsoft's Dynamics AX, a comprehensive ERP
(Enterprise Resource Planning) system targeting large enterprises as well
as growth Chinese corporations. After a short four months of diligent
work, Pansoft's technical team successfully completed the project, which
is now ready for the market debut. Pansoft is the only Chinese firm
involved in the development of financial system for Dynamics AX. It was
chosen to be the alliance partner with Microsoft given Pansoft's enormous
success in developing a Centralized Financial and Accounting System for
PetroChina. That solution was highly praised by Mr. Jun Wang, China's
Vice Minister of Finance and he called the system an "impressive and
exciting innovation for China."

    Pansoft leveraged the concept from PetroChina's solution and developed the
program for Dynamics AX to enhance the centralized financial and
accounting function. Mr. Sun, General Manager of MBS said, "Microsoft
strives to bring the best global managerial experiences to Chinese
corporations. We are pleased to be the partner with Pansoft, a company
with extensive experience in corporate financial management. We can
complement each other's strengths to provide the best solutions for our
clients."

    Microsoft has superior brand recognition as well as broad sales and
distribution channels globally. Pansoft's partnership with Microsoft adds
additional sales venue to the company's products and solutions. In
addition, it should increase Pansoft's own brand awareness. More
importantly, as Dynamics AX is marketing to Chinese group corporations in
various industries, it should help Pansoft enter other markets beyond oil
and gas. This fits in with Pansoft's business development strategy.

    Mr. Lin, CEO of Pansoft, commented, "Chinese enterprises' background
histories, cultural and management habits and regional characteristics all
add difficulties to ERP system implementations in China. However, Pansoft
has long and strong business relationships with large oil and gas
companies such as Sinopec and PetroChina and we understand our customers'
needs. We are able to provide onsite services and solutions based on
their unique requests. The solutions we developed emphasized practicality
and efficiencies, which are the same concepts drawn upon when we created
the centralized financial solution for Microsoft Dynamics AX ERP system.
I am confident that the Dynamics AX will be well received by Chinese
corporations. We are establishing a new department for its sales,
implementation and maintenance to cooperate with Microsoft's marketing
efforts. We will provide training for Microsoft's partners and channel
members next month to help the new solution get to customers as soon as
possible. I am excited about Pansoft's growth prospects."

&lt;p&gt;Sept 18 (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) on Thursday
filed five civil lawsuits in Seattle, Washington against alleged

advertising and works by camouflaging malicious code as harmless
online advertisements, Microsoft's associate general counsel Tim
Cranton wrote in a blog.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The lawsuits allege that individuals using the business
names "Soft Solutions," "Direct Ad," "qiweroqw.com," "ITmeter
Inc" and "ote2008.info" used malvertisements to distribute
malicious software or present deceptive websites that peddled
scareware to unsuspecting Internet users," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cranton added that names of specific individuals behind
these activities were not known and the lawsuits were being
filed to help uncover the people responsible.

&lt;p&gt;Cook, who fondly described his 38-year rise from Disneyland ride operator to head the Hollywood studio in 2002, said in a statement that he had been contemplating his departure "for some time now" and felt it was the right time to move on.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cook, 59, told his staff on Friday that he felt like "a square peg in a round hole," according to a source familiar with Cook's statement.

&lt;p&gt; * No successor named yet by Disney&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Refiles to fix typo in lead paragraph)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Gina Keating&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LOS ANGELES, Sept 18 (Reuters) - Walt Disney (DIS.N)
Studios Chairman Dick Cook stepped down on Friday from his post
to pursue "new adventures" after privately telling staff he
felt he no longer fits in at the No. 1 U.S. entertainment
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cook, who fondly described his 38-year rise from Disneyland
ride operator to head the Hollywood studio in 2002, said in a

ready to announce a successor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The studios division struggled in recent quarters with a
slide in DVD sales due to the recession and changing technology
and a spate of unprofitable films.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; After taking over as CEO in 2005, Iger cut the studios'
staff by 20 percent and refocused the division on a smaller
slate of high-concept family-oriented franchises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The strategy worked for a couple of years -- producing
megahits like "Pirates of the Caribbean," "National Treasure"
and "The Chronicles of Narnia" -- but the studio has been slow
to cut costs and leverage hits from other divisions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; COOK PRAISED FORTHCOMING FILMS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The respected industry figure left days after he said at a
glittering Disney exposition in Anaheim, California that the
studios' upcoming slate of films was "the best in our
history."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Cook presided over the integration of Pixar Animation
Studio, the "Pirates" franchise that went on to gross more than
$2 billion at worldwide box offices, and a roster of "big
event" films and technological innovations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under his watch, Disney became the first studio to push
digital 3D technology with "Chicken Little" and got top
directors to make 3D to revitaliae an industry that was losing
ground to video games, piracy and digital home entertainment
systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In a statement, Iger praised Cook's "outstanding creative
instincts and incomparable showmanship."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; His departure coincides with Disney's efforts to absorb
Marvel Entertainment, whose creative and production staff
likely will function independently from Disney as has Pixar's
team.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Larry Gerbrandt, a principal at consultancy Media Valuation
Partners, said Cook's resignation could be tied to Disney's $4
billion acquisition last month of the comic book publisher and
movie studio, and Disney's reliance on its Pixar division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If Disney is not going to develop a significant slate of
completely original films, but relies primarily on Pixar and
Marvel, then Dick's role becomes far less important," he said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) has approved a proposal to allow shareholders to vote on its executives' compensation, as U.S. corporations' pay policies come under scrutiny in the wake of the financial crisis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shareholders will be allowed to vote every three years on the pay of Microsoft executives, starting with the annual meeting on November 19, the world's biggest software company said in a regulatory filing on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The votes will not be binding, but Microsoft said that, in the result of a "significant negative" vote, it would "consult directly with shareholders to better understand the concerns that influenced the vote."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Congress has been discussing legislation on so- called "say on pay" measures to give shareholders more involvement in executive pay in the wake of scandals over massive bonuses paid to failing firms in the past few years, but so far none has been made law.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said it adopted the vote after discussions with shareholders, including Walden Asset Management, Calvert Investments and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, which had submitted similar proposals for "say-on-pay" votes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. House of Representatives approved a bill to give shareholders annual nonbinding votes on executive pay earlier this summer, but legislation has since stalled.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wall Street banks have attracted the most scrutiny of their pay packages, but Microsoft said it wanted to be transparent in its governance to foster investor trust.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Given the interest in executive pay, we think it makes sense to encourage more dialogue with our shareholders on our compensation approach," said Brad Smith, Microsoft general counsel, in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is not known for its huge pay packages, although many of its employees and executives have become millionaires through owning Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chief Executive Steve Ballmer was paid only $665,833 in salary for fiscal 2009, which ended in June, according to Friday's filing, only slightly up from the previous year's $640,833. His cash incentive payment has yet to be established. Last year it was $700,000.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, who owns about 408 million Microsoft shares worth more than $10 billion, has requested no equity compensation from the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The 2009 fiscal year was tough for Microsoft, as it was for most U.S. companies. It had its first-ever drop in annual revenue and operating profit fell 9 percent to $20.4 billion. Its shares fell 13.6 percent over the 12-month period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Because of the uncertain economy, Microsoft said in January that all employees and executives would not receive merit-based salary increases for fiscal year 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company left its quarterly dividend at 13 cents per share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, Sept 21 (Reuters) - An investment arm of
Goldman Sachs Group (GS.N) is in talks with China's biggest
privately-owned car maker Geely Automotive (0175.HK) to buy
about $250 million of the company's convertible bonds, two
sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Geely, whose parent is eyeing Ford's (F.N) Swedish car brand
Volvo, aimed to use the proceeds to boost its carmaking
capacity, a source close to the Chinese car maker told Reuters
on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geely plans to use the proceeds to add new car and parts
plants and to buy auto-related assets from its parent, Geely
Holding Group Co, said the source.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geely and Goldman officials declined to comment.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Monday demonstrated a new tool for its Bing search engine that will allow advertisers to measure the effectiveness of their ads with online users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking at the IAB MIXX Conference and Expo 2009 in New York on Monday, Yusuf Mehdi, senior vice president of Microsoft's Online Audience Business group, showed off what he called a "user-level targeting" tool that allows Microsoft to see which search-based ads that appear in the Bing search engine are getting the most traffic and from where.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we're doing with Bing for vigorous measurement is we're matching the exact ad online with the exact user," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mehdi pointed out that statistics show that 39 percent of Web users do 65 percent of the online searches, so it would be beneficial for advertisers to see which of those "heavy users" are targeting certain ads, versus which ads are favored by "light users." The tool Microsoft created shows where the interest in a marketing or advertising campaign is specifically coming from, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This measuring ability for Bing was demonstrated as part of Mehdi's presentation, in which he discussed how Microsoft is applying lessons it's learned from studying advertising campaigns and creating technology to reflect that learning. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One of those lessons was what he characterized as "relentless measurement and optimization" to find out what ads are most effective so they can be better targeted to their proper audience.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"One of the big things is trying to build a loyal fan base for the product," he said. "You can&#8217;t just go out and put your message everywhere. You have to pick and focus."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft revamped and rebranded its Live Search engine "Bing" in June, and making it more effective for search advertising is something the company continues to work on, Mehdi said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was unclear from Mehdi's presentation whether this technology is available for advertisers using Bing today or whether it's just something Microsoft is using internally. A representative from Microsoft's public relations firm, Waggener Edstrom, declined to answer follow-up questions about the technology or his presentation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This kind of ability to measure what kinds of online advertising is working with users is becoming essential as more and more business is being done on the Web. In fact, Microsoft competitor Adobe Systems -- an executive from which spoke before Mehdi on Monday -- last week said it was purchasing Web analytics company Omniture to build measuring technology directly into Adobe's tools for creating online media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drugmakers Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and Wyeth WYE.N said on Monday they will sell some of their animal health assets to privately held German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The divestiture is part of the regulatory approval process associated with Pfizer's planned $68 billion acquisition of Wyeth, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Terms of the deal were not disclosed, but Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said products being sold to Boehringer represent less than 10 percent of the combined companies' revenue from animal health assets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Animal health has become an increasingly important source of revenue for drugmakers. Pfizer reported revenue of $2.83 billion from its animal health business in 2008, while Wyeth posted $1.08 billion in animal health sales last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The products being divested primarily include cattle and small animal vaccines and some animal health pharmaceuticals, Pfizer said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal does not include Pfizer's Palladia, which recently became the first approved cancer treatment specifically designed for dogs and will be retained by Pfizer, Campion said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boehringer Ingelheim will also acquire research and manufacturing facilities, located in Fort Dodge, Iowa, as well as related assets and intellectual property, primarily from Wyeth's Fort Dodge Animal Health portfolio in the United States and Canada.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The agreement with Boehringer is subject to U.S. and Canadian regulatory approval. Pfizer said it expect to obtain the approvals shortly and close the transaction early in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agreement Subject to Regulatory Approval in U.S. and Canada, and the Closing of
the Pfizer/Wyeth Transaction, Among Other Things

Pfizer/Wyeth Transaction Expected to Close Early in the Fourth Quarter 2009
NEW YORK &amp; MADISON, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) and Wyeth (NYSE: WYE) today announced that they have
entered into an agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim to divest certain animal
health assets in connection with the regulatory approval process associated with
Pfizer`s pending acquisition of Wyeth. Under the terms of the agreement,
Boehringer Ingelheim will acquire products, research and manufacturing
facilities, located in Fort Dodge, Iowa, as well as related assets and
intellectual property, primarily from Wyeth`s Fort Dodge Animal Health portfolio
in the U.S. and Canada. Products primarily include cattle and small animal
vaccines and some animal health pharmaceuticals. Boehringer Ingelheim also
intends to acquire certain animal health assets in other jurisdictions,
including companion animal vaccines in Australia, and cattle vaccines in the
European Union and South Africa. 

The closing of the agreement with Boehringer Ingelheim is contingent upon
approval from the U.S. Federal Trade Commission and the Canadian Competition
Bureau, as well as the closing of the Pfizer/Wyeth transaction and the
satisfaction of other customary closing conditions. The divestitures to
Boehringer Ingelheim of animal vaccines in Australia and cattle vaccines in the
European Union, which are included in this agreement, also are subject to
approval from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the
European Commission, respectively. In addition, Pfizer has committed to divest
certain other animal health assets in both of those jurisdictions. 

The Pfizer/Wyeth transaction remains subject to regulatory approval in the U.S.,
Canada, China and Australia. Pfizer expects to obtain these approvals shortly
and now expects to close the transaction early in the fourth quarter 2009. 

The European Commission granted regulatory approval for the transaction on July
17, 2009, subject to the commitment to divest certain animal health assets in
the European Union, some of which are among the assets Boehringer Ingelheim
intends to acquire. 

Financial terms of the agreement were not disclosed.

&lt;p&gt;For years, Microsoft had no competition when it came to productivity suites. The vast majority of people and enterprises didn't have to give suites any thought at all. They just chose Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With more businesses getting used to the idea of their apps and data living in the cloud, though, that's starting to change. Oh, Office is still dominant. But the Google Docs Web-based office suite is starting to gain traction, and not just among small businesses, but where the big boys and girls roam as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google claims in its official blog that more than 1.75 million businesses, schools and other organizations, including Motorola, now use Google Docs. The company also claims that 3,000 organizations sign up for Google Docs every day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the education world, the company says, Google Docs has made significant inroads. It claims that more than 5 million students at thousands of universities in more than 145 countries are now using Google Docs, a 400% increase over last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As a way to drive home the point that Google Docs is ready for the enterprise, Google is renting billboard space in Boston, Chicago, New York and San Francisco to explain why enterprises should use the suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft isn't sitting still, of course. The next version of Office, Microsoft Office 2010, will include Web-based access to popular applications such as Word, Excel and PowerPoint, as a way to compete with Google Docs. Those Web-based versions, though, are not likely to be as robust as Google Apps. Google, for its part, has extended Google Docs to the desktop, adding some client features. And that, in turn, is not as robust as the client version of Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But over the next several years, you can expect Google Docs and Microsoft Office to resemble each other more and more. Microsoft Office will gain cloud-based storage and other Web-based features, and Google Docs will include more powerful client-based components. Still, it's likely that Microsoft Office will for the foreseeable future be primarily client-based, and Google Docs primarily Web-based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Where does that leave small businesses, medium-size businesses and large enterprises? Which should they use -- Google Docs or Microsoft Office? Ultimately, it will come down to trust, and that's not just trust in a particular company, but trust in the company's particular technology approach, be it cloud- or client-based.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The worldwide outage of Gmail for 100 minutes earlier this month should give pause to those considering moving full time to Google Docs. As I wrote in my blog, the Gmail outage had Microsoft laughing all the way to the bank.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Imagine if you ran a company and that outage brought down all of the word processing, spreadsheet and presentation software in your business. That could be disastrous.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For now, at least, client-based suites are more trustworthy than Web-based ones. In addition, Microsoft has years of experience deploying and supporting Office, including automated deployment and management tools. Those are two good reasons to go with Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Of course, the decision also depends on price, and on a company's size and requirements. If I were starting a small business today, for example, I would go with Google Docs. Not only is licensing less expensive than it is with Microsoft Office, but with Google Docs you can operate a business without an infrastructure, or even an IT staff. All you need is Web access. So the cost savings go well beyond licensing fees and would overshadow occasional outages.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Large enterprises, with their large investments in infrastructure, technology, expertise and staff, will still want to go with the tried-and-true. That's today, though. If the cloud becomes more reliable and Google develops enterprise-level support, the decision could become much tougher.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Preston Gralla is a contributing editor for Computerworld.com and the author of more than 35 books, including How the Internet Works (Que, 2006).

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc has been commended by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) for its
approach to addressing climate change. CDP named Pfizer to its Climate
Disclosure Leadership Index, which highlights the company`s climate change
disclosure practices. This is the third consecutive year that Pfizer has been
recognized by CDP. 

"As a health care company, Pfizer is very aware of the potential impact of
climate change on global health," said Steve Brooks, vice president of Global
Environment Health &amp; Safety for Pfizer. "Pfizer has set ambitious goals to
lessen our effect on the environment." 

Brooks cited steady reduction of the company`s carbon footprint through global
conservation and energy efficiency efforts, including equipment retrofits and
combined heat and power systems. From 2002 to 2008, Pfizer reduced its global
greenhouse gas emissions by 18 percent; between 2008 and 2012, the company is
committed to reduce those emissions by another 20 percent. 

"Companies recognized in the Carbon Disclosure Leadership Index are rewarded for
high quality responses to CDP, which demonstrate a good understanding of how
climate change is and will continue to impact their business," said CDP Chief
Executive Paul Dickinson. "Companies which control their risks today, manage
their emissions and seize the opportunities to produce low carbon goods and
services, will be the best placed to prosper in a low-carbon economy of the
future." 

CDP is a not-for-profit coalition of 475 institutional investors with $55
trillion in assets under management. The Climate Disclosure Leadership Index, a
key component of CDP`s annual S 500 Report, highlights the constituent
companies within the S 500 Index which have displayed the most professional
approach to corporate governance in respect of climate change disclosure
practices. Companies are scored on their climate change disclosure, and high
scores indicate good internal data management and understanding of climate
change related issues affecting the company.

Disclosure Leadership Index, can be found at www.cdproject.net.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
Twisted Pair Solutions a pioneer in unified communications software built to
open standards, and IDV Solutions, a leading enterprise mashup and data
visualization software company, today announced their partnership in creating an
entirely new communications client for the Microsoft Surface computer. Built
upon Twisted Pair`s WAVE software technology and exploiting IDV`s extensive
knowledge and experience in creating interactive, visual applications utilizing
Microsoft SharePoint, the new WAVE for Surface application helps demonstrate the
applicability of multiple Microsoft technologies to mission-critical
communications. 

Microsoft Surface is a revolutionary multi-touch computer that responds to
natural hand gestures and real-world objects, helping people interact with
digital content in a simple and intuitive way. With a large, horizontal user
interface, Surface offers a unique gathering place where multiple users can
collaboratively and simultaneously interact with data and each other. Using
Twisted Pair`s WAVE .NET Software Developers Kit (SDK), IDV Solutions created an
imaginative new WAVE client for the Surface, turning it into a comprehensive
communications console that can bridge and patch multiple two-way radio systems
such as those operated by Microsoft`s own Global Security Operations Centers
(GSOC). 

To create a combined application, IDV Solutions paired its innovative
Silverlight WAVE interface with Visual Fusion for Surface, a version of its
flagship product optimized for the multi-touch computer. With Visual Fusion for
Surface, end users interact with visually consolidated data coming from any
number of different sources: SharePoint, SQL Server, web feeds and services, and
through the Visual Fusion SDK, virtually any other data resource. 

Bing Maps serves as the canvas for this integrated content and users are
empowered to explore, manipulate, and take action with tools such as spatial
query, the ability to draw an area on the map and return relevant content for
that ad hoc region. Visual Fusion for Surface provides uniquely powerful
situational awareness, dashboard, and interactive map capabilities in a
compelling form. All of these capabilities are magnified in this common
operational picture with WAVE and Surface since multiple users can accomplish
different tasks at the same time on the same interface. 

Twisted Pair created WAVE, a voice-over-IP (VoIP) software platform, to bring
groups together for critical communications. Used by defense, federal, public
safety and commercial customers worldwide, WAVE is best known for its ability to
extend and link private two-way radio networks so that users can communicate
more effectively. In fact, by enabling interoperable communications among
telephony, collaboration and messaging systems, and with group communications
systems such as two-way radio, intercom, paging and broadcast systems, WAVE is
powering the next generation of communications, collaboration and
interoperability solutions. 

"Twisted Pair has an ecosystem of partners like IDV Solutions that build
WAVE-powered products, services and solutions for a broad set of markets and
customers," said Tom Guthrie, President and CEO of Twisted Pair Solutions. "IDV
has built an exceptionally well engineered WAVE client that delivers exciting
new capabilities to the Surface device at a time when Microsoft is rapidly
extending its presence in the world of mission-critical communications." 

"We are tremendously excited about the WAVE and Surface integration," explained
Mark Morrison, IDV Solutions CEO. "Both of these technologies fit well with
Visual Fusion, and bringing our expertise in business user experience allowed us
to augment their offerings in ways that greatly benefit the customer. WAVE is a
great complement to Visual Fusion on the audio side, accomplishing the
unification of diverse audio sources in much the same way that we unite
disparate data sources visually." 

Twisted Pair also has announced the launch of WAVE 4.8, the latest version of
its innovative and widely deployed Voice-over-IP (VoIP) application. Microsoft
will deploy WAVE 4.8 in its Global Security Operations Centers (GSOC) in the
United States, Europe and India. The software will help Microsoft`s GSOC build
mission-critical redundancy in to its global security operations by enabling
communications interoperability between the different two-way radio systems
currently in use around the world, as well as provide dispatch console positions
for GSOC operators. 

About Twisted Pair Solutions

Twisted Pair Solutions' award-winning WAVE software technology enables partners
and customers to build and operate secure, highly scalable communications
solutions in the world's most demanding environments. Recognizing that the best
approach to solving the complexities of communications interoperability is to
use standards-based software to unify diverse communications technologies, WAVE
is trusted when communications is absolutely indispensable. Twisted Pair
Solutions is headquartered in Seattle, Washington, USA with offices in the
United Kingdom and Australia. 

About IDV Solutions

IDV Solutions is an enterprise software company committed to helping Global 2000
and government organizations make their information more accessible,
understandable, and contextual. Their suite of products, Visual Fusion, forms an
enterprise mashup platform for creating interactive, visual applications
utilizing the power of SharePoint. This software empowers everyone in an
organization to create interactive, geospatial mashups from unlimited sources of
data. It provides a streamlined platform for building Enterprise 2.0 apps that
drive agility, collaboration, and insight.

&lt;p&gt;Global Marketing Campaign to Support Sponsorship of the 2010 FIFA World Cup
South Africa Unveiled at Global Press Conference in Zurich
ZURICH--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today unveiled elements of a global integrated marketing
campaign inspired by the joyous dance celebrations familiar to Africa, the host
continent for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The campaign developed to support its
sponsorship of the landmark sporting event is an extension of the current
Coca-Cola brand platform "Open Happiness." 

The campaign, showcased during a global press conference attended by Coca-Cola
Chairman and CEO Muhtar Kent and FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter at the
headquarters of Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA),
invites fans to express their optimism and passion for football through active
dance celebrations. 

Among the key elements from the Coca-Cola campaign are the first-ever
recognition of the best player celebration carried out during the tournament, a
music anthem, global television commercials, an online program, commemorative
packaging and the 86-country FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola. 

"The worldwide passion for the sport of football is unrivalled and gives our
business the best platform to connect with fans everywhere Coca-Cola does
business," said Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive officer, The Coca-Cola
Company. "Our programs to support the 2010 FIFA World Cup, like the Trophy Tour,
will help ensure that fans have the chance to experience the excitement and
pageantry of football no matter where they live. And like all football fans,
Coca-Cola is especially excited about the 2010 FIFA World Cup taking place on
the African continent for the first time." 

The campaign begins with the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola, which will
take the Trophy to 86 countries, including every nation in Africa. The
ceremonial start of the tour was held today as President Blatter and Mr. Kent
sent the Trophy on its round-the-world journey. The FIFA World Cup Trophy will
be flown later in the week from Zurich to its first stop in Cairo, Egypt. 

"The international reach and marketing expertise of our partner Coca-Cola is an
enormous benefit in strengthening the game and helps us bring the excitement and
passion of our sport to more people around the globe," said Joseph S. Blatter,
president of FIFA. "This campaign captures both the unique spirit of the
continent of Africa and the celebrations that football inspires." 

"Football, especially during the FIFA World Cup, can motivate people to `let go`
a bit and express their passion in a spontaneous way," said Joe Tripodi, chief
marketing and commercial leadership officer, The Coca-Cola Company. "This is
particularly true of African football, where there is often a heightened passion
for exuberant, colorful celebrations both on and off the field. That is the
inspiration for our entire campaign." 

In the months leading up to the FIFA World Cup an array of programs will be
activated that will bring fans closer to the FIFA World Cup experience. Among
the highlights will be a global TV commercial featuring Roger Milla - the
legendary footballer from Cameroon famed for his iconic celebratory dance during
the FIFA World Cup Italia in 1990. Millions around the world remember Milla`s
goal celebration as the first to include a joyful dance. Milla was on hand in
Zurich to present the new spot. 

Elements of the campaign will include: 

The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola

World football`s greatest prize is set to embark on its biggest ever global tour
as part of the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola. Free tickets to the
Trophy Tour will be made available to consumers via Coca-Cola promotions in
countries on the route. At events in each city, fans can have a souvenir photo
taken of themselves with the trophy, view a 3-D movie showcasing moments of the
FIFA World Cup, participate in interactive displays and enjoy other
entertainment. Short films highlighting the African leg of the tour will be
created by a film crew lead by renowned filmmaker Jeremy Gilley of Peace One
Day. 

Coca-Cola Celebration Award

For the first time ever, Coca-Cola will recognize the tournament`s best goal
celebration. Fans will be able to vote for the eventual winner online. For every
goal scored during the 2010 FIFA World Cup and celebrated with a dance,
Coca-Cola will make an additional donation to the Company`s "Water for Schools"
effort that helps provide schools access to safe drinking water. The award will

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - China has quietly eased restrictions on its citizens traveling from Guangdong province to Macau, sending casino stocks soaring on Monday as industry executives bet on record October earnings in the world's hottest gambling market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares of Galaxy Entertainment and Melco International jumped around 9 percent, and SJM Holdings was up more than 6 percent, while the broader Hang Seng stock index fell 0.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shares of U.S. casino companies were mixed, with Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O) up 1.2 percent at $70.02 in morning trading. Las Vegas Sands (LVS.N) was down 1.7 percent at $18.53, and MGM Mirage (MGM.N) was down 1.2 percent at $13.06.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alarmed that some Guangdong residents were gambling too much in neighboring Macau, China last year imposed new rules limiting them to two trips a year to the former Portuguese enclave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the authorities began easing up on the rule as early as two months ago, and noticeably loosened the restriction at the start of this month, said top executives at two of Macau's six casino licensees, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The latest version is (they can travel to Macau) once a month out of Guangdong," said one of the executives. "Gaming revenues for the first two weeks of the month have been good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other executive forecast that October -- a high travel season for Chinese because of the October 1 Golden Week holiday -- could see record monthly casino revenues, in part due to the relaxing of the visa rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macau's six casino operators include U.S. giants Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, along with home-grown players Galaxy and SJM Holdings and joint ventures Melco Crown and a casino jointly operated by MGM Mirage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing repeat customers coming back more regularly than previously," said an executive at one of the six operators. "It's been occurring for two and a half months, but they probably lightened up even more since September 1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macau has rocketed on to the global gambling stage in recent years following reforms earlier this decade that saw an end to a previous monopoly and awarding of licenses to multiple players, boosting competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market grew 57 percent in 2007 alone, fueled by a huge influx of mainland Chinese, who now make up about 65 percent of casino visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDEN OCTOBER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macau generated HK$105.6 billion ($13.5 billion) in gross gaming revenues in 2008, more than double the HK$46.7 billion generated by the Las Vegas Strip during the same period, according to a prospectus from Wynn Macau, the Macau assets of Wynn Resorts, which is preparing an IPO in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Beijing clamped down on mainland visitors to Macau in the middle of last year amid a proliferation of stories of officials illegally gambling away millions of dollars in government funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That clampdown, combined with the global financial crisis, sent a chill through Macau, with gaming revenue down 12.5 percent in the first half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The return of Chinese tourists and an improving economy helped Macau post record casino revenue in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"September will be very good, but not a record," said one of the executives. "October will be the highest because of the eight-day Golden Week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robert LaFleur, a U.S. analyst with Susquehanna Financial Group, said the easing of the Macau visa restrictions had been expected and should come as no surprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Things are sort of coming together pretty well for Macau," LaFleur said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he also said a weekend Wall Street Journal report suggesting casino stocks may be a bad bet at current prices could be affecting U.S. casino shares, which had rallied strongly in recent weeks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Doug Young with added reporting by Kyle Peterson and Karen Jacobs in the United States; Editing by Chris Lewis, Valerie Lee, Dave Zimmerman)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Delo 710 LE SAE 20W-40 Meets Future and Current Market Needs 
SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron`s Delo brand of technologically advanced engine oils, lubricants and
coolants has introduced the newest member of its product family, Delo 710 LE
(Low Emissions) SAE 20W-40 - the first marine lubricant designed with tier-four
engine compliance in mind. Chevron Delo 710 LE is a premium diesel engine oil
for use in EMD and GE engines. The lubricant is specifically formulated for use
with Low Sulfur Diesel (LSD) and Ultra Low Sulfur Diesel (ULSD) fuels and new
low emission engines. 

Chevron Delo 710 LE employs newly developed dispersants, detergents and
oxidation inhibitors to provide outstanding oil life and reduced ash content. In
fact, the advanced additive technology found in Delo 710 LE cuts ash levels in
half - over previous generation Delo 6170 CFO - significantly reducing
emissions. These features make Delo 710 LE an excellent lubricant for engines
using LSD and ULSD fuels with or without exhaust after-treatment equipment. 

"Like many industries, the marine market is in the process of changing to
address emissions issues," said Tom Keirnes, marine account manager, Chevron
Global Lubricants. "In this change, Chevron saw an opportunity to deliver a new
marine diesel engine oil formulated for new, lower sulfur fuels. We also looked
toward the future in an effort to make sure Delo 710 LE would work with the new
engine technologies and exhaust after treatment systems that are on the horizon.
The result is a product that reduces emissions, provides enhanced protection
against wear and lowers oil consumption. Delo 710 LE gives our customers an oil
that provides bottom line impact while positioning them for the future." 

The performance advantages offered by Delo 710 LE are significant, with
cylinders, pistons, rings and bearings well protected against wear and
corrosion, resulting in longer service life and reduced maintenance costs. The
SAE 20W-40 lubricant can also reduce oil consumption by 15-20%* compared to
single-grade oils, lowering operating costs. 

Delo 710 LE is formulated with ISOSYN Technology. ISOSYN Technology combines
highly refined base oils with advanced additives to create products that rival
synthetic lubricants in critical performance tests. 

Delo 710 LE 20W-40 benefits:

* Designed for low and ultra low sulfur diesel fuels 
* Formulated for modern EMD and GE engines used in a wide range of inland marine
applications 
* Uses an optimized additive formulation with reduced ash and incorporates
advanced dispersant technology 
* Helps reduce exhaust system and turbo-charger deposits 
* Zinc free, Non-chlorinated 
* Compatible with earlier generation EMD and GE approved engine oils 
* EMD Generation V approved for use in engines operating under EMD factory
warranty 
* General Electric Generation IV Long Life approved

Delo 710 LE 20W-40 will be available in the fall of 2009. Contact your local
Chevron lubricant marketer for more information. For more information on Delo

 Title                                         Protecting Data in Motion                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                
 Overview                                      The number one problem that`s driving a new generation of file transfer technology is data protection. If you have un-auditable pockets of file transfer technology all over the place, you can`t answer the fundamental question: "What`s being transferred?   
                                               Where? And are we okay with that?" You have no oversight that helps you catch issues early on. And you have no audit trails to help you investigate problems.                                                                                                   
                                               
Kyle Parris will explore the data protection challenges that are driving enterprises to invest in best-in-class managed file transfer solutions. He`ll present a tool kit of solutions using standard methods and protocols to protect in motion, with a

    Visa International's recent investment in Monitise plc, a mobile payments
technology vendor, is not sufficient to change the horizon of mobile
banking.

    The investment is not unique; most issuers, acquirers, and networks
already have business alliances, investments, or ventures with mobile
technology providers.

    If the Visa network elects to integrate some of the features of Monitise
into a Visa product, it will have to contend with the possibility of
competing with its own customers' offerings.

    Although the investment is of note because it indicates Visa's financial
commitment to mobile payments, it has the potential to create conflicts in
the market.

&lt;p&gt;SEOUL (Reuters) - A united Korea -- combining Asia's fourth biggest economy with one of its poorest -- could surpass that of Germany or Japan in economic might in the next 30-40 years, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though North Korea's planned economy system looks to be on the edge of collapse, it offers a large and cheap workforce, a wealth of minerals that the resource-poor South currently has to import to feed its industry and the likelihood of gains in productivity and its currency once economic reforms take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We project that a united Korea could overtake France, Germany and possibly Japan in 30-40 years in terms of GDP in U.S. dollar terms," it said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thw two Koreas have been separated for more than half a century and have yet to sign a peace treaty to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Goldman Sachs report was published just as the communist North has shown signs of being willing to reengage with the outside world, from which it has been all but cut off after a series of nuclear and missile tests this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It also comes as the conservative government in Seoul has turned increasingly hard-nosed in dealings with its prickly neighbor, ending years of aid until Pyongyang starts to dismantle its nuclear weapons programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The cost of reunification has long been seen as one of the biggest risks facing the South Korean economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many analysts warn the South's rise to an economic powerhouse in the region could be undone by the burden of absorbing its neighbor, whose per capita income is about 5 percent the size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman Sachs said it could be affordable by having the appropriate policies and by following the China/Hong Kong reunification model which allows two political and economic systems to co-exist, with limited inter-Korean migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The report was written by the bank's South Korea economist, Goohoon Kwon, and included input from one of the economists who co-authored the bank's influential prediction earlier this decade that the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China -- the so-called BRICs -- would turn dominant by the mid-century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It argued that there remained a spirit of reconciliation despite the hardening in Seoul and that the political backdrop in the region was supportive of peaceful and gradual integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;North Korea's increasing lag behind other former planned economies, such as Russia, China and Vietnam, "could eventually spark powerful political and economic changes in North Korea which, with the recent political changes in the U.S. and Japan, could transform the nature and magnitude of North Korea risks".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, N.C., Sept. 21, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Icagen, Inc.
(Nasdaq:ICGN) today announced a one year extension to a prior worldwide
collaboration and licensing agreement with Pfizer aimed at discovering,
developing and commercializing compounds that modify three specific sodium ion
channels as new potential treatments for pain and related disorders.

For the past two years, Icagen and Pfizer have partnered to identify compounds
that target three ion channels in a global research and development
collaboration. The companies have also formed a joint research committee (JRC)
to monitor and oversee the collaboration.

The ion channel targets included in the collaboration are sodium channels, which
are important in the generation of electrical signals in nerve fibers that
mediate the initiation, transmission and sensation of pain. By selectively
targeting these sodium channels, the companies seek to develop effective
treatments for serious pain disorders with few side effects.

During the extension period, Pfizer will continue to fund all aspects of the
collaboration including research efforts at both companies. Pfizer also will
continue to have exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize products resulting
from the collaboration. Under the terms of the extended agreement, Pfizer will
provide approximately $5.0 million in committed funding to Icagen over the next
year of the collaboration through September 30, 2010. Additionally, Icagen
remains eligible to receive approximately $359 million in research, development,
regulatory and commercialization milestones for each product. Icagen is also
eligible to receive tiered royalties, against which the commercialization
milestones are creditable, based upon product sales.

"We are very pleased to announce this extension of our previous collaboration
with Pfizer," noted P. Kay Wagoner, Ph.D., President and CEO of Icagen. "We have
had a great partnership thus far and remain confident that the combined
abilities of our two companies will help identify novel drug candidates directed
at one or more of these important sodium channel targets for the treatment of
pain and related disorders."

Gillian Burgess, Ph.D., Chief Scientific Officer of Pfizer's Pain Research Unit
and member of the Icagen-Pfizer JRC, continued, "We have made substantial
progress over the first two years of our collaboration and look forward to
working with Icagen in the upcoming year in seeking to identify drug candidates
from these targeted programs."

About Icagen

Icagen, Inc. is a biopharmaceutical company based in Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina, focused on the discovery, development and commercialization of
novel orally-administered small molecule drugs that modulate ion channel
targets. Utilizing its proprietary know-how and integrated scientific and drug
development capabilities, Icagen has identified multiple drug candidates that
modulate ion channels. The Company is conducting research and development
activities in a number of disease areas, including epilepsy, pain and

&lt;p&gt;UANI Applauds General Electric for Refusing to Do Business with Iran
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
General Electric (GE) today signed United Against Nuclear Iran's (UANI's) Iran
Business Declaration, affirming that it does not and will not conduct business
in or with Iran. UANI applauds GE for its decision. 

The UANI Business Declaration and GE's corporate citizenship and international
trade control policies ensure that GE does not do business in Iran or other
countries designated as State Sponsors of Terrorism. 

As part of its pledge, GE will provide humanitarian health care products to the
Iranian people that suffer under the repression of a theocratic dictatorship. GE
will donate any profits earned from this assistance to charitable organizations
including the International Rescue Committee, a nonprofit organization dedicated
to helping refugees and victims of armed conflict around the world. 

Responding to GE's decision, Ambassador Mark D. Wallace, President of UANI today
said: "General Electric recognizes the danger of a nuclear-armed Iran and by
signing the Iran Business Declaration, GE sets a strong example of corporate
responsibility. UANI calls on the international business community to follow
GE's example." 

UANI's Iran Business Declaration provides companies with an opportunity to
certify publicly that they do not and will not conduct business in or with Iran.
Collective action on the part of the international business community will
isolate the Iranian regime and remove the economic crutch upon which the current
regime relies to pursue its illegal nuclear weapons program.

&lt;p&gt;Global Marketing Campaign to Support Sponsorship of the 2010 FIFA World Cup
South Africa Unveiled at Global Press Conference in Zurich
ZURICH--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today unveiled elements of a global integrated marketing
campaign inspired by the joyous dance celebrations familiar to Africa, the host
continent for the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The campaign developed to support its
sponsorship of the landmark sporting event is an extension of the current
Coca-Cola brand platform "Open Happiness." 

The campaign, showcased during a global press conference attended by Coca-Cola
Chairman and CEO Muhtar Kent and FIFA President Joseph S. Blatter at the
headquarters of Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA),
invites fans to express their optimism and passion for football through active
dance celebrations. 

Among the key elements from the Coca-Cola campaign are the first-ever
recognition of the best player celebration carried out during the tournament, a
music anthem, global television commercials, an online program, commemorative
packaging and the 86-country FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola. 

"The worldwide passion for the sport of football is unrivalled and gives our
business the best platform to connect with fans everywhere Coca-Cola does
business," said Muhtar Kent, chairman and chief executive officer, The Coca-Cola
Company. "Our programs to support the 2010 FIFA World Cup, like the Trophy Tour,
will help ensure that fans have the chance to experience the excitement and
pageantry of football no matter where they live. And like all football fans,
Coca-Cola is especially excited about the 2010 FIFA World Cup taking place on
the African continent for the first time." 

The campaign begins with the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola, which will
take the Trophy to 86 countries, including every nation in Africa. The
ceremonial start of the tour was held today as President Blatter and Mr. Kent
sent the Trophy on its round-the-world journey. The FIFA World Cup Trophy will
be flown later in the week from Zurich to its first stop in Cairo, Egypt. 

"The international reach and marketing expertise of our partner Coca-Cola is an
enormous benefit in strengthening the game and helps us bring the excitement and
passion of our sport to more people around the globe," said Joseph S. Blatter,
president of FIFA. "This campaign captures both the unique spirit of the
continent of Africa and the celebrations that football inspires." 

"Football, especially during the FIFA World Cup, can motivate people to `let go`
a bit and express their passion in a spontaneous way," said Joe Tripodi, chief
marketing and commercial leadership officer, The Coca-Cola Company. "This is
particularly true of African football, where there is often a heightened passion
for exuberant, colorful celebrations both on and off the field. That is the
inspiration for our entire campaign." 

In the months leading up to the FIFA World Cup an array of programs will be
activated that will bring fans closer to the FIFA World Cup experience. Among
the highlights will be a global TV commercial featuring Roger Milla - the
legendary footballer from Cameroon famed for his iconic celebratory dance during
the FIFA World Cup Italia in 1990. Millions around the world remember Milla`s
goal celebration as the first to include a joyful dance. Milla was on hand in
Zurich to present the new spot. 

Elements of the campaign will include: 

The FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola

World football`s greatest prize is set to embark on its biggest ever global tour
as part of the FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola. Free tickets to the
Trophy Tour will be made available to consumers via Coca-Cola promotions in
countries on the route. At events in each city, fans can have a souvenir photo
taken of themselves with the trophy, view a 3-D movie showcasing moments of the
FIFA World Cup, participate in interactive displays and enjoy other
entertainment. Short films highlighting the African leg of the tour will be
created by a film crew lead by renowned filmmaker Jeremy Gilley of Peace One
Day. 

Coca-Cola Celebration Award

For the first time ever, Coca-Cola will recognize the tournament`s best goal
celebration. Fans will be able to vote for the eventual winner online. For every
goal scored during the 2010 FIFA World Cup and celebrated with a dance,
Coca-Cola will make an additional donation to the Company`s "Water for Schools"
effort that helps provide schools access to safe drinking water. The award will
only recognize celebrations conducted within the rules of the game. 

World`s Longest Celebration

Coca-Cola is inviting football fans to film and upload their own goal
celebrations to the Coke website. All clips will be edited into a continuous
`loop` to create a non-stop celebration that will air on the website. Eligible
fans will have the chance of winning great FIFA World Cup prizes including match
tickets. 

Advertising

Coca-Cola has created three commercials as part of the campaign - `Roger Milla`,
which tells the story of how Roger Milla inspired footballers to celebrate goals
in an African-inspired manner, `Quest`, an animated tale of one young
footballer`s quest to find his perfect goal celebration and `Borders`, a film
showing the hilarious things that sometimes happen as the FIFA World Cup trophy
makes its way around the globe. 

K`Naan Music Anthem

Up-and-coming Somalian hip-hop artist K`Naan has specially recorded an uplifting
African-inspired track, a remix of `Wavin Flag`, as the anthem of Coca-Cola`s
2010 FIFA World Cup program. The track will be used as the music element
throughout the entire campaign including as the soundtrack on all TV
commercials, played at FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour by Coca-Cola events, featured
on the online digital platform and more. 

`Coca-Cola Presents: Celebrating the Goal` Documentary

Coca-Cola is producing a 60-minute documentary which investigates the stories
behind the world`s most famous goal celebrations and catches up with 2010 FIFA
World Cup players as they plan their African inspired celebrations for the
tournament. The documentary will be broadcast globally in the run-up to the 2010
FIFA World Cup. 

Commemorative Packaging

Consumers around the world can put their hands on special Coca-Cola packaging
that celebrates the 2010 FIFA World Cup with dynamic graphics and football
imagery. 

Coca-Cola Football Camp

250 teenagers from around the world will gather at a special football camp
hosted by Coca-Cola in Pretoria, South Africa, during the FIFA World Cup
tournament. The camp will encourage young people to continue to be active
through sports and will include training, skills demonstrations, celebrity
coaches and a tournament. 

Coca-Cola Flagbearers

Once again, Coca-Cola is giving young football fans around the world the
once-in-a-lifetime chance to be official flag bearers and lead the teams out on
to the pitch before 2010 FIFA World Cup games. 

The Coca-Cola Company has had a formal association with FIFA since 1974 and an
official sponsorship of FIFA World Cup that began in 1978. Coca-Cola has had
stadium advertising at every FIFA World Cup since 1950 and is a long-time

&lt;p&gt;SHANGHAI/HONG KONG (Reuters) - An investment arm of Goldman Sachs is in talks with Chinese car maker Geely Automotive, which has been linked with both Volvo and Opel, to buy about $250 million of the company's convertible bonds and warrants, two sources said.&lt;/p&gt;

 (Adds more quotes, background)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SHANGHAI/HONG KONG, Sept 21 (Reuters) - An investment arm
of Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is in talks with Chinese car maker
Geely Automotive (0175.HK), which has been linked with both
Volvo and Opel, to buy about $250 million of the company's
convertible bonds and warrants, two sources said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The two sides have basically agreed on the investment in
Geely already, but have yet to work out some technical
details," one source with direct knowledge of the deal told
Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geely, China's 10th largest vehicle maker, said this month
its parent was considering a bid for Ford's (F.N) Swedish car
brand Volvo with a local government-backed investment firm.
[ID:nHKG180468]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A successful deal would boost Geely's profile and give it
access to Volvo technologies which it needs to upgrade its
cars.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A source told Reuters last week that Geely's parent also
had approached Canadian auto parts maker Magna International
MGa.TO about a potential production partnership on Opel.
General Motors [GM.UL] agreed earlier this month to sell a 55

company said it was considering a convertible bond and warrants
issue, though Geely Executive Director Lawrence Ang told
Reuters the issue was not related to Volvo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geely would use the proceeds from a Goldman deal to boost
its production capacity -- including adding 150,000 units a

from its parent, with a combined annual capacity of 165,000
units, once construction was completed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Car sales in China, the world's largest auto market, have
grown sharply this year, boosted by Beijing's policy
initiatives, including sales tax cuts on small cars and
subsidies for rural buyers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Automakers from GM to Volkswagen (VOWG.DE) are building new
plant or setting up new China joint ventures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geely, which competes against Chery Automobile and other
local brands, has current annual production capacity for
370,000 cars, according to data provided by a Geely
representative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The car maker, based in the eastern city of Hangzhou, had
said previously it aimed to add capacity of 315,000 in phases,
including taking over its parent's three facilities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Geely's January-August car sales rose 35 percent to more
than 185,000 units, equivalent to 74 percent of its full-year
target, another company executive said.

International Business Machines (IBM) and Cisco Systems (CSCO) recently
announced the selection of Smart grid partners and products. Smart grid
technology transforms the way power is distributed and used, adding intelligence
throughout the grid, which ultimately results in substantial reduction of
wastage and faults, improves receptiveness, handles current and future demand
efficiently and manages costs. IBM`s smart grid maturity model helps to
accelerate the adoption of smart grid technologies and business solutions. 

To enhance this segment IBM`s software platform is tying together various
enterprise products like Lotus and WebSphere. This apart, IBM also announced

Here are highlights from Friday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Discover Surpasses Forecasts

Discover Financial Services` (DFS) third quarter (ended Aug. 31, 2009) earnings
came in at $1.07 per share, substantially ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate.
This compares to earnings of 37 cents per share in the prior-year quarter. The
results were bolstered primarily by an antitrust lawsuit settlement and cost
containment measures. 

The antitrust lawsuit, which claimed that Visa (V) and MasterCard (MA) harmed
Discover`s business by preventing their member banks from issuing credit cards
for Discover`s network, contributed $287 million (after-tax) to Discover`s
earnings. 

Net income available to common stockholders came in at $559.4 million, compared
to $209.2 million in the prior quarter and $180.1 million in the prior-year
quarter. 

Southern Technology Enriches China

Southern Co. (SO) yesterday said that it has agreed with a Chinese utility for
the first commercial use of the firm`s proprietary new low-emission coal-based
electricity production. 

The technology - known as the Transport Integrated Gasification (TRIG) - is an
integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) technology that produces
electricity with lower emissions than traditional coal power plants. It converts
coal to synthetic gas, from which pollutants can be removed before being burned
in a combustion turbine to produce electricity. The technology can also be used
with lower grades of coals that are plentiful in China. 

TRIG has been developed at an Alabama research facility by Southern Co., in
collaboration with KBR Inc. (KBR) and other partners, which include the U.S.
Department of Energy. 

Per the terms of the agreement, the developers of TRIG will provide Beijing
Guoneng Yinghui Clean Energy Engineering Co. Ltd. with licensing, engineering
services and proprietary equipment for the implementation of the technology at a
120-megawatt (MW) power plant operated by Dongguan Tianming Electric Power Co.
Ltd. in Guandong Province of China.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 21 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan Securities downgraded four
European media stocks, including Britain's biggest free-to-air
broadcaster ITV Plc (ITV.L) and French broadcaster M6
(MMTP.PA), to "neutral" from "overweight" citing disappointing
second-quarter results and a weak advertising market outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We were expecting the ad market year-over-year rate of
decline to reach the trough by 2009 June end and to rebound in
the second half of 2009, with a gradual improvement expected
from third quarter," the brokerage said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Instead, most media management highlighted that the
decline seen in the first half of 2009 was expected to persist
in the third quarter," it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan estimates ad spend in major Western European
countries to fall 14.6 percent on a year-over-year basis in
2009, compared with its prior view of a 10.8 percent decline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also lowered its ratings on German commercial
broadcaster ProSiebenSat1 PSMG_p.DE and Italian broadcaster
Mediaset SpA (MS.MI).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JP Morgan, however, upgraded PagesJaunes PAJ.PA and
Wolters Kluwer (WLSNc.AS) to "overweight" from "neutral". The
brokerage raised its prices targets on shares of several media
companies and said the advertising market recovery would likely
start next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage named the world's No. 2 outdoor advertising
group JCDecaux (JCDX.PA), German pay-TV broadcaster Sky
Deutschland (SKYDn.DE) and Swedish media company Modern Times
Group (MTGb.ST) its top picks, and said the three were the
growth stories in the sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The brokerage also named Dutch publisher Wolters Kluwer
(WLSNc.AS) and French media and telecoms giant Vivendi (VIV.PA)
as its top defensive picks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For related alerts, double-click [ID:nWNAB1327]

&lt;p&gt; (Fixes date in dateline; no other changes)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; (Click on [ID:nSEO177561] for related story)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Jonathan Thatcher&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; SEOUL, Sept 21 (Reuters) - A united Korea -- combining
Asia's fourth biggest economy with one of its poorest -- could
surpass that of Germany or Japan in economic might in the next
30-40 years, U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Though North Korea's planned economy system looks to be on
the edge of collapse, it offers a large and cheap workforce, a
wealth of minerals that the resource-poor South currently has
to import to feed its industry and the likelihood of gains in
productivity and its currency once economic reforms take hold.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We project that a united Korea could overtake France,
Germany and possibly Japan in 30-40 years in terms of GDP in
U.S. dollar terms," it said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Thw two Koreas have been separated for more than half a
century and have yet to sign a peace treaty to formally end the
1950-53 Korean War.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Goldman Sachs report was published just as the
communist North has shown signs of being willing to reengage
with the outside world, from which it has been all but cut off
after a series of nuclear and missile tests this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It also comes as the conservative government in Seoul has
turned increasingly hard-nosed in dealings with its prickly
neighbour, ending years of aid until Pyongyang starts to
dismantle its nuclear weapons programme.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cost of reunification has long been seen as one of the
biggest risks facing the South Korean economy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Many analysts warn the South's rise to an economic
powerhouse in the region could be undone by the burden of
absorbing its neighbour, whose per capita income is about 5
percent the size.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Goldman Sachs said it could be affordable by having the
appropriate policies and by following the China/Hong Kong
reunification model which allows two political and economic
systems to co-exist, with limited inter-Korean migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report was written by the bank's South Korea economist,
Goohoon Kwon, and included input from one of the economists who
co-authored the bank's influential prediction earlier this
decade that the economies of Brazil, Russia, India and China --
the so-called BRICs -- would turn dominant by the mid-century.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It argued that there remained a spirit of reconciliation
despite the hardening in Seoul and that the political backdrop
in the region was supportive of peaceful and gradual
integration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; North Korea's increasing lag behind other former planned
economies, such as Russia, China and Vietnam, "could eventually
spark powerful political and economic changes in North Korea
which, with the recent political changes in the U.S. and Japan,
could transform the nature and magnitude of North Korea
risks".

&lt;p&gt;  BOSTON, MA, Sep 21 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
EMBEDDED SYSTEMS CONFERENCE 2009 -- LynuxWorks(TM), Inc., a world leader
in embedded software, today announced the immediate release of LynxSecure
3.1, the latest version of its next-generation and award-winning
separation kernel and embedded hypervisor. This update to LynxSecure
takes advantage of new technologies, including guest operating support
for the latest Microsoft Windows(R) and the latest Intel(R) Core2 Duo
systems.

    As with prior versions, LynxSecure 3.1 can virtualize the underlying
hardware to enable multiple, heterogeneous operating systems (OS) to
co-exist on the same platform. This mix can include traditional desktop
OSes like fully virtualized Windows and para-virtualized Linux(R) along
with hard real-time OSes like the LynxOS(R) RTOS family. LynxSecure 3.1
introduces support for Windows 7, Windows Vista and Windows 2003 which
are run as fully virtualized guest OSes, adding to the existing Windows
XP support offered in version 3.0. LynxSecure 3.1 gives embedded systems
developers the ultimate flexibility of full desktop systems, while
retaining military-grade security with real-time performance and
determinism.

    LynxSecure also offers built-in virtual networking, allowing Windows
applications to seamlessly communicate via TCP/IP with other virtualized
OSes, such as Linux, running in a separate partition. This rapid and
secure inter-partition communication is handled entirely by LynxSecure,
without modifying the applications or the virtualized OS.

    Unlike other hypervisor solutions and as a testament to the performance of
LynxSecure, applications that require 3D graphics support can also be run
at near-native performance on virtualized guest OSes. These applications
are very commonly required in industries such as A, medical and gaming,
bringing the functionality of LynxSecure to the reach of many more
embedded developers.

    Support for some of the latest Intel Core2 Duo devices, including
reference platforms such as the American Portwell Wade 8067, is included
in LynxSecure 3.1. The multi-core processor and hardware virtualization
capabilities of these boards mean virtualized guest OSes can now operate
at near-native performance.

    "With the release of LynxSecure 3.1, we've again raised the bar for
software virtualization solutions," said Gurjot Singh, CEO, LynuxWorks.
"This new version gives our customers even more flexibility for their
application development without compromising the performance and security
that has defined LynxSecure as the leader in this new and exciting space."

    LynxSecure can run on any 32-bit or 64-bit processor with a memory
management unit (MMU) and provides 100 percent application binary
compatibility between a stand alone OS and its virtualized version. Like
all LynuxWorks products, LynxSecure is based on open standards, but it
also offers the highest real-time and security capabilities, conforming
to the MILS standard and designed to be certifiable to Common Criteria
EAL 7+.

    About LynuxWorks

    LynuxWorks, a world leader in the embedded software market, is committed
to providing open and reliable real-time operating systems (RTOS) and
software tools to embedded developers. The company's LynxOS family of
operating systems offers open standards with the highest level of safety
and security features, enabling many mission-critical systems in defense,
avionics and other industries. Additionally, LynuxWorks' BlueCat Linux

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - China has quietly eased restrictions on its citizens traveling from Guangdong province to Macau, sending casino stocks soaring on Monday as industry executives bet on record October earnings in the world's hottest gambling market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in Galaxy Entertainment and Melco International jumped around 9 percent, and SJM Holdings was up more than 6 percent, while the broader Hang Seng stock index fell 0.7 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Alarmed that some Guangdong residents were gambling too much in neighboring Macau, China last year imposed new rules limiting them to two trips a year to the former Portuguese enclave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the authorities began easing up on the rule as early as two months ago, and noticeably loosened the restriction at the start of this month, said top executives at two of Macau's six casino licensees, speaking on condition of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The latest version is (they can travel to Macau) once a month out of Guangdong," said one of the executives. "Gaming revenues for the first two weeks of the month have been good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The other executive forecast that October -- a high travel season for Chinese because of the October 1 Golden Week holiday -- could see record monthly casino revenues, in part due to the relaxing of the visa rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macau's six casino operators include U.S. giants Las Vegas Sands and Wynn Resorts, along with home-grown players Galaxy and SJM Holdings and joint ventures Melco Crown and a casino jointly operated by MGM Mirage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're seeing repeat customers coming back more regularly than previously," said an executive at one of the six operators. "It's been occurring for two and a half months, but they probably lightened up even more since September 1."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macau has rocketed on to the global gambling stage in recent years following reforms earlier this decade that saw an end to a previous monopoly and awarding of licenses to multiple players, boosting competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market grew 57 percent in 2007 alone, fueled by a huge influx of mainland Chinese, who now make up about 65 percent of casino visitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;GOLDEN OCTOBER&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Macau generated HK$105.6 billion ($13.5 billion) in gross gaming revenues in 2008, more than double the HK$46.7 billion generated by the Las Vegas Strip during the same period, according to a prospectus from Wynn Macau, the Macau assets of Wynn Resorts, which is preparing an IPO in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Beijing clamped down on mainland visitors to Macau in the middle of last year amid a proliferation of stories of officials illegally gambling away millions of dollars in government funds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That clampdown, combined with the global financial crisis, sent a chill through Macau, with gaming revenue down 12.5 percent in the first half of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The return of Chinese tourists and an improving economy helped Macau post record casino revenue in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"September will be very good, but not a record," said one of the executives. "October will be the highest because of the eight-day Golden Week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Doug Young; Editing by Chris Lewis and Valerie Lee)&lt;/p&gt;

two casino executives told Reuters that China had eased its

Guangdong province.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Shares of Galaxy were up 8.67 percent at 0647 GMT and shares

Macau casino operator, was up more than 9 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two casino sources told Reuters that China had quietly begun
relaxing restrictions for its citizens from Guangdong traveling
to Macau, leading to a strong showing for casinos so far this
month and big hopes for October. [ID:nHKG158012]

Key Study Results Will Be Presented Across 5 Compounds and 9 Tumor Types
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--


Pfizer Oncology will present data from across its portfolio, including results
from long-term follow-up of Aromasin&#174; (exemestane tablets) in a study of early
breast cancer,1 updated study results from a Phase 3 study of Sutent&#174; (sunitinib
malate) in pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NET),2 and early-stage research of
investigational agents PF-023410663 and figitumumab (CP-751,871)4 in patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These data, and over a dozen additional
abstracts covering Pfizer agents, will be presented at the ECCO 15/ESMO 34
bi-annual meeting in Berlin, Germany from September 20 to September 24. 

"Pfizer is conducting research to identify clinical benefits for targeted
patient populations with investigational compounds like cMET/ALK inhibitor,
while continuing to study drugs like Aromasin through their entire life cycle to
ensure we provide maximum support and information to patients and healthcare
providers about our cancer products," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice
president of clinical development and medical affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology
Business Unit. 

Featured Data Highlights

At the meeting, Pfizer will present new 91-month median follow-up data from the
Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES) study (Abstract #5010; September 22) which is
evaluating the clinical benefits of switching women to Aromasin after two to
three years of tamoxifen versus continuing women on tamoxifen for a full five
years of therapy.1 IES, a randomized, double-blind, multinational trial of
postmenopausal women with hormone sensitive early breast cancer,5 enrolled 4,724
patients. IES is a landmark trial with the longest follow-up of endocrine
treatment in the adjuvant switch setting.6

New study results from an expansion cohort of a Phase 1 study evaluating the
investigational agent PF-02341066 in patients with NSCLC carrying the ALK
(anaplastic lymphoma kinases) fusion gene will be highlighted in the "Best of
2009" Presidential Plenary session Thursday, September 24 (Abstract #6G).3
PF-02341066 is a selective ATP-competitive small molecule inhibitor of both
c-MET/HGF receptor and ALK tyrosine kinases and their oncogenic variants.
PF-02341066 is the first agent in clinical development that selectively targets
a unique genetic feature found in several types of cancer, echinoderm
microtubule-associate protein-like 4 (EML4)-ALK translocation, present in
approximately 3 - 7 percent of NSCLC patients.7

In addition, final results will be presented from a Phase 3 trial (Abstract
#6.502, September 23), which was discontinued in January 2009 following the
recommendation of an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) after
finding no evidence of improvement in the primary endpoint of survival in
patients with advanced pancreatic cancer treated with axitinib and gemcitabine,
compared to gemcitabine alone.

About Sutent (sunitinib malate)

Sutent is an oral multi-kinase inhibitor approved for the treatment of
gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) after disease progression on or
intolerance to imatinib mesylate and advanced / metastatic renal cell carcinoma
(RCC). 

Sutent works by blocking multiple molecular targets implicated in the growth,
proliferation and spread of cancer. Two important Sutent targets, vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR) and platelet-derived growth factor
receptor (PDGFR), are expressed by many types of solid tumors and are thought to
play a crucial role in angiogenesis, the process by which tumors acquire blood
vessels, oxygen and nutrients needed for growth. Sutent also inhibits other
targets important to tumor growth, including KIT, FLT3 and RET. 

Important Sutent (sunitinib malate) Safety Information

Women of child bearing age who are (or become) pregnant during therapy should be
informed of the potential for fetal harm while on Sutent. 

Decreases in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) to below the lower limit
of normal (LLN) have been observed. Patients with concomitant cardiac conditions
should be carefully monitored for clinical signs and symptoms of congestive
heart failure. 

Patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with
standard antihypertensive therapy. Complete blood counts (CBCs) with platelet
count and serum chemistries should be performed at the beginning of each
treatment cycle for patients receiving treatment with Sutent. 

The most common adverse reactions in advanced RCC and GIST clinical trials were
fatigue, asthenia, diarrhea, nausea, mucositis/stomatitis, vomiting, dyspepsia,
abdominal pain, constipation, hypertension, rash, hand-foot syndrome, skin
discoloration, altered taste, anorexia and bleeding. 

About Aromasin (exemestane tablets)

Aromasin is the only aromatase inhibitor indicated for sequential therapy in
postmenopausal women with HR positive early breast cancer after two to three
years of tamoxifen for a total of five years of adjuvant therapy. The use of
Aromasin in this setting is supported by the landmark IES trial. Aromasin is
also indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal
women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. 

Important Aromasin (exemestane tablets) Safety Information

Aromasin should not be used in women who are premenopausal, are nursing or
pregnant, have a known hypersensitivity to the drug, or are taking
estrogen-containing agents. Dose modification is recommended for patients who
are receiving certain medications, including strong CYP 3A4 inducers. In
patients with early breast cancer, elevations in bilirubin, alkaline
phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those receiving Aromasin than
either tamoxifen or placebo. Reductions in bone mineral density over time are
seen with the use of Aromasin.

&lt;p&gt; * China allows visits to Macau once a month - exec&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Record gaming revenues expected in October - exec&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Visitors up noticeably in the last two months
 (Adds details)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Doug Young&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HONG KONG, Sept 21 (Reuters) - China has quietly begun
relaxing restrictions for its citizens from Guangdong province
traveling to Macau, leading to a strong showing for casinos so
far this month and big hopes for October, two industry sources
said on Monday.
 Alarmed that some residents of Guangdong were gambling too
much in neighboring Macau, China last year imposed a new rule
limiting them to two trips per year to the former Portuguese
enclave.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But the authorities began easing up on the rule as early as
two months ago, and noticeably loosened the restriction at the
start of this month, said top executives at two of the market's
six casino licensees, speaking on condition of anonymity due to
the sensitivity of the situation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The latest version is (they can travel to Macau) once a
month out of Guangdong," said one of the executives. "Gaming
revenues for the first two weeks of the month have been good."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The other executive forecast that October -- a high travel
season for Chinese because of the Oct 1 Golden Week holiday at
the beginning of the month -- could see monthly casino revenues
soar to a record high, in part due to the relaxing visa rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Macau's six casino operators include U.S. casino giants Las
Vegas Sands (LVS.N) and Wynn Resorts (WYNN.O), along with
homegrown players Galaxy Entertainment (0027.HK) and SJM Holdings
(0880.HK) and joint ventures Melco Crown (MPEL.O) and a casino
jointly operated by MGM Mirage (MGM.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're seeing repeat customers coming back more regularly
than previously," said an executive at one of the six operators.
"It's been occurring for two and a half months, but they probably
lightened up even more since the first of September."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Macau has rocketed onto the global gambling stage in recent
years, following reforms earlier this decade that saw an end to a
previous monopoly and awarding of licenses to multiple players,
boosting competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Macau market generated HK$105.6 billion ($13.5 billion)
in gross gaming revenues in 2008, more than double the HK$46.7
billion generated by the Las Vegas Strip during the same period,
according to a prospectus from Wynn Macau, the Macau assets of
Wynn Resorts, which is preparing an IPO in Hong Kong.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Macau reported HK$64,678.1 daily gross win per gaming table
in 2008, about three times the HK$21,531.4 reported for the Las
Vegas Strip in the same period, the prospectus added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The return of Chinese tourists with the relaxation of visa
restrictions and an improving economy helped Macau to post record
casino revenue in August, following a 12.5 percent decline in the
first half of the year at the height of the global downturn.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; One of the executives said September is unlikely to notch a
new monthly record as many Chinese -- who account for more than
half of all gambling revenue -- may delay their trips to coincide
with the long holiday that begins Oct 1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "September will be very good but not a record," he said.
"October will be the highest because of the eight-day Golden
Week."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Shares of Galaxy Entertainment were up 1.16 percent in the
morning session in Hong Kong, while SJM shares were up 1.63
percent, leading a 0.21 percent for the broader market .HSI.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
As part of his keynote address today, Sean Maloney, General Manager at Intel,
disclosed that IBM will soon have a 4 socket blade using the next generation
Intel Xeon processor. The blade is based on IBM's next generation of
X-Architecture, eX5. This new blade extends IBM`s influence in the fast growing
high-end x86 marketplace, and opens up a range of new application environments
for clients. 

"We are excited to partner with Intel, bringing to market a differentiated
offering that combines Intel's latest processor with the innovation of IBM's
X-Architecture. The new BladeCenter demonstrates our commitment to delivering
the latest technology while maximizing customers' existing infrastructure
investments," said Alex Yost, IBM's Vice President and Business Line Executive
for IBM System x and BladeCenter. 

The new IBM BladeCenter offering is another example of Intel and IBM`s ongoing
technology collaboration. IBM and Intel have a rich history of working together
to push the x86 envelope, especially around blades. In 2002, when blades were in
their infancy, IBM and Intel announced joint development on the BladeCenter
platform. In 2006, IBM, Intel and other leaders in the industry worked together
to establish an open, collaborative community called Blade.org to further drive
innovation in the blade market. Three years later, both Intel and IBM are
actively engaged with dozens of partners in Blade.org, and both companies serve
on the board of directors. 

Kirk Skaugen, Vice President, Intel Architecture Group remarked: "Intel is
working together with IBM to expand the blade ecosystem. New market segments and
broader solutions are already being borne out of the Blade.org community, and
Intel will continue to work closely with the consortium to create new blade
solutions." Today`s announcement reaffirms that intention and validates the
ongoing partnership. 

About Blade.org 

Blade.org is a collaborative vendor and end-use community focused on
accelerating the development and adoption of blade server solutions. The
organization provides leadership to the blade market and fosters a thriving
industry ecosystem focused on delivering valuable solutions to blade computing
customers. More information is available at www.blade.org

&lt;p&gt;Company Launches Innovative Learning Lab Project to Increase Access to Finance
and Skills Development for Women

$5 Million Gift to Clinton Foundation to Support Programs in Developing World


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
During the opening plenary of the Clinton Global Initiative, the Chairman and
CEO of The Coca-Cola Company, Mr. Muhtar Kent, committed to foster economic
development in Africa and other developing markets by bringing more women into
its distribution business. 

The Manual Distribution Centers (MDC) in Africa that distribute Coca-Cola
products in urban areas currently employ over 12,000 people and generate over
$550 million in annual revenues. A new Learning Laboratory project in Tanzania
with partners AED (Academy for Educational Development) and the Bill &amp; Melinda
Gates Foundation will explore ways to increase numbers of women owners in the
MDC program. The objective of the Learning Laboratory is to identify strategies
for overcoming the two biggest barriers to women`s increased participation in
Coca-Cola`s distribution business: access to finance and skills development. 

"Enhancing economic opportunities for women in developing markets will result in
increased wealth, enhanced skills in business, accounting and marketing,
increased profile and stature within the community, and increased economic
opportunity to be applied to future jobs," Kent stated during the session, which
was moderated by President Clinton. 

During the session, Kent provided detail on a $5 million contribution from The
Coca-Cola Company to The Clinton Foundation to support programs in the
developing world. The contribution will comprise $1 million per year, beginning
in 2009 and ending in 2011. Over the same period, the Company plans to
contribute $2 million toward programs in the developing world that are jointly
identified with the Clinton Foundation as being of mutual interest, with a
particular focus on Africa. 

This commitment is the latest by the Company to advance both business goals and
the international development agenda through its system`s MDC program. The MDC
model utilizes small businesses to deliver Coca-Cola products manually to
small-scale retailers in Africa`s hard-to-reach urban and peri-urban markets. 

To date, the Coca-Cola system has created more than 2,600 MDCs in Africa.
Currently, women make up about 30 percent of the MDC entrepreneurs. "Over the
next three years, we plan to greatly increase the participation of women in our
MDC program," Kent said. 

President Clinton applauded the ongoing work by The Coca-Cola Company to support
women. "I would like to thank The Coca-Cola Company again for this valuable
commitment. Solutions that empower women around the world improve communities,
drive economic development and foster sustainable markets for the future," he
said. "The Coca-Cola Company`s micro-distribution model is an excellent example
of the way companies can leverage core business activities to provide
opportunities for women and developing communities." 

The Company has been working to scale-up the number of MDCs in Africa since
joining the Business Call to Action, an initiative that mobilizes large
companies to help reach the Millennium Development Goals by harnessing core
business competencies. Last year, The Coca-Cola Company asked the Corporate
Social Responsibility Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School and the
International Finance Corporation (IFC) to study the MDC model in Dar es Salaam,
Tanzania, and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and recommend specific ways to improve and
expand the program. This research identified a number of opportunities to
further enhance the MDC approach, including bringing more women in to the
business opportunity.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some investors believe Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) may try to shed its commercial banking charter to sidestep U.S. government efforts to rein in exorbitant Wall Street pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But regulators may force the firm to stay in the banking system.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Federal Reserve is proposing new rules to limit pay packages in an effort to curb excessive risk-taking. Banks are expected to bridle under the new restrictions, with Goldman taking particular umbrage because of its history of outsized compensation deals for strong performers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Goldman is a massive bank -- its $890 billion in assets make it the fifth-largest in the United States -- and any difficulty it faces could bring trouble to the financial system. That means regulators are likely to continue to take a keen interest in the bank, investors said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The stakes are high. Regulators are struggling to ensure that they fix the financial system so that the market meltdowns of 2008 are not repeated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The government is going to find a way, one way or another, to include (Goldman) in regulations," said Walter Todd, a portfolio manager at Greenwood Capital Associates in South Carolina.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman, for its part, said it would not seek a change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"(The) Fed is our supervising regulator and we have no plans for that to change," spokesman Lucas van Praag said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But some investors like the idea of Goldman without a bank charter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has slowly been extracting itself from an embrace with the government that began in October, when it received $10 billion of bailout funds as the financial system was collapsing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman paid that money back in June. In July, it redeemed warrants held by the U.S. Treasury for $1.1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Getting rid of its New York banking charter could be one of the last steps it takes to reduce government control over its affairs. Goldman would give up the support of the Federal Reserve in exchange for lighter regulation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If there's confidence that Goldman has endured the worst of the financial crisis, shedding the charter "makes all the sense in the world," said Anton Schutz, president of Mendon Capital Advisors in Rochester, New York.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman and Morgan Stanley (MS.N), the two largest U.S. investment banks, converted to bank holding companies in September 2008 to assuage concerns about their access to funds amid the credit crunch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;HITTING THE BOTTOM LINE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Fed's compensation rules will apply to all employees of Fed-regulated banks, not just the bosses, according to a Fed source. Goldman, in the first half of 2009, set aside $11.3 billion for its year-end bonus pool, equal to about half of its revenues.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Fed regulation might not just limit compensation, but could also reduce Goldman's ability to borrow, curbing the bank's trading revenue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Bank earnings are hindered by too much regulation," said Tom Sowanick, co-president and chief investment officer of Omnivest Group LLC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That may be so, but regulators are unlikely to give up without a fight, said Lawrence White, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business and a former bank regulator.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It is going to be a huge issue," White said, "given all of the history.".&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan; editing by John Wallace)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Fitch Ratings has downgraded, removed from Rating Watch Negative, and assigned
Rating Outlooks and Loss Severity (LS) ratings to 12 classes of commercial
mortgage pass-through certificates from J.P. Morgan Chase Commercial Mortgage
Securities Corp., series 2006-LDP7. A detailed list of rating actions follows at
the end of this release. 

The downgrades are the result of loss expectations and reflect Fitch's
prospective views regarding commercial real estate market value and cash flow
declines. Fitch foresees potential losses could reach as high as 8.8% for this
transaction should market conditions not recover. Today's rating actions are
based on losses of 5.8%, including 100% of the term losses and 25% of the losses
anticipated to occur at maturity; the 5.8% recognizes all of the losses
anticipated in the next five years. Of the recognized losses, 54.8% were on
loans reviewed in detail. 

Given the significant remaining term to maturity, Fitch's actions today do not
account for the full magnitude of possible maturity losses. The bonds with
Negative Outlooks indicate classes that may be downgraded in the future should
full potential losses be realized. 

Fitch analyzed the transaction and calculated expected losses by assuming cash
flows on each of the properties decline 15% from year-end (YE) 2007 and property
values decline 35% from issuance. These loss estimates were reviewed in more
detail for certain loans representing 64.8% of the pool and, in some cases,
revised based on additional information and/or property characteristics. 

Approximately 11.9% of the mortgages mature within the next five years as
follows: 0% in 2009, 0% in 2010, 5.6% in 2011, 1.3% in 2012, 3.6% in 2013 and
1.4% in 2014. All losses associated with these loans are fully recognized in the
rating actions. 

Fitch identified 60 Loans of Concern (20.1%) within the pool, 22 of which (5.7%)
are specially serviced. Of the specially serviced loans, seven are current. One
of the specially serviced loans (1.48%) is within the transaction's top 15 loans
(43.8%) by unpaid principal balance. 

Four of the loans within the top 15 (43.8%) are expected to default during the
term. The largest contributors to loss are as follows: Bella Terra Retail
(4.9%), One &amp; Two Prudential (5.3%) and Shoreview Corporate Center (1.4%). 

Bella Terra Retail is a 663,923 sf retail center located in Huntington Beach, CA
at the corner of Beach Boulevard and Edinger Avenue. The property underwent a
major redevelopment in 2004 which transformed the property from an indoor mall
to an open-air lifestyle center. As of a March 31, 2006 rent roll, the property
was 92.8% occupied, compared to 93.3% at issuance. As of year-end (YE) 2008 the
reported debt service coverage ratio (DSCR) was 1.36x. Major tenants include
Burlington Coat Factory (19.2% of NRA), Kohl's (12.6% of NRA). There is limited
near-term roll during 2010-2011. The loan was structured with six year interest
only. The sponsors are D. John Miller, Eric Sahn, Lindsay Parton, Dieter Mees
and John Cappetta. The loan was structured as interest only for the first six
years, followed by a 30-year amortization schedule. 

Four Penn Center is a 522,600 sf office building located Philadelphia, PA. Major
tenants include Elsevier Inc (25.6% of the NRA), Post &amp; Schell P.C. (15.4%) and
Federal Insurance Co. (11.3%). As of a June 30, 2009 rent roll the property was
92.3% occupied, compared to 92.1% at issuance. The YE 2008 reported DSCR was
1.31x. The sponsor is Strategic Realty Advisors. The loan was structured as
interest-only. 

Shoreview Corporate Center is a 552,9277 sf office portfolio located in five
buildings in Shoreview, MN, approximately 12 miles north of the Minneapolis/St.
Paul CBD. Major tenants include Deluxe Financial Services (40.95 of the NRA),
Land O' Lakes (22% of the NRA) and American Biosystems (18.1% of the NRA). As of
an Aug. 19, 2009 rent roll, the portfolio was approximately 84.2% occupied.
Deluxe Financial has a lease for one of the two properties they occupy (29% of
the NRA) expiring on Sept. 30, 2009 that they are not renewing. The sponsors are
Richard D. Gee and Maxwell B. Drever. The loan was structured with four years
interest only, followed by a 30-year amortization schedule.

"There is no shortage of health information available to providers and

more adept at capturing and storing health data, we need to focus on the
application and sharing of this information to improve the quality, safety, and
efficacy of patient care. Not only could we improve the health of individual
patients, we could also contribute to clinical research and basic scientific
discovery."

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is buying technology from four of its partners in order to bolster its Dynamics AX ERP (enterprise resource planning) product with commonly needed functions across various industries, according to a senior company executive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sells ERP products across five industries, and three of those categories, manufacturing, retail and professional services, will benefit from the purchase, said Crispin Read, general manager for Dynamics ERP.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hadn't provided sufficient industry capability," Read said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is buying additional functionality for manufacturing from Fullscope, a company that specializes in customizing Microsoft's Dynamics AX product, which is aimed at the upper midmarket, Read said. The technology will add a capability for manufacturing processes that don't deal with discrete components, such as formulas for food and chemical products, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The technology for retail comes from two companies, LSRetail and To-Increase Denmark. It will add new features for retailers, but not functions tailored for a certain type of retailer, such as restaurant or fashion house, Read said. Some of those features cover store management, point-of-sale and merchandising.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last bit of software for professional services comes from Computer Generated Solutions. It is a system for managing resources, executing financial transactions and billing customers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Read said the new functions for manufacturing and professional services will be made available immediately in Dynamics AX, a product designed for companies in the 1,000-employee range with hundreds of ERP users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft plans to publish a road map for when it will incorporate the new functions into the retail version, Read said, although that integration should take less than a year. The price for Dynamics AX should not change, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sells its Dynamics product to its partners, who then sell it to end users and customize it for their market, Read said.&lt;/p&gt;

qu`un hymne, la diffusion mondiale d`annonces t&#233;l&#233;vis&#233;es, un programme en ligne,
des emballages comm&#233;moratifs et la Tourn&#233;e du Troph&#233;e de la Coupe du Monde FIFA
World Cup organis&#233;e par Coca-Cola dans 86 pays. 

Muhtar Kent, le pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral de Coca-Cola, a d&#233;clar&#233; : &#171; On
constate un nombre sans pr&#233;c&#233;dent de passionn&#233;s de football dans le monde, et
ceci repr&#233;sente pour nous la meilleure plateforme pour communiquer avec ces
supporters, partout o&#249; nous sommes pr&#233;sents. Nos programmes de promotion de la
Coupe du Monde FIFA World Cup 2010, comme la Tourn&#233;e du Troph&#233;e, visent &#224; offrir
l`opportunit&#233; &#224; ces supporters, de quelque r&#233;gion qu`ils soient, de prendre part
au d&#233;lire li&#233; &#224; cet &#233;v&#233;nement. Comme tous les authentiques amateurs de football,
Coca-Cola est particuli&#232;rement enthousiaste &#224; l`id&#233;e que la Coupe du Monde FIFA
World Cup 2010 se dispute sur le continent africain. &#187; 

La campagne d&#233;butera par la Tourn&#233;e du Troph&#233;e de la Coupe du Monde FIFA World
Cup organis&#233;e par Coca-Cola, au cours de laquelle le Troph&#233;e parcourra 86 pays,
y compris l`ensemble des nations africaines. La c&#233;r&#233;monie de lancement de la
tourn&#233;e a eu lieu aujourd`hui ; le pr&#233;sident de la FIFA, Joseph S. Blatter et M.
Muhtar Kent ont donn&#233; le d&#233;part du voyage du troph&#233;e autour du monde. Ce dernier
quittera donc Zurich plus tard dans la semaine &#224; bord d`un avion &#224; destination
du Caire, en &#201;gypte. 

M. Blatter, le pr&#233;sident de la FIFA, a d&#233;clar&#233; : &#171; La renomm&#233;e internationale et
l`expertise en mati&#232;re de marketing de notre partenaire Coca-Cola sont un atout
consid&#233;rable pour consolider l`image et transmettre la fi&#232;vre et la passion du
football &#224; un plus vaste public dans le monde entier. Cette campagne allie
l`esprit propre au continent africain et les c&#233;l&#233;brations que le football
inspire &#187; 

Joe Tripodi, le directeur commercial et directeur du marketing de la soci&#233;t&#233;
Coca-Cola, a ajout&#233; : &#171; Le football, surtout pendant la Coupe du Monde FIFA
World Cup, est l`occasion pour chacun de &#171; l&#226;cher les r&#234;nes &#187; et d`exprimer sa
passion de mani&#232;re spontan&#233;e. C`est d`autant plus vrai pour le football
africain, qui suscite souvent un enthousiasme immod&#233;r&#233; pour les d&#233;monstrations
les plus exub&#233;rantes et les plus hautes en couleur, &#224; la fois sur le terrain et
hors du terrain. C`est ce qui nous a inspir&#233; pour l`ensemble de la campagne. &#187; 

Dans les mois pr&#233;c&#233;dant la Coupe du Monde FIFA World Cup, une s&#233;rie de
programmes seront mis en &#339;uvre afin d`amener les supporters &#224; &#234;tre plus pr&#232;s du
terrain. L`un des points forts sera un film publicitaire diffus&#233; mondialement
dans lequel appara&#238;tra Roger Milla, le l&#233;gendaire footballeur de l`&#233;quipe du
Cameroun rendu c&#233;l&#232;bre par sa danse de c&#233;l&#233;bration embl&#233;matique lors de la Coupe
du Monde FIFA World Cup 1990, en Italie. Des millions de personnes dans le monde
ont conserv&#233; le souvenir de la danse fr&#233;n&#233;tique de Milla apr&#232;s avoir marqu&#233; un
but, la premi&#232;re du genre. Milla &#233;tait &#233;galement pr&#233;sent &#224; Zurich pour pr&#233;senter
le nouveau spot publicitaire. 

La campagne comprendra les &#233;l&#233;ments suivants : 

La Tourn&#233;e du Troph&#233;e de la Coupe du Monde FIFA World Cup, organis&#233;e par
Coca-Cola

La plus grande r&#233;compense du football mondial va bient&#244;t entamer son plus long
p&#233;riple international &#224; l`occasion de la Tourn&#233;e du Troph&#233;e de la Coupe du Monde
FIFA World Cup organis&#233;e par Coca Cola. Dans tous les pays couverts par cet
itin&#233;raire, des billets gratuits pour la Tourn&#233;e du Troph&#233;e seront offerts aux
consommateurs dans le cadre de la campagne publicitaire de Coca-Cola. Lors
d`&#233;v&#233;nements organis&#233;s dans chaque ville, les supporters pourront se faire
photographier avec le troph&#233;e, visionner un film en 3D des moments inoubliables
de la Coupe du Monde FIFA World Cup, participer &#224; des affichages interactifs, et
autres divertissements. Des courts-m&#233;trages portant sur l`&#233;tape africaine de la
tourn&#233;e seront cr&#233;&#233;s par une &#233;quipe de tournage sous la direction du fameux
r&#233;alisateur Jeremy Gilley, connu notamment pour son film Peace One Day.

durant la Coupe du Monde FIFA World Cup 2010, Coca-Cola fera un don
suppl&#233;mentaire dans le cadre de son initiative &#171; Water for Schools &#187; (de l`eau
pour les &#233;coles) visant &#224; alimenter des &#233;coles en eau potable. Seules seront
qualifi&#233;es les danses de c&#233;l&#233;bration qui respecteront le r&#232;glement du jeu. 

La plus longue danse de c&#233;l&#233;bration du monde

Coca-Cola invite les supporters &#224; filmer et &#224; exporter sur son site Web leurs

Publicit&#233;

Coca-Cola a cr&#233;&#233; trois spots publicitaires dans le cadre de la campagne : le

devenu une source d`inspiration pour les footballeurs qui c&#233;l&#232;brent leurs buts &#171;
&#224; l`africaine &#187; ; le deuxi&#232;me, &#171; Quest &#187;, est un film d`animation contant
l`aventure d`un jeune footballeur en qu&#234;te de la danse de c&#233;l&#233;bration id&#233;ale ;
le troisi&#232;me, &#171; Borders &#187;, montre les incidents cocasses survenant parfois
pendant le tour du monde du troph&#233;e de la Coupe du Monde FIFA World Cup.

2010. Ce morceau servira de g&#233;n&#233;rique tout au long de la campagne et des
&#233;v&#233;nements organis&#233;s par Coca-Cola dans le cadre de la Tourn&#233;e du Troph&#233;e de la

&lt;p&gt;Working with Microsoft, Phonevalley Will Develop Customized Mobile Solutions for
the World`s Largest Brands
PARIS--(Business Wire)--
Regulatory News: 

Publicis Groupe`s Phonevalley (Paris:PUB), the world`s leading mobile marketing
agency and part of the VivaKi Nerve Center, announced today a strategic
agreement to create customized mobile advertising solutions, technology and
metrics that will run across Microsoft`s mobile web properties, including the
Microsoft Media Network, Bing and MSN. The packaged solutions will be available
in 14 markets worldwide, including the U.S., the UK, France, Italy, Spain and
Germany. 

This alliance strenghtens the relationship between Microsoft Advertising and
VivaKi. It furthermore reinforces the VivaKi strategy to build a market leader
in digital communications, in an increasingly mobile world. 

Phonevalley and Microsoft Mobile Advertising will work together to design
innovative packaged mobile advertising solutions for six industry verticals:
luxury, retail, entertainment, automotive, travel and financial services. For
example, for an automotive manufacturer the package could include a customized
mobile internet site, which would display specific product lines and new cars.
The customized site would encourage consumers to visit car dealers through a
`test drive` booking tool and a dealer locator function on the site. To
efficiently drive the most qualified audience, the package would take advantage
of the innovative ad formats and new targeted mobile media features such as
behavioural targeting developed by Microsoft Advertising. 

Additionally, by utilizing data from dedicated vertical research and post test
results, advertisers can further improve the efficiency and efficacy of their
campaigns to better engage with their target mobile audiences. 

Alexandre Mars, Phonevalley CEO and Publicis Groupe Head of Mobile, said: "Our
mobile alliance strengthens the relationships between Microsoft Advertising and
Phonevalley`s parent company, Publicis Groupe. It further reinforces VivaKi`s
strategy to build a market leader in digital communications, in an increasingly
mobile world." 

Charles Johnson, General Manager at Microsoft Mobile Advertising said: "As
mobile advertising becomes more of a mainstream digital advertising medium, our
collaborative work will help advertisers plan, execute and measure their mobile
campaigns more effectively and ultimately, will enable them to harness the
untapped potential of mobile advertising."

&lt;p&gt;100 Best Continue to Improve while Nationwide Standards Sag 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Defying expectations in this time of economic stress, The Goldman Sachs Group,
Inc (Ticker: GS) has been named among the 2009 Working Mother 100 Best Companies
for its unwavering dedication to family-friendly benefits. Goldman Sachs and the
other winning companies lead the way in pioneering programs that support
families, with 100 percent offering flextime, on-site lactation and
telecommuting; and 98 percent offering job-sharing and wellness programs-numbers
that dwarf those seen nationwide. In addition, financial programs available to
the 100 Best employees are on the rise, a much needed boost for families in
today`s economy. These include tuition reimbursement, retirement planning and
pre-tax FSAs for childcare. 

By contrast, national numbers&#176; are dismal, with just 25 percent of companies
offering on-site lactation (vs. 100 percent of the 100 Best), 11 percent with
stress reduction programs (vs. 96 percent of the 100 Best), 35 percent offering
health insurance for part-timers (vs. 99 percent of the 100 Best) and 16 percent
offering job-sharing (vs. 98 percent of the 100 Best). 

"The Working Mother 100 Best Companies stand head and shoulders above the rest,"
said Carol Evans, CEO, Working Mother Media. "For example, in the last year, we
saw the number of companies nationwide offering flexible work arrangements
diminish five percentage points, while the 100 Best Companies stayed steady at
100 percent. The 100 Best provide leadership where and when we need it most,
furnishing a framework of support for working families during good times and
bad. If all companies adopted these best practices, more families could weather
the economic storm." 

Profiles of the 100 Best Companies, as well as national comparisons, are in the
October issue of Working Mother and at workingmother.com. 

"Moms are increasingly becoming the sole breadwinners in many households as men
lose their jobs at a higher rate than women," said Suzanne Riss, Editor in
Chief, Working Mother magazine. "Now more than ever, our readers and all working
mothers need the support of their employers. By offering benefits like paid
maternity leave, the ability to work from home and wellness programs, as well as
programs that enhance financial well-being, our 100 Best are helping to reduce
stress in the busy lives of working moms. These companies epitomize
family-friendly support at its best." 

Even in tough economic times, the Working Mother 100 Best Companies employ
creative programs that adeptly help employees in all areas of their lives. In
2007, Goldman Sachs developed the idea of a program that could assist women in
their desire to return to the workforce. This lead to the launch in 2008 of a
program called ReturnshipSM, an initiative that came out of the firm`s New
Directions on-ramping program. This eight-week internship like program was
designed for women who were looking to re-enter the workforce after off-ramping
an extended period of time. Despite the down economy, Goldman Sachs was able to
hire 50% of the participants for positions in various divisions of the firm. 

Now in its 24th year, the Working Mother 100 Best Companies program draws
attention to the significant contributions working mothers make to industries
and the companies that recognize the importance of tapping this essential labor
pool. "We have faith that some day the programs found at the 100 Best Companies
will become business norms offered by all companies," said Evans. "When the
economy recovers, lagging companies will lose out on a powerful group of
dedicated employees-working moms." 

Methodology:

Companies were selected for the 2009 Working Mother 100 Best Companies based on
an extensive application with more than 500 questions on workforce,
compensation, child care, flexibility programs, leave policies and more. It also
surveys the usage, availability and tracking of programs, as well as the
accountability of managers who oversee them. Seven areas were measured and
scored: workforce profile, benefits, women`s issues and advancement, child care,
flexible work, parental leave and company culture. For this year`s 100 Best,
particular weight was given to benefits, flexibility and parental leave.

mid-December and due by early March 2010. All companies that apply, including
those that don`t make the 100 Best list, receive feedback showing how they
compare with all other applicants.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase raised approximately $90 billion in financing for local
governments and nonprofit organizations throughout the country in the past nine
months, the company announced today. 

Across the nation, the bank has provided $90 billion to non-profit and
healthcare companies, universities and state and local government, helping to
build bridges and parks, improve social services, train young people for jobs,
expand hospitals and fund medical research. 

"From the time our country faced its toughest moments in the financial crisis,
we have been dedicated to local governments and the organizations at the heart
of our communities that Americans have come to depend on," said Todd Maclin,
Chase Commercial Bank CEO. "We have always been committed to the communities
that we serve, but funding for these organizations is more crucial now than ever
before." 

JPMorgan Chase`s safe and sound lending helped to keep communities moving
forward during the recent market turmoil and helped the nation grow through
support in the following sectors:

* $62 billion for state and local governments; 
* $11 billion for healthcare organizations; 
* $15 billion for education organizations; and 
* $1.6 billion for other non-profits groups.

JPMorgan Chase`s funding came at a critical time as auction-rate securities and
the fixed-rate loan markets shut down, creating severe challenges for many
nonprofits and local governments. The company`s strong capital position allowed
it to step in and help these organizations. In the last nine months, the bank
raised nearly $90 billion for these types of institutions through traditional
loans, credit facilities and bond and capital market underwritings. 

Support for these organizations came to all corners of the country. One example
is the line of credit JPMorgan Chase provided to the Woodall Rodgers Park
Foundation in Dallas to create a 5.2-acre deck park that will connect three
areas that are currently segmented -- Uptown, Downtown and the Arts District --
using sustainable design principles. 

"Chase has a good reputation in the community for working effectively with a
wide variety of not-for-profit groups on several innovative projects," said
Linda Owen, president of the Woodall Rodgers Park Foundation. She further
explained why the Foundation turned to Chase for the critical financing it
needed during the park`s design phase: "Chase bent over backwards to help us get
the credit we needed so we could stay on track with our development timeline.
They were extremely responsive and did all the necessary due diligence to close
the loan within 30 days." 

JPMorgan Chase also helped Virtua Health Inc., a regional non-profit healthcare
network in southern New Jersey. The bank helped Virtua finance the construction
of the Voorhees replacement hospital, a state-of-the-art medical center that
will enhance the healthcare system`s ability to meet the needs of the community.


"By assisting with the development of a strategic plan and being part of our
successful bond financing, JPMorgan Chase provided a positive impact and a
significant benefit for the community," said Bob Osler, Treasury Director of
Virtua.

&lt;p&gt;FRANKFURT, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Germany's HSH Nordbank
[HSH.UL] defended millions of dollars in transfers to Goldman
Sachs (GS.N) made last year as the financial crisis raged, but
said it had asked its auditors to check the deals to create
clarity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The payments in question were disputed and should have been
subject of a legal review, HSH said in a statement on Tuesday,
but added it had decided to go ahead with them anyway last
November to avoid any impression it was having trouble.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "In a market environment marked by concerns that banks other
than Lehman would be unable to meet their payment obligations,
we had to nip in the bud any expected market rumours over HSH
Nordbank's performance," it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The bank authorised the payments with the goal of
preventing much greater material and immaterial damage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chief Executive Dirk Jens Nonnemacher said he had asked
HSH's auditors KPMG to take a close look at the transfers and
the decisions that led up to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regional broadcaster NDR had first reported the $45 million
transfers as part of a credit default swap that Goldman Sachs
had lined up to protect itself against any Lehman Brothers
default.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NDR said HSH did not have to make the payments because
Goldman Sachs had missed a deadline to demand the money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; This triggered a political storm and calls by local
politicians for prosecutors to investigate. Hamburg prosecutors
said they were still gathering information about the case.

&lt;p&gt;New Simple API for Cloud Application Services Facilitates Development of Cloud
Applications That Can Access Services on All Major Cloud Platforms


CUPERTINO, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Zend Technologies, the PHP Company, today launched the Simple API for Cloud
Application Services project, a new open source initiative that allows
developers to use common application services in the cloud, while enabling them
to unlock value-added features available from individual providers. The project
aims to facilitate the development of cloud applications that can access
services on all major cloud platforms. Zend, IBM, Microsoft, Nirvanix, Rackspace
and GoGrid are co-founding contributors to this community project. 

The Simple Cloud API project empowers developers to use one interface to
interact with a variety of cloud application services, enabling them to more
easily access new technologies from cloud vendors. The first deliverables will
include interfaces for file storage, document database, and simple queue
services from platforms like Amazon Web Services, Windows Azure, Nirvanix
Storage Delivery Network and Rackspace Cloud Files. As a result, developers can
deploy software applications to access services in these environments without
making time consuming and expensive changes to their source code. 

"Cloud computing offers irresistible value to enterprises of all sizes, but the
lack of portability across cloud application services for even the most basic
operations has been an impediment to broader adoption of cloud services," said
Andi Gutmans, CEO at Zend Technologies. 

"The Simple Cloud API combines the benefits of open source community processes
with the active participation of the cloud vendors themselves," continued
Gutmans. "With early participation and support from industry leaders and the
Zend Framework community, we anticipate that this important project will
continue to grow, serving a wide range of application developers and businesses
building modern Web applications for the cloud." 

The Simple Cloud API project is designed to encourage widespread participation
and contributions from the open source community, resulting in the availability
of Simple Cloud API adapters for virtually all major cloud providers. 

Although led by Zend, the largest corporate contributor to the PHP programming
language, the Simple Cloud API can be translated to any object-oriented language
for the Web. The PHP implementation will be available in the widely adopted open
source Zend Framework project as a new component, called "Zend Cloud." PHP
developers can take advantage of this new component to utilize existing client
libraries available in Zend Framework in a uniform way. 

Zend Cloud adapters will be available for services such as:

* File storage services, including Windows Azure blobs, Rackspace Cloud Files,
Nirvanix Storage Delivery Network and Amazon S3 
* Document Storage services, including Windows Azure tables and Amazon SimpleDB 
* Simple queue services, including Amazon SQS and Windows Azure queues

Zend Cloud will also provide adapters for local services to make offline coding
and testing against cloud services as easy as connected development. 

Other adapters, such as those for Rackspace Cloud Files API, will work with
external libraries with no changes to application code. Microsoft is also
contributing Simple Cloud API adapters, along with the official PHP client
libraries for Windows Azure storage, to future versions of Zend Framework. These
adapters will allow applications to take advantage of many Windows Azure
features through the Simple Cloud API interface, while Microsoft`s client
libraries will put Windows Azure innovations, such as transaction and partial
upload support, at the fingertips of cloud application developers. 

Dr. Kristof Kloeckner, CTO of IBM Cloud Computing, recognizes this effort as a
significant step towards a more open and interoperable cloud. "The Simple Cloud
API will enable developers to invoke cloud services in a common way across cloud
providers. This can significantly reduce the costs for application development
and provide customer choice. To that end, IBM will be contributing adapters for
IBM`s cloud service interfaces, as well as adapters to IBM's data storage
products, allowing developers to easily switch between public clouds, private
clouds and traditional data center environments." 

"Microsoft is pleased to continue to work with Zend and join efforts with other
contributors to this project," said Doug Hauger, General Manager, Microsoft
Windows Azure. "The Simple Cloud API is an example of Microsoft`s continued
investment in the openness and interoperability of its platform. We`re excited
to see how this project will foster adoption of cloud computing platforms by PHP
developers and hope that many of these developers are encouraged to use Windows
Azure." 

Lew Moorman, Chief Strategy Officer and President of the Rackspace Cloud, added,
"We`re proud to be part of any initiative that delivers more value to developers
in the cloud. Our contributions to the Simple Cloud API are part of our ongoing
effort to bring the unique value of open source software to the cloud. Many of
our customers use PHP as their Web application language of choice, and we
believe that these developers should be able to choose which cloud services are
the best fit for them through interfaces that they can help define." 

An initial Simple Cloud API proposal and reference implementation is available
now for community review and participation at http://www.simplecloud.org.
Developers can also evaluate the Simple API for Cloud Application Services by
deploying their applications that use it on the Amazon cloud using the freely
available Zend Server Community Edition Amazon Machine Image (AMI) for EC2. Zend
Technologies also offers a Zend Server AMI that is commercially supported. A
technology preview of the PHP client libraries for Windows Azure can be viewed
and downloaded from: http://framework.zend.com/Zend_Service_WindowsAzure

&lt;p&gt;Strategy Drives Improvement in Customers` Understanding of Their Health Benefits


ARMONK, N.Y. &amp; BLOOMFIELD, Conn.--(Business Wire)--
CIGNA (NYSE:CI) today announced the initial results of its multi-year strategy
that places an entirely new focus on improving customers` experience. The effort
has led to an improvement in customer understanding of their benefits in excess
of 100 percent, a 50 percent reduction in the number of printed materials
customers receive, and the use of simpler language that doesn`t rely on
insurance jargon. It also led CIGNA to become the first in its industry to offer
24 hour-a-day, seven day-a-week customer service. 

Tapping the expertise of IBM Global Business Services (NYSE:IBM) as an advisor,
CIGNA has driven its new customer focus throughout a 27,000-employee
organization, retraining employees on how to deliver consistent, quality service
to its customers. The company started by creating a Customer Experience Office -
a first in the health service industry -- to serve as the voice of the customer
and spearhead a cultural change. Working with IBM, CIGNA`s Customer Experience
Office identified and prioritized specific areas for improvement, focusing on
eliminating pain points for customers and addressing issues that had the most
relevance to customers. 

"At the heart of our effort is our own acknowledgement that we need to do more
to remove complexity and confusion and be easier to understand, whether on the
phone, through our enrollment communications or by examining the language we use
to explain our products and services," said Ingrid Lindberg, CIGNA Customer
Experience Officer. "This is an ongoing effort, and our company has embraced
this vision that puts customers at the center of efforts to improve health,
well-being and sense of security. These efforts are having an impact." 

In addition, CIGNA began to tap customer information to make interactions with
the company more personalized. For example, when a customer calls in with a
question about a dental claim, CIGNA employees can note that they also receive
pharmacy benefits and offer to provide help in refilling a prescription while
they are on the line. By working more closely with customers, CIGNA
representatives are now able to help identify gaps in care and work with their
doctors and care managers to help ensure patients are taking the right
medication and getting the follow up they need either from a primary care doctor
or a specialist. 

CIGNA`s new strategy extended to every facet of its interactions with its health
care customers. The company started by simplifying the way material is written,
reducing the amount customers receive and bringing clarity to how CIGNA
employees speak with customers by explaining complicated benefits, policies and
legal clauses in simplified terms. It also simplified its explanation of
benefits to make the information more clear and understandable and will begin
use of the redesigned explanation of benefits this fall. 

"CIGNA recognizes and embraces the importance of the individual customer and
their experience and this has led to a profound change in how CIGNA has modeled
its business," said Steve LaValle, Partner, IBM Global Business Services. "For
example, CIGNA also developed new technology that provides a 360-degree view of
the customer allowing CIGNA`s customer experience associates rapid access to the
same consistent information to address customer needs." 

The company also worked closely with IBM Global Business Services to transform
how data is captured, stored, analyzed and used for the benefit of customers.
This includes using IBM FileNet enterprise content management software to
capture, store and retrieve CIGNA communications with customers such as forms,
letters and e-mails to provide rapid access to same information customers see
while addressing customer needs - something most customers might expect but few
organizations can actually do. 

A new IBM whitepaper: Don`t yield on customer trust: Navigating the customer
experience journey on the rough road ahead, describes how CIGNA worked with IBM
Global Business Services to develop its comprehensive customer focused strategy,
the results of its efforts to date and lessons learned for other organizations
also striving to be customer focused.

&lt;p&gt;  WATERTOWN, MA, Sep 22 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Sanbolic's AppCluster advanced clustering software for Microsoft SQL
Server is now generally available. AppCluster is installed together with
Sanbolic's Melio clustered file system and LaScala clustered volume
manager, and allows users to deploy large, flexible active-active
clusters of SQL Server. AppCluster utilizes Melio file system's ability
to provide concurrent shared access to a SAN storage volume from multiple
database servers, and removes the limitations introduced by Windows
Failover Clusters when using SQL Server in a SAN. LaScala enables high
performance volumes that span multiple storage LUNs, and supports dynamic
volume expansion. Mirroring will be available in Q4. Sanbolic's software
can be used with any industry standard SAN hardware. Customers can
download the evaluation software at www.sanbolic.com.

    AppCluster allows users to easily deploy high performance SQL clusters on
physical or virtual servers, and allows databases to be quickly migrated
between SAN instances for load balancing or failover. AppCluster is a .Net
service that works in conjunction with SQL Management Studio. Because
AppCluster utilizes Melio clustered file system to provide active-active
access to a shared SAN volume, much of the complexity and dependencies of
clustering is eliminated.

    AppCluster has the ability to automatically balance SQL databases across
the cluster, and can provision based on server weight. It integrates with
Melio FS Quality of Service, so essential databases can be given priority
access to storage bandwidth to optimize performance.

    AppCluster can be installed using any industry standard servers or virtual
instances running SQL together with any industry standard SAN storage.

&lt;p&gt;Globale Marketingkampagne im Rahmen des Sponsorings der
FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft 2010 in S&#252;dafrika bei Pressekonferenz in Z&#252;rich
vorgestellt
Z&#220;RICH--(Business Wire)--
Die Coca-Cola Company hat heute Bestandteile einer weltweiten Marketingkampagne
vorgestellt, die von den fr&#246;hlichen Tanzfeierlichkeiten inspiriert wurden, wie
sie aus Afrika, dem gastgebenden Kontinent der FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft
2010, bekannt sind. Die als Unterst&#252;tzung des Sponsorings dieser historischen
Sportveranstaltung entwickelte Kampagne ist eine Erg&#228;nzung der aktuellen
Markenplattform &#8222;Open Happiness" von Coca-Cola. 

Die Kampagne, die im Rahmen einer globalen Pressekonferenz im Beisein des
Vorstandsvorsitzenden und CEO von Coca-Cola, Muhtar Kent, und des
FIFA-Pr&#228;sidenten Joseph S. Blatter am Hauptsitz der F&#233;d&#233;ration Internationale de
Football Association (FIFA) vorgestellt wurde, ermutigt die Fans, ihren
Optimismus und ihre Leidenschaft f&#252;r den Fu&#223;ball durch aktive t&#228;nzerische Feiern
auszudr&#252;cken. 

Zu den Schl&#252;sselelementen der Coca-Cola-Kampagne geh&#246;ren erstmalig eine Ehrung
f&#252;r den besten Torjubel durch einen Spieler w&#228;hrend des Turniers, eine
musikalische Hymne, globale Fernsehwerbung, ein Online-Programm,
Gedenkverpackung und die sich &#252;ber 86 L&#228;nder erstreckende Trophy Tour von
Coca-Cola zur FIFA-Weltmeisterschaft. 

&#8222;Die weltweite Leidenschaft f&#252;r den Fu&#223;ballsport ist einzigartig und gibt
unserem Unternehmen die bestm&#246;gliche Plattform, die Fans &#252;berall dort, wo
Coca-Cola Gesch&#228;fte betreibt, zu erreichen", sagte Muhtar Kent,
Vorstandsvorsitzender und Chief Executive Officer der Coca-Cola Company. &#8222;Unsere
Aktionen zur F&#246;rderung der FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft 2010, wie die Trophy
Tour, tragen dazu bei, dass die Fans die M&#246;glichkeit haben, die Aufregung und
das Spektakel um den Fu&#223;ball mitzuerleben, egal wo sie leben. Und wie alle
Fu&#223;ballfans freut sich Coca-Cola ganz besonders dar&#252;ber, dass die
FIFA-Weltmeisterschaft 2010 erstmals auf dem afrikanischen Kontinent
stattfindet." 

Die Kampagne startet mit der FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour von Coca-Cola, die sich
&#252;ber 86 L&#228;nder, darunter jede Nation in Afrika, erstrecken wird. Die
Feierlichkeiten zum Start der Tour wurden heute abgehalten, als Pr&#228;sident
Blatter und Kent den WM-Pokal auf seine weltumrundende Reise schickten. Der
Pokal der FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft wird noch diese Woche von Z&#252;rich aus zu
seinem ersten Halt in Kairo in &#196;gypten geflogen. 

&#8222;Die internationale Reichweite und die Marketingkompetenz unseres Partners
Coca-Cola tragen enorm zur St&#228;rkung des Spiels bei und helfen uns dabei, den
Menschen &#252;berall auf der Welt die Aufregung und die Leidenschaft unseres Sports
n&#228;herzubringen", sagte FIFA-Pr&#228;sident Joseph S. Blatter. &#8222;Diese Kampagne greift
sowohl den einzigartigen Geist des afrikanischen Kontinents als auch die Feiern,
zu denen der Fu&#223;ball inspiriert, auf." 

&#8222;Der Fu&#223;ball kann, insbesondere w&#228;hrend der FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft, die
Menschen motivieren, ein wenig &#8218;loszulassen` und ihre Leidenschaft spontan
auszudr&#252;cken", sagte Joe Tripodi, Chief Marketing und Commercial Leadership
Officer der Coca-Cola Company. &#8222;Dies gilt insbesondere f&#252;r den afrikanischen
Fu&#223;ball, wo h&#228;ufig auf dem Spielfeld und an dessen Rand starke und
&#252;bersch&#228;umende Leidenschaft gezeigt wird. Dies ist die Inspiration f&#252;r unsere
ganze Kampagne." 

In den Monaten bis zur FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft wird eine Reihe von
Aktionen durchgef&#252;hrt, welche die Fans n&#228;her an das Erlebnis
FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft heranf&#252;hren werden. Zu den H&#246;hepunkten geh&#246;rt ein
weltweit ausgestrahlter TV-Werbespot mit Roger Milla - dem legend&#228;ren Fu&#223;baller
aus Kamerun, der f&#252;r seinen denkw&#252;rdigen Jubeltanz w&#228;hrend der
FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft 1990 in Italien ber&#252;hmt ist. Millionen aus aller
Welt erinnern sich an Millas Torjubel, der erstmals auch einen fr&#246;hlichen Tanz
beinhaltete. Milla war in Z&#252;rich dabei, um den neuen Werbespot vorzustellen. 

Zu den Bestandteilen der Kampagne geh&#246;ren: 

Die FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour von Coca-Cola

Der gr&#246;&#223;te Preis des Weltfu&#223;balls steht kurz davor, als Teil der FIFA World Cup
Trophy Tour von Coca-Cola seine gr&#246;&#223;te Weltreise aller Zeiten anzutreten.
Kostenlose Karten zur Trophy Tour werden den Verbrauchern &#252;ber Promotionen von
Coca-Cola in den L&#228;ndern auf der Tourstrecke angeboten. Bei den Veranstaltungen
in den einzelnen St&#228;dten k&#246;nnen die Fans dann ein Erinnerungsfoto von sich mit
dem WM-Pokal machen lassen, einen 3-D-Film mit R&#252;ckblicken auf die
FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaften sehen, an interaktiven Vorf&#252;hrungen teilnehmen
und sich anderer Unterhaltungsprogramme erfreuen. Kurzfilme &#252;ber die
afrikanische Etappe der Tour werden von einem Filmteam unter der Leitung des
renommierten Filmemachers Jeremy Gilley von Peace One Day erstellt. 

Coca-Cola Celebration Award

Erstmals wird Coca-Cola den besten Torjubel ehren. Fans werden die M&#246;glichkeit
haben, online &#252;ber den Gewinner abzustimmen. F&#252;r jedes im Verlauf der
FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft 2010 geschossene und mit einem Tanz gefeierte Tor
wird Coca-Cola eine zus&#228;tzliche Spende an die Aktion &#8222;Water for Schools" des
Unternehmens leisten, durch die Schulen der Zugang zu sicherem Trinkwasser
erleichtert wird. Der Preis wird nur solchen Jubel anerkennen, der im Rahmen der
Spielregeln erfolgt. 

Die l&#228;ngste Feier der Welt

Coca-Cola l&#228;dt Fu&#223;ballfans dazu ein, ihren Torjubel zu filmen und auf die
Website von Coca-Cola hochzuladen. Alle Clips werden zu einer &#8218;Dauerschleife`
zusammengeschnitten und ergeben so eine endlose Jubelfeier, die auf der Website
ausgestrahlt wird. Teilnehmende Fans haben dann die Chance, tolle Preise zur
FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft zu gewinnen, darunter auch Eintrittskarten zu
Spielen. 

Werbung

Coca-Cola hat im Rahmen der Kampagne drei Werbespots erstellt - &#8218;Roger Milla`,
in dem die Geschichte erz&#228;hlt wird, wie Roger Milla die Fu&#223;baller dazu
inspiriert hat, Tore auf afrikanische Art zu feiern; &#8218;Quest` (&#8218;Suche`), einen
Animationsfilm &#252;ber die Geschichte eines jungen Fu&#223;ballers auf der Suche nach
seinem perfekten Torjubel; und &#8218;Borders` (&#8218;Grenzen`), einen Film &#252;ber die
lustigen Dinge, die manchmal passieren, wenn sich der Pokal der
FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft auf seiner Reise um die Welt befindet. 

Musikalische Hymne von K`Naan

Der aufstrebende somalische Hip-Hop-K&#252;nstler K`Naan hat extra einen erhebenden,
afrikanisch inspirierten Titel, einen Remix von &#8218;Wavin Flag`, als Hymne f&#252;r die
Aktionen von Coca-Cola zur FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft 2010 aufgenommen. Der
Titel wird das musikalische Element f&#252;r die gesamte Kampagne sein. Dies
beinhaltet unter anderem, dass er der Soundtrack aller TV-Werbespots ist, an den
Veranstaltungen w&#228;hrend der FIFA World Cup Trophy Tour von Coca-Cola gespielt
wird und auf der digitalen Online-Plattform zu h&#246;ren sein wird. 

Die Dokumentation &#8218;Coca-Cola pr&#228;sentiert: Die Torfeier`

Coca-Cola ist dabei, eine 60-min&#252;tige Dokumentation zu produzieren, welche die
Geschichten hinter den weltweit ber&#252;hmtesten Torfeiern recherchiert und Spieler
der FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft 2010 dar&#252;ber befragt, wie sie ihren
afrikanisch inspirierten Jubel w&#228;hrend des Turniers planen. Die Dokumentation
wird im Vorfeld der FIFA-Fu&#223;ballweltmeisterschaft 2010 weltweit ausgestrahlt
werden. 

Gedenkverpackung

&lt;p&gt;International Insurance Firm Deploys FalconStor VTL, Achieving More
Cost-Effective Operations and Fast ROI, Further Validating a Recent Industry
Analyst Survey of FalconStor Customers
MELVILLE, N.Y.--(Business Wire)--
FalconStor Software, Inc. (NASDAQ: FALC), the provider of TOTALLY Open data
protection solutions, today announced that a large international life insurance
company has deployed FalconStor&#174; Virtual Tape Library (VTL) Enterprise Edition
to optimize its backup performance across the company`s open systems, IBM System
i and IBM System z (mainframe) environments. This heterogeneous enterprise-wide
installation demonstrates FalconStor`s leadership in the VTL industry as the
only vendor that can address all systems, from open systems in small to
medium-size businesses to midrange servers and mainframes in large, distributed
enterprises. FalconStor VTL connectivity to IBM System z is enabled by
FalconStor`s longstanding collaboration with Bus-Tech, which plays an important
role in this customer solution. 

The FalconStor VTL solution helped the insurance company bridge the gap between
its mainframe and open systems, reducing IT complexity while controlling
explosive data growth. The solution alleviated backup window and reliability
issues, lowered operation costs and allowed the company to provide superior
continuous service to customers for the highest return on investment (ROI). 

This customer`s experience further validates the results of a recent ROI
customer survey sponsored by FalconStor and conducted by IDC, a leading global
market intelligence and advisory firm. According to the survey, all customers
who participated enjoyed considerable benefits from FalconStor solutions,
including cost reductions, greater system availability and increased staff
productivity.1

Based on IDC`s comprehensive survey metrics, the top three cost reductions that
FalconStor solutions provide to end users result from (1) the ability to
purchase cost-effective disk arrays from any vendor, (2) lower costs associated
with tape and backup drives and (3) reduced new server purchases through
decreased storage needs. According to the IDC ROI analysis, FalconStor
customers:

* Reduced tape drive costs by an average of $162,000 annually 
* Saved an average of $81,000 annually on storage hardware 
* Increased staff productivity equal to one full-time employee 
* Reduced the average number of critical system failures from 17 to 1 annually 
* Achieved 448 percent ROI with a payback period of 5.5 months

"FalconStor differentiates itself in the VTL market by offering a broader data
protection platform including a strategy and product set that expands well
beyond only tape emulation," said Laura DuBois, research director, IDC Storage
Software. "This strategy includes deduplication, encryption and mainframe
connectivity, giving FalconStor VTL wide-ranging market appeal that provides
meaningful ROI in data center environments of all sizes." 

"We built our leadership in the VTL market by creating the most comprehensive,
high-performance solution for the broadest base of customers of any vendor in
the industry. We help enterprises of all sizes address the single most critical
issue in backup: meeting the backup window," said ReiJane Huai, chairman and CEO
of FalconStor Software. "IDC`s ROI study corroborates what we have already
experienced firsthand - that our customers are solving significant data
protection problems, architecting more efficient IT operations and achieving
outstanding ROI with FalconStor solutions." 

The international insurance firm deployed FalconStor VTL throughout its three
distributed data centers. In the IBM System z environment, they installed a
high-availability (HA) pair of FalconStor VTL gateway appliances with a Sun STK
6140 disk array to ensure high-speed disk-based data protection. The IT team
uses the Bus-Tech Mainframe Data Library model 100V, which allows the ESCON
channel to connect with the IBM z and to process mainframe tape data to the
industry-standard FalconStor VTL platform. The FalconStor VTL secure tape
feature exports and encrypts mainframe tapes before shipping offsite for DR and
vaulting. 

"Bus-Tech`s Mainframe Data Library works with FalconStor VTL to provide our
mainframe and distributed systems customers access to the rich feature set and
benefits of FalconStor`s industry-leading virtual tape library solution," said
Ralph Armstrong, vice president of product management for Bus-Tech, Inc.
"Companies in today's economic climate are looking at ways to reduce cost. The
ability to combine mainframe and distributed systems into a single converged
data protection scheme is very attractive to a wide range of data center
managers." 

In the IBM System i environment, the insurance company uses a similar HA
configuration. The IBM i host can directly connect with the FalconStor VTL
system via a Fibre Channel (FC) port. A disk array with high-capacity SATA disks
can emulate an IBM 3590 or 3584 tape drive with the magnetic tape data storage
media formats that are accepted by the IBM i. To accommodate the large volume of
data in the open systems environment, IT deployed two HA pairs of FalconStor VTL
while running Veritas NetBackup to protect Oracle, AWD, Microsoft SQL Server and
Lotus Notes applications on both UNIX and Microsoft Windows Servers. 

The customer experienced significant benefits from implementing the FalconStor
VTL solution. FalconStor VTL combines concurrent processing power with
high-speed FC disk arrays, which enables high throughput. Backup data streams
are no longer limited by the number of tape drives in the tape library and
multiple data streams can be processed simultaneously. This has accelerated the
batch processing of the backup procedures and improved performance in the
mainframe environment by 30 to 40 percent. In the open systems environment,
backup time has been reduced by 50 percent. The HA configuration improves backup
system reliability two-fold and minimizes failure rates, which in turn saves
time and human resources.

distributed systems environments, visit the case study library on the FalconStor

&lt;p&gt;Through a Global Casting Call on Facebook, Coca-Cola Is Asking People to `Open
Happiness` and Share Their Versions of How It Sounds to Enjoy a Coke
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
If it`s been your dream to star in a Coca-Cola ad, the wait may finally be over.
A new commercial, called the `Sounds of Coca-Cola,` will feature real people
demonstrating their personal renditions of the distinct sounds that occur every
time someone opens a Coke and Opens Happiness. 

People may speak different languages, but everyone understands the universal
language of Coca-Cola. It`s the "ahh" sound you make after taking the first sip
on a hot day or the "phsst" sound of the bubbles being released. If you can
mimic those sounds, you may find yourself in a starring role alongside other
Coca-Cola fans from around the world. 

From now through October 15, people can visit the Coca-Cola page on Facebook at
http://CokeURL.com/soundsofcocacola to learn how to take part in the global
casting call for the new commercial. Through a specially designed `Sounds of
Coca-Cola` application on Facebook you can upload personal audition videos
showcasing your own unique interpretation of the `Sounds of Coca-Cola.` 

"When you open a Coca-Cola, you hear the unmistakable sounds that are the
ultimate invitation to `Open Happiness` and enjoy a simple moment of
refreshment," said Katie Bayne, Chief Marketing Officer, Coca-Cola North
America. "We know there`s nothing quite like drinking a Coca-Cola, so if people
share their interpretations of how that sounds, have fun and make us thirsty, we
may put them in a Coca-Cola commercial." 

The Coca-Cola Facebook page, which was created in 2008 by two of the brand`s
most ardent supporters, Dusty and Michael, now has nearly 3.7 million fans
representing countries on six continents and is one of the most popular brand
pages on the global website. To tap into this digital gathering of Coca-Cola
lovers from around the globe, the innovative worldwide casting call for "Sounds
of Coca-Cola" is being conducted exclusively through Facebook. 

For pointers on producing an eye-catching "Sounds of Coca-Cola" submission,
aspiring commercial stars can check out a video in which Dusty and Michael
reveal their impressions of what it`s like to enjoy the world`s most refreshing
beverage. To participate in the casting call, you simply need to create an
individual video, one minute in length, in which you impersonate the following
sounds:

* Opening a bottle or can or Coca-Cola 
* Ice cubes clinking as they drop into a glass 
* Pouring a Coca-Cola over ice 
* The fizzing of the Coke as it bubbles after being poured 
* The first drink of Coca-Cola 
* That "ahh" moment of refreshment

All submitted videos will be reviewed and those which demonstrate the best
quality sound effects, exhibit noticeable on-camera presence and personify the
Coca-Cola brand will be considered for casting in the production of the
commercial, which will debut in 2010. 

The global Coca-Cola "Open Happiness" campaign, which debuted in January 2009,
invites people to share a little happiness and enjoy life`s simple pleasures.
The campaign is airing in markets around the world, Recently, "Heist," an
animated ad in which ladybugs, grasshoppers and other insects join forces to rob
a bottle of Coca-Cola from a slumbering picnicker, won the 2009 Emmy for
Outstanding Commercial at the Academy of Television Arts and Sciences' Creative
Arts Awards.

&lt;p&gt;100 Best in 2009 Continue to Improve while Nationwide Standards Sag


NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc has been named among the 2009 Working Mother 100 Best Companies for
its steadfast commitment to family-friendly benefits. Pfizer and the other
winning companies are pioneering programs that support families, with 100
percent offering flextime, on-site lactation and telecommuting; and 98 percent
offering job-sharing and wellness programs-numbers that dwarf those seen
nationwide. In addition, financial programs available to the 100 Best employees
are on the rise, a much needed boost for families in today`s economy. These
include tuition reimbursement, retirement planning and pre-tax FSAs for
childcare. 

By contrast, national numbers1 are dismal, with just 25 percent of companies
offering on-site lactation (vs. 100 percent of the 100 Best), 11 percent with
stress reduction programs (vs. 96 percent of the 100 Best), 35 percent offering
health insurance for part-timers (vs. 99 percent of the 100 Best) and 16 percent
offering job-sharing (vs. 98 percent of the 100 Best). 

Even in tough economic times, the Working Mother 100 Best Companies employ
creative programs that adeptly help employees in all areas of their lives.
Pfizer offers benefits, programs and resources such as flexible-work
arrangements, tuition reimbursement, adoption assistance, scholarships for
children of employees, backup childcare, health improvement, mentoring, career
management, and manager and leadership training - all of which allow employees
to stay healthy, fulfilled, balanced, informed and innovative. 

"It`s simple. As a company committed to better care for all of the world`s
people, we`re convinced that good caregivers make good employees, and we`re
further convinced that helping colleagues balance work and family
responsibilities leads to healthier families, a healthier company, and a
healthier world," said Karen Boykin-Towns, chief diversity officer for Pfizer. 

"The Working Mother 100 Best Companies stand head and shoulders above the rest,"
added Carol Evans, chief executive officer, Working Mother Media. "For example,
in the last year, we saw the number of companies nationwide offering flexible
work arrangements diminish five percentage points, while the 100 Best Companies
stayed steady at 100 percent. The 100 Best provide leadership where and when we
need it most, furnishing a framework of support for working families during good
times and bad. If all companies adopted these best practices, more families
could weather the economic storm." 

Profiles of the 100 Best Companies, as well as national comparisons, are in the
October issue of Working Mother and at workingmother.com. 

"Moms are increasingly becoming the sole breadwinners in many households as men
lose their jobs at a higher rate than women," said Suzanne Riss,
editor-in-chief, Working Mother magazine. "Now more than ever, our readers and
all working mothers need the support of their employers. By offering benefits
like paid maternity leave, the ability to work from home and wellness programs,
as well as programs that enhance financial well-being, our 100 Best are helping
to reduce stress in the busy lives of working moms. These companies epitomize
family-friendly support at its best." 

Now in its 24th year, the Working Mother 100 Best Companies program draws
attention to the significant contributions working mothers make to industries
and the companies that recognize the importance of tapping this essential labor
pool. "We have faith that some day the programs found at the 100 Best Companies
will become business norms offered by all companies," said Ms. Evans. "When the
economy recovers, lagging companies will lose out on a powerful group of
dedicated employees-working moms." 

Methodology:

Companies were selected for the 2009 Working Mother 100 Best Companies based on
an extensive application with more than 500 questions on workforce,
compensation, child care, flexibility programs, leave policies and more. It also
surveys the usage, availability and tracking of programs, as well as the
accountability of managers who oversee them. Seven areas were measured and
scored: workforce profile, benefits, women`s issues and advancement, child care,
flexible work, parental leave and company culture. For this year`s 100 Best,
particular weight was given to benefits, flexibility and parental leave.

&lt;p&gt;Survey Data Shows Significance of Verified Skills and Credentials amongst
Companies Hiring Contractors Online
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Elance, where companies hire, manage and pay contractors online, today unveiled
"Groups" to further differentiate its IT and marketing professionals with
branded affiliations based on expertise and credentials. 

"Elance`s professional community of individuals and teams who work online have a
tremendous breadth and depth of expertise. We are committed to connecting
companies with experts who have the demonstrated skills and qualifications to
get the job done," said Brad Porteus, CMO of Elance. 

According to a survey on hiring conducted by Elance, hiring managers indicated
that 3 in 4 businesses prefer to hire contractors with tested skills and
verified credentials. Elance Groups are organized by sponsoring companies who
set admission criteria such as skill tests and certifications for their specific
groups. Inaugural sponsoring companies include Microsoft, PayPal, Adobe, Palm,
Facebook, Sun, Yahoo!, American Express, Salesforce.com and many more. 

"Microsoft`s small business customers consistently tell us they want a community
of experts who can deliver customized solutions utilizing our leading Microsoft
products like Microsoft Office Access, Microsoft Office Excel, and Microsoft
Office SharePoint Server," said Kirk Gregersen, senior director of Microsoft
Information Worker Services. "With the new Elance Groups, it makes it easy for
our customers to find and work with the experts they need." 

"Elance`s launch of their PayPal Certified Developer Group helps recognize those
developers who have kept their skills up to date with PayPal`s newly-released
Certification 2.0," said Jason Korosec, general manager, PayPal Platform.
"Clients can be assured that these Elance providers are some of the best trained
in integrating PayPal`s full suite of payment products." 

As the trend of getting work done through online contractors continues to surge,
so has the importance of transparent qualifications and credentials. A recent
Elance survey that received 335 responses from employers who hire online
contractors demonstrated that tested skills and verified credentials are
important factors in the evaluation and hiring process, with 77 percent of
prospective clients considering it important that candidates showcase tested
skills when promoting their services. Data from Elance`s hiring records
underscores the importance of tested skills, indicating that proposals submitted
by providers with tested skills are 33 percent more likely to win projects than
those from providers without tested skills. 

Overall, the survey reveals that businesses look for demonstrated skills and
past work performance when hiring professionals online:

* Feedback and ratings from previous work assignments are very important to 89
percent of hiring businesses 
* Work samples are very important to 84 percent of hiring businesses 
* Rates and costs are very important to 78 percent of hiring businesses 
* The trend of hiring contract professionals continues to grow as nearly a third
of businesses plan on hiring more contractors and less full-time employees,
while 50 percent plan to keep hiring about the same.

Elance Groups sponsors also include companies such as Zoho, CVSDude, Central
Desktop, ooVoo, ConceptShare, Dimdim, Drop.io and ProtoShare. A complete
directory of Elance Groups and members is available at

2007 R2 and Microsoft Exchange Server 2007 for all voice and voicemail
services, audio and web conferencing, instant messaging (IM) and presence.
With rollout complete in the region, Aspect has now deployed Office
Communications Server 2007 R2 to 100 percent of its employee base.

    "This demonstrates how a large company can plan and execute a global
deployment of Office Communications Server 2007 R2 and see productivity
and cost savings success almost immediately," said Gurdeep Singh Pall,
corporate vice president for the Unified Communications Group at Microsoft
Corp. "Aspect was able to use its knowledge of mission-critical voice
applications and professional services to become a model example for
businesses looking to bring the benefits of UC to their organizations."

    Since the beginning of the company-wide Office Communications Server 2007
R2 deployment in the first quarter of 2009, Aspect has already begun
seeing a number of significant benefits, such as:


--  $1 million in savings on annual conferencing costs
--  Elimination of multiple PBXs, resulting in annual support savings of
    $300,000
--  Savings of over $250,000 annually in telecommunication charges as a
    result of deploying SIP trunking
    

    
Since the initial deployment in February 2009:


--  1,100,000+ instant messaging (IM) sessions have taken place
--  38,000 conference calls and 70,000 if you add in web, IM, application
    sharing, etc. conference calls have been executed, with participant minutes
    exceeding eight million (for just pure voice conference calls)
--  6,140 web conferences have been held, with 882,000 participant minutes
    logged
--  886,000 voice conversations have taken place, totaling more than
    5,800,000 minutes of talk time
    

    
"Through the entire deployment of Office Communications Server 2007
R2, Aspect has demonstrated our expertise in developing and implementing a
cohesive and comprehensive unified communications strategy that allowed us
to be very successful, including exceeding expectations on our initial
timeline, ROI and finishing the entire deployment ahead of schedule," said
Jamie Ryan, senior vice president, information technology and chief
information officer, Aspect. "The Aspect global implementation is a
shining example of the company's knowledge and expertise in deploying
unified communications across a wide variety of infrastructures in many
regions around the world."

&lt;p&gt; * NFL signs 5-year extension on sponsorship with Visa&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * League also renews deal with IBM&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Ben Klayman&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CHICAGO, Sept 22 (Reuters) - Visa Inc (V.N) signed on as
the exclusive payment service of the National Football League
for another five seasons, citing the U.S. league's popularity
at a time when sports fans and corporate backers are slashing
spending.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The world's largest payment network said on Tuesday the
deal with the 32-team league will run through the 2014 season,
continuing a relationship that dates back to 1995.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, NFL
officials said it was for more than the current agreement, due
to expire in March 2010 and previously valued at about $8
million a year by Street  Smith's SportsBusiness Journal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It is the No. 1 sport in the country when it comes to
viewing," Antonio Lucio, Visa's chief marketing officer, said
in a telephone interview. "It is a very well-managed
institution of people that understand the needs of sponsors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "When you add on top of that everything that has to do with
increases in audiences during tough economic times, it is a
property that actually fits very well with our strategic
priorities," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sports leagues and teams have been hurt over the past year
as major sponsors from General Motors Co [GM.UL] to FedEx Corp
(FDX.N) and top banks cut spending on sports marketing,
including sponsorships, advertising and tickets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Spending on sports sponsorships by North American-based
companies is expected to rise only 0.7 percent this year to
$11.48 billion, after growth the previous year of 14.6 percent,
according to IEG, a research firm owned by advertising giant
WPP Plc (WPP.L).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The NFL has seen ticket sales drop in some cities this
season, resulting in a few games being blacked out in local
markets. But it remains the most popular U.S. sports league
thanks to strong TV ratings, with annual revenue of about $8
billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition to Visa, the NFL renewed a sponsorship with
International Business Machines Corp (IBM.N), NFL Chief
Marketing Officer Mark Waller said. Last month, it signed a
deal with Procter  Gamble Co(PG.N) reportedly valued at $10
million or more a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We're an incredibly strong proposition in the
marketplace," Waller said. "The sport is strong, the ratings
are strong and our brand is strong."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, no sport is immune to the recession. Growth of the
NFL's sponsorship revenue will be in the low single-digit
percentage range this year compared with the high single-digit
growth of the past, Waller said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NFL owners last year blamed rising costs when they
terminated their labor contract with the players union two
years early in a move to cut salaries. Both sides are now
preparing for a possible work stoppage for the 2011 season.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Visa, which also is a global sponsor of the Olympics and
soccer's World Cup, has seen revenue growth slow over the last
year as debt-burdened consumers used their credit cards less
often. Last week, Visa CEO Joseph Saunders said U.S. consumer
spending would remain lackluster for the rest of the year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Under the extended NFL agreement, Visa adds top-tier
sponsorship of the NFL Draft and NFL Kickoff, as well as
exclusive NFL experiences for select Visa card holders.

&lt;p&gt;* Academies to help teachers encourage student interest in science careers and
promote gender equity 
* Program expands ExxonMobil`s ongoing support for math and science education

IRVING, Texas--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation announced today it has increased its investment in math
and science education through a partnership with Dr. Sally Ride, the first
American woman to travel in space. 

The Sally Ride Science Academy brought to you by ExxonMobil will encourage
student interest in math and science education though curriculum augmentation,
programs to make math and science more relevant, constructive feedback skills
training and tools to promote careers in math and science. In addition, the
Academy will provide gender equity training to help educators foster an
encouraging and collaborative learning environment. 

"ExxonMobil`s long-time involvement with education and Sally Ride`s passion for
math and science complement each other perfectly," said Rex W. Tillerson,
chairman and chief executive officer. "Together we share the goal of preparing
young people, particularly young girls, for careers in science, technology,
engineering and math." 

Dr. Ride, president and CEO of Sally Ride Science, noted that over the past
decade, the number of young people prepared to enter the fields of math and
science has decreased. 

"The Sally Ride Science Academy brought to you by ExxonMobil will give teachers
and counselors the tools they need to help students learn to love math and
science the way I do," said Dr. Ride. "We`ll help them open students` eyes to
the wonders of science and the fantastic careers that await them." 

A pilot session of the Sally Ride Science Academy brought to you by ExxonMobil
was held in July and included 120 educators from Paradise Valley, AZ, Arlington,
VA, the California communities of Orange County, San Diego and Torrance, and the
Texas communities of Aldine, Austin, Beaumont, Carroll, Cypress-Fairbanks,
Houston, Irving and San Antonio. 

During the summer of 2010, the Sally Ride Science Academy is expected to expand
to three sessions, two for elementary school teachers, and one for middle school
teachers who will be selected in conjunction with administrators from targeted
school districts. 

The Sally Ride Science Academy brought to you by ExxonMobil is one of several
significant programs established by the company to support math and science
education in the United States. 

ExxonMobil`s support for math and science education includes a $125 million
commitment to the National Math and Science Initiative (NMSI). NMSI, which
includes Dr. Ride on the board of directors, recently released promising results
from its first year of concerted efforts to expand the reach of the
college-level program, Advanced Placement, known as AP. 

The number of students passing AP math, science and English exams increased by
51 percent at participating schools, more than nine times the national average.
The results for underrepresented populations were even better: African American
and Hispanic students passed 71 percent more AP exams, and girls passed 55
percent more. 

Other ExxonMobil education initiatives include the Mickelson ExxonMobil Teachers
Academy, a partnership with PGA golfer Phil Mickelson and his wife, Amy, which
has equipped more than 2,000 teachers with innovative tools to inspire students
in math and science. Working with the National Science Teachers Association and
Math Solutions, the Academy offers a five-day program each summer to provide
third- through fifth-grade teachers with the knowledge and skills necessary to
motivate students to pursue careers in science and math. 

"ExxonMobil is dedicated to supporting programs that generate interest in math
and science education and provide career options for students," said Tillerson.
"Our country needs future scientists and engineers and our efforts are an
investment in that future."

&lt;p&gt;91-Month Follow-up of the Intergroup Exemestane Study (IES) Demonstrated a
Significant Disease-Free Survival Benefit in Favor of Switching to AROMASIN
After 2 to 3 Years of Tamoxifen Compared to Continuing on Tamoxifen for 5 Years
in Oestrogen-Receptor Positive/Unknown Postmenopausal Early Breast Cancer
Patients
BERLIN--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc today announced new, longer-term data from the Intergroup Exemestane
Study (IES) showing that women who switched to AROMASIN (exemestane tablets)
after taking tamoxifen for two to three years experienced a significant
reduction (18%) in the risk of disease-free survival (DFS) events (HR=0.82; 95%
CI: 0.73-0.92; P=0.0009), compared to women who continued on tamoxifen for a
full five years of treatment.1 In addition, IES showed that AROMASIN prolonged
overall survival (OS) in the ER+/unknown population with a 14% reduction in the
risk of dying (HR=0.86; 95% CI: 0.75-0.99; P=0.04).1 These results demonstrate
that the benefits of treatment are maintained in long term follow-up. These
results were presented at the joint ECCO 15/ESMO 34 meeting in Berlin, Germany.1

"These new, long-term follow-up data of the IES demonstrate a significant
survival benefit for patients who switched to AROMASIN compared to those who
stayed on tamoxifen," said Charles Coombes, head of the oncology department at
Imperial College, London, UK and principal investigator of the IES. "These
findings are important to patients and physicians alike as they reaffirm their
confidence in switching to AROMASIN after two to three years of tamoxifen." 

IES is a landmark trial with the longest follow-up of endocrine treatment in the
adjuvant switch setting. It is a randomized, double-blind, multinational trial
of postmenopausal women with early breast cancer.2 IES evaluates the clinical
benefits of switching 2,352 patients to AROMASIN after two to three years of
tamoxifen versus continuing 2,372 patients on tamoxifen for a full five years of
therapy. The primary endpoint of the study was DFS in the intent-to-treat (ITT)i
population. Within the IES, 97% of the study population was oestrogen-receptor
positive/unknown.1

In postmenopausal women with early breast cancer at a median follow-up of 91
months, switching to AROMASIN after two to three years of tamoxifen, for a total
of five years of treatment, was shown to result in a:

* 16% reduction in the risk of DFS events, defined as local or distant
recurrence of breast cancer, contralateral breast cancer, or death from any
cause, compared to staying on tamoxifen for five years (HR=0.84; 95% CI:
0.75-0.94; P=0.002) in the ITTi population.1
* For the secondary endpoint of overall survival in the ITT population, there
was an 11% relative risk reduction of death. There was a statistically
significant 14% reduction in the risk of death noted in the ER+/unknownii
population (HR=0.86: 95% CI: 0.75-0.99 P=0.04).1

These DFS and OS data are consistent with the previous IES update at 55.7
months. Additionally, AROMASIN`s safety profile at 91 months was similar to that
shown previously. An analysis of events of interest including cardiovascular and
musculoskeletal showed no new serious adverse events in comparison to the
previous analysis.1

"AROMASIN has proven to be an effective treatment for postmenopausal women with
oestrogen-receptor positive early breast cancer after 2-3 years of tamoxifen
treatment," said Mace Rothenberg, MD, senior vice president, clinical
development and medical affairs, Pfizer Oncology. "The extraordinarily long-term
follow up of patients enrolled in this study adds to the body of data supporting
AROMASIN`s benefits and further underscores Pfizer`s commitment to oncology." 

About AROMASIN (exemestane tablets)3

In Europe, AROMASIN is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of postmenopausal
women with oestrogen receptor positive invasive early breast cancer, following
two to three years of initial adjuvant tamoxifen therapy. AROMASIN is indicated
for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in women with natural or induced
postmenopausal status whose disease has progressed following anti-oestrogen
therapy. Efficacy has not been demonstrated in patients with oestrogen receptor
negative status. 

In the United States, AROMASIN is indicated for the adjuvant treatment of
postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor positive early breast cancer who
have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to AROMASIN for
completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy.
AROMASIN is also indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in
postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. 

Important AROMASIN (exemestane tablets) Safety Information3

AROMASIN should not be used in women who are premenopausal, are nursing or
pregnant, have a known hypersensitivity to the drug, or are taking
oestrogen-containing agents. Dose modification is recommended for patients who
are receiving certain medications, including strong CYP 3A4 inducers such as
rifampicin and phenytoin. In patients with early breast cancer, elevations in
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those
receiving AROMASIN than either tamoxifen or placebo. Reductions in bone mineral
density over time are seen with the use of AROMASIN.

postmenopausal women with oestrogen-receptor positive early breast cancer who
have received two to three years of tamoxifen and are switched to AROMASIN for
completion of a total of five consecutive years of adjuvant hormonal therapy.
AROMASIN is also indicated for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in
postmenopausal women whose disease has progressed following tamoxifen therapy. 

Important AROMASIN (exemestane tablets) Safety Information3

AROMASIN should not be used in women who are premenopausal, are nursing or
pregnant, have a known hypersensitivity to the drug, or are taking
oestrogen-containing agents. Dose modification is recommended for patients who
are receiving certain medications, including strong CYP 3A4 inducers such as
rifampicin and phenytoin. In patients with early breast cancer, elevations in
bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, and creatinine were more common in those
receiving AROMASIN than either tamoxifen or placebo. Reductions in bone mineral
density over time are seen with the use of AROMASIN.

&lt;p&gt;http://www.profit.zacks.com/
CHICAGO--(Business Wire)--
Zacks Equity Research highlights Goldman Sachs (GS) as the Bull of the Day and
Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity
Research provides analysis on Freeport McMoRan (FCX), Rio Tinto (RTP) and Vale
(VALE). 

Full analysis of all these stocks is available at http://at.zacks.com/?id=2676. 

Here is a synopsis of all five stocks: 

Bull of the Day: 

Goldman Sachs (GS)

We are initiating coverage on Goldman Sachs (GS) with an Outperform
recommendation. The company reported strong second-quarter results,
significantly ahead of the Zacks Consensus Estimate, led by strong topline
growth in all its key businesses. 

Goldman's well-diversified business model, coupled with a more favorable
operating environment resulting from improved equity markets, led to strong
growth in fixed income and a turnaround in investment banking activity. 

Though losses from the commercial real estate portfolio will likely weigh on the
results in the near term, we think Goldman's sturdy capital and liquidity will
lead to increased profitability from newer opportunities once the economy
recovers. 

Bear of the Day: 

Cadence Design Systems (CDNS)

Cadence Design Systems (CDNS) reported weak results for the second quarter, and
blamed the shortfall on softness in EDA spending. We expect that a turnaround is
going to take time due to mounting financial problems leading to a lackluster
growth. 

Third quarter and 2009 guidance was not encouraging. Although Cadence is
offering new products and taking cost-cutting measures, we are not confident in
the company`s ability to grow and show healthy fundamentals over the near term.
Cadence also withdrew its bid for Mentor Graphics in 2008, further dimming its
growth prospects. 

Cadence recently came out with enhanced versions of its products, but it will
take time for these to generate additional revenue. 2011 estimates have been
added. We maintain an Underperform rating on the shares a six-month price target
of $4.50. 

Latest Posts on the Zacks Analyst Blog: 

Leading Indicators Higher

Today`s numbers seem to indicate a much-stronger-than-expected economic recovery
in the making. I`m not sure I quite buy it, but the combination of the sweet
spot of the economic stimulus package hitting and a stopping of inventory
liquidation (even perhaps some rebuilding) could give us a few very nice
quarters -- it's the sustainability of them that is the issue. 

The U.S., however, does not seem to be alone in starting to recover, and if
other countries are recovering, it will also aid in ours. They will be more
likely to buy our exports if they are growing. 

A world-wide recovery would, however, mean much higher commodity prices,
particularly for base metals and energy. This would be good news for the miners
like Freeport McMoRan (FCX), Rio Tinto (RTP) and Vale (VALE).

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Zusammen mit Changemakers von Ashoka und dem International Center for Research
on Women (ICRW) hat die Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM) heute eine
Initiative vorgestellt, durch die Frauen in Entwicklungsl&#228;ndern ihr
wirtschaftliches Potenzial mit Hilfe von neuen technologischen Errungenschaften
verwirklichen sollen. 

Im Rahmen des Programms, das sich Technologies to Improve Women`s Economic
Livelihoods (&#8222;Technologien zur Verbesserung der wirtschaftlichen Stellung der
Frau") nennt, werden Technologien und Innovationen ausgew&#228;hlt und eingesetzt,
die zur Verbesserung der Lebensqualit&#228;t beitragen k&#246;nnen und Frauen zur
vermehrten Teilhabe an Lohnarbeit bef&#228;higen. Das Programm ist Teil der 2005
lancierten Initiative Women`s Economic Opportunity von ExxonMobil. Im Rahmen der
bisher als Educating Women and Girls (Ausbildung f&#252;r Frauen und M&#228;dchen)
bekannten Initiative wurden bereits &#252;ber 20 Millionen US-Dollar in Programme
investiert, an denen Frauen aus 64 Entwicklungsl&#228;ndern teilgenommen haben. 

&#8222;Als globales Technologieunternehmen kann ExxonMobil einen dauerhaften Beitrag
leisten, indem wir neue Technologien ausfindig machen und einsetzen, die die
wirtschaftliche Stellung von Frauen verbessern und festigen", sagte Rex W.
Tillerson, Chairman und Chief Executive Officer. &#8222;Dieser Schwerpunkt entspricht
unserer eigenen &#220;berzeugung und Erfahrung, dass neue technologische
Errungenschaften bei der L&#246;sungsfindung f&#252;r viele der gr&#246;&#223;ten Probleme auf der
Welt entscheidend sind." 

Die neue Initiative von ExxonMobil wurde vom ehemaligen US-Pr&#228;sidenten Bill
Clinton anl&#228;sslich der Jahresversammlung der Clinton Global Initiative in New
York angek&#252;ndigt. ExxonMobil ist Co-Sponsor des allerersten
CGI-Spezialprogramms, das den Investitionsschwerpunkt auf M&#228;dchen und Frauen
legt. Tillerson war an der Plenumssitzung zum Thema &#8222;Investing in Girls and
Women" (&#8222;Investitionen in M&#228;dchen und Frauen") als Diskussionsteilnehmer
beteiligt. 

&#8222;Die Investitionen von ExxonMobil in diesem Bereich zielen darauf ab, Frauen in
Entwicklungsl&#228;ndern mehr Chancen zu verschaffen, dank derer sie ihre
wirtschaftlichen Aussichten verbessern und als F&#252;hrungskr&#228;fte und
Unternehmerinnen Erfolg haben k&#246;nnen", sagte Tillerson. &#8222;Wir freuen uns, den
neuen Schwerpunkt der Clinton Global Initiative zu unterst&#252;tzen, denn
Investitionen in Frauen spiegeln die weltweit wachsende Anerkennung des
wichtigen Einflusses von Frauen in verantwortungsvollen Positionen auf die
wirtschaftliche und gesellschaftliche Entwicklung wider." 

Der erste Jahresbeitrag f&#252;r das Programm &#8222;Technologien zur Verbesserung der
wirtschaftlichen Stellung der Frau" in H&#246;he von 1,5 Millionen US-Dollar wird f&#252;r
Forschungsarbeiten und die Ver&#246;ffentlichung und Verbreitung eines Wei&#223;buchs des
ICRW zu den Bereichen, in denen technologische Fortschritte die wirtschaftliche
Produktivit&#228;t von Frauen f&#246;rdern k&#246;nnen, eingesetzt. 

Diese wegweisende Forschungst&#228;tigkeit erg&#228;nzen wird ein weltweites Programm
zusammen mit Changemakers von Ashoka, das die vielversprechendsten Innovationen
mit der gr&#246;&#223;ten Bedeutung f&#252;r Frauen aufsp&#252;ren und daraufhin untersuchen soll,
wie diese am besten in den Markt eingebracht werden k&#246;nnen. Solche Innovationen
k&#246;nnen von Technologien und Ger&#228;ten zur Erleichterung von Haushaltsaufgaben wie
Kochen, Wasserholen oder Ernten bis hin zu Technologien reichen, die Frauen bei
der Entwicklung von effizienteren Methoden der Lohnarbeit unterst&#252;tzen. 

Bill Drayton, Gr&#252;nder und Chief Executive Officer von Ashoka, sagte, dass seine
Organisation sich auf die Zusammenarbeit mit ExxonMobil freue, um die
vielversprechendsten Innovationen mit der gr&#246;&#223;ten Bedeutung f&#252;r Frauen zu finden
und zum Einsatz zu bringen. 

&#8222;Wir haben gesehen, was einzelne Personen tun k&#246;nnen, um in ihrem Umfeld
Ver&#228;nderungen zu erreichen", sagte Drayton. &#8222;Diese gemeinschaftliche Suche wird
uns zeigen, wie neue technologische Errungenschaften f&#252;r Frauen einen Teil zur
L&#246;sung der weltweiten Armut beitragen k&#246;nnen." 

&#8222;Wir freuen uns sehr, bei diesen wegbereitenden Bem&#252;hungen beteiligt zu sein und

&lt;p&gt;SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Chevron Corp. (NYSE:CVX) has filed an international arbitration claim against
the government of Ecuador citing violations of the country`s obligations under
the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty, investment agreements,
and international law. The complaint stems from the government of Ecuador`s
exploitation of the ongoing lawsuit against Chevron in Ecuador, as well as the
government`s failure to uphold its duties under decade-old contracts. The
arbitration proceeding has been commenced before the Permanent Court of
Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law. 

Chevron`s claims relate to the lawsuit currently pending against the company in
Lago Agrio, Ecuador, where Chevron`s subsidiary, Texaco Petroleum Company
participated until 1992 as a minority member of a consortium that explored for
and produced oil under contracts with Ecuador and Ecuador`s government-owned oil
company, Petroecuador. Through the filing, Chevron seeks to enforce prior
settlement and release agreements that the government of Ecuador entered into
with Texaco Petroleum when the consortium was terminated, and to hold Ecuador
accountable for its obligations under Ecuadorian law and existing international
treaties. 

"As has been widely recognized, the government of Ecuador has seriously
diminished the independence and integrity of its own judiciary. The government
is using the legal process in Lago Agrio to avoid the environmental obligations
of its state-owned oil company," said Hewitt Pate, Chevron`s vice president and
general counsel. "Because Ecuador`s judicial system is incapable of functioning
independently of political influence, Chevron has no choice but to seek relief
under the treaty between the United States and Ecuador." 

After its participation in the consortium ended in 1992, Texaco Petroleum
negotiated a settlement agreement with Ecuador and Petroecuador whereby Texaco
Petroleum assumed responsibility for specified environmental remediation
projects in proportion to its minority ownership interest. In 1998, after the
requisite remediation work was performed and independently validated, Ecuador
and Petroecuador released Texaco Petroleum and its affiliates from further
liability. Ecuador assumed responsibility for any remaining impact caused by the
consortium`s pre-1992 activities as well as any future impact caused by
Petroecuador`s own ongoing operations in the former concession area. Since
Texaco Petroleum`s departure, Petroecuador has drilled over 400 new wells in the
concession area, compared to the 321 wells that were drilled during the
consortium. Compounding the situation, Petroecuador`s environmental record as an
operator has been notoriously poor, with more than 1,400 oil spills since 2000
alone. 

The current Ecuador lawsuit is an effort to force Chevron to pay for
Petroecuador`s own misdeeds. In collusion with trial lawyers suing Chevron, the
government of Ecuador has violated its contracts with Texaco Petroleum as well
as protections afforded to investors under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral
Investment Treaty:

* Ecuador`s President has publicly committed to support the plaintiffs; 
* Representatives of the Attorney General`s office have conspired with
plaintiffs` lawyers to undermine the integrity of the 1995 and 1998 contracts; 
* Ecuador`s Prosecutor General has manufactured illegitimate criminal
indictments against Chevron counsel, and 
* The judge presiding over the trial has publicly revealed his bias and
pre-judgment of the case in media interviews and recorded meetings with
individuals who had been solicited by officials of Ecuador`s ruling political
party to pay a bribe in exchange for the award of contracts to be funded with
the proceeds of an anticipated verdict against Chevron.

"Chevron`s filing today should not come as a surprise. The overt conduct of
Ecuador`s government and judicial branch disregards Ecuadorian law,
international obligations, and Chevron`s basic right to a fair hearing," Pate
added. "Ecuador`s actions violate Texaco Petroleum`s agreements with Ecuador as
well as the Bilateral Investment Treaty`s guarantee of fair and equitable
treatment for U.S. investors." 

Chevron is not alone in highlighting the demise of Ecuador`s judiciary as well
as the government`s hostility towards foreign investors. In February 2009, the
United States Department of State released its Investment Climate Statement for
Ecuador which states, "Systemic weakness and susceptibility to political or
economic pressures in the rule of law constitute the most important problem
faced by U.S. companies investing in or trading with Ecuador." The report goes
on to state that "Corruption is a serious problem in Ecuador," and that, "The
courts are often susceptible to outside pressure and bribes. Neither
Congressional oversight nor internal judicial branch mechanisms have shown a
consistent capacity to effectively investigate and discipline allegedly corrupt
judges." 

Chevron`s notice of arbitration has been delivered to the Attorney General of
Ecuador, as well as Ecuador`s President and Ambassador to the United States.
Upon appointment of the arbitrators to hear the case, the tribunal will
establish a schedule for briefings and arguments on the merits. Copies of the
petition in English and Spanish, as well as related materials, can be found at
www.chevron.com/ecuador.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Corp., Yahoo Inc. and several other top vendors are making it easier for small and mid-size companies to hire specialized IT consultants located anywhere in the world by working with providers of online employment marketplaces that use eBay-like features to match workers with employers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mountain View, Calif.-based Elance Inc. announced today that it is working with several companies to list the specific skills needed to work with their products, while rival oDesk Corp. in Menlo Park, Calif., says it also has a similar agreements with multiple vendors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elance and oDesk both provide a means for businesses to hire workers, especially in IT, for specific projects at hourly rates. The freelance workers must take tests to prove their skills, and are also subject to eBay-like customer satisfaction ratings. Their increasing relationships with vendors raise the possibility that global competition for IT work is expanding down to the smallest of businesses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The consultants available through the online marketplace can be located anywhere in the world -- the U.S., India, Eastern Europe and so on. The services are delivered virtually via cloud platforms created by Elance and oDesk. Ths services enable businesses of any size to tap into a global labor pool to find the skills they need at potentially competitive rates.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We think this opens up a whole new market for small business customers to get the help they need," said Michael Schultz, a director of product management and marketing at Microsoft, during a press briefing this week organized by Elance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike larger firms, "small businesses have never really had much leverage or leeway to be competitive with their bids," said Schultz. He said small businesses needing help with Microsoft platforms typically seek technical expertise locally . They often have trouble finding the right skills for their job or a competitive price for the work, he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether the vendor's support for the online marketplaces are a sign that globalization will filter down to the smallest businesses remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The increasing use of H-1B visas has brought globalization, at least in part, to mid-size firms via niche IT contracting shops that utilize foreign expertise. Large companies have always had the ability to tap offshore talent, whether through Indian offshore firms like Infosys, or though large U.S.-based vendors like IBM, which operates large offshore development operations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Elance says about 61% of its providers are based in the U.S., and oDesk said its providers are roughly split in thirds, between Asia, Eastern Europe and the U.S., although it said the U.S. was its fastest growing provider base.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One reason the technology vendors are working more with companies like Elance is the emergence of cloud platforms hosting development tools and/or applications, said Fabio Rosati, the CEO of Elance. User companies need to find people who can work on the specific virtual platforms created by individual vendors, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The vendors have control over their technology platform group and determine admission criteria to vet the skills levels needed. The vendors "wanted to control who is in the group," said oDesk CEO Gary Swart.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both Elance and oDesk are private and highly competitive and both claim to be the largest and have different metrics, such as size of project and approaches for measuring their size. Regardless of the claims, each firms lists thousands of jobs -- nearly 27,000 on Elance, and almost 13,000 on oDesk -- and have been growing in the recession.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Elance 's partners are eBay Inc. unit PayPal, Adobe Systems Inc., Palm Inc., Facebook Inc., Sun Microsystems Inc., Yahoo Inc., American Express Inc., and Salesforce.com. ODesk's list of partners include Yahoo, Facebook, Sun, RedHat, Intuit and others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These lists will likely expand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A federal appeals court today heard arguments in a patent infringement case involving Word that required Microsoft to pay nearly $300 million in damages and barred the company from selling the software starting Oct. 10.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today's hearing was the latest step in a fast-track appeal that was granted Microsoft earlier this month, when it contested a jury verdict that ruled it illegally used technology patented by Canadian developer i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case has attracted interest primarily because a lower court slapped an injunction on Microsoft that would have prevented the company from selling Word 2003 and Word 2007 as of Oct. 10. That injunction, however, was suspended earlier this month after Microsoft threatened that chaos would result. According to Microsoft, it would take five months to modify Word, and the company wouldn't be able to sell Word and the suites, Office 2003 and Office 2007, that include the popular word processor, during that time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Lawyers for Canadian developer i4i and Microsoft were each given 30 minutes today to argue their positions before the three judges who make up the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal District.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although the judges did not rule today -- and gave no indication when they would -- i4i and Microsoft representatives naturally had their own takes on what occurred.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We really do feel very good coming out of the hearing," said Loudon Owen, the chairman of i4i, in a telephone interview after the hearing. "We have the verdict and the injunction, so the onus is on Microsoft. What was good was that there were no surprises.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It was very encouraging, because Microsoft just rehashed its arguments," added Owen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement e-mailed to Computerworld , Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz had a different outlook. "We emphasized three points for why a reverse judgment or retrial is warranted," said Kutz. "Courts need to construct claims properly, the patent is not valid and we do not infringe it, and common sense can't be abandoned when it comes to damages calculation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like Owen, Kutz also commended the judges. "We are pleased with how the hearing proceeded, and we look forward to the Court's ruling," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Owen continued to hold out hope that the injunction would be restored , perhaps to its original Oct. 10 date.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not in a position to tell the judges their business," he said when asked whether i4i's lawyer prompted the panel to quickly produce a ruling on the appeal. "But there was a fairly extensive discussion of the time frame, including the fact that the actual verdict was [rendered] in May, and that Microsoft has had four-to-five months to decommission [Word]."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The injunction required Microsoft to either stop selling Word 2003 and 2007, or to modify the software so that it no longer includes the infringing XML editing and "custom" XML technology patented by i4i.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are being irreparably harmed [by the injunction's stay]," said Owen today. "Until it's put in place, we are suffering not only tactical damage, but strategic damage."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Silverlight&#160;rich media plug-in technology for Internet applications will extend to the Intel-driven Moblin device platform early next year, Intel and Microsoft said on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Version 3 of Silverlight will be supported, according to Microsoft. Through Silverlight's cross-platform foundation, developers can write applications once and have them run on both Windows and Moblin devices, Intel said. Moblin is a Linux-based open source operating system project intended for systems ranging from netbooks and handhelds to smartphones and in-car computers. It is primarily focused on the Intel Atom processor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Also on InfoWorld: "Microsoft gives sneak peek at Silverlight 4." ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Silverlight 3 shipped in July, featuring offline and 3-D capabilities as well as advanced streaming. Silverlight is a rival to the ubiquitous Adobe Flash platform. Moblin has not supported previous versions of Silverlight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft lauded Intel's plans in its Silverlight blog on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This collaboration is focused on enabling consumers to have a great out-of-the box experience for browsing the Web and we see Silverlight support as a key aspect of that," Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are excited by further support of Silverlight by key industry leaders and how this collaboration delivers on Silverlight's cross-platform, cross-browser, and cross-device promise by going beyond just the PC to allow developers to reach more endpoints for their applications and services," Microsoft said. "We see this is a clear extension of our current efforts with Novell where we are building an open source implementation of Silverlight called 'Moonlight' that is targeted at the broad range of Linux-based PCs."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel announced the Moblin-Silverlight effort at the Intel Developer Forum in San Francisco, where the company also unveiled its Intel Atom Developer Program, intended to encourage ISVs and developers to build applications for Atom devices. Silverlight will be supported within the program, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Developers can target Silverlight as a preferred client runtime and know they will get solid support on Atom-based devices," said Microsoft in its blog. Intel also showed Microsoft IIS (Internet Information Services) Smooth Streaming on Atom-devices running both Windows 7 and Moblin, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Intel has transferred jurisdiction over Moblin to the Linux Foundation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.infoworld.com/node/92989&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp said it had filed an international arbitration claim against Ecuador, opening a new front in its defense against a $27 billion environmental damage lawsuit in Ecuadorean court.&lt;/p&gt;

and international law. The complaint stems from the government of Ecuador`s

government`s failure to uphold its duties under decade-old contracts. The
arbitration proceeding has been commenced before the Permanent Court of
Arbitration in The Hague under the Rules of the United Nations Commission on
International Trade Law. 

Chevron`s claims relate to the lawsuit currently pending against the company in
Lago Agrio, Ecuador, where Chevron`s subsidiary, Texaco Petroleum Company
participated until 1992 as a minority member of a consortium that explored for
and produced oil under contracts with Ecuador and Ecuador`s government-owned oil
company, Petroecuador. Through the filing, Chevron seeks to enforce prior
settlement and release agreements that the government of Ecuador entered into
with Texaco Petroleum when the consortium was terminated, and to hold Ecuador
accountable for its obligations under Ecuadorian law and existing international
treaties. 

"As has been widely recognized, the government of Ecuador has seriously
diminished the independence and integrity of its own judiciary. The government
is using the legal process in Lago Agrio to avoid the environmental obligations
of its state-owned oil company," said Hewitt Pate, Chevron`s vice president and
general counsel. "Because Ecuador`s judicial system is incapable of functioning
independently of political influence, Chevron has no choice but to seek relief
under the treaty between the United States and Ecuador." 

After its participation in the consortium ended in 1992, Texaco Petroleum
negotiated a settlement agreement with Ecuador and Petroecuador whereby Texaco
Petroleum assumed responsibility for specified environmental remediation
projects in proportion to its minority ownership interest. In 1998, after the
requisite remediation work was performed and independently validated, Ecuador
and Petroecuador released Texaco Petroleum and its affiliates from further
liability. Ecuador assumed responsibility for any remaining impact caused by the
consortium`s pre-1992 activities as well as any future impact caused by
Petroecuador`s own ongoing operations in the former concession area. Since
Texaco Petroleum`s departure, Petroecuador has drilled over 400 new wells in the
concession area, compared to the 321 wells that were drilled during the
consortium. Compounding the situation, Petroecuador`s environmental record as an
operator has been notoriously poor, with more than 1,400 oil spills since 2000
alone. 

The current Ecuador lawsuit is an effort to force Chevron to pay for
Petroecuador`s own misdeeds. In collusion with trial lawyers suing Chevron, the
government of Ecuador has violated its contracts with Texaco Petroleum as well
as protections afforded to investors under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral
Investment Treaty:

* Ecuador`s President has publicly committed to support the plaintiffs; 
* Representatives of the Attorney General`s office have conspired with
plaintiffs` lawyers to undermine the integrity of the 1995 and 1998 contracts; 
* Ecuador`s Prosecutor General has manufactured illegitimate criminal
indictments against Chevron counsel, and 
* The judge presiding over the trial has publicly revealed his bias and
pre-judgment of the case in media interviews and recorded meetings with
individuals who had been solicited by officials of Ecuador`s ruling political
party to pay a bribe in exchange for the award of contracts to be funded with
the proceeds of an anticipated verdict against Chevron.

"Chevron`s filing today should not come as a surprise. The overt conduct of
Ecuador`s government and judicial branch disregards Ecuadorian law,
international obligations, and Chevron`s basic right to a fair hearing," Pate
added. "Ecuador`s actions violate Texaco Petroleum`s agreements with Ecuador as
well as the Bilateral Investment Treaty`s guarantee of fair and equitable
treatment for U.S. investors." 

Chevron is not alone in highlighting the demise of Ecuador`s judiciary as well
as the government`s hostility towards foreign investors. In February 2009, the
United States Department of State released its Investment Climate Statement for
Ecuador which states, "Systemic weakness and susceptibility to political or
economic pressures in the rule of law constitute the most important problem
faced by U.S. companies investing in or trading with Ecuador." The report goes
on to state that "Corruption is a serious problem in Ecuador," and that, "The
courts are often susceptible to outside pressure and bribes. Neither
Congressional oversight nor internal judicial branch mechanisms have shown a
consistent capacity to effectively investigate and discipline allegedly corrupt
judges." 

Chevron`s notice of arbitration has been delivered to the Attorney General of
Ecuador, as well as Ecuador`s President and Ambassador to the United States.
Upon appointment of the arbitrators to hear the case, the tribunal will
establish a schedule for briefings and arguments on the merits. Copies of the
petition in English and Spanish, as well as related materials, can be found at
www.chevron.com/ecuador.

with subsidiaries that conduct business worldwide. The company`s success is
driven by the ingenuity and commitment of more than 62,000 employees who operate
across the energy spectrum. Chevron explores for, produces and transports crude

&lt;p&gt; * Seeks to enforce release of liability from Ecuador govt * Chevron faces $27 bln claim in Ecuadorean court SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 23 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on Wednesday it had filed an international arbitration claim against Ecuador, opening a new front in its defense against a $27 billion environmental damage claim in Ecuadorean court. Chevron has complained repeatedly of government interference in the 16-year-old case, in which indigenous communities have accused Texaco, bought by Chevron in 2001, of damaging the environment and their health while operating petroleum facilities in the region. Chevron said the arbitration proceeding has been commenced before the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague under United Nations international trade law. Chevron says that in 1998, Ecuador and state oil company Petroecuador released Texaco from further liability after remediation work was completed. But plaintiffs in the case argue that the release did not deal with private claims against the company. (Reporting by Braden Reddall; Editing by Richard Chang)

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Wells Fargo  Co (WFC.N) said on Wednesday they are eliminating some overdraft fees altogether and trimming others, after Bank of America Corp (BAC.N) announced a similar move on Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The changes follow U.S. congressional leaders' criticism of bank account fees and come as the banks digest rule changes for credit card fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;New York-based JPMorgan said it made the changes, which include removing overdraft fees if a customer's account is $5 or less overdrawn, in a bid to help its 25 million debit card customers amid the recession and rising U.S. unemployment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The second-largest U.S. bank is also ending overdrafts for debit cards unless the account holder opts into an overdraft service and it will start recognizing debit-card transactions and cash withdrawals as they occur, according to the statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;San Francisco-based Wells Fargo said it will charge no more than four overdraft fees in a day and it will allow customers to opt out of having an overdraft facility.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bank of America, the largest U.S. bank, said it was reducing overdraft and other account fees over the next year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Elinor Comlay; editing by Lisa Von Ahn and Andre Grenon)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is working on a tablet-style computer that could compete with Apple's rumored device, and may be in the final stages of prototyping, according to multiple reports on the Internet yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The device, which Gizmodo first reported on, has been dubbed the "Courier" and resembles a book more than a traditional tablet, as it sports dual 7-inch screens that face each other when the system is opened. Other features include the ability to use either a stylus or multi-touch gestures to operate the Courier, as well as a camera embedded in the device's case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Gizmodo posted a concept video demonstration of the Courier as well as several images -- although not photographs -- of the device on its site Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Gizmodo, the Courier is in the "late prototype" stage, and is being created by Pioneer Studios, a group within Microsoft's Entertainment  Devices division, which is also responsible for the Xbox, Zune and Windows Mobile. "Courier appears to be at a stage where Microsoft is developing the user experience and showing design concepts to outside agencies," said "The Paperboy," an anonymous writer for Gizmodo.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Others have confirmed the Gizmodo account. CNET's Ina Fried , for example, said sources told her the Courier is legitimate, although it's only one of several design prototypes being explored by a team led by long-time Microsoft executive J. Allard, the Entertainment  Devices group's chief technology officer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Very interesting idea," said Allan Krans, an analyst with Technology Business Research. "It combines a lot of technology that's been proven, including the Kindle, and the touch interface of the iPhone seems to be there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Krans noted that the Courier seems to blend several past and present Microsoft technologies, including its attempts at promoting pen-style computing in the 1990s and its much newer gesture-based, tabletop "Surface."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the reason why something like the Courier makes sense now -- as opposed to the aborted efforts by Microsoft to back pen computing, and this decade's lackluster Tablet PC concept -- is because of the company's rival.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The iPhone really changed the way that people interacted with a device like this," said Krans today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Apple has also been the target of talk about tablets. The latest round of speculation about Apple's entry came last week, after a Taiwanese publication cited industry sources who claimed that several component suppliers are building parts for an upcoming Apple tablet computer , which will launch in February 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those sources said the Apple device would sport a 9.6-in. screen -- considerably less display real estate than the Courier's two 7-in. screens -- and will rely on a processor created by P.A. Semi, the Santa Clara, Calif. microprocessor design company that Apple purchased over a year ago .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Courier looks like a really nice way to do this form factor," said Krans. "It won't have the screen limitations of an iPhone, and would be larger than Apple's rumored tablet."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Microsoft spokeswoman declined to react today to the Courier reports, saying, "Microsoft makes it a practice not to comment on rumors and speculation."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

FICO credit scoring technology to drive AQUSH.JP credit analytics, helping
Japanese social lending investors improve risk management and make informed
investment decisions. Collaboration marks first time FICO has collaborated with
a company that enables peer-to-peer consumer loans.
TOKYO &amp; MINNEAPOLIS--(Business Wire)--
Exchange Corporation K.K., the pioneering operator of Japan`s AQUSH.JP Social
Lending Service (www.aqush.jp), and FICO (NYSE:FICO), the leading provider of
analytics and decision management technology, today announced that FICO risk
scoring technology will be used at the core of the AQUSH Credit Grade
borrower-ranking system. 

Using FICO credit risk scores to power AQUSH Credit Grades will give Japanese
social lending investors at AQUSH.JP access to the same world-class analytics
and risk assessment that were previously available only to large Japanese
institutions. AQUSH lenders will use these Credit Grades to define their risk
tolerance and determine the interest rates at which their funds will be offered
to borrowers. Borrowers will gain a unique opportunity to see their credit
standing through the same analytical framework that major financial institutions
have been using for decades. 

"The FICO Score is the Global Standard for Consumer Risk assessment. We are
extremely excited to be empowering our users, both borrowers and lenders, by
giving them access to Credit Grades that are based on technology they can trust.
We anticipate that our lender community will see tremendous value in the
rigorous science and 50-year track record of the FICO credit scoring technology
when making lending decisions. For borrowers, we think that the openness and
transparency of our origination process will be valued by our community, many of
whom will be gaining insights about their own credit standing for the first
time." said Russell Cummer, co-founder of Exchange Corporation. 

"Exchange Corporation is determined to provide its lenders and borrowers with
the best decision-making tools available in their AQUSH.JP peer-to-peer lending
platform, and the FICO Score is the ideal technology to power those tools," said
Robert Duque-Ribeiro, vice president and general manager of Scoring for FICO.
"Our scoring analytics are the dominant global tool for risk assessment because
we are continuously applying our science to the specifics of local markets and
changing economic conditions. And through AQUSH Credit Grade, Exchange
Corporation will help consumers to better understand and take greater control of
their credit health. We look forward to working with Exchange Corporation and
supporting a Japanese peer-to-peer risk assessment tool to build and grow this
important new segment in the Japanese credit market." 

Peer-to-peer (P2P) or social lending is a growing new segment of the consumer
credit market. Using the Internet to connect prospective borrowers with people
who wish to lend, P2P lending represents a new asset class for investors and a
new source of funding for borrowers. 

Since P2P was introduced in the United Kingdom in 2005, there are now more than
50 P2P lending services operating in nearly 20 countries around the world.
Harvard Business Review recently selected P2P lending as one of the "Top 20
Breakthrough Ideas for 2009."

work here," Mann said. "It's because of this intense focus on Microsoft
CRM that PowerObjects has grown so quickly."

give the leadership staff additional time to deliver value to customers by
doing Dynamics CRM / xRM the PowerObjects way.

    "Which is simple," Sheehan said. "Make sure customers feel that they get
way more than they give. That is the real measure of being able to add
value."

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE : XOM), en partenariat avec Changemakers d`Ashoka
et le Centre international de recherche sur les femmes (International Center for
Research on Women, ICRW), a lanc&#233; aujourd`hui une initiative visant &#224; aider les
femmes des pays en voie de d&#233;veloppement &#224; r&#233;aliser leur potentiel &#233;conomique
gr&#226;ce &#224; la technologie et &#224; l`innovation. 

Ce programme, intitul&#233; Technologies visant &#224; am&#233;liorer les moyens de subsistance
des femmes (Technologies to Improve Women`s Economic Livelihoods), va contribuer
&#224; l`identification et au d&#233;ploiement de technologies et d`innovations pouvant
am&#233;liorer la qualit&#233; de vie et permettre aux femmes de participer plus
pleinement &#224; des activit&#233;s g&#233;n&#233;ratrices de revenus. Il fait partie de
l`Initiative d`ExxonMobil en faveur des opportunit&#233;s &#233;conomiques pour les femmes
(Women`s Economic Opportunity Initiative) (anciennement l`Initiative d`aide &#224;
l`&#233;ducation des femmes et des jeunes filles (Educating Women and Girls
Initiative)), qui a &#233;t&#233; lanc&#233;e en 2005 et a investi plus de 20 millions de
dollars dans des programmes destin&#233;s aux femmes de 64 pays en voie de
d&#233;veloppement. 

&#171; En tant qu`entreprise technologique mondiale, ExxonMobil peut contribuer de
fa&#231;on durable &#224; l`identification et au d&#233;ploiement de nouvelles technologies
pour am&#233;liorer et renforcer les moyens de subsistance des femmes &#187;, a d&#233;clar&#233; le
pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral, Rex W. Tillerson. &#171; Ce domaine d`intervention
r&#233;pond &#224; notre propre conviction et &#224; notre exp&#233;rience, qui placent au premier
plan la technologie et l`innovation comme les moyens indispensables de r&#233;soudre
bon nombre des grands probl&#232;mes mondiaux. &#187; 

La nouvelle initiative d`ExxonMobil a &#233;t&#233; annonc&#233;e par l`ancien pr&#233;sident Bill
Clinton lors de l`assembl&#233;e g&#233;n&#233;rale de l`Initiative mondiale Clinton (Clinton
Global Initiative, CGI) qui s`est tenue &#224; New York. ExxonMobil co-parraine les

&#171; Les investissements d`ExxonMobil dans ce domaine visent &#224; accro&#238;tre les
opportunit&#233;s pour les femmes des pays en voie de d&#233;veloppement, &#224; am&#233;liorer
leurs perspectives &#233;conomiques, et &#224; prendre et conserver la t&#234;te d`activit&#233;s et
d`entreprises qui r&#233;ussissent &#187;, a expliqu&#233; M. Tillerson. &#171; Nous sommes heureux
de soutenir le nouvel objectif de l`Initiative mondiale Clinton, en faveur de
l`investissement pour les femmes, qui refl&#232;te la prise de conscience croissante,
dans le monde, du r&#244;le crucial des femmes pour am&#233;liorer les r&#233;sultats du
d&#233;veloppement &#233;conomique et social. &#187; 

L`engagement, pour la premi&#232;re ann&#233;e, de 1,5 million d`USD par le programme
Technologies visant &#224; am&#233;liorer les moyens de subsistance des femmes englobera
l`&#233;tude, la publication et la distribution d`un livre blanc par le Centre
international de recherche sur les femmes, sur les domaines o&#249; l`innovation
technologique peut faire progresser la productivit&#233; &#233;conomique des femmes. 

En compl&#233;ment de cette &#233;tude novatrice, un programme mondial en partenariat avec
Changemakers d`Ashoka visera &#224; identifier les innovations les plus prometteuses
et pouvant avoir le plus d`impact pour les femmes, et &#224; d&#233;terminer le meilleur
moyen de les mettre en pratique. Ces innovations pourront comprendre aussi bien
des technologies et des appareils destin&#233;s &#224; all&#233;ger les t&#226;ches m&#233;nag&#232;res
(cuisson des aliments, corv&#233;es d`eau, r&#233;coltes, etc.) que des technologies
permettant aux femmes d`augmenter la rentabilit&#233; de leurs activit&#233;s g&#233;n&#233;ratrices
de revenus. 

Bill Drayton, fondateur et pr&#233;sident-directeur g&#233;n&#233;ral d`Ashoka, a d&#233;clar&#233; que
cette organisation se r&#233;jouissait de collaborer avec ExxonMobil &#224; la recherche
et au d&#233;ploiement des innovations les plus prometteuses et &#224; plus fort impact en
faveur de la condition f&#233;minine. 

&#171; Nous avons &#233;t&#233; les t&#233;moins de ce que peuvent obtenir des individus pour faire
&#233;voluer leurs communaut&#233;s &#187;, a ajout&#233; M. Drayton. &#171; Cette &#233;tude coop&#233;rative nous
aidera &#224; cerner les fa&#231;ons dont les innovations technologiques en faveur des
femmes peuvent aider &#224; r&#233;soudre le probl&#232;me de la pauvret&#233; mondiale. &#187; 

&#171; Nous sommes ravis de participer &#224; cette initiative de pointe pour favoriser
l`acc&#232;s des femmes aux technologies, car elle peut leur donner les moyens d`&#234;tre
plus productives sur le plan &#233;conomique &#187;, a confi&#233; pour sa part Geeta Rao
Gupta, pr&#233;sidente de l`ICRW. &#171; Cette initiative s`efforce d`abattre un obstacle
tr&#232;s important &#224; la participation &#233;conomique des femmes, et contribuera

Dahlberg will work to further develop the voice of PowerObjects through
expanded development of newsletters, blogs and customer success stories.
Significant effort will be placed on developing and driving informative

    Dahlberg is driven to establish an even larger fan base for the
ever-popular PowerObjects superhero JoeCRM.

     "I want JoeCRM to help me spread the word that everyone can be a CRM
superhero," Dahlberg said.

    The second addition, Director of Solution Delivery Gretchen Mann, will
further PowerObjects' ability to successfully deliver Dynamics CRM / xRM
solutions. Gretchen will use her extensive Dynamics CRM background to
deliver solutions that exceed customer expectations. She will make sure
each customer solution is implemented on time and within budget.

    "Customers like that," Mann said. "From my past experience I know how
critical it is to have good communication between all parties involved. I
make sure everyone is on board with what the objectives are and how they
impact the success of the project. I was very excited to get this role for
PowerObjects and be part of the tremendous growth."

Dynamics CRM partner.

    "The PowerObjects drive for success -- that's what really attracted me to

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO (Private Equity Week)  Cambridge, Mass.-based Soane Energy, which is aiming to cut the impact of crude oil exploration and production, recently raised an undisclosed amount of early stage funding from venture capitalists.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intervale Capital led the investment with support from CTTV Investments, which is also known as Chevron Technology Ventures, the VC unit of Chevron Corp.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Our reliance on fossil fuels will increase over the next two decades, said company founder David Soane.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While alternative energy will fulfill our power needs of tomorrow, Soane Energys technology can be applied today to improve the efficiency of oil and gas extraction and reduce the environmental impact of exploration and production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The companys technology uses chemistry to improve the process of extracting oil from oil sands. Also known as tar sands, they are a naturally occurring mixture of sand or clay that includes a thick form of petroleum.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The oil sands are found throughout the world, especially in large quantities in Canada and Venezuela. Up until recently, oil sands were considered unprofitable for oil extraction because of the difficultly of extracting and refining it. There may be as much as 175 billion barrels of petroleum sitting in Canadas sands waiting to be extracted, according to Soane, a repeat entrepreneur who was formerly a chemical engineering professor at the University of California at Berkeley,&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Soanes startup, however, is one of several dozen new companies in the market that are looking to tap into oil sands&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The market is quite large, says Wes Raffel. There arent too many that are larger.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Raffel, a former general partner with Advanced Technology Ventures, previously partnered with Charles River Ventures and Nth Power to back Rive Technology, a startup focused on making better refining processes for oil companies. To date, Cambridge, Mass.-based Rive has raised $23.3 million from investors to pursue its technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Another example is Houston-based GloriOil, which has developed technology to ease the extraction of oil out of nearly tapped wells. The company, which claims that its technology leads to a 200% increase in oil extraction, has raised $10 million in venture capital from  Kleiner Perkins Caufield  Byers and other investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ProtoSphere gains full integration with Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007
LANSDALE, Pa. &amp; SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
Responding to strong demand from customers, ProtonMedia today announced the
integration of Microsoft Office SharePoint Server 2007 with the company`s
ProtoSphere virtual teaming and collaboration platform. This is the first time
Microsoft SharePoint services and content have been combined with a 3-D virtual
collaboration platform. By adding ProtonMedia`s SharePoint Media Carousel to
their ProtoSphere environment, companies extend their SharePoint investment and
processes while they cut travel costs, raise productivity, improve engagement,
and speed learning with ProtoSphere. The announcement was made in a post-keynote
address by ProtonMedia`s CEO Ron Burns at the 3D Training, Learning, and
Collaboration Expo (3D TLC), taking place September 23-24, 2009 in San Jose Ca. 

"Integration with Microsoft SharePoint is the one feature customers and
prospects have asked us for most, and we`re giving it to them today," says Ron
Burns, CEO of ProtonMedia. "We work with a lot of Fortune 500 companies,
including global life sciences and energy companies. They`re using SharePoint
within sales logistics, sales communications, learning-related apps, document
management, training, and so on. SharePoint is an increasingly crucial resource
that needs to be available in virtual collaboration scenarios. So we engaged
with several of our customers to specify exactly how ProtoSphere`s integration
with SharePoint should work. Several have already licensed and are planning
deployments. We think this is a crucial capability for the future of virtual
collaboration." 

Indeed, by delivering the SharePoint Media Carousel, ProtonMedia is connecting
ProtoSphere with one of the most widely used enterprise content and process
management platforms in business today. Over 17,000 companies and 100 million
people use SharePoint daily. A recent report by market researcher IDC found 61
percent of users surveyed were deploying SharePoint enterprise-wide. Another 28
percent using SharePoint in departments are expected to expand usage to the
enterprise within 12 months. And three-quarters of the Fortune 100 now have
SharePoint. Last year Microsoft SharePoint revenue exceeded $1 billion, "making
it the hottest selling server-side product ever for the company," according to
the New York Times. 

ProtoSphere`s SharePoint Media Carousel makes it easy for users to share and use
any media stored in or managed by Microsoft Office SharePoint Server. They can
securely bring live content from their company`s SharePoint infrastructure into
ProtoSphere`s 3-D world. Once there, the virtual teams can edit, modify, change,
and write the content back to their SharePoint infrastructure. This includes
content and metadata subject to workflow, process, and compliance rules defined
in and enforced by SharePoint. 

ProtonMedia representatives will be demonstrating ProtoSphere`s new SharePoint
Media Carousel at 3D TLC booth #36 today and tomorrow. Attendees can experience
first-hand the exciting new functionality that is brought to bear by integrating
one the enterprise`s most widely used platforms with ProtoSphere, the industry`s
most complete virtual collaboration environment. 

ProtonMedia`s SharePoint Media Carousel is an optional add-on for ProtoSphere.
It will be available in October for a one-time license fee.

&lt;p&gt;SAN JOSE, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The Department of Industrial Relations` Division of Occupational Safety &amp; Health
(DIR/DOSH) today awarded its 71st Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) STAR Flag
to IBM Research - Almaden in the Silicon Valley. IBM Research - Almaden performs
science and technology research focusing on fundamental science, nanotechnology,
spin physics and photoresists. 

"IBM Research - Almaden has achieved the coveted status of being a Cal/VPP STAR
member and for good reason," said DIR Director John C. Duncan. "Their commitment
to workplace safety goes above and beyond the basic requirements of providing
protection for their employees. This is evident in their below average injury
rate of .76 per 100 full time workers compared to the industry average of 1.8." 

Almaden is one of eight laboratories worldwide that make up IBM Research.
Scientists and engineers at the lab perform basic and applied research in
computer science, services, storage systems, physical sciences and materials
science and technology. There are 875 employees and close to half are
researchers and visiting staff. 

To enhance workplace safety, Amaden has prepared a comprehensive safety profile
for each laboratory work area that includes an assessment of possible hazards,
personal protective equipment needs, warning sign requirements, eyewashes
stations, emergency power switch off buttons, and other critical safeguards to
protect their employees. The lab profiles are reviewed and updated on a regular
basis by health and safety professionals. 

Environmentally conscious, Almaden uses a project management system to identify
potential environmental impacts of engineering projects and generate a checklist
requiring approval before proceeding. 

Training and recognition are top priorities at Almaden. Their Chemical
Distribution Center approves, receives and tracks all chemicals that are used at
their facilities. This system verifies that only highly trained and qualified
employees can use chemicals and also provides an effective way to track and
manage the chemical inventory to ensure proper storage and handling. 

Almaden`s "Thanks" Recognition Program is ahead of the industry by allowing both
managers and employees to recognize each other for safety and health and other
valid achievements. 

"Commitment to employee well-being is a fundamental value within IBM. I am proud
to accept the Cal/VPP STAR on behalf of the employees and managers at Almaden,
for their success in making us a recognized leader in occupational safety and
health in California," said Josephine Cheng, IBM Fellow and Vice President, IBM
Research - Almaden. "Ensuring the health, safety and well-being of our employees
is our highest priority." 

Candidates for the Cal/VPP STAR program are required to complete a rigorous
health and safety process. There are five key elements required to achieve
induction into the program including management commitment, worksite analysis,
hazard prevention and control, health and safety training, and continual
improvement. Applicants must submit documents to support the implementation of
the five Cal/VPP elements along with the last three years` average Injury &amp;
Illness Rates and Loss Work Day Incident rates. 

DIR/DOSH protects workers and the public from safety hazards and provides
consultation to employers. For more information about the Voluntary Protection

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The European Union's anti-trust chief wants to reach a deal with Microsoft Corp in a dispute over Web browsers before she leaves her post later this year, she said in an interview published on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told the International Herald Tribune she also wanted to close other important cases, including one involving wireless chip maker Qualcomm Inc, before the executive European Commission's term ends in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Referring to the long-standing battle with Microsoft over the U.S. company's former practice of bundling its Internet browser with its flagship Windows program, she said: "I would be pleased if we could close that dossier."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission has over the years imposed fines totaling 1.68 billion euros ($2.5 billion) on Microsoft for infringing EU antitrust rules. It could levy another hefty penalty if it were to rule against the company in the web browsers case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the Qualcomm case, the Commission is examining whether royalties and licensing terms are compatible with the EU's anti-trust laws.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kroes also said should would like to discuss anti-trust issues related to Google with her U.S. counterpart during a visit to Washington this week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Marcin Grajewski; Editing by David Holmes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.6754 Euro)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - A JPMorgan Chase  Co vehicle on Wednesday increased its cash offer for London-listed carbon offset aggregator EcoSecurities, garnering further support from shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon Acquisition Company said it had increased its recommended offer to 105 pence per share, valuing EcoSecurities at some 129 million pounds ($211 million), and bought a further 18.3 million EcoSecurities shares, or almost 15.5 percent of the company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The new offer compares with JP Morgan's previous bid of 100 pence and a rebuffed offer of 90 pence from rival bidder Pedro Moura Costa, the co-founder and former president of EcoSecurities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;EcoSecurities in a brief statement recommended shareholders accept the revised JP Morgan offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's slightly unusual to outbid yourself without the other party intervening but it's likely 105 pence was the price they had to pay on market to acquire the additional shares," said analyst Ken Rumph at Nomura Code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Analyst Gus Hochschild at Mirabaud, however, said the increased offer was in response to market expectations that Guanabara would make a counterbid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Costa's investment vehicle, Guanabara, said last week it was extending its offer for EcoSecurities and that it reserved the right to increase its offer further now that a bidding war had broken out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guanabara's advisors declined to comment on the JP Morgan statement and when contacted by Reuters on Wednesday, Costa said his position had not changed since last week's statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are in the process of due diligence to decide on a potential revised offer," he said via telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Including acceptances from shareholders owning 19.9 percent of the firm, JP Morgan now owns or has agreed to acquire 35.9 percent of EcoSecurities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The door is still open for Guanabara," Nomura's Rumph added. "Thirty-five percent still isn't more than fifty percent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At 0811 GMT, shares in AIM-listed EcoSecurities were up 2.4 percent at 105.6 pence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Victoria Bryan; Editing by Rhys Jones and Rupert Winchester)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=.6121 Pound)&lt;/p&gt;

NOVA YORK--(Business Wire)--
A Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), em parceria com a Changemakers, da Ashoka,
e o Centro internacional de pesquisa sobre a mulher (ICRW), lan&#231;ou hoje uma
iniciativa para ajudar as mulheres dos pa&#237;ses em desenvolvimento a realizarem o
seu potencial econ&#244;mico por meio da tecnologia e inova&#231;&#227;o. 

O programa, chamado Tecnologias para a melhoria do sustento econ&#244;mico da mulher,
vai ajudar a identificar e instalar tecnologias e inova&#231;&#245;es que possam melhorar
a qualidade de vida e habilitar as mulheres a participar mais integralmente das
atividades de gera&#231;&#227;o de renda. O programa faz parte da iniciativa Oportunidades
econ&#244;micas para as mulheres, da ExxonMobil (anteriormente Iniciativa para a
educa&#231;&#227;o de mulheres e meninas), que foi lan&#231;ada em 2005 e j&#225; investiu mais de
US$ 20 milh&#245;es em programas envolvendo mulheres de sessenta e quatro pa&#237;ses em
desenvolvimento. 

"Como empresa tecnol&#243;gica global, a ExxonMobil pode fazer uma contribui&#231;&#227;o
duradoura, ajudando a identificar e instalar novas tecnologias que melhorem e
fortale&#231;am o sustento econ&#244;mico das mulheres", disse Rex W. Tillerson,
presidente e diretor executivo. "Essa &#225;rea de foco &#233; condizente com nossa
experi&#234;ncia e a convic&#231;&#227;o de que a tecnologia e a inova&#231;&#227;o s&#227;o fundamentais para
tratar diversos dos maiores desafios do mundo." 

A nova iniciativa da ExxonMobil foi anunciada pelo ex-presidente Bill Clinton,
na reuni&#227;o anual da Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), realizada em Nova York. A
ExxonMobil est&#225; copatrocinando a primeira programa&#231;&#227;o especial da CGI voltada
para investimentos que beneficiem mulheres e meninas. Tillerson participou de um
painel durante a sess&#227;o plen&#225;ria "Investindo em mulheres e meninas". 

"Os investimentos da ExxonMobil nessa &#225;rea t&#234;m por objetivo aumentar as
oportunidades para as mulheres nos pa&#237;ses em desenvolvimento, para melhorar suas
perspectivas econ&#244;micas e permitir que elas sejam e se mantenham l&#237;deres e
empreendedoras bem-sucedidas", disse Tillerson. "Estamos felizes por poder
apoiar o novo foco da Clinton Global Initiative de investir nas mulheres, que
reflete o crescente reconhecimento mundial do papel fundamental das mulheres na
produ&#231;&#227;o de altos n&#237;veis de retorno para o desenvolvimento econ&#244;mico e social." 

O compromisso de US$ 1,5 milh&#227;o no primeiro ano do programa Tecnologias para a
melhoria do sustento econ&#244;mico da mulher incluir&#225; a pesquisa, publica&#231;&#227;o e
dissemina&#231;&#227;o de uma nota t&#233;cnica pelo Centro internacional de pesquisa sobre a
mulher em &#225;reas onde a inova&#231;&#227;o tecnol&#243;gica pode impulsionar a produtividade
econ&#244;mica das mulheres. 

Completando essa pesquisa inovadora, haver&#225; um programa global, em parceria com
a plataforma Changemakers, da Ashoka, para identificar as inova&#231;&#245;es mais
promissoras que podem ter o maior impacto sobre as mulheres e para determinar a
melhor maneira de introduzi-las no mercado. As inova&#231;&#245;es podem cobrir desde
tecnologias e equipamentos at&#233; a diminui&#231;&#227;o do fardo das tarefas dom&#233;sticas,
como cozinhar, carregar &#225;gua ou fazer a colheita - e tecnologias para ajudar as
mulheres a se tornar mais eficientes nas suas atividades de gera&#231;&#227;o de renda. 

Bill Drayton, fundador e diretor executivo da Ashoka, disse que a organiza&#231;&#227;o
est&#225; ansiosa por trabalhar com a ExxonMobil, para encontrar e ajudar a instalar
as inova&#231;&#245;es mais promissoras com maior impacto sobre as mulheres. 

"J&#225; vimos o que as pessoas podem fazer para projetar mudan&#231;as nas suas
comunidades", disse Drayton. "Essa busca colaborativa vai nos ajudar a ver como
as inova&#231;&#245;es tecnol&#243;gicas para as mulheres podem fazer parte da solu&#231;&#227;o do
problema da pobreza global." 

"Estamos entusiasmados com nosso envolvimento nesse esfor&#231;o de vanguarda para
incentivar o acesso das mulheres &#224;s tecnologias, j&#225; que isso pode lhes oferecer

NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), in partnership with Ashoka`s Changemakers
and the International Center for Research on Women (ICRW), today introduced an
initiative to help women in developing countries fulfill their economic
potential through technology and innovation. 

The program, called Technologies to Improve Women`s Economic Livelihoods, will
help identify and deploy technologies and innovations that can improve quality
of life and enable women to participate more fully in income-generating
activities. The program is part of ExxonMobil`s Women`s Economic Opportunity
Initiative (previously Educating Women and Girls Initiative), which was launched
in 2005 and has invested more than $20 million in programs that have involved
women from 64 developing countries. 

"As a global technology company, ExxonMobil can make a lasting contribution by
helping to identify and deploy new technologies to improve and strengthen the
economic livelihoods of women," said Rex W. Tillerson, chairman and chief
executive officer. "This focus area is consistent with our own belief and
experience that technology and innovation are critical to addressing many of the
world`s major challenges." 

ExxonMobil`s new initiative was announced by former President Bill Clinton at
the Clinton Global Initiative`s annual meeting in New York. ExxonMobil is
co-sponsoring the first-ever CGI special programming focused on investing in
girls and women. Tillerson participated as a panelist during a plenary session
"Investing in Girls and Women." 

"ExxonMobil`s investments in this area aim to increase opportunities for women
in developing countries to improve their economic prospects and become and
remain successful business leaders and entrepreneurs," said Tillerson. "We are
pleased to support the Clinton Global Initiative`s new focus on investing in
women, which reflects the world`s growing recognition of the critical role of
women in delivering high returns for economic and social development." 

The $1.5 million first-year commitment of the Technologies to Improve Women`s
Economic Livelihoods program will involve the research, publication and
dissemination of a white paper by the International Center for Research on Women
on areas where technological innovation can advance women`s economic
productivity. 

Complementary to this ground-breaking research will be a global program, in
partnership with Ashoka`s Changemakers, to identify the most promising
innovations that can have the greatest impact for women and to determine how
best to bring them into the market. Innovations could range from technologies
and equipment to reduce the burden of household tasks -- such as cooking, water
collection or crop harvesting -- to technologies to assist women in becoming
more efficient in their income-generating activities. 

Bill Drayton, founder and chief executive officer of Ashoka, said the
organization is looking forward to working with ExxonMobil to find and help
deploy the most promising innovations that will have the greatest impact on
women. 

"We have seen what individuals can do to engineer change in their communities,"
said Drayton. "This collaborative search will help us see how technology
innovations for women can be part of the solution to global poverty." 

"We are excited to be involved in this cutting-edge effort to spur women`s
access to technologies as this could provide them with more opportunities to be
economically productive," said Geeta Rao Gupta, ICRW president. "This effort
will address a critical barrier to women`s economic participation and have a
significant impact on boosting women`s economic activity and productivity."

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Inc today announced that it has earned a score of 100 - the highest
possible - in the 2010 Corporate Equality Index, which evaluates U.S.-based
businesses on their treatment of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT)
employees, investors and consumers. 

The Corporate Equality Index - published annually by the Human Rights Campaign
Foundation (HRCF), the largest LGBT advocacy organization in the United States -
rates businesses using a scale of 0-100. For the 2010 edition, 590 businesses
were rated, and the average rating was 86. Pfizer was the first pharmaceutical
company to score 100 and has achieved a 100 rating for six consecutive years. 

"Pfizer operates in just about every nation with a flag and a seat in the United
Nations," said Pfizer Chief Diversity Officer Karen Boykin-Towns. "Our corporate
culture is rich in unique perspectives from what may be the world`s most diverse
colleague population. Our goal now is to broaden our action beyond the
traditional talent perspective and use our remarkable diversity to transform the
ways we bring better health to more of the world`s people." 

Pfizer was recognized both for its diversity and inclusion platform, which
includes sexual orientation and gender identity, and for its equal opportunity
policy, which bars discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, gender
identity or gender expression. The company also offers benefits coverage for
same-sex domestic partners where legally permissible, donates resources to LGBT
community- and health-related organizations, and sponsors various site-based
LGBT colleague resource groups. 

Employers ranked in the Corporate Equality Index are chosen from Fortune
magazine`s 1,000 largest publicly-traded businesses; Forbes magazine`s 200
largest privately-owned firms; and American Lawyer magazine`s top 200
revenue-grossing law firms. All ranked employers must be based in the United
States and have 500 or more full-time employees. 

"Even in the most challenging economy, leading employers are forging ahead of
federal and state law to recruit and retain a diverse workforce - regardless of
employees` sexual orientation and gender identity or expression," said Joe
Solmonese, president of the Human Rights Campaign. "These [top-rated
businesses], and all employers actively working to improve their rating, set an
example for all U.S. employers, including the federal government." 

Pfizer Inc: Working together for a healthier world

Founded in 1849, Pfizer is the world's premier biopharmaceutical company taking
new approaches to better health. We discover, develop, manufacture and deliver

&lt;p&gt;  RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NC, Sep 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Lenovo (HKSE: 0992) today announced that Pennsylvania Virtual Charter
School (PAVCS), a K-12 public cyber charter school in Norristown, Pa.,
deployed nearly 4,000 ThinkPad R500 laptops to equip its students with
the technology needed to complete a high quality home-based public
education.

    The school has also entered into a partnership with IBM Global Financing,
the lending and leasing business segment of IBM (NYSE: IBM) to support a
regular, environmentally responsible technology refresh strategy through
leasing.

    "The Pennsylvania Virtual Charter School views technology as a powerful
tool to support an effective 21st century education, and after exhaustive
research chose the ThinkPad R500 for our students," said Joanne Barnett,
Pennsylvania Virtual Charter School Chief Executive Officer. "As the
premiere provider of public cyber education in Pennsylvania we embrace
innovation and equip our students with the instruments they need to
succeed. We believe Lenovo offers the most innovative and affordable
laptops for education, and we are excited to have our student use them."

    PAVCS administrators selected the ThinkPad laptops for their exceptional
reputation, high quality and durability. PAVCS specifically chose the
ThinkPad R500 laptop for its affordability and performance. This is the
school's first purchase of PCs enabling it to provide better service and
consistency to its students. The school previously leased computers from
its curriculum provider. The charter school also has a plan in place to
access the latest Lenovo PC technology on a regular schedule. Leveraging
IBM Global Financing's flexible leasing and technology asset recovery
services will allow the school to upgrade older PCs every three years and
to return used PCs for either reuse or recycling.

    For students, the ThinkPad R500 laptop's large 15.4 inch high-resolution
widescreen display makes it easy to work on assignments and class
presentations. Equipped with an internal roll cage and air-bag like
protection system, the laptop helps protect data from the bumps and
bruises that frequently happen in a student environment. Along with the
PCs, the school also provides each of its students with a printer and all
curriculum materials. PAVCS purchased the ThinkPad laptops from IT Nest
Inc., a Lenovo business partner.

&lt;p&gt;  MONTREAL, Sep 23 (MARKET WIRE) -- 
Superclick, Inc. (OTCBB: SPCK), a technology leader in IP infrastructure
solutions to the hospitality industry, announced that its gateway has
been selected by IBM as a core technology for its Hotel of the Future
program on a worldwide basis and the deployment of InterContinental Hotel
Group's Hotel in a Box(TM) initiative.

    A modern hotel is more than a marvel of architecture, design, decor and
comfort. It is also a sophisticated technological investment requiring the
most up-to-date IT systems for management, communications, security and
entertainment. The current method for acquiring the needed technologies is
a complex effort of discovering what is needed, finding reputable
providers, purchasing the correct solution components, putting them
together and hoping they work harmoniously, training staff, and supporting
the solution with a myriad of different phone numbers. It is like buying a
car by selecting the engine from one provider, the seats from another, the
body from a third, and hoping they all work together.

    IBM's Hotel of the Future program allows hotel brand owners to secure a
broad suite of IBM-standardized IT services essential to providing
differentiated and world-class guest service and support, including
property management systems, telecommunications, high-speed Internet
access and 24x7 customer support, call accounting, voice messaging and
door lock systems. IBM has selected technology partners for this program
which can be most effectively integrated into hotels in a cost-conscious
manner. Hoteliers and brand owners are left with the additional benefit
of fewer technology vendor contracts to manage, and the services a
deployed and supported by a single vendor, IBM.

    Sandro Natale, Superclick's CEO, commented that, "Simplifying the
technology infrastructure development and management process is an
important advance in the industry and we are pleased to have been selected
by IBM as the core gateway technology for the IP infrastructure management
of its Hotel of the Future Program, as well as for the rollout in IHG's
Hotel in a Box initiative. This is a great validation of our efforts to
deliver a superior product with support to the hospitality marketplace."

    According to Raul Arce, IBM's Vice President of Travel &amp; Transportation,
the Hotel of the Future program will make hotel owners' lives easier and
reduce costs because they will require fewer technology consultants.
Owners can streamline their procurement, consolidate applications on a
single server, reduce personnel requirements and even power consumption.
"We selected Superclick's gateway for our Hotel of the Future program
because it is truly best-in-class providing greater network reliability,
better IP infrastructure management with the ability to reduce
bottlenecks and prioritize network traffic. The Internet gateway is a
core and critical piece of our technology solution to the hospitality
industry and we think Superclick is a great fit for us."

&lt;p&gt;Collaboration Includes Wireless and Internet Connectivity, PCs for Classrooms,
Teacher Training, ICT Skills Training, Digital Content and a School Technology
Innovation Center
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Today at the Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting, Cisco, Intel Corp.,
Microsoft Corp., the government of Kenya and the U.S. Agency for International
Development (USAID) announced a joint commitment to improve education in Kenya.
Launched in collaboration with Kenya`s Ministry of Education, the Accelerating
21st Century Education (ACE) project aims to improve the quality of primary and
secondary education through the effective use of information and communications
technology (ICT). 

The parties are working together to develop a best-in-class model for deploying
ICT in education. Reflecting a combined commitment valued at more than US$9
million, ACE will create "one-to-one e-learning" classrooms in 60 focus schools
across Kenya. One-to-one e-learning, a model in which every student has access
to a computer, helps foster an environment where young people can develop skills
such as problem solving and critical thinking. 

ACE will deploy more than 6,000 networked computers for student and teacher use;
train approximately 7,000 teachers to effectively integrate technology in the
classroom; train technical support staff at each school to maintain the
technology; deploy a wireless infrastructure within the schools; provide access
to digital educational content; and develop the local ICT industry in Kenya to
promote economic development and sustainability. 

In addition, Cisco, Intel and Microsoft will work together to establish a School
Technology Innovation Center (STIC) in Nairobi - a model that has been promoted
in other countries through the Microsoft Partners in Learning Program. The
center will be dedicated to research on innovative emerging technology solutions
and serve as a repository and showcase for best-known methods of teaching,
learning and educational technology. 

"ACE ties in with our mission to increase access to education, improve the
quality of education and raise school enrollment rates for children from
marginalized areas of East Africa," said USAID Kenya Mission Director Erna
Kerst. "We hope this collaboration will encourage more Kenyan children to
complete school, improve teacher training practices and enhance professional
development for teachers and school administrators with support from USAID." 

USAID works closely with the government of Kenya on educational programs aimed
at ensuring that more Kenyan children enroll in school, stay in school and
receive a high-quality education that equips them with the knowledge and skills
they need to succeed in the 21st-century economy. These education programs
support more than 400,000 children from the most marginalized communities -
including those orphaned by the HIV/AIDS pandemic - as well as systemic changes
in teacher training colleges and key educational institutions. 

Commitment to Action Takes Holistic Approach to ICT in Education

The ACE project focuses on 40 secondary schools and 20 primary schools across
Kenya. It will deploy 6,000 student personal computers (PCs), 120 teacher
laptops, 60 servers and the supporting wireless infrastructure to establish two
e-learning classrooms at each school. 

The project will also train 2,000 teachers at the schools, as well as 5,000
pre-service teachers at teacher training colleges in Kenya. In addition, ACE
will offer education leadership forums to help lead teachers at the
participating schools define a strategy for creating 21st-century learning
environments. Training will be provided through the Intel Teach Program and the
Microsoft Partners in Learning Program, which offer proven ways to integrate
technology into the curriculum for enhanced classroom learning. 

To promote a sustainable implementation of ICT in education, two instructors and
one network administrator at each of the 60 schools will receive networking and
IT training through the Cisco Networking Academy. The Networking Academy
collaborates with educational institutions, governments and community-based
organizations to provide students around the world with foundational ICT skills
along with career skills such as problem solving, collaboration and critical
thinking for increased access to career and economic opportunities. 

"Collaboration among public and private-sector organizations can significantly
enhance the quality of education for students around the world and strengthen
the communities where they live," said Tae Yoo, senior vice president, Corporate
Affairs, Cisco. "By taking a holistic approach to education that includes the
effective integration of ICT, the government of Kenya in cooperation with Cisco,
Intel, Microsoft and USAID is taking a bold step forward to create a sustainable
model of education reform and equip students with the skills they need to be
successful in the 21st-century." 

ACE aligns closely with the goals of Kenya`s Ministry of Education, which
recently digitized its national curriculum. The project will provide digital
content to help deploy the revamped curriculum, with an initial focus on math
and science subjects for primary grades 4-6 and for the first two years of
secondary education. As part of this effort, Intel and the Ministry will
collaborate on developing localized content for the Intel skoool Learning and
Teaching Technology, an interactive Internet resource for learning math and
science. Microsoft is also working with the Ministry to develop a new education
portal where teachers can access e-mail and online educational content. 

"By mobilizing our combined resources, we can help Kenya`s Ministry of Education
put the implementation of its National ICT Strategy for Education on the fast
track," said Lila Ibrahim, general manager of the Emerging Markets Platform
Group at Intel. "We believe that public-private collaborations like the ACE
project are the most powerful means to invest in 21st-century learning and at
the same time can help to stimulate the local economy." 

Extending the Benefits of ICT in Education Investments

To encourage the sharing of knowledge related to tested best uses of technology
in education, all of the key practices and methods learned from ACE will be
captured in a School Technology Innovation Center (STIC) that Cisco, Intel and
Microsoft have committed to establish in Nairobi. 

Like STICs in other countries, the Kenya center will serve as a hub where
education leaders and teachers from the region can access the latest information
on technology solutions that are proven to enhance innovative teaching and
learning, thus improving the skills needed by students to thrive in the
21st-century. Center visitors will also be able to view research on innovative
educational technology solutions, witness technology demos, participate in
trainings, and learn from best-practice models and outcomes. 

"Providing technology access and IT skills to students is a cornerstone for
future innovation, economic growth and individual opportunity in the competitive
global marketplace," said Linda Zecher, corporate vice president of Worldwide
Public Sector at Microsoft. "By combining the experience and resources of public
and private sector partners in a holistic way, the ACE project will help the
Ministry of Education further its efforts to transform learning and increase
opportunity for all of Kenya`s students." 

To demonstrate the benefits of technology in the classroom, the STIC will
feature 20 Intel-powered classmate PCs, networked via Cisco wireless
infrastructure, and the latest software offerings from Microsoft, including the
new Windows 7 operating system. The classmate PC is an affordable,
full-featured, compact and rugged student laptop designed to promote interactive
and collaborative learning among students and teachers. The STIC will also
feature other technology products that are well-suited to teaching and learning.


Over the course of three years, the ACE project is expected to directly benefit
an estimated 39,000 students and 7,000 teachers through improved educational
infrastructure and training. Kenya`s Ministry of Education estimates that an
additional 300,000 people will benefit indirectly from the STIC and other
aspects of knowledge sharing.

&lt;p&gt;Visa Brings Personal Finance Education to Football Fans Worldwide with Free
FIFA-Themed Video Game
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) announced at the Clinton Global Initiative (CGI) Conference
today that it is launching a new FIFA World Cup branded educational video game
as the centerpiece of a commitment to reach 20 million people worldwide with
financial literacy information by May 1, 2013. Last year at CGI, Visa pledged to
reach 10 million people with personal finance education within five years, and
today the company announced its ambitious plan to double that goal. 

To reach this milestone, Visa unveiled an innovative new approach for helping
children and adults learn about personal finance: Financial Football - a free
video game that combines the world's most popular sport with an award-winning
financial literacy curriculum. 

A FIFA Partner since 2007, Visa will roll out its Financial Football game (known
as Financial Soccer in the U.S.) in over 12 countries in the months leading up
to the 2010 FIFA World Cup. The game, which went live in Brazil on September 15,
is now available for U.S. players at www.financialfootball.com and
www.financialsoccer.com. Financial Football is the latest component of Visa`s
decade-long commitment to financial literacy which has helped millions of people
worldwide learn how to manage their money wisely. 

"We believe one of the most important tools to spur financial inclusion is not a
product - it is knowledge," said Joseph W. Saunders, Chairman and Chief
Executive Officer of Visa Inc. "We are pleased to be joining forces with FIFA to
harness Visa`s personal finance expertise and the popularity of the FIFA World
Cup to help people worldwide learn how to manage their money successfully." 

"Supporting education is part of FIFA`s long-standing commitment to promoting
social development through football," said FIFA Secretary General J&#233;r&#244;me Valcke.
"Visa`s Financial Football channels the passion for football and helps make
learning about money management entertaining. This learning tool will be a
valuable resource for community-based organizations and their work with
youngsters." 

As part of the launch of Financial Football, Saunders rang the opening bell of
the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) today. Saunders was joined at the bell
ringing by NYSE Euronext CEO Duncan Niederauer, U.S. national team captain
Landon Donovan of the Los Angeles Galaxy and World Cup veteran Brian McBride of
the Chicago Fire. Before the bell ringing, copies of an NYSE-themed version of
Financial Football were distributed to each trader on the exchange floor. The
NYSE will also use the game as part of its ongoing financial literacy outreach
with teachers across the country. 

"NYSE Euronext is proud to join with Visa in promoting financial literacy to
America's youth," said Duncan Niederauer, CEO, NYSE Euronext. "Visa and NYSE
Euronext share a strong commitment to financial literacy and to reaching young
people in innovative and interesting ways. I applaud Visa's initiative and
welcome this opportunity, one of many that we support, to increase the public's
awareness and understanding of finance and our capital markets." 

Following the bell ringing, Visa hosted a Financial Football clinic with
Donovan, McBride and Mexican soccer legend Jorge Campos at Martin Luther King
Jr. High School in Manhattan to give students a preview of the game and teach
them the fundamentals of money management. 

Financial Football

Financial Football challenges players to answer fast-paced, multiple-choice
money management questions correctly to advance down the field for a chance to
score a goal. Financial Football offers single player and head-to-head game play
options and is being translated into a dozen different languages. This free game
features three difficulty levels - geared to children, teens and adults - and
has companion lesson modules for classroom use. Players learn key concepts about
saving, responsible spending, budgeting, and the wise use of credit. 

"It would have been great to learn more about personal finance when I was in
school," said Donovan. "Fortunately, Financial Football provides today`s
students with the opportunity and tools to learn about the financial world in
ways that were never available to me when I was younger." 

"Money management is a crucial life skill that is essential for success," said
Campos. "Financial Football is a great way to learn those skills." 

"Knowing how to manage your money will let you take control of your financial
future," said McBride. "Financial Football is an excellent way to learn those
money management skills, all while getting to play a great game."

Practical Money Skills for Life

Financial Football is part of Practical Money Skills for Life, Visa`s free,
award-winning, financial education program. The program contains comprehensive
money management resources and lesson plans tailored for use at home and in the
classroom. 

Financial Football comes on the heels of Visa`s financial literacy video game
developed with the NFL and NFL PLAYERS. That game has been distributed by 23
state governments to every public high school in those states.

&lt;p&gt;BERLIN (Reuters) - Social Democrat (SPD) Frank-Walter Steinmeier is running against conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel in Germany's federal election, which is scheduled for Sunday. Below are some facts about Steinmeier:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;-- A political unknown at the national level when he was appointed foreign minister in 2005, the 53-year old Steinmeier quickly emerged as one of Germany's most popular politicians. He took over the symbolic post of vice-chancellor in November 2007 and was named the Social Democrat (SPD) candidate for chancellor in September 2008.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Chief of staff to former SPD Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder from 1999 to 2005, Steinmeier has shown himself to be an effective behind-the-scenes mediator and fixer, but his experience as a politician is limited. He has never been elected to office, lacks campaigning experience and has not shown the rhetorical skills and charisma of his mentor Schroeder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Steinmeier is seen as a moderate within the SPD. He has defended Schroeder's controversial "Agenda 2010" economic reforms against left-wing members of his party but supports traditional SPD positions on phasing out nuclear power, extending the minimum wage and raising taxes on the most wealthy Germans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- As foreign minister, Steinmeier has taken issue with Merkel's open criticism of human rights violations in countries like China and Russia. Unlike Merkel, he also favors Turkish entry into the European Union. But he has worked harmoniously with her on a range of other foreign policy issues, from keeping German troops in Afghanistan, to confronting Iran over its nuclear program and negotiating binding goals to combat climate change.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-- Born in Detmold, western Germany in 1956, the white-haired, bespectacled Steinmeier studied law and political science at Giessen University. He is married and has one daughter. He likes jazz and is an avid football fan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Writing by Noah Barkin)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;PHOENIX--(Business Wire)--
A recent licensing agreement between Microsoft Corp. and SmarterTools Inc.
extends Microsoft`s patented Exchange ActiveSync technology to more than 15
million end users through the latest version of the SmarterMail mail server. The
agreement provides a patent license to SmarterTools for this industry-leading
technology and allows Microsoft to expand its reach to include SmarterTools`
robust customer base, which encompasses hosting/service providers, enterprises,
and small to medium sized businesses. 

"We are pleased to work with SmarterTools to provide Microsoft Exchange
ActiveSync to SmarterMail users," said David Kaefer, general manager of
intellectual property licensing at Microsoft. "This technology is being sought
out by our partners and competitors alike because it enhances their value
proposition to their customers, and we believe that to be a testament to the
innovation taking place at Microsoft." 

Microsoft has been licensing the Exchange ActiveSync protocol for mobile devices
since 2003, and SmarterTools joins a growing number of companies licensing the
Exchange ActiveSync patents for implementation on a server. 

"With the growing number of mobile manufacturers adding Microsoft Exchange
ActiveSync compatibility to their devices, the technology is the standard for
mobile synchronization and communication," said Tim Uzzanti, CEO of
SmarterTools. "Mobile devices are becoming the primary device for communication
and the ability to accept a calendar event, read email immediately, and track
tasks from a mobile device while syncing with the server is a necessity. The
addition of Exchange ActiveSync to the SmarterMail mail server is part of our
continuing commitment to provide individuals and businesses the tools necessary
to compete in today`s marketplace." 

Under the terms of the patent licensing agreement, SmarterMail 6.x users have
the ability to synchronize emails, calendars, contacts, and notes between mobile
devices in real time using Exchange ActiveSync`s Direct Push technology. 

SmarterTools has packaged the SmarterMail 6.x Exchange ActiveSync add-on
differently than other providers, resulting in a yearly subscription priced well
below competitive solutions. In addition, SmarterTools allows customers to add
Exchange ActiveSync to only the mailboxes that need the technology, making
adoption of the add-on easy and affordable for small to medium sized businesses
(SMBs) and the ISP/hosting industry. 

Scalable and easy to manage, SmarterMail 6.x features a rich, Webmail interface;
reporting; events/notifications; throttling; message archiving; intrusion
detection/prevention; advanced synchronization with Microsoft Outlook;
over-the-air support for BlackBerry, iPhone, and Windows Mobile devices; and
optional add-ons for Exchange ActiveSync and Commtouch Antispam. Enhanced
antispam, antivirus, and security features provide superior protection
out-of-the-box. 

SmarterMail is available at the SmarterTools Web site and through authorized
resellers.

&lt;p&gt; * First charge card from any Visa/MasterCard issuer&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Company also launches credit cards for small business&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 23 (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N),
the second-largest U.S. bank, launched a charge card for small
businesses on Wednesday, entering a market long dominated by
American Express Co (AXP.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In addition, the bank launched three new credit cards for
small businesses -- offering rewards, cash back and large
credit limits. The new cards come at a time when small
businesses have experienced great difficulty obtaining new
credit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Unlike credit cards, charge cards have to be paid in full
at the end of every month, reducing the risk of defaults at a
moment when credit card losses are at record highs in the
United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new charge card, called Ink Bold, is the first charge
card from JPMorgan Chase or from any other Visa Inc (V.N) or
MasterCard Inc (MA.N) issuer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We really believe we are starting to see a stabilization
point in the economy, and there are going to be small-business
owners that are going to be leading the U.S. out of this
recession," Richard Quigley, president of Chase business cards,
a division of JPMorgan Chase, said in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Quigley said small businesses each year spend almost $5
trillion on non-payroll expenses in the United States, adding
that 70 percent of those expenses were paid with checks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move could help JPMorgan diversify its card business,
in a time when credit losses and a new law limiting interest
rates and fees are denting the division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon has estimated the
bank's credit card business will not be profitable until 2011.
In addition, Chase has forecast the new credit card legislation
that will enter into effect in February could trim revenue by
$500 million per year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The charge card has no fee for the first year but carries a
fee of $95 thereafter. The new credit cards for small
businesses have no annual fee the first year and cost up to $60
thereafter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In recent months, American Express, the largest U.S. credit
card company by sales volume, has boosted its charge card
business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan currently is the biggest issuer of Visa branded
credit cards and the second-largest issuer of MasterCard
branded credit cards.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has purchased assets in a company that specializes in parallel computing, a function used mainly in supercomputing that Microsoft aims to develop for a broader audience, the company said Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has acquired the technology assets of Interactive Supercomputing (ISC), a company that specializes in desktop tools for parallel computing, Microsoft said in a blog post. Parallel computing refers to the execution of a task on multiple process cores and threads simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will explain in coming months how it plans to integrate the company's technologies into its own products, it said. The CEO and other staff from ISC will join Microsoft, it said. It did not give the price of the purchase, which was announced by its server division.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft said ISC will no longer sell its main product, a software platform that helps users work with parallel setups for complex computations on array or matrix-based data. But Microsoft will provide support for current users until the end of next year or until their contracts expire, it said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has said it and partners are working to develop software architecture and applications to correspond with parallel computing hardware.&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

94 Bank Failures So Far in '94

Hamilton, Ohio-based First Financial Bank (FFBC) will assume all of the deposits
of the two banks. So there will be no losses to any depositor. The FDIC and
First Financial Bank reached a loss-share agreement covering about $2.5 billion
of the two banks' combined assets. 

In the second quarter of 2009, the number of banks on the FDIC's list of problem
institutions grew to 416 from 305 in the first quarter. This is the highest
since the savings and loan crisis in 1994. Increasing loan losses on commercial
real estate are expected to cause more bank failures in the next few years. The
FDIC anticipates the bank failures to cost about $70 billion over the next five
years. 

Recently, the FDIC allowed private investors to buy failed financial
institutions. The regulator`s board voted to reduce the cash that private equity
funds must maintain in banks they acquire. 

The FDIC is considering borrowing money from the government to replenish the
deposit insurance fund as it has slipped to 0.22% of insured deposits, below the
mandated minimum of 1.15%. The agency has already raised $5.6 billion through an
added assessment. 

The failure of Washington Mutual last year is the largest bank failure in U.S.
history. It was acquired by JP Morgan Chase (JPM). The other major acquirers of
failed institutions since 2008 include Fifth Third Bancorp (FITB), U.S. Bancorp
(USB), Zions Bancorp (ZION), SunTrust Banks (STI), and several others.

  (Adds detail, clarifies relationship with Goldman Sachs Gao

Goldman Sachs. He will be working closely with Goldman's China
partner, Gao Hua Securities, a domestic Chinese securities
brokerage.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs Gao Hua Securities is the investment banking
joint venture between Goldman Sachs and Gao Hua. Goldman's
investment banking franchise in China has seen less success
than its other groups across the region. Zhang will focus his
attention on the securities side of the business.

&lt;p&gt; * Agrees to buy further 18.3 million EcoSecurities shares&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * EcoSecurities shares rise 2.8 percent

 (Adds analyst, Guanabara, shares)  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Sept 23 (Reuters) - A JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N)
vehicle on Wednesday increased its cash offer for London-listed
carbon offset aggregator EcoSecurities ECO.L, garnering
further support from shareholders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Carbon Acquisition Company said it had increased its
recommended offer to 105 pence per share, valuing EcoSecurities
at some 129 million pounds ($211 million), and bought a further
18.3 million EcoSecurities shares, or almost 15.5 percent of the
company.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The new offer compares with JP Morgan's previous bid of 100
pence and a rebuffed offer of 90 pence from rival bidder Pedro
Moura Costa, the co-founder and former president of
EcoSecurities. [ID:nLE634707]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; EcoSecurities in a brief statement recommended shareholders
accept the revised JP Morgan offer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It's slightly unusual to outbid yourself without the other
party intervening but it's likely 105 pence was the price they
had to pay on market to acquire the additional shares," said
analyst Ken Rumph at Nomura Code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Analyst Gus Hochschild at Mirabaud, however, said the
increased offer was in response to market expectations that
Guanabara would make a counterbid.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Costa's investment vehicle, Guanabara, said last week it was
extending its offer for EcoSecurities and that it reserved the
right to increase its offer further now that a bidding war had
broken out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Guanabara's advisors declined to comment on the JP Morgan
statement and when contacted by Reuters on Wednesday, Costa said
his position had not changed since last week's statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are in the process of due diligence to decide on a
potential revised offer," he said via telephone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Including acceptances from shareholders owning 19.9 percent
of the firm, JP Morgan now owns or has agreed to acquire 35.9
percent of EcoSecurities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The door is still open for Guanabara," Nomura's Rumph
added. "Thirty-five percent still isn't more than fifty
percent."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 0811 GMT, shares in AIM-listed EcoSecurities were up 2.4
percent at 105.6 pence.

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, Sept 23 (Reuters) - The European Union's
anti-trust chief wants to reach a deal with Microsoft Corp
(MSFT.O) in a dispute over web browsers before she leaves her
post later this year, she said in an interview published on
Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; EU Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes told the
International Herald Tribune she also wanted to close other
important cases, including one involving wireless chip maker
Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O), before the executive European
Commission's term ends in November.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Referring to the long-standing battle with Microsoft over
the U.S. company's former practice of bundling its Internet
browser with its flagship Windows programme, she said: "I would
be pleased if we could close that dossier." &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission has over the years imposed fines totalling

&lt;p&gt;HONG KONG (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs' (GS.N) $334 million investment in Geely Automobile Holdings (0175.HK) will boost the Chinese automaker's global ambitions, including a potential bid by its parent for Ford's (F.N) Volvo brand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shares in Hong Kong-listed Geely spiked 26 percent on Wednesday after the company said it would issue convertible bonds and warrants to an affiliate of Goldman and will use proceeds for capital expenditure, working capital and potential acquisitions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The addition of Goldman as a major investor could help China's 10th-largest automaker achieve its aspirations to secure global brands and technology from struggling Western rivals, said Yi Junfeng, an analyst with Changjiang Securities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's a wise move for Geely as it can use the money to build up capacity and free up capital for its parent, which has publicly announced its interest in Volvo," said Yi.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier this month, Geely said its parent, Geely Group Holdings Co, planned to bid for Sweden's Volvo which media reports have valued at close to $2 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geely Group has also approached Magna International MGa.TO about a potential production partnership on General Motors' GM.UL European brand Opel, a source familiar with the matter told Reuters last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For Goldman, which could end up with 15.1 percent of Geely if it fully converts the bonds and warrants, the investment will give it exposure to China's fast growing auto market -- the world's largest.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope Goldman can help us to improve our operating efficiency, and that Goldman's network will help in our long-term development," said Geely Executive Director Lawrence Ang at a company shareholder meeting for an unrelated matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Geely's shares were suspended last week pending announcement of the convertible bond offer.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today warned Internet Explorer (IE) users that they could double their security woes if they installed and used Google Chrome Frame, the plug-in that provides better JavaScript performance and adds support for HTML 5 to Microsoft's browser.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"It's not necessarily that plug-ins aren't or can't be secure, but that running a browser within a browser doubles the potential attack surface in a way that we don't see is particularly helpful," said Amy Bazdukas, Microsoft's general manager for IE.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bazdukas also said that by running Chrome Frame, Internet Explorer 8 (IE8) users were unwittingly discarding all the private browsing protections that Microsoft built into its newest browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Chrome Frame breaks the privacy model of IE," she claimed. "Users are not going to be able to use IE's privacy features, something that's not made apparent to users. They're essentially circumvented."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bazdukas also maintained that IE8's browser history deletion feature is crippled by Chrome Frame; users who decide to erase the history may think it's working, but it's not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a statement earlier today, Microsoft said using Chrome Frame is not "a risk we would recommend our friends and families take." Bazdukas, however, got more specific.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We're not saying that there's a specific security vulnerability in Chrome Frame, but the concern that plug-ins in general have had regarding security issues adds a new potential threat when Chrome Frame is used. Users have told us that they're looking for a better and safer browser, and we can't see how [using Chrome Frame] will deliver that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Released Tuesday, Chrome Frame lets IE utilize the Chrome browser's WebKit rendering engine, as well as its high-performance V8 JavaScript engine. Google pitched the plug-in as a way to instantly improve the performance of the notoriously slow IE , and as a way for Web developers to support standards IE can't handle, including HTML 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to benchmark tests conducted by Computerworld , IE8 with Chrome Frame zips through JavaScript nearly 10 times faster than does IE8 on its own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra speed and HTML 5 support are necessary, said Google, if IE users are to run advanced Web applications such as Google Wave , a collaboration and communications tool that Google launched in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bazdukas tied Google's release of Chrome Frame to its rival's desire to promote Wave, but at the expense of IE. "Chrome Fame is all about supporting the impending release of Google Wave," she argued.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More irritating to Microsoft, though, is that Google is trying to profit from IE's position as the world's leading browser. "Google hasn't been able to make an impact on market share with Chrome," said Bazdukas, "and so they've turned to alternate means. Chrome Frame would look to capitalize on the leadership position that we have."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to the most recent data from Web metrics company Net Applications, IE accounted for 67% of all browsers used last month, with IE8 holding a 15% share on its own. Google's Chrome, meanwhile, controlled just 3% of the browser market in August.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Bazdukas declined to say whether Microsoft could, and if so, whether it would, somehow block Chrome Frame from being used with IE. "Our focus now is making sure that users understand the tradeoffs they're making if they use Chrome Frame," she said. "People expect that things like IE8's privacy mode [will] work as advertised."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bazdukas also countered claims by Google that IE users demand faster JavaScript and want support for protocols such as HTML 5. "HTML 5 is not a completed standard," she noted. "We're working on it very actively, and we see a lot of promise in it. But it's premature to support it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Microsoft knows what its users want better than Google, argued Bazdukas. "The many years we've been in the browser business, we've been able to get a lot of feedback from users," she said. "And they've told us that they're looking for security, privacy and reliability. With IE8, we think we've done a great job at delivering those to customers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chrome Frame plug-in works with IE6, IE7 or IE8 on Windows XP or Windows Vista. It's available from Google's site as a free download.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has given small system builders the green light to start selling new Windows 7 PCs more than a week before the general launch date of Oct. 22, a Seattle-area computer maker said today.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to Jon Bach, the president of Puget Systems, several Microsoft representatives have told him that his company, which sells custom PCs nationally out of its Auburn, Wash. facility, can install Windows 7 on new machines, then sell and ship them to customers on Oct. 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That date is nine days before the worldwide Oct. 22 launch Microsoft has touted, when Windows 7 upgrades are to go on sale at retail -- and when large computer manufacturers, such as HP and Dell, will start selling systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"For us [system builders], we can buy the OEM editions of Windows 7, which should be hitting distributors no later than Oct. 12, and put them in the hands of our customers on Oct. 13 at the latest," said Bach.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bach said he had Microsoft's okay in writing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have a long line of customers who are waiting for Windows 7," said Bach, who added that his sales team has taken informal orders for new Windows 7 machines from about 50 customers. Puget Systems will also kick off a more formal pre-order promotion on Monday to offer all customers the option of placing orders for early delivery of new Windows 7 computers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The OEM distribution channel has historically been more flexible than that for large [computer makers]," said Bach, "both as an operating system reaches its end-of-life and before it's contracted to ship from the likes of HP and Dell."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bach's mention of end-of-life referred to the ups and downs of Microsoft's plans for Windows XP. Originally, Microsoft extended XP's availability by five months in September 2007 . But it then added to its lifespan several times after that, including an exception for netbooks that still continues, and an extension to distributors that allows them to ship OEM versions of the eight-year-old OS through late May 2009 .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The last was a move aimed at quieting complaints from system builders -- the smaller shops and computer dealers that build PCs to order -- who wanted to keep selling XP machines because of customer demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The great thing for us is that we'll be able to install Windows 7 on new computers before Oct. 13, since Windows 7 allows installation without a product key." said Bach. "Then on the 13th, after we have the product keys from our distributor, we can pop them in and start shipping immediately."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bach speculated about why Microsoft is letting system builders get a jump on larger computer makers. "They released Windows 7 to manufacturing early, and they've been very conservative on dates all along, so it's definitely ready," he said. "Maybe they saw no reason to wait, and decided that there wasn't anything to gain by holding on the OEM side."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Windows 7's final code, dubbed RTM for "release to manufacturing," has actually been available to some users for more than a month. Microsoft wrapped up work on Windows 7 in late July, and delivered RTM to developers and IT professionals on Aug. 6, then shipped copies to volume license customers at the beginning of this month.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This isn't the first time that Puget Systems has beaten bigger computer sellers to the punch. Last March, the company launched a free Windows 7 upgrade offer months before Microsoft rolled out its official promotion that provides buyers of Vista-powered PCs a free upgrade to the new OS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Puget Systems will start taking Windows 7 PC pre-orders for early delivery on its Web site .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the early availability of Windows 7 through system builders.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Inspector general says Ecuador to strongly defend itself&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Chevron says only natural it would seek a fair hearing
 (Adds comments from Chevron, plaintiffs' adviser)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;QUITO, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Ecuador accused Chevron Corp
(CVX.N) on Thursday of filing an international arbitration
claim against the country in an attempt to shield itself
against losing a $27 billion environmental damage lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron, the second-largest U.S. oil company, opened a new
front in its legal fight with the Ecuadorean government on
Wednesday by accusing the government of violating a
U.S.-Ecuador investment treaty. [ID:nN23418073]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indigenous communities in Ecuador have accused Texaco,
which Chevron bought in 2001, of damaging the environment and
their health while operating petroleum facilities in the
region. Chevron denies the charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ecuador Inspector General Diego Garcia, who is leading the
country's legal case, said Chevron was looking to avoid being
hit with the stigma of losing the case by seeking arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron is looking to achieve what it couldn't do in
Ecuadorean or U.S. courts -- a decision in which it won't be
affected in the event it loses the trial," he said. "The state
will strongly defend itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron filed a complaint before the Permanent Court of
Arbitration in the Hague, arguing Ecuador's judicial system is
heavily influenced by President Rafael Correa and citing public
comments from Correa in support of the plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If the government and the courts it controls are not going
to have a fair hearing where these things are considered, it's
only natural that Chevron would invoke its rights under the
bilateral investment treaty," Chevron spokesman Kent Robertson
said on Thursday, responding to Garcia's comments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move for arbitration came three weeks after Chevron
accused the Ecuadorean judge in the case of being involved in a
$3 million bribery scheme and offered secretly videotaped
footage as evidence, which prompted a local investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judge is still presiding over the lawsuit even though
he requested to be recused after the videos were released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plaintiffs say Texaco, which was first granted exploration
rights in Ecuador in 1964 and was in a consortium with state
oil firm Petroecuador starting a decade later, dumped billions
of gallons of polluted water in the jungle near indigenous
communities before leaving Ecuador in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The environmental case should be resolved by the
appropriate courts and between the parties involved, not in an
arbitration where all the parties to the suit are not even
represented," Garcia said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Steven Donziger, a U.S. lawyer advising the indigenous
communities, said in an emailed statement on Thursday that
Chevron had not exhausted all domestic remedies in Ecuador, as
required by the investment treaty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But Chevron said in its arbitration filing that its
representatives had met with Ecuadorean officials many times to
resolve the "investment dispute" over a 1998 release from
liability granted to Texaco by Ecuador's government.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron also said it delivered a letter about the dispute
in October 2007, seeking to resolve it through talks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "All efforts at a negotiated solution have failed,"
Chevron's lawyers wrote in the filing.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Demand for high grade
corporate credit has become a crowded trade and investors
should increase allocation to stocks instead of switching to
the asset class, or risk being disappointed with the bonds'
returns, JPMorgan analysts said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Investors burnt by last year's stock declines have been
increasingly changing allocations away from stocks and towards
corporate debt, helping spark a rally that has also been buoyed
by improving economic indicators.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "A bullish view on high grade credit spreads is a crowded
trade," the JPMorgan analysts said in a client note. "Crowded
trades usually end in tears though, as something unexpected
goes wrong and everyone tries to get out at the same time."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A rush for the exits is a risk for credit, though it's
difficult to position for an unknown negative catalyst and
spreads can stay low for years, the analysts said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is more likely that corporate credit spreads continue to
tighten but returns disappoint because rising U.S. Treasury
yields offset corporate spread gains, or because equity markets
outperform the bonds, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Corporate bond returns are based on a spread over
comparable Treasuries.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We believe the way to bet against the crowded trade in
high grade credit is not to short credit spreads but to
increase allocations to stocks. This would be doing the
opposite of what many investors are doing, and it is supported
by the economic trends as well," JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Significant demand for high grade credit coming from
retail investors and pension fund managers who are reducing
allocations to stocks," JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, "shifting from stocks to credit just as the
economy is returning to growth risks locking in past equity
market losses and replacing them with high grade bonds which
are unlikely to make up for these losses," they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Improvements in company credit metrics, such as stronger
cash balances and improving margins, in addition also benefit
stocks, they said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Karen Brettell)

&lt;p&gt;QUITO, Sept. 24 (Reuters) - Ecuador on Thursday accused
Chevron Corp of filing an international arbitration claim
against the country in an attempt to shield itself against
losing a $27 billion environmental damage lawsuit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron (CVX.N), the second-largest U.S. oil company,
opened a new front in its legal fight with the Ecuadorean
government on Wednesday, taking the government to court over
accusations it violated a U.S.-Ecuador investment treaty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indigenous communities in Ecuador have accused Texaco,
which Chevron bought in 2001, of damaging the environment and
their health while operating petroleum facilities in the
region. Chevron denies the charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ecuador's Inspector General Diego Garcia, who is leading
the country's legal case, said Chevron was looking to avoid
being hit with the stigma of losing the lawsuit by seeking   
arbitration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Chevron is looking to achieve what it couldn't do in
Ecuadorean or U.S. courts -- a decision in which it won't be
affected in the event it loses the trial," he said. "The state
will strongly defend itself."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron filed a complaint before the Permanent Court of
Arbitration in the Hague, arguing Ecuador's judicial system is
heavily influenced by President Rafael Correa.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The move came three weeks after Chevron accused the
Ecuadorean judge in the case of being involved in a $3 million
bribery scheme and offered secretly videotaped footage as
evidence that prompted a local investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The judge is still presiding over the lawsuit even though
he requested to be recused after the videos were released.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plaintiffs say Texaco dumped billions of gallons of
polluted water in the jungle near indigenous communities before
the company left Ecuador in the early 1990s.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The environmental case should be resolved by the
appropriate courts and between the parties involved, not in an
arbitration where all the parties to the suit are not even
represented," Garcia said.

&lt;p&gt;Latest Move to Avoid $27 Billion Environmental Liability Contains Risks for Oil
Giant
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Chevron`s filing of an arbitration claim against Ecuador`s government over a
potential $27.3 billion environmental liability in Ecuador can best be explained
by an embarrassing string of legal defeats the company has suffered in U.S. and
Ecuadorian courts on several of the same issues the company will bring before
the arbitration panel, lawyers for the Amazonian communities said today. 

"Filing an arbitration claim smacks of forum shopping and is one of Chevron`s
last cards to avoid paying for a half-century of environmental contamination in
Ecuador`s Amazon," said Steven Donziger, an American lawyer who advises the
plaintiffs. The plaintiffs include dozens of indigenous and farmer communities
in the Amazon rainforest who charge Texaco (now Chevron) discharged billions of
gallons of toxic waste onto their lands and waterways. 

"Over the last three years every public court that has looked at this case -
from the lowest trial court in Ecuador to the United States Supreme Court -- has
rejected some or all of Chevron`s fundamental claims," said Donziger. "There is
no reason to think the arbitration panel will conclude differently." 

Donziger emphasized the filing of the claim - under a trade pact between Ecuador
and the U.S. - will have no impact on the underlying case or on the chances of
recovery by the plaintiffs. If the plaintiffs win a judgment against Chevron in
Ecuador`s courts, they plan to move "expeditiously" to seize Chevron`s assets in
the U.S. and other countries given that Chevron has publicly announced it will
never pay, he said. 

Whether Chevron succeeds in getting a judgment against Ecuador`s government for
the environmental liability in Ecuador will have no impact on the strategy to
seize the company`s assets, said Donziger. The environmental case is a private
litigation between the indigenous groups and Chevron, while the arbitration case
is between Chevron and Ecuador`s government, he added. 

"Chevron operates in more than 100 countries and has numerous oil tankers that
troll the world`s waterways and dock in any number of ports," Donziger said.
"This could end up being one of the biggest forced asset seizures in history and
it could have a significant disruptive impact on the company`s operations. 

"This is not something we would delight in doing," he added. "But it appears
seizing Chevron`s assets is the only way to uphold the rule of law. Chevron
obviously believes it is bigger than the laws of the country where it wanted the
trial to be held. It is also clear that the indigenous people in the Amazon who
are suffering from cancers and other oil-related diseases are not a factor in
the company`s analysis." 

Chevron faces a number of legal obstacles in bringing the arbitration claim,
said Donziger. First, the company fought for ten years in U.S. federal court to
have the environmental case (which was filed in 1993) moved to Ecuador, praising
the country`s courts in 14 sworn affidavits by legal experts. After winning that
argument over the objections of the plaintiffs, Chevron then tried to discredit
Ecuador`s courts when the evidence began to demonstrate 100% of the company`s
378 former production sites are extensively contaminated - a finding recently
confirmed by a review of the evidence by a court-appointed Special Master. 

In one of the more surprising findings in Ecuador, the Special Master found that
Chevron`s own evidence corroborated claims by the plaintiffs that the sites were
contaminated. "Chevron helped us prove our case, which is hugely embarrassing
for Chevron`s legal team and helps explain the company`s strategy to focus on
the politics of Ecuador rather than on the evidence at trial," said Donziger. 

Donziger also pointed to Chevron`s recent legal setbacks in the U.S. to help
explain the company`s timing in filing the arbitration claim:

* The U.S. Supreme Court in June of this year rejected a Chevron petition
designed to reverse a lower court ruling that Chevron did not have a right to
arbitrate against Ecuador`s government over the environmental liability, based
on a 1965 operating contract that allowed Texaco (now Chevron) to drill for oil
in the Amazon.

* In June 2007, a highly regarded U.S. federal judge - Leonard B. Sand - handed
Chevron a stunning rebuke when he ruled that Chevron knew or should have known
that Ecuador was not bound by an arbitration provision in Chevron`s operating
agreement (this is distinct from the recent arbitration claim, which is made
under a bilateral treaty entered into by Ecuador).

* In October 2008, a three-judge panel from a U.S. federal court rejected
Chevron`s appeal of the Sand decision in a unanimous summary order - probably
the most embarrassing type of decision one can receive in U.S. federal court.
Such a decision demonstrates the judges thought Chevron`s concerns were not
important enough to warrant even a full written decision.

* In December 2008, Chevron suffered another defeat when the full panel of the
U.S. Court of Appeals denied its motion for an en banc hearing to review the
unanimous summary order.

* In July of this year, Chevron dealt itself another setback when it voluntarily
withdrew a claim before Judge Sand that its controversial legal release from
Ecuador`s government - secured by fraud, according to the plaintiffs - absolved
of it all clean-up responsibility. Chevron apparently was worried it would lose
on that issue and thereby prejudice its ability to bring up the release argument
in the arbitration action filed yesterday, said Donziger.

Donziger also said Chevron`s arbitration claim suffers from a number of defects.
These include the fact the company has not exhausted domestic remedies in
Ecuador (a requirement in the treaty), given that the case is not over; the fact
Chevron`s own executives and lawyers could be subject to sworn depositions over
recently released videos that the plaintiffs believe likely were contrived by
Chevron to taint the trial; and, the fact that Chevron, by claiming its domestic
remedies in Ecuador are exhausted, is accelerating the time frame for a final
judgment in Ecuador. 

In addition, one of the main arguments Chevron will use in the arbitration -
that it was released by Ecuador after a remediation in the mid-1990s - is "a
total non-starter" given there is express language in that release excluding
private claims of the type being pressed in the lawsuit, said Donziger. 

"One of the interesting wrinkles is that Chevron`s own legal team could be
exposing itself to personal liability if it is found that it played a role in
the purported bribery scheme in Ecuador to create evidence for the arbitration
proceeding," said Donziger. "That`s just one scenario where this could blow up
for Chevron. Everybody from the CEO on down could be forced to answer questions
about whether Chevron manipulated the video and was trying to destabilize a
foreign nation`s judicial system to evade a judgment in a private litigation." 

"More to the point," added in Donziger, "if the court in Ecuador rules against
Chevron on the environmental case, we think Chevron`s latest move to file the
arbitration claim enhances our prospects of getting that trial judgment
satisfied sooner rather than later."

and sessions designed specifically around the challenges that CIOs face today,
which will teach them how to enhance IT performance through new tools and
practices, including restructuring IT, CIO leadership, growth strategies in a
down economy, and linking IT and business strategies. 

In the opening keynote on Monday, October 19, Gartner analysts will examine the
dramatic changes that IT leaders must make as priorities shift from cost cutting
and risk mitigation to the investments needed to position themselves for
recovery. Gartner analysts will explore breakthrough approaches for pressing
imperatives in the era of "the new normal," and examine the strategic
implications of fast-evolving technologies and trends. 

Symposium/ITxpo immerses more than 125 Gartner analysts, more than 110 solution
providers, and more than 5,000 delegates in an environment designed to reveal

more workshops, roundtable discussions and other networking opportunities
provide attendees with the relationships and best practices they need to get
real business results. 

This year's agenda includes more than 200 sessions, more than 65 workshops, and
100 roundtable discussions - all organized across tracks designed to help nine
core IT leadership roles:

* Applications 
* Business Intelligence &amp; Information Management

an illegal bank card interchange-fee cartel that inhibited
competition.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The GVH fined MasterCard and Visa Europe 477 million forints

promised to launch an appeal as soon as they received a written
copy of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "We concluded that the financial institutions under
investigation, by creating a uniform interchange-fee structure,
... and by maintaining and supporting such a free structure,
inhibited competition," Toth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Therefore competition between the two card firms and the
card-accepting banks was distorted and limited," Toth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OTP Bank OTPB.BU, the country's top commercial bank,
received a 281 million forint fine, the biggest among banks as
the GVH distributed fines in part based on market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; FIRMS DENY WRONGDOING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "During the relevant period, Visa did not set interchange in
Hungary and we do not consider there can be any credible legal
basis for the finding of an infringement against Visa Europe or
the imposition of a fine," Visa Europe said in a statement. "We
are confident that this decision will be overturned on appeal to
a higher court." Visa Europe is owned by banks, and is not a
unit of Visa Inc. (V.N)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Milan Gauder, MasterCard's regional director for Hungary,
Croatia and Slovenia also said his firm plans an appeal as they
disagree with the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OTP deputy chief executive Antal Kovacs added: "We disagree
with this decision; none of the watchdog's arguments are valid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We'll pay the fine but will take the necessary legal
action," Kovacs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Budapest Bank, a unit of General Electric (GE.N), received a
188 million forint fine, KH Bank, a unit of Belgium's KBC
(KBC.BR), was fined 127 million forints while and (ERST.VI) was
fined 107 million forints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; None of the other financial firms could immediately comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The GVH said banks and the two card companies struck a deal
in 1996 to charge a uniform interchange fee for card
transactions, which directly led to a uniform-fee structure paid
by retailers to banks over card payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But this fee should have been the most important condition
for competition between card-accepting banks," Toth said.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
The Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) today announced plans to build an improved
and upgraded version of its global climate change disclosure system. The system
will make available primary information on corporate emissions performance,
collected for use by institutional investors, businesses and the world`s
national regulatory systems, to drive greenhouse gas emission reductions and
performance improvements. The provision of high quality data on climate change
and corporate carbon footprints will be vital to supporting a global framework
post Kyoto, bridging the gap between corporations` climate change reporting and
government regulation. 

Beginning in 2010 corporations will report to CDP through the new data system
which will increase the quality of disclosure globally, meeting the demand from
investors for more detailed, consistent, comparable and actionable data. It will
streamline reporting for companies by providing enhanced tools and guidance
through a single, fully accessible reporting platform. This platform will enable
data to be easily shared with and analyzed by institutional investors,
corporations and the world`s national regulatory systems. With more user
friendly output of information, CDP`s upgraded system will drive greater use of
corporate climate change information within financial and strategic decision
making. 

CDP is partnering with world leading consulting and technology companies
Accenture, Microsoft and SAP to deliver the new version of its data system. 

Measurement, reporting and verification of emissions is a vital step for
organizations looking to increase awareness of the impact of climate change. It
enables them to lower costs by identifying efficiency measures, reduce climate
change related risk to the business and also reveal commercial opportunities. It
also enables a fuller assessment of senior management`s options with regard to
strategic direction, innovations and capital projects. These developments will
not only help companies reveal emissions hot spots so they can be better
managed, but also help to prepare companies for future regulation. 

CDP`s Chief Executive Paul Dickinson said: "Climate change is a global issue
that requires a global solution. With our new improved data tools and
capabilities we are providing a world class reporting platform that will assist
in the sharing of high quality climate change data on an international scale and
eventually integrate with existing national regulatory systems. This global hub
of information will be essential to supporting a global deal post Kyoto." 

CDP has selected a consortium of implementation partners. Accenture will work as
solution integrator and provide strategic guidance for the implementation of the
new reporting platform. "Effective carbon disclosure helps corporations mitigate
investment risk and achieve more sustainable performance," said Mark Foster,
Group Chief Executive, Management Consulting &amp; Global Markets at Accenture. "The
simplicity, standardization and transparency of disclosure will make CDP the de
facto process for reporting carbon emissions and an indispensible tool for
helping the corporations and governments of the world take action." 

Microsoft will work on all aspects of data capture within the new version of the
CDP platform, enabling companies to report more detailed and standardized
climate change information. 

"Gathering and tracking environmental data is one of the biggest challenges
facing organizations today," said Rob Bernard, Chief Environmental Strategist at
Microsoft. "Technology and innovation can play a significant role in driving
solutions to address the world`s environmental challenges. Microsoft is pleased
to partner with CDP to deliver a software solution that enables organizations to
be more transparent and make decisions that benefit both their bottom line and
the environment." 

SAP will leverage its SAP BusinessObjects BI OnDemand solution to store and
deliver the carbon disclosure reports and dashboards to users. 

"As a driving force behind CDP's carbon benchmarking analytics, SAP technology
will provide organizations, investors and governments around the world clarity
on progress against carbon reduction targets," said Anirban Chakrabarti, Vice
President and General Manager of SAP Carbon Impact. "Reducing the carbon
emissions of both SAP and our 89,000 global customers is a top-level strategic
and operational issue for our company. SAP technology enables our customers to
measure, report and reduce their carbon emissions and, in doing so, increase the
efficiency of their business networks."

&lt;p&gt;WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Appeals court judges hearing the latest round of a long-running patent fight between Microsoft Corp and Toronto technology company i4i on Wednesday questioned a lower court's calculation that the software giant owed $290 million in damages to the smaller firm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The appeals court made no immediate ruling on an injunction which a U.S. district court in Texas had imposed in August, that would have barred Microsoft from selling some versions of its popular Word application on the grounds that it infringed i4i's patent relating to XML, or extensible markup language.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit stayed that injunction earlier this month, meaning there is no immediate threat to Microsoft's sales of the 2003 and 2007 versions of Word, which contain the disputed technology.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Kimberly Moore of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit took issue on Wednesday with the calculation in the original ruling that XML users who bought a $90 version of Windows would have paid considerably more for a substitute.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Not everyone who is willing to pay $90 or $200 for a product is willing to pay $500," she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft also faced skeptical questioning as it asked the appeals court to overturn a lower court's finding that it had infringed the smaller company's patent and should be barred from selling versions of Word that contain it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft acknowledged being in contact with i4i about the technology, but said there was no direct evidence that anyone at Microsoft actually read the disputed patent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Judge Alvin Schall was skeptical. "I find it hard to believe that Microsoft didn't read the patent," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;i4i said that Microsoft approached it in 2000 with an eye toward potentially licensing its technology, and that the two companies made joint presentations but never reached a licensing agreement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The appeals court judges gave no indication of when they will rule on the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case is: i4i Limited Partnership and Infrastructures for Information Inc v. Microsoft Corp, an appeal from the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas in case no. 07-CV-113.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Diane Bartz; Editing by Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has launched a program that gives Web development professionals the chance to get free software and technical support to help them get new businesses off the ground.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web development companies with less than 10 employees can apply for the new WebsiteSpark program, which was unveiled at the PICNIC conference in Amsterdam Thursday. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program is similar to Microsoft's BizSpark program launched last year, which provides software and other resources to startups, and the DreamSpark program, which does the same for students.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eddie Amos, general manager for Microsoft's developer platform and tools group, said the company added WebsiteSpark because it realized there was a "hole" in the enablement programs where Web professionals are concerned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The programs also provide a way for Microsoft to get young companies and developers using its software in their businesses. In the Web development and Web design space many companies already use products from Adobe and other Microsoft competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Through WebsiteSpark -- which companies can apply for online -- Microsoft will provide three licenses for Visual Studio 2008 Professional Edition, two licenses for Expression Web 3 and one license for Expression Studio 3. Qualifying companies also receive four processor licenses for production use of both Windows Web Server 2008 and Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Web Edition. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The program also includes two technical-support incidents per company, access to community support through connections with other Microsoft partners and unlimited access to technical managed newsgroups on the Microsoft Developer Network. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Cyrus Massoumi, whose company ZocDoc has been a part of Microsoft's BizSpark program, said getting free software and support has been a great benefit. ZocDoc provides a Web site through which people can book doctors' appointments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The program enables us to work with Microsoft&#8217;s latest technologies without worrying about cost, and the savings for our data center are significant," said Massoumi, ZocDoc's CEO and founder.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition to unveiling WebsiteSpark, Microsoft Thursday also updated its Web Platform Installer software, which simplifies the installation of Microsoft Web development software to make it easier to build Web applications. The 2.0 version is available online for download.&lt;/p&gt;

"Best of 2009" Data Presentation at ECCO15/ESMO34 Highlights Clinical Activity
with PF-02341066 in a Phase I Dose Escalation Study 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Pfizer Oncology announced today that it will initiate a global, Phase 3 clinical
trial of its investigational oral c-Met and ALK inhibitor, PF-02341066, versus
standard of care chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) carrying the ALK (anaplastic lymphoma kinases) fusion gene, who
have progressed on one prior treatment with a platinum-based chemotherapy.
Updated data from an expansion cohort of a Phase 1 study with PF-02341066 in
NSCLC patients with tumors carrying this fusion gene were featured today at the
ECCO15/ESMO34 meeting in Berlin, Germany (Abstract #6G). 

PF-02341066 is an investigational, selective, ATP-competitive small molecule
dual inhibitor of mesenchymal epithelial transition growth factor (c-Met or
hepatocyte growth factor) and ALK tyrosine kinases, which are implicated in the
progression of several cancers, including NSCLC. A subset of NSCLC patients have
been identified whose tumors carry a unique mutation in which the echinoderm
microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene is fused to ALK, also known as
an EML4-ALK translocation. This fusion/translocation has been reported in 3-7
percent of all NSCLC patients, with the incidence increasing to 10-20 percent
among NSCLC patients with adenocarcinoma histology and those who have a
never-to-light smoking history, and represents one of the newest molecular
targets in NSCLC. 

"We see this as an extraordinary opportunity for rational drug development. This
represents a shift from large trials designed to detect a small benefit in a
large group of patients towards looking for a bigger effect in a smaller, better
characterized group of patients. By focusing on the subset of patients whose
lung cancers carry the EML4-ALK translocation, we will be in the best position
to determine the clinical effects of PF-02341066, both good and bad, in
comparison to standard chemotherapy," said Dr. Mace Rothenberg, senior vice
president of clinical development and medical affairs for Pfizer`s Oncology
Business Unit. 

Lung cancer is the most common cancer worldwide, with NSCLC accounting for
approximately 85 percent of lung cancer cases. Nearly 60 percent of NSCLC
patients are diagnosed late with Stage IIIB/IV advanced disease. For Stage
IIIB/IV NSCLC, the five-year survival rate is only 12 percent. 

Phase 3 Study Open and Enrolling Patients in Select Centers

A Phase 3 randomized, open-label study of the anti-tumor activity and safety of
PF-02341066 versus pemetrexed or docetaxel in patients with measurable NSCLC who
have tested positive for the ALK fusion gene and who have progressed on a
platinum-based chemotherapy is currently open and enrolling in the United States
and will be enrolling globally by the end of 2009. The study is expected to
enroll 318 patients. 

The primary objective of the study is progression-free survival (PFS), and
secondary outcomes include assessment of overall survival, objective response
rate, duration of response, disease control rate, and patient-reported outcomes.
Patients in the study will be randomized to receive PF-02341066 (250 mg orally
BID) or pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle) or docetaxel (75
mg/m2 on Day 1 of each 21 day cycle). 

Those interested in learning more about the trial should contact the Pfizer
Oncology Clinical Trial Information Services (patients: Pfizer
http://pfizercancertrials.com; physicians:

Data Featured at ECCO/ESMO Support Initiation of Phase 3 Study

Updated study results from an expansion cohort of a Phase 1 study in patients
with NSCLC carrying the ALK fusion gene showed early clinical activity with
PF-02341066. 

In this study, patients carrying the EML4-ALK translocation were recruited into
an expanded cohort at the recommended Phase 2 dose of 250 mg twice daily (BID).
To date, 31 NSCLC ALK patients have been evaluated for response. 

The overall response rate, to date, is 65 percent (20/31 patients [95 percent
CI: 45 percent, 81 percent]) and disease control rate (DCR) at 8 weeks is 84
percent (26/31 patients [95 percent CI: 66 percent, 95 percent]). Median PFS has
not yet been reached. The median duration of treatment is 24.5+ weeks. 

In the Phase 1 study, the most common adverse events were mild or moderate, and
included nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. Treatment-related severe toxicity
(elevated liver transaminases) was infrequent and reversible. 

"Now that the EML4-ALK translocation has been validated as a therapeutic target
in a small, but significant subset of NSCLC patients, we look forward to seeing
how our early stage research translates in a larger Phase 3 trial," added Mr.
Rothenberg. 

This expansion cohort was part of a dose-escalation study which enrolled 38
advanced cancer patients in the escalation phase, and 57 patients in the
expansion cohort, with various tumors, including NSCLC, colorectal, pancreatic,
sarcoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma tumors.

&lt;p&gt;BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary's competition authority fined Visa, MasterCard and the country's top commercial banks on Thursday for illegally fixing the fees they charge each other after bank card transactions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The GVH fined MasterCard and Visa 477 million forints ($2.6 million) each and levied a combined fine of 968 million forints on the country's top commercial banks, Tihamer Toth, chairman of the GVH ruling panel, told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Both card firms as well as OTP denied any wrongdoing and promised to launch an appeal as soon as they received a written copy of the decision.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We concluded that the financial institutions under investigation, by creating a uniform interchange-fee structure, ... and by maintaining and supporting such a free structure, inhibited competition," Toth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Therefore competition between the two card firms and the card-accepting banks was distorted and limited," Toth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;An interchange fee is what banks charge each other when a customer uses a card to pay for merchandise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTP Bank, the country's top commercial bank, received a 281 million forint fine, the biggest among banks as the GVH distributed fines in part based on market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FIRMS DENY WRONGDOING&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During the relevant period, Visa did not set interchange in Hungary and we do not consider there can be any credible legal basis for the finding of an infringement against Visa Europe or the imposition of a fine," Visa said in a statement. "We are confident that this decision will be overturned on appeal to a higher court."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Milan Gauder, MasterCard's regional director for Hungary, Croatia and Slovenia also said his firm plans an appeal as they disagree with the ruling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;OTP deputy chief executive Antal Kovacs added: "We disagree with this decision; none of the watchdog's arguments are valid."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We'll pay the fine but will take the necessary legal action," Kovacs said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Budapest Bank, a unit of General Electric, received a 188 million forint fine, KH Bank, a unit of Belgium's KBC, was fined 127 million forints while and was fined 107 million forints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;None of the other financial firms could immediately comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The GVH said banks and the two card companies struck a deal in 1996 to charge a uniform interchange fee for card transactions, which directly led to a uniform-fee structure paid by retailers to banks over card payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"But this fee should have been the most important condition for competition between card-accepting banks," Toth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Additional reporting by Marton Dunai; Editing by David Holmes and Louise Heavens)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;($1=184.38 Forint)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Wednesday`sAnalyst Blog: 

Palm Raises Public Offering

Palm Inc. (PALM) today raised its secondary offering of approximately 16 million
shares of common stock (as announced on September 17) to 20 million shares. The
company priced the offering at $16.25 per share. 

Upon the closing of the offering, Palm expects to receive net proceeds of
approximately $313.1 million, which will be used for working capital and general
corporate purposes. The company may receive $359.9 million in case the
over-allotment option is exercised in full. The company also said that the
underwriters have an option to purchase up to 3 million additional shares to
cover over-allotments. 

Venture capital firm Elevation Partners, which owns a stake in Palm, plans to
buy $35 million of shares in the sale. Goldman Sachs (GS) and J.P. Morgan (JPM)
are serving as the joint book runners in the offering, and RBC Capital Markets
is serving as co-manager. 

In order to boost its earnings and curb cash burn, the company has come out with
the offering. PALM had a negative working capital (current assets minus current
liabilities) of $269.5 million at the end of the last quarter ended August 2009.


Palm exited the most recent quarter (first quarter of fiscal 2010) with $221.2
million in cash, investments (including short-term and restricted portion) and
non-current auction rate securities versus $264.6 million in the previous
quarter. The company used $45.1 million cash from operations. Palm expects to
use cash in the first half of fiscal year 2010. 

The company posted a loss (for the eighth consecutive quarter) of 10 cents per
share excluding one-time items. Palm`s business had been struggling amid
competition from Research in Motion`s (RIMM) BlackBerry and Apple`s (AAPL)
iPhone. We do not expect any improvement in Palm`s business and maintain our
Underperform rating on the stock. 

Shares of Palm have been soaring in anticipation of the forthcoming secondary
offering, which was at a 5.0% discount to the closing price of $17.07 yesterday.
Shares of Palm have been hovering around the $17 mark since mid-morning, down a
quarter of a percent.

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BUDAPEST, Sept 24 (Reuters) - Hungary's competition
authority the GVH ruled that Visa (V.N), MasterCard (MA.N) and
the country's top commercial banks formed an illegal bank card
interchange-fee cartel, it said on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The GVH fined MasterCard and Visa 477 million forints ($2.6
million) each and levied a combined fine of 968 million forints
on the country's top commercial banks, Tihamer Toth, chairman of
the GVH ruling panel, told a news conference.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;  "We concluded that the financial institutions under
investigation, by creating a uniform interchange-fee structure,
... and by maintaining and supporting such a free structure,
inhibited competition," Toth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Therefore competition between the two card firms and the
card-accepting banks was distorted and limited," Toth said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; OTP Bank OTPB.BU, the country's top commercial bank,

fined 107 million forints.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The GVH said banks and the two card companies struck a deal
in 1996 to charge a uniform interchange fee for card
transactions, which directly led to a uniform-fee structure paid
by retailers to banks over card payments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "But this fee should have been the most important condition
for competition between card-accepting banks," Toth said.

&lt;p&gt;Sept 24 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs (GS.N) is looking to bring
about a number of changes related to its employee compensation
policies that include imposing longer vesting periods for stock
options, The New York Post said, citing sources familiar with
the matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The paper said the U.S. bank is also considering paying
senior executives' bonuses in stock, in a bid to keep away from
making huge cash payments. The bonus kitty is expected to touch
$16 billion after the current quarter, it added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The cash excluded from the bonuses, could be used to buy
back stock, according to the paper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A spokesman from Goldman Sachs was not immediately available
for comment, outside the regular U.S. business hours.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has opened up for business its new Dublin data center, a massive 550,000-square-foot facility dedicated to serving primarily European customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Construction isn't quite done yet, with about 303,000 square feet finished, but Microsoft is accepting clients. The company will run "cloud" services from the center for consumers, businesses and developers, said Steve Clayton, who works in cloud-computing strategy for Microsoft International.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the consumer side, the data center will run applications such as Windows Live Mail, formerly Hotmail, as well as Microsoft's other Live-branded services. Businesses will be able to subscribe to a range of hosted applications, including Exchange e-mail, the Sharepoint collaboration software and Office Communication Server, among others, Clayton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dublin facility will also host Microsoft's Azure platform, which will be made available in November. Azure is a platform that developers can use to host and manage Web-based applications. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dublin was chosen for the data center due to the local talent pool, robust Internet connectivity and cool climate, Clayton said. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is using outside air to cool the data center. One of the predominant costs for running a data center is electricity in order to keep servers cool. The data center's operating temperature can be maintained 95 percent of the time without mechanical or refrigerated cooling, such as chilled water systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We literally take outside air and pump it directly into the server room," Clayton said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Dublin data center's PUE (power usage effectiveness) is 1.25, which means for every one watt of server power, there's .25 of a watt dedicated to cooling and other electricity-consuming functions, Clayton said. The industry average PUE for data centers is between 2 and 2.4 PUE. Microsoft's average for all of its data centers is 1.6, although the company wants to reduce that to 1.125 by 2012.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The facility can now generate up to 5.4 megawatts of critical power. Eventually, it will be possible to expand to 22.2 megawatts, Microsoft said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Customers have the option of having their applications run on their own dedicated server or sharing hardware, which is a cheaper option, Clayton said. Some administrators don't like the idea of their data being on the same physical server as that of other companies, although virtualization technologies make those arrangements generally more efficient.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's moves toward cloud computing have come as the company repeatedly emphasizes that it doesn't see those services replacing on-premise software, or applications installed on PCs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Other companies, such as Microsoft's competitor Google, have been strong proponents of Web-based applications accessed through a Web browser, which can be cheaper and updated instantly but are dependent on reliable Internet connectivity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe people will continue to want to run software on premise," Clayton said.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week on the PC World Podcast, editors Tim Moynihan, Robert Strohmeyer, Ginny Mies, and Nick Mediati are ready to party! Sort of. Listen in to hear them discuss Microsoft's mind-boggling Windows 7 launch party videos, the HTC Hero Android phone for Sprint, and the mysterious Microsoft Courier tablet PC.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can download this week's podcast here.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Could Microsoft beat Apple to the "cool tablet" punch? This week a demo video surfaced featuring a secretive dual-screen device code-named Courier, which may or may not be in a late prototype phase. The gang talks about whether this could be the tablet PC to boost tablet sales--that is, if it truly exists.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hey, what are you planning for your Windows 7 launch party? You are going to have a Windows 7 launch party, right? That's what Microsoft is suggesting you do, and those folks have even provided some how-to party videos, party notes (complete with bonus activities!), and print-out signs that you can hang up in your home. Listen in to hear whether the podcast team thinks this is some sort of ingenious social commentary on the absurdity of product launches, or just another oddball marketing stunt.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, a brand-new Android phone is coming to stores, and Ginny Mies thinks it's the best one yet. It's also the first Android phone offered by a carrier other than T-Mobile--the HTC Hero will be available from Sprint. Learn what makes the Hero different, what makes it less than perfect, and what makes it an extremely compelling smartphone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We want to read your take, too.

&lt;p&gt;Google hit back at Microsoft today, defending the security of its new Chrome Frame plug-in and claiming that the software actually makes Internet Explorer (IE) safer and more secure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Accessing sites using Google Chrome Frame brings Google Chrome's security features to Internet Explorer users," said a Google spokesman today. "It provides strong phishing and malware protection, absent in IE6, robust sandboxing technology [in IE6 and on Windows XP], and defenses from emerging online threats that are available in days rather than months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although both IE7 and IE8 include a "sandbox" defense dubbed "Protected Mode," the feature works only when the browsers are run in Vista (IE7 and IE8) or Windows 7 (IE8). Google's Chrome Frame , however, prevents malicious code from escaping the browser -- and worming its way into, say, the operating system -- on Windows XP as well.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Microsoft warned users that they would double their security problems by using Chrome Frame, the plug-in that provides better JavaScript performance and adds support for HTML 5 to Microsoft's browser.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Running a browser within a browser doubles the potential attack surface in a way that we don't see is particularly helpful," said Amy Bazdukas, Microsoft's general manager for IE, on Thursday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Bazdukas blasted plug-in security in general, and Chrome Frame specifically, while taking the latter to task because it busts IE8's private browsing features. "Chrome Frame breaks the privacy model of IE," claimed Bazdukas. "Users are not going to be able to use IE's privacy features, something that's not made apparent to users. They're essentially circumvented."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google countered that its plug-in is secure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google Chrome Frame ... was designed with security in mind from the beginning," the company spokesman added in an e-mail. "While we encourage users to use a more modern and standards-compliant browser such as Firefox, Safari, Opera or Chrome rather than a plug-in, for those who don't, Chrome Frame is designed to provide better performance, strong security features, and more choice ... across all versions of Internet Explorer."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to Google, Chrome Frame receives automatic, behind-the-scenes security updates with the same mechanism used by the Chrome browser itself, relieving users of manually patching the plug-in.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company is also investigating bugs filed with the Chrome team by Microsoft developers, who reported that Chrome Frame broke IE8's privacy mode.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chrome Frame lets IE utilize the Chrome browser's WebKit rendering engine, as well as its high-performance V8 JavaScript engine. The extra speed and HTML 5 support are necessary, said Google earlier this week, if IE users are to run advanced Web applications such as Google Wave , a collaboration and communications tool that Google launched in May.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google pitched the plug-in as a way to instantly improve the performance of the notoriously slow IE, and as a way for Web developers to support standards IE can't handle, including HTML 5.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chrome Frame plug-in works with IE6, IE7 and IE8 on Windows XP and Windows Vista. It's available from Google's site as a free download .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft on Thursday said it has discontinued the mobile versions of its Dynamics ERP (enterprise resource planning) products. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first mobile Dynamics product, Dynamics AX Mobile Sales, was introduced in 2007 and let sales people remotely place and track orders, query sales histories and manage advertising campaigns from Windows Mobile devices. Microsoft also offered development tools for businesses to build their own mobile offerings based on Dynamics. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the time, Microsoft said it planned to extend other products in the Dynamics family to mobile devices. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Thursday's blog post said that mobile access for Dynamics AX and Dynamics NAV has been discontinued. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft did not immediately reply to a request for comment. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The software giant appears to have begun sending notes out to users earlier in September. It said that third parties have enabled great mobile applications for Dynamics. "Due to the broad availability of partner-developed mobile solutions built on these or similar technologies, we have made a strategic decision to discontinue the current development of Microsoft Dynamics Mobile," according to the note, which has been posted online by various customers. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The note also said that no future updates to the product will be provided and it won't be sold past Aug. 31, 2010. Web sites for the products are still live. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has discontinued a number of products in the past year. Between October 2008 and June 2009, Microsoft had stopped selling or scaled back development on at least 12 products, said Matt Rosoff, an analyst at Directions on Microsoft. Other discontinued products include Money and Equipt.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
Teachers and families will be the focus at the ExxonMobil Science Day at the
Dallas Zoo, scheduled for Saturday, September 26 from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. 

The festival-style event will feature 14 science booths featuring hands-on
activities for children of all ages, preschool to junior high, that are aligned
with the Texas Essential Knowledge and Skills (TEKS) standards. In addition to
the activities for families, for a $10 registration fee teachers and home school
parents can receive four hours of Continuing Education Units (CEUs), TEEAC
credit, and a curriculum CD-ROM filled with the day`s activities and classroom
extensions. 

"Programs such as Science Day at the Zoo offer a unique opportunity for teachers
to continue their professional development and receive additional classroom
resources to help make science more fun and engaging for students," said Truman
Bell, senior program officer for education and diversity, ExxonMobil Foundation.
"We are proud to continue our partnership with the Dallas Zoo and support North
Texas teachers." 

Participation at the activity stations and map stamps are free with Zoo
admission. In exchange for participating in each station, families will receive
stamps on a map and can redeem the map for prizes. 

"This is a fun way to remind people that everyone is a scientist," said Cynthia
Bennett, Ph.D., curator of conservation education and science at the Dallas Zoo.
"We look for ways to engage children and families and get them thinking about
how things actually happen." 

Educators who pre-registered for the event received free parking and admission
to the Zoo for the day. Teachers must pay parking and admission if they register
the day of the event, but they can still receive CEUs and the curriculum CD-ROM.
Information for educators and downloadable registration forms can be found at
www.DallasZooEd.com. 

The event is sponsored by the Dallas Zoo and the following community
organizations: the Trinity River Audubon Center, City of Dallas Storm Water
Management, the Museum of Nature and Science, City of Dallas Water Utilities,
Texas Discovery Gardens, Dallas Sanitation Services, Wildcare, North Texas
Master Naturalists, and the Office of Environmental Quality. 

The Dallas Zoo is the largest zoological experience in Texas, with a 95-acre
park, interesting and exotic animals, and an education department that offers
fascinating, fun programs for all ages. It is an accredited member of the
Association of Zoos &amp; Aquariums (AZA). The Dallas Zoo is located at 650 S. R.L.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 25 (Reuters) - IBM (IBM.N) was the main
supplier in a failed project by British intelligence to upgrade
its communications system so various organizations and agents
in different locations could share information, a report said
on Friday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Register, an online technology publication, said IBM's
failure to meet deadlines, as well as security concerns, led
the Cabinet Office to scrap the project last year after years
of development and write off 24.4 million pounds ($39
million).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; IBM declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The report said IBM was the lead contractor in the second
phase of the SCOPE project, which aimed to bolster
collaboration among the branches of British intelligence
including the MI5 Security Service, MI6 Secret Intelligence
Service, the Government Communications Headquarters, and the
Foreign Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The UK Intelligence and Security Committee said in its last
annual report, presented to Parliament in March, that phase 2
of the SCOPE program had been delayed numerous times and had
finally been abandoned.

&lt;p&gt;Continues Firm`s Emphasis on the State
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. today announced that experienced banker and business leader
Peter Barker will become its California Chairman September 28. Barker, who was
raised in Arcadia, California, and attended Claremont McKenna College, worked as
an investment banker for more than 30 years, and has served on a number of
philanthropic and corporate boards. 

"Peter has been a trusted banker and terrific businessman in California for more
than 30 years and will help us continue to build the J.P. Morgan and Chase
businesses in the state," said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. 

The firm`s Investment, Private and Corporate banks have served California
customers for many years, as have the credit card and home lending businesses.
Last year, JPMorgan Chase purchased Washington Mutual`s 700 branches and 1,900
ATMs in California, setting the stage for dramatic growth in consumer, small
business and commercial banking. Today, the company has more than 16,000
employees in the state. 

Barker will serve on JPMorgan Chase's Executive Committee and will work closely
with fellow California-based executives to serve clients, interface with
California state officials and coordinate and leverage the bank`s businesses. 

"JPMorgan Chase has an excellent team here, and I hope that my overall market
perspective will help connect lines of business so we can serve more clients and
grow our California businesses," Barker said. 

The firm recently lent the state of California $1.5 billion so it could redeem
IOUs. On March 31, Chase rebranded 708 bank branches with its trademark blue
octagon logo, and plans to add 20 new branches by the end of the year. It also
continues to refurbish branches and add personal bankers, business bankers, loan
officers and investment specialists. Earlier this year, Chase opened nine
homeownership centers in California so that struggling homeowners could talk
face to face with loan counselors. 

Barker began his career with Goldman Sachs in London in 1971, then moved to New
York and on to Los Angeles seven years later - and has been there ever since. In
1982, he became the partner heading up the firm`s investment banking activities
on the West Coast, working directly with corporations across industries on debt
and equity financings, acquisitions, divestitures, recapitalizations, spin-offs
and initial public offerings. He served as an advisory director from 1998
through 2002, and has worked on a variety of philanthropic and corporate
activities, as well as, private investments since then. 

He serves on the corporate boards of Avery Dennison and Fluor Corporation as
well as the boards of W.M. Keck Foundation, Claremont McKenna College, the
Huntington Library and the Fletcher Jones Foundation, where he is president of
the board. He earned an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) expects to benefit from the new over-the-counter derivatives and commodity trading rules owing to its strong technology position, said a Citigroup analyst, who met with Goldman management, and raised his earnings outlook for the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;"Standardized central clearing of OTC derivatives are likely to force a major electronification of derivatives trading, which may play to Goldman's advantage given their existing technology platform and expertise in high volume electronic trading," Citigroup analyst Keith Horowitz said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Taming the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market -- a "shadow banking system" of enormous size now largely beyond government reach -- is a key part of a push for tighter government oversight of banks and capital markets under way now for six months.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Standardized" OTC derivatives would go through clearinghouses at regulated exchanges to reduce the risk of default. OTC derivatives are complex instruments whose value is based on an underlying asset.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Horowitz, who recently met with Goldman's Chief Financial Officer David Viniar, said the new rules, which could set mandatory minimum collateral and margin requirements, if enacted are expected to benefit the bank relative to its peers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman has historically had among the most stringent collateral and margin terms versus more generous peers, who too often cut deals with easy credit terms to win business, said Horowitz, who also met Goldman's Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn and investment banking head David Solomon.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are more optimistic on Goldman's long-term prospects and gained comfort that worst-case outcomes from regulatory reform are unlikely to materialize and structurally impair returns," Horowitz wrote in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Global policymakers agree that the OTC derivatives market should be regulated after a type of derivative, credit default swaps, led to insurer American International Group's (AIG.N) near collapse and $180 billion government bailout.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The analyst raised his earnings estimate for Goldman by 20 cents to $4.20 a share for the third quarter, and by 25 cents to $5 a share for the fourth.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He kept his "buy" rating and target of $215 on the stock.

&lt;p&gt;(Reuters) - Goldman Sachs said oil prices are likely to be higher in the future due to a recovery in demand and a decline in production, and expects European integrated oil companies to struggle to sustain the current level of production.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Goldman, however, said it expects Royal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L), BG Group (BG.L) and Norway's StatoilHydro (STL.OL) to be exceptions, as they have the best production growth over the coming five years. It rates all the three stocks "buy."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"StatoilHydro is in our view the best European integrated play on our bullish view on the oil price, given its greater sensitivity (both in terms of cash flow and net income) to oil price changes," Goldman said in a note to clients.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It expects the European integrated oils sector to suffer due to lack of major new projects and potentially poor delivery.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman said 2010-13 is likely to see a dramatic acceleration of non-OPEC production decline, with annual production losses of up to 1 million barrels per day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We believe oil equities and the oil price are close to breaking out of the narrow trading range seen over the past three months. The key catalyst, in our view, will be evidence that global oil demand has returned to positive year-over-year growth," Goldman said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It maintained its "attractive" view on the European oil integrated sector, while keeping its "neutral" stance on exploration and production companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Goldman upgraded the European refining sector to "neutral" on the back of increased diesel demand, supported by higher economic activity in 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Tresa Sherin Morera in Bangalore)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Thursday`sAnalyst Blog: 

IBM Cut to Neutral

We downgrade International Business Machines (IBM) to Neutral from Outperform to
reflect near-term risks to the company`s top-line growth and valuation. 

We believe that IBM`s long-term revenue growth potential is limited and remain
cautious on currency fluctuation, which is taking a toll on sales and may be
critical to earnings expansion over the next two years. While we do believe that
cost-cutting initiatives and share repurchases will substantially increase
earnings, we do not see the company catching up on its top-line growth. 

We expect revenue to decline by 7.8% in the current year, primarily due to low
growth in some segments, continued decline in hardware and rising pressures on
the services business. 

In the most recent quarter, IBM`s sales were down across the board and total
revenue declined 13.3% (down 7% when adjusted for currency) year over year,
impacted by a strong US dollar as well as the global recession. 

While we are impressed by the company`s strong liquidity position, operational
efficiency and improving profitability (IBM raised its 2009 EPS outlook from
$9.20 to $9.70), near-term visibility remains low given the lack of long-term
customer signing growth. 

Moreover, pricing pressure from rivals like Hewlett-Packard (HPQ), Dell Inc.
(DELL), Microsoft (MSFT), Cisco (CSCO) and others have hurt IBM`s business.
Higher profit on lower revenue indicates that the quality of IBM`s products may
deteriorate and damage its brand in the long term.

&lt;p&gt;LONDON, Sept 25 (Reuters) - Wall Street bank Goldman Sachs
(GS.N) said on Friday global oil consumption was recovering more
quickly than its previous estimates and raised its demand
forecast, while maintaining its price outlook.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Goldman said Chinese oil demand has risen to its levels
before the global economic recession, which was triggered by
financial crisis in the third quarter last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Accordingly, we are raising our demand forecasts," the bank
said in its commodities research note. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Importantly, the permanent damage from the credit crisis is
much less than we had previously thought, which means that we are
beginning the recovery from a higher base, suggesting a fourth
quarter 2009 demand level that we originally thought would take
until the third quarter 2010."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman now expect global oil demand to average 85.106
million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2009. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Demand will average 84.727 million bpd this year, a dip from
86.304 million bpd last year, then rise to 86.405 million bpd
next year, it said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The bank maintained its oil price forecast because the

&lt;p&gt;LA PAZ, Sept 27 (Reuters) - Indigenous groups and coca leaf farmers clashed over control of land in a national park in northern Bolivia, killing one person, local media reported on Sunday. Indian groups that have land rights in the remote Isiboro National Park in Beni have long complained that hundreds of coca leaf growers have been clearing forests inside their territory to grow coca, the raw material for cocaine. As a result of the clashes between Yuracare Indians ... (and) the illegal settlers that are illegally growing coca in their territory, a person was killed, presumably an Indian, and three more were injured, deputy interior minister Marcos Farfan was reported as saying by state news agency ABI. Farfan said that the person killed, as well as some of the injured, have bullet wounds and that the government has sent police to the area to prevent further violence. The coca leaf is legal in Bolivia, where Indians in the Andean highlands chew it to ward of the effects of altitude and as a mild stimulant. Cocaine is illegal in the country, but Bolivia is the third largest producer of cocaine in the world, after Colombia and Peru. Both the United States and the United Nations have reported that in 2008 coca leaf cultivation increased slightly in Bolivia. The U.S. State Department said this month that the Bolivian government of Evo Morales, a former coca grower, has failed to do enough to curb the drug trade in the past 12 months. Morales, the country's first president of indigenous descent, says his government is striving to fight the cocaine trade, but gives farmers the right to grow small plot of coca in certain regions. His policies toward coca farmers have been called permissive by the United States.  (Reporting by Eduardo Garcia; Editing by Fiona Ortiz)

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft today confirmed that it will launch its free security software suite, which has been in development for almost a year, Tuesday morning.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;"Microsoft Security Essentials, their highly anticipated no-cost consumer security offering, will be released to the public tomorrow, September 29," a company spokeswoman said in an e-mail reply to questions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The spokeswoman added that the program will be made available Tuesday morning, Pacific time, although she did not have a specific hour for the launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Earlier in the day, Network World 's John Fontana had been told by Bob Muglia, the president of Microsoft's sever and tools division, that the company would ship the free software Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security Essentials, which Microsoft offered to a limited number of beta testers last June, is the company's replacement for Windows Live OneCare, a for-a-fee security suite that was retired at the end of June 2009. Microsoft has pitched the software as a basic anti-virus, anti-spyware program that consumes less memory and disk space than commercial security suites, like those from vendors such as McAfee, Symantec and Trend Micro.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Those companies, however, unanimously dismissed Security Essentials -- once codenamed "Morro" -- as proof that Microsoft couldn't compete in the paying market.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;According to one researcher today, those security vendors have little to fear from Microsoft's giveaway. "It won't be the application that puts Symantec or McAfee out of business," said Andrew Storms, the director of security operations at nCircle Network Security. "...Microsoft still has to prove itself in this arena. Take, for example, Windows Defender, which has been free. It's not necessarily the best anti-spyware product available."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Storms also wondered how Microsoft's re-entry into the consumer security space would affect the relationships it's built with antivirus vendors, including those that involve the sharing of threat intelligence. "We've come to learn that Symantec and others have shared their threats and risk information with Microsoft in an effort to better protect all consumers. If Microsoft starts dipping into the market share of these partners, will it affect that intelligence sharing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The free Security Essentials will be available for Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 as a 4.7MB download from the Microsoft Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hackers have publicly released new attack code that exploits a critical bug in the Windows operating system, putting pressure on Microsoft to fix the flaw before it leads to a worm outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability has been known since Sept. 7, but until today the publicly available programs that leverage it to attack PCs haven't been able to do more than crash the operating system. A new attack, developed by Harmony Security Senior Researcher Stephen Fewer, lets the attacker run unauthorized software on the computer, in theory making it a much more serious problem. Fewer's code was added to the open-source Metasploit penetration testing kit on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two weeks ago, a small software company called Immunity developed its own attack code for the bug, but that code is available only to the company's paying subscribers. Metasploit, by contrast, can be downloaded by anyone, meaning the attack code is now much more widely available.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Metasploit developer HD Moore said Monday that the exploit works on Windows Vista Service Pack 1 and 2 as well as Windows 2008 SP1 server. It should also work on Windows 2008 Service Pack 2, he added in a Twitter message. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But the code may not be completely reliable. Immunity Senior Researcher Kostya Kortchinsky said that he could get the Metasploit attack to work only on the Windows Vista operating system running within a VMware virtual machine session. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;When he ran it on native Windows systems, it simply caused the machines to crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The attack "definitely works on at least some physical machines, but looks like it could use more testing," Moore said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Either way, the public release of this code should put Windows users on alert. Security experts worry that this code could be adapting to create a self-copying worm attack, much like last year's Conficker outbreak. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Unlike Conficker, however, this attack would not affect Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, or Windows 2000 systems.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That's because the underlying flaw that all of these programs exploit lies in the SMB (server message block) version 2 system, introduced in Vista. Microsoft has confirmed that Immunity's attack works on 32-bit versions of Vista and Windows Server 2008, but did not have any immediate comment on the Metasploit code.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The flaw has been patched in Windows 7, Kortchinsky said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Sept. 18, Microsoft released a Fix It tool that disables SMB 2, and the company said that it is working on a fix for the software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whether that patch will be ready in time for Microsoft's next set of security patches, due Oct. 13, remains to be seen.&lt;/p&gt;

into profits.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan, the second-largest U.S. bank, tops the "league
tables" for both equity and debt underwriting fees for the year
to date, at $1.6 billion and $1.1 billion respectively.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the first three quarters of last year, JPMorgan had
earned equity underwriting fees of $986 million and debt
underwriting fees of $1 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Bank of America Corp (BAC.N), the largest U.S. bank, ranks
second for debt underwriting, having taken in $963 million so
far this year, while Morgan Stanley ranks second for equity
underwriting, with $967 million in fees.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; RECORD ISSUANCE&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Companies raised $168.9 billion in debt globally in the
third quarter, taking the total for the first nine months of
2009 to a record $814.9 billion, the data showed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The combination of low interest rates and narrowing credit
spreads has made financing cheaper for companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It is not clear how long this will continue, however.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "My sense is that there's been a fair amount of issuance
that's been pulled forward from the fourth quarter to now to
take advantage of market conditions," said Jim Probert, head of
Americas investment-grade syndicate at Bank of America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "As a result, I think there's a good chance that supply
will begin to decline as we approach the end of the fourth
quarter because it's been pulled forward."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; And fees from debt and equity underwriting alone will not
make up for the slump in MA activity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Global investment banking fees including MA and loan fees
fell 34 percent in the third quarter compared with the second
quarter. Year-to-date fees are down 24 percent from last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There is hope, however, in the pipeline of planned equity
offerings, which now stands at $191.5 billion, according to the
Thomson Reuters data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Encouragement can also be found in the high-yield debt
markets. U.S. issuers raised $25.8 billion in this market in
the third quarter, up from $19.7 billion in the second, while
European issuers raised $9.6 billion, up from $2.8 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If we continue to see markets improving or even staying at
current levels, then you will likely see more high-yield and
emerging market issuers taking up any slack in the investment
grade pipeline," said Mark Lewellen, head of European corporate
origination at Barclays Capital.

&lt;p&gt;The just-released Technical Preview of Office Web Apps is a still-incomplete piece of work that points the way towards Microsoft's vision of integrating Web-based and client-based versions of Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it launches next year, Office Web Apps will consist of four applications: Excel, PowerPoint, Word and OneNote. In the Technical Preview, many features are missing from the apps, and some are more fully developed than others. For example, in Word you can only view documents, while in Excel you can create spreadsheets, edit them and collaborate with other users. OneNote isn't available at all yet.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even at launch there will still be some features missing. For example, only Excel and OneNote will allow co-authoring (letting multiple people collaborate on a document simultaneously). Neither Word nor PowerPoint will have those features at launch, although Microsoft says they will be added in the future.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Web Apps works on Internet Explorer (version 7 and later), as well as on Safari (version 4 and later) and Firefox (version 3.5 and later). Chrome is not supported. There was only one exception to this rule: If you're working on a document on Office Web Apps on your PC, and want to open that document locally in Microsoft Office on your PC, you'll need IE7 or later.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I used it on Windows, Mac and Linux platforms, and it worked the same on all three. You'll also need Microsoft Office 2003, 2007 or 2010 (also in Technical Preview) on your PC. On the Mac, you'll need Office 2008 or greater.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Understanding the different versions&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Just as there are different versions of Microsoft Office, there will be different versions of Office Web Apps:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * The consumer version, which is what I tested, will be free, although "free" will come at a price when it comes to the user experience, because it will include advertisements. There are no ads yet, and so no way to know whether they will be disruptive or barely noticeable. As of now, Microsoft has no plans for releasing a for-pay consumer version of Office Web Apps that will allow you to dispense with the ads.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;      The consumer version is tied to Microsoft SkyDrive, Microsoft's free online storage service. That's where you'll store, create, edit and share your Office Web Apps documents. The service lets you designate certain folders as private and others as shareable with people you specify or with anyone.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * The hosted version will be available to business customers who pay for hosted accounts on Microsoft Online Services, which is powered by SharePoint. No ads will be in the interface.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;    * The corporate, in-house version is for enterprises with volume licenses for Microsoft Office and a SharePoint server. In this version, enterprises will host Office Web Apps on their own SharePoint server. No ads will be in the interface. Enterprises will not have to pay extra for this; it will be part of the volume license for Microsoft Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Most of the features of these three versions will be identical, although there will be some minor differences. Besides ads, the consumer version will include a feature that allows publishing to third-party blogs, Web sites and wikis, something that the other two versions won't allow. The other versions, though, will track document lifecycles, allow for backup and restore, and give IT staff control over how the application is deployed and used.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Your Office home in the cloud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office Web Apps uses Microsoft's Windows Live SkyDrive online service as its home base. In order to use Web Office Apps, you navigate to a special area of SkyDrive, where you get 25 GB of free storage space.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;From here, you can go to a My Documents page where you can create new Office documents, upload files, create folders, and manage sharing and permissions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Click any document, and you'll see a screen that shows basic information about the document, including file size, the date it was created or uploaded, the last date it was worked on and so on. The page also lets people make comments about the document. You can view the document, edit it, download it to your computer, move it to a different folder, copy it and rename it.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once you start using it, Office Web Apps looks and feels much like the client-based version of Office; in fact, it looks more like a polished client application than a Web-based one. It displays Office documents in full fidelity so that they look exactly the same way online as they do on your PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excel&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excel is the furthest along of all the Web Apps in approaching the suite's final feature set and is currently the only app that lets multiple people work on a document at the same time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It looks much like the Office 2010 version of Excel (including the Ribbon that users tend to love or hate and the redesigned Office button in the upper left-hand part of the screen). In other words, if you use Excel 2007 or later, you already know how to use the Web App version. Creating a spreadsheet, inserting formulas, handling tables, recalculating the workbook, etc. work exactly the same in the Web App version as they do in the client version. When you import a worksheet, it looks exactly as it does on the client-based version, including charts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, it's also a very stripped-down version of Excel. There's no way to create or edit charts, for example, and most of Excel 2010's features -- such as advanced formulas, control of page layout, ability to mark up and review spreadsheets -- are missing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Office 2010 version of Excel has seven separate tabs on the ribbon; currently, the Web App version has only two, and those two don't have all the features that their equivalent tabs have in Office 2010. However, if you import a worksheet that has a chart, and you edit the underlying data for that chart, the chart will automatically change to reflect the new data, just as it does in the client version of Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I ran into a number of problems when I tested this version. I could not paste data or text into a spreadsheet, for example, a problem that presumably will be fixed further on in the development cycle. In addition, I was able to view but not edit .xls files -- currently, you can only edit files in the newer .xlsx format. The same holds true for PowerPoint and Word -- you can only edit .pptx and .docx files.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Excel is the only one of the Office Web Apps that has collaboration enabled, and it worked as advertised. I was able to work on the same spreadsheet on both a Mac and PC simultaneously, and was able to see the changes on each machine made on the other.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, there is no apparent way to lock the worksheet, which means that two people can work on the same cell simultaneously, overriding each other's work. In addition, when multiple people are working on a spreadsheet at the same time, the undo and redo functions do not work, making it more difficult to get the spreadsheet back to its original form. This is a problem that needs to be addressed in future versions.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;PowerPoint&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Technical Preview of PowerPoint has fewer features than Excel. Creating new presentations from the Web at this point is rudimentary, at best. You can't, for example, apply themes or backgrounds, use animations between slides, or, frankly, do much beyond creating new slides.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, adding new slides is exceptionally easy, and works much like it does in the client version of PowerPoint. And as with Excel, when you open documents that you created in the client version of PowerPoint, they look online exactly as they do when on your PC. You can also play presentations as a slideshow, and the presentation includes all the animations and special effects that you created in the client version of Office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As with Excel, you won't be able to edit files created with an older Office file format -- no .ppt files. Unlike in Excel, when you open a .ppt file for editing, you have the option of immediately converting the file to .pptx, without having to go through the process of saving the file. Still, it would be better if it supported the .ppt format, just as if it would have been better if the Office Web Apps version of Excel supported the .xls format.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Word and OneNote&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, there's very little to be said about Word, because you cannot create new Word documents or edit existing ones in the Technical Preview. All you can do is view files. As with Excel and PowerPoint, though, the viewer is excellent -- files look identical to the ones stored on your PC. At launch, Word will lack one important feature of Excel and PowerPoint-- no simultaneous editing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As for OneNote, it's not yet available in the Technical Preview, and as with Word, you won't be able to work simultaneously with others when it does launch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What's missing&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The biggest issue with Office Web Apps isn't what's here, but what's missing and will be missing at launch: the ability to synchronize your work in Office so that, wherever you are, you always have the latest versions of your documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For all of its look-and-feel mimicry of Microsoft Office, at heart the Web-based and the client-based versions of the software are surprisingly separate from one another. This lack of integration and synchronization will most likely lead to a great deal of confusion about where the latest version of a document is located.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The problem is that there is no automatic synchronization between your work on your local PC and your work in Office Web Apps. Let's say you create a document in Microsoft Office, and want to work on it later when you're away from your machine. Before you leave, you'll have to remember to upload the document to Office Web Apps; if you forget, it won't be available to you.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After you've worked on it online, when you return to your main machine you'll have to remember to download the document to work on it. If you forget and work on it locally, you'll be working on a local version which differs from the latest version, which is stored on the Web.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making matters worse is that when you upload a file from a PC to Office Web Apps, you're not given a warning if you upload a file that will overwrite the file that's already there. So it's very easy to overwrite newer work with older work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This is a very significant shortcoming, and if it remains this way it launch, it will be at least one way in which Office Web Apps will be inferior to Google Docs. In Google Docs, this integration between online and offline is built in; you're always working on the latest version of your document, no matter where you are. Synchronization is built in -- assuming you've installed the Google Gears app, which saves documents to your hard drive. (On the other hand, Google Docs has its own shortcomings compared to Office Web Apps, such as an inferior interface and an inability to create documents as sophisticated-looking as those created in Office. )&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What makes this deficiency all the more surprising is that Microsoft already has excellent synchronization technology that to a great extent solves this problem. Windows Live Sync automatically synchronizes files and folders among multiple PCs. If Microsoft were to link that synchronization to Office Web Apps, it could keep files in sync between your local hard disk and your Web-based SkyDrive store of information. However, at this point at least, that is not in the works.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, sharing documents with others is awkward at best. You can't share individual documents. Instead, you have to share entire folders -- every document in any given folder is either shared with others or not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The way you share is confusing as well, because it requires a multi-step process in which you can become easily lost. This is because it uses the SkyDrive interface for managing and sharing files. Microsoft would do well to change this before final release.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The bottom line&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, Office Web Apps is not much more than a glimmer of what the final version will be at launch. Based on what I saw, though, it will be a useful complement to the client-based version of Office. Its ability to display Office documents in all their fidelity is particularly noteworthy, as is the ability to work remotely on the same document with others. However, at this point it is not clear what features will be present or missing at launch, so it is too early to tell how powerful Office Web Apps will be when creating documents.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Despite that, it's already clear that the Web-based version of Office will find widespread use by almost everyone who now uses Office, not just for the Web-editing features but because it can be used to share documents with others.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, the lack of automated synchronization of files between local computers and the Web is a very serious shortcoming. Because of that, Office Web Apps will not be as useful as Google Apps for those who often work on documents from different locations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 28 (Reuters) - J.P. Morgan (JPM.N)
raised its forecast for 2010 oil prices by $1 a barrel to
$68.75 and by $5 a barrel to $70 for the fourth quarter of
2009, according a monthly report released last week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "We continue to expect prices to remain range bound...we
think OPEC will continue to produce, limiting our upside risk
and as such, we've only made a only modest upward revision our
price (forecast)," said Sung Yoo, oil strategist at J.P. Morgan
on a conference call Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Crude demand is will likely be pressured by low refinery
runs as refiners try to draw down the current glut of products
inventories, he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; However, escalating tensions between the West and Iran over
that nation's nuclear program could stoke concerns over
disruptions to crude supplies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Additional sanctions on Iran, including restrictions on
gasoline sales to the country, could prompt the country to
retaliate by reducing crude oil output.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "If there was a reduction of Iranian crude output, it would
be kind of muted given that OPEC currently has over 5 million
barrels per day of spare capacity," Yoo said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "The biggest risk would be any retaliation to the exports
traveling through the Strait of Hormuz," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some 40 percent of the world's globally traded oil passes
through the Strait of Hormuz.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; (Reporting by Rebekah Kebede; Editing by David Gregorio)

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft faces more criticism over the browser "ballet screen" proposal it made to European antitrust regulators, possibly delaying a deal, the Wall Street Journal said Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;According to a story published on the newspaper's Web site , the European Committee for Interoperable Systems (ECIS), a trade group whose members include Norwegian browser maker Opera Software, argued that the ballot screen concept would confuse users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In late July, Microsoft said it would give Windows users a chance to download rivals' browsers, part of its campaign this year to mollify the European Commission, the EU's antitrust agency, which filed charges in January 2009 accusing the company of shielding Internet Explorer (IE) from competition by bundling it with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A key part of that plan would be a "ballot screen" that EU Windows users would see if IE was set as the default browser. Under Microsoft's proposal, the ballot would offer links to downloads of Mozilla's Firefox, Apple's Safari, Google's Chrome and Opera's flagship Opera.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;This summer, the commission issued questionnaires to those competitors, as well as to computer makers and others, asking for opinions on the Microsoft proposal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although at least one rival browser maker, U.S.-based Mozilla, has said it wanted changes made to Microsoft's proposal , the ECIS is the first to publicly acknowledge it has officially informed the commission of its concerns.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Choosing another browser requires "the user to confirm and answer threatening and confusing warnings and questions," Thomas Vinje, an attorney and spokesman for the ECIS, told the Journal . "Microsoft has cunningly found a way to accept the commission's suggestion of a ballot screen, but to do so in a way that will be entirely ineffective."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vinje did not reply to a request Sunday for further comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Under Microsoft's proposal , Windows 7 users would receive an update starting Oct. 22, the new operating system's official launch date, or two weeks after the commission rules, whichever comes later. Windows XP and Vista users will be on a slower schedule: Microsoft said it would give them the ballot screen three to six months after EU regulators sign off on the plan.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In April, the ECIS was granted "interested third party" status in the case, allowing it to obtain the EU's charges against Microsoft and to comment on the action. Previously, both Mozilla , which makes Firefox, and Google , the creator of Chrome, had also been awarded the same status.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera Software was already involved in the case; it's December 2007 complaint to the commission sparked the antitrust investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ECIS's criticisms may put the brakes on a deal, which EU officials had hinted last week might be near. Neelie Kroes, the head of the EU's antitrust agency, told the New York Times on Sept. 22 that she hoped to "close that dossier," referring to the Microsoft browser case, before her term expires at the end of October. A resolution before then may be more difficult against opposition, especially if the ECIS's comments have been echoed by Microsoft's competitors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For its part, Microsoft remained committed to the position it has staked out since it first offered the ballot screen. "In July, we made a new proposal to address EU competition law issues related to Internet Explorer and interoperability," said Microsoft spokesman Kevin Kutz in an e-mail reply to questions. "The commission welcomed our proposal and announced it would assess its effectiveness. We continue to look forward to the next steps in this process."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While European antitrust officials only have the power to enforce a ballot screen decree in the EU, both Opera and Mozilla have argued that the deal should be extended to Windows users worldwide .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Last month, for example, John Lilly, Mozilla's chief executive, joined Opera in urging just that. "My hope is that whether or not the commission and Microsoft decide to revise the proposal, that Microsoft will take [our concerns] to heart," Lilly said at the time. "It's all about what makes it best for the users, so hopefully Microsoft will take that into account and do this not just in the EU, but that it starts to look like this across the world."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Representatives of the EU's antitrust agency did not immediately reply to a request for comment early today.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;LONDON (Reuters) - Solvay's 4.5 billion euro ($6.6 billion) drug unit sale to Abbott Laboratories has wrongfooted Wall Street heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs, who had stood to earn tens of millions of dollars from rival bidder Nycomed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Abbott (ABT.N) said it would buy the pharmaceutical arm of Solvay, its Belgian development partner, ending a months-long auction run by Citigroup (C.N), Morgan Stanley (MS.N) and Rothschild ROT.UL.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Abbott's only adviser, Barclays Plc (BARC.L) unit Barclays Capital, may earn $25-$28 million, according to estimates from MA consultancy Freeman  Co. Solvay's (SOLB.BR) banks will split about $29-$32 million for their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The deal, struck over the weekend, gives Abbott full control of cholesterol treatments TriLipix and Tricor and a bigger footprint in emerging markets.

&lt;p&gt;  EMERYVILLE, CA, Sep 28 (MARKET WIRE) -- 

News Facts

    -- The SANS Institute September report,  "The Top Cyber Security Risks"
has rocked the IT security world by stating that neglecting the
fundamentals of prompt and thorough patch and management for client-side
application software poses the highest priority threat to the integrity
of enterprise information security.

    -- According to SANS, large organizations typically take at least twice as
long to patch client-side vulnerabilities compared to patching operating
system vulnerabilities. From this, SANS concludes, "The highest priority
risk is getting less attention than the lower priority risk."

    -- The  IBM X-Force Mid Year Trend and Risk Report, reconfirms points
made in the SANS report, describing how hackers launch increasingly
sophisticated blended threats to target data they can monetize
immediately.

    -- Both studies validate BigFix's approach to security and vulnerability
management processes -- the need to provide customers with a consolidated,
single-pane-of-glass approach to address the complete asset discovery,
vulnerability assessment and remediation lifecycle across heterogeneous,
widely distributed enterprise IT infrastructures.

    -- BigFix Security and Vulnerability Management offers enterprise
customers unrivaled ability to quickly close windows of vulnerability
against Internet-borne and other types of threats.

    Background and Context

    -- The rising volume and increasing sophistication of Internet-borne
attacks on enterprise information technology infrastructures has outpaced
the abilities of one-tool-per-threat approaches to IT security in
providing effective protection.

    -- The application problem is complicated by the fact that enterprise
computers may run a wide variety of applications from many vendors. Not
only is it imperative that IT departments learn of new threats to their
environments early in an "epidemic," but they also must access remediation
content quickly, identify vulnerable assets, and install patches and
updates promptly.

    -- BigFix has gained recognition as being ahead of the curve in
understanding the security configuration management crisis and
evangelizing the enterprise IT community to reassess and reinforce the
fundamentals of information security: real-time visibility into IT asset
bases, fast and thorough remediation of vulnerabilities, ability to
project this visibility and control across widely heterogeneous
environments from 100s to 100,000s of endpoints.

    -- Recent BigFix contributions to the industry knowledge base on this
subject include several Beyond the Perimeter Podcasts, in particular,
Episode 50: "Information Security and the Application Stack," with BigFix
CTO Amrit Williams and Adobe Systems director of security and privacy
Brad Arkin. BigFix has also recorded a SANS Tool Talk,  "Staying Ahead of
the Latest Endpoint Security Threats" featuring BigFix senior director of
product marketing Sandy Hawke and IBM Internet Security Systems director
of marketing Mark Zadelhoff.

    Supporting Quotes

    Amrit Williams, Beyond the Perimeter host and BigFix CTO, said, "While
it's not always the sexiest side of security, patch management is one of
the most critical aspects of an organization's overall security program.
Unfortunately, despite vendors working diligently to combat
vulnerabilities with patches and enterprises incorporating them, those
efforts are often in vain because the end user doesn't apply it. These
days, leaving patch installation in the end users hand is as safe and
effective as installing a top-of-the-line security system at a bank but
leaving open the vault door."

&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Quentin Webb&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; LONDON, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Solvay's 4.5 billion euro ($6.6
billion) drug unit sale to Abbott Laboratories has wrongfooted
Wall Street heavyweights such as Goldman Sachs, who had stood to
earn tens of millions of dollars from rival bidder Nycomed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; On Monday, Abbott (ABT.N) said it would buy the
pharmaceutical arm of Solvay, its Belgian development partner,
ending a months-long auction run by Citigroup (C.N), Morgan
Stanley (MS.N) and Rothschild [ROT.UL].&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Abbott's only adviser, Barclays Plc (BARC.L) unit Barclays
Capital, may earn $25-$28 million, according to estimates from
MA consultancy Freeman  Co. Solvay's (SOLB.BR) banks will
split about $29-$32 million for their work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The deal, struck over the weekend, gives Abbott full control
of cholesterol treatments TriLipix and Tricor and a bigger
footprint in emerging markets. [ID:nLS426471]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Plastics and chemicals producer Solvay said in April it was
reviewing its pharmaceuticals business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Interested parties have included an initially unreceptive
Abbott, the private-equity-owned Nycomed [NYCMD.UL], Takeda
(4502.T) of Japan and Solvay's domestic rival UCB (UCB.BR),
according to people familiar with the matter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; HIGH-YIELD&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nycomed, the Swiss drugmaker whose owners include Nordic
Capital and Credit Suisse (CSGN.VX) unit DLJ Merchant Banking,
for a long time appeared a frontrunner.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It submitted a bid of about 4-4.5 billion euros, including
contingent payments, in early September, people familiar with
the matter have said.
 Nycomed devised a financing package compatible with its
already high leverage that would have used bridge loans, quickly
refinanced with a similar quantity of high-yield bonds in
dollars and euros.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A deal with $2 billion of bridge loans and bonds would have
yielded advisers up to $75 million, Freeman reckons: $25-$28
million for mergers and acquisitions (MA) advice, $10-$15
million in loan fees and $24-$32 million for bond underwriting.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman Sachs (GS.N) was joined at the last minute by Lazard
(LAZ.N) as an MA adviser to Nycomed, with JPMorgan (JPM.N),
Bank of America Merrill Lynch (BAC.N), Credit Suisse and
Deutsche Bank (DBKGn.DE) all working on Nycomed's financing,
people familiar with the matter say.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In contrast, Abbott has a rock-solid AA credit rating from
Standard  Poor's, and the U.S. drugmaker is funding the deal
from available cash, meaning no lucrative follow-on fees for
Barclays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NOT INTERESTED&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Barclays could have had no deal at all. In July Abbott
signalled it was not keen on Solvay Pharmaceuticals, saying it
was already strong enough in the class of drugs that includes
the blockbuster Tricor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Like a lot of things, your interest in a given property or
asset evolves over time. Early on we were not interested,"
Abbott Chief Executive Miles White told a conference call on
Monday, adding that Solvay's "great strategic fit" became
apparent only more recently.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Healthcare deals have proved an increasingly important
source of income for banks as the credit crisis has crimped
overall MA.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Pfizer's $68 billion purchase of Wyeth is this year's
biggest announced takeover, and fees from the healthcare sector
have risen to 6.8 percent of completed MA fees this year,
Freeman says, the highest proportion since 2004.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Solvay's banks may also get more follow-on work advising on
chemicals and plastics deals.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Solvay said it would reinvest some of the proceeds in
"sizeable external growth" in these sectors, expanding
geographically and looking to make itself less exposed to
economic fluctuations.
 Nycomed's advisers may not go entirely empty-handed; in the
medium term it remains keen on an initial public offering that
will value the company in the billions of euros. [ID:nLM321849]

&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Norwegian browser maker Opera urged European Union antitrust regulators on Monday not to rush to close its antitrust case against Microsoft before ensuring a level playing field among browsers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a newspaper interview last week that she was keen to reach a deal with Microsoft before her term ends this year. A settlement would end the company's decade-long dispute with the European Commission.

We think the current solution on the table will not be an effective settlement," he said. "We think they need to hear and listen to our comments."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Opera in December 2007 complained to the Commission about Microsoft's tying of its Internet Explorer browser to its Windows operating system, triggering formal charges from the Commission against Microsoft in January this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The EU competition watchdog is now reviewing feedback from Microsoft's rivals and other interested parties on the U.S. software company's proposal to install a ballot screen that would give users the chance to choose its competitors' Web browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Wium Lie said other browser makers also backed Opera on the issue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Google and Mozilla are in line with this.

That is what Windows users are used to getting."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He also said computer makers could remove the ballot screen under Microsoft's proposed implementation -- before consumers get to see the browser option.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Commission has to date slapped a total 1.68 billion euros in fines on Microsoft for infringing EU antitrust rules.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee, editing by Jason Neely)&lt;/p&gt;

Here are highlights from Friday`s Analyst Blog:

Citi to Trim U.S. Branches

Citigroup, Inc. (C) plans to scale back its U.S. retail footprint to just six
major metropolitan areas and limit lending mostly to wealthy customers. 

Citigroup, one of the biggest recipients of government bailout money, is looking
to limit its overall consumer lending in the U.S. primarily to credit cards and
"jumbo" mortgages, catering largely to well-heeled customers. 

The company`s executives are expected to present their plans to the board of
directors in October to trim the retail branch network and concentrate mainly on
the New York, Washington, D.C., Miami, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles
areas. 

Citi has a global footprint with its branches located internationally. The
company currently operates about 1,000 U.S. branches, significantly lower than
the 5,000-plus run by Bank of America Corporation (BAC), Wells Fargo (WFC) and
JP Morgan Chase &amp; Co. (JPM), which expanded its network with the takeover of
Washington Mutual last year. 

Citi is also considering the sale of its 120 branches in Texas and is mulling
whether it should maintain a major presence in cities like Boston and
Philadelphia. Citi holds few deposits in those locations compared with
competitors.

&lt;p&gt; (Repeats to additional subscribers with no changes to text)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; 
&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;BRUSSELS, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Norwegian browser maker Opera
(OPERA.OL) urged European Union antitrust regulators on Monday
not to rush to close its antitrust case against Microsoft
(MSFT.O) before ensuring a level playing field among browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; European Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said in a
newspaper interview last week that she was keen to reach a deal
with Microsoft before her term ends this year. A settlement
would end the company's decade-long dispute with the European
Commission.
"We are slightly concerned about perhaps a premature
settlement in this case," Opera's Chief Technology Officer Hakon
Wium Lie told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We are also eager to close the case but we want to make
sure the settlement is effective. We think the current solution
on the table will not be an effective settlement," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Opera had in December 2007 complained to the Commission
about Microsoft's tying of its Internet Explorer browser to its
Windows operating system, triggering formal charges from the
Commission against Microsoft in January this year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The EU competition watchdog is now reviewing feedback from
Microsoft's rivals and other interested parties on the U.S.
software company's proposal to install a ballot screen that
would give users the chance to choose its competitors' Web
browsers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Commission has to date slapped a total 1.68 billion
euros in fines on Microsoft for infringing EU antitrust rules.

CCE Methodology

The CCE index captures business-to-business purchases to acquire goods and
services used in production, wholesale and retail purchases of final goods,
business capital expenditures and government spending on goods and services.
Adjustments are made to exclude capitalized expenditures such as construction
and durable defense spending. Calculations measure transactions at basic prices
which include taxes on production. Retroactive adjustments are made as necessary
to include revisions in officially published statistics and economic data for
current and prior years. 

Data sources used to calculate the U.S. CCE index include the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA) and U.S. Census Bureau, which conducts the Retail and Wholesale
Trade Surveys. A variety of data sources were used in the calculation of the
Global CCE index including the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), the Eurostat database, the STructural ANalysis (STAN)
database, the General Government Accounts from the National Accounts of OECD
Countries, the United Nations Statistics Division National Accounts Main
Aggregates Database, Economist Intelligence Unit proprietary databases and
government data from several countries. A model developed by the Economist
Intelligence Unit was used to estimate results for countries where government
data was unavailable.

CCE Methodology

The CCE index captures business-to-business purchases to acquire goods and
services used in production, wholesale and retail purchases of final goods,
business capital expenditures and government spending on goods and services.
Adjustments are made to exclude capitalized expenditures such as construction
and durable defense spending. Calculations measure transactions at basic prices,
which include taxes on production. Retroactive adjustments are made as necessary
to include revisions in officially published statistics and economic data for
current and prior years. 

Data sources used to calculate the U.S. CCE index include the Bureau of Economic
Analysis (BEA) and U.S. Census Bureau, which conducts the Retail and Wholesale
Trade Surveys. A variety of data sources were used in the calculation of the
Global CCE index including the Organization for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD), the Eurostat database, the STructural ANalysis (STAN)
database, the General Government Accounts from the National Accounts of OECD
Countries, the United Nations Statistics Division National Accounts Main
Aggregates Database, Economist Intelligence Unit proprietary databases and
government data from several countries. A model developed by the Economist
Intelligence Unit was used to estimate results for countries where government
data was unavailable.

&lt;p&gt;QINGDAO, Sept 28 (Reuters) - China's Chuandongbei gas
project, in which U.S. oil major Chevron Corp (CVX.N) has a 49
percent stake, expects first gas production in 2010, a Chinese
industry official said on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron and leading Chinese oil company CNPC, parent of
PetroChina (0857.HK), entered a 30-year product sharing contract
in Dec 2007 to develop the high-sulphur gas field using
technology from Chevron, which will be the operator of the field.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Chuandongbei block, in southwestern Sichuan province, has
proven gas reserves of 176 billion cubic metre (bcm) and
companies said in 2007 that they planned to process the gas at
two plants with total capacity of 740 million cubic feet per day,
or 7.6 bcm a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Speaking at a seminar on the sidelines of the U.S.-China
energy forum, Yan Cunzhang, president of PetroChina's foreign
cooperation administration also said CNPC's joint venture with
French major Total ToTF.PA was on track to develop Sulige gas
field in northern China.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; CNPC and Total would submit to the National Development 
Reform Commission by end of October the overall development plan
for Sulige South gas block in Inner Mongolia region that covers
nearly 2,400 square km, Yan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The project is expected to reach a plateu production of 3 bcm
from 2012 for 15 years, the companies have said.

&lt;p&gt;AMSTERDAM, Sept 28 (Reuters) - Dutch investor Louis
Reijtenbagh's family has reached a settlement with JPMorgan
Chase  Co over the family's art collection, a Dutch newspaper
reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Reijtenbagh had put up the collection, which includes works
by Rembrandt and Picasso, as collateral for loans but was later
sued by JPMorgan Chase  Co, as well as ABN AMRO, for selling or
moving paintings.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan dropped its claims on the art, which includes a
17th-century Dutch masterpiece, Gerrit Adriaensz Berckheyde's
"Golden Bend" after Reijtenbagh repaid a loan, the Financieele
Dagblad reported on Monday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The Netherlands' largest museum was at risk of losing the
famous painting, which it had bought from Reijtenbagh last year.
[ID:nLH636196]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The painting was on a list of art collateral used to back
the JPMorgan loan. JPMorgan contended that Reijtenbagh
unlawfully moved a portion of the art collection out of the
United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Last Friday, Dutch news agency ANP-Reuters reported that ABN
AMRO had seized more than 60 pieces from Reijtenbagh's
collection.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp paid its chief executive Steve Ballmer 5.5 percent less for the last fiscal year as the world's biggest software company suffered its first ever drop in annual sales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ballmer, CEO since 2000, earned a total of $1,276,627 for fiscal year 2009, which ended June 30, according to a filing with securities regulators on Tuesday. That is slightly below the previous fiscal year's total of $1,350,834.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer's salary of $665,833 was up slightly from last year, but his bonus was slashed by $100,000 to $600,000. At his own request, Ballmer receives no compensation in the form of Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft lowered compensation for most of its highest-level executives in the last fiscal year. It said in January that it had frozen salaries for fiscal 2010 which started July 1, in response to the difficult economic climate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The company suffered its first-ever drop in annual revenue in fiscal 2009 and operating profit fell 9 percent to $20.4 billion. Its shares fell 13.6 percent over the 12-month period.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even in good times, Microsoft has never made a splash with huge pay packages, although many of its employees and executives have become millionaires by owning Microsoft shares.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ballmer himself owns about 408 million Microsoft shares, according to Tuesday's filing, worth more than $10 billion.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; editing by Carol Bishopric)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft Corp did not infringe a patent held by anti-piracy software maker Uniloc Inc, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday, nullifying an earlier $388 million damages award against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision, by U.S. District Judge William Smith, means Microsoft does not need to pay what would have been one of the largest damages awarded in a civil patent case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased that the court has vacated the jury verdict and entered judgment in favor of Microsoft," said Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A call to Uniloc was not immediately returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uniloc USA and its Singapore-based parent originally filed suit against Microsoft in 2003, claiming that Microsoft infringed its patent with security software it was using to prevent unlicensed use of its Windows XP operating system and parts of its Office suite of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six years of legal wrangling culminated in a trial earlier this year, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island found in favor of Uniloc in April, awarding the large damages against Microsoft.

&lt;p&gt;Although one of the top consumer security vendors welcomed Microsoft's Security Essentials to the market, another dismissed the new free software as a "poor product" that will "never be up to snuff."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Earlier today, Microsoft launched Security Essentials , its free antivirus and antispyware software suite, which has been in development for almost a year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think it's a good thing that they're in the market," said Carol Carpenter, the general manager of Trend Micro's consumer division. "We look forward to the competition ... and I think Microsoft's targeting of developing countries and the unprotected is a good approach."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft has pitched Security Essentials, which replaced the now-defunct for-a-fee Windows OneCare, as basic software suitable for users who can't, or won't, pay for security software.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not everyone, however, agreed with Carpenter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Security Essentials won't change anything," said Jens Meggers, Symantec's vice president of engineering. "Microsoft has a really bad track record in security," he added, ticking off several ventures into consumer security that the giant has tried, including Windows Defender, an anti-spyware tool bundled with Windows Vista and Windows 7; the released-monthly Malicious Software Removal Tool; and OneCare.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Like OneCare, Security Essentials is a poor product," said Meggers. "It has very average detection rates. And now they've decided to go for the free market, but that's a very crowded market. There's not much room to grow there."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a company blog, another Symantec employee called Security Essentials a "rerun" of OneCare , and said: "At the end of the day, Microsoft Security Essentials is a rerun no one should watch."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It's no surprise that top-tier security vendors like Trend Micro and Symantec dismissed Security Essentials today. They did the same thing last year, when Microsoft announced the upcoming demise of OneCare and said it would ship a free, streamlined product. At the time, a Symantec executive said it was a capitulation by Microsoft, which was tacitly admitting it couldn't compete .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Meggers' take today was even more bearish. "We don't like the notion of 'basic,'" he said. "That makes me very worried, because the risk on the Web today is far too high for 'basic.' Tossing a bunch of little basic tools into the computing environment doesn't make it safe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Even Carpenter had some unkind words for Microsoft. "It's better to use something than to use nothing, but you get what you pay for," she said. "But I don't think it will worry the main security vendors. If I were a free, focused security company, trying to get my upsell over time, like AVG [Technologies], then I'd be concerned."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Symantec's Meggers also wondered what took Microsoft so long to come up with Security Essentials. "It takes them an entire year to remove features from OneCare, to make something even worse than OneCare?" Meggers asked. "I could have done that with three developers in three months."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And that's a good clue that Microsoft won't be able to keep up with the likes of Symantec, Trend Micro and McAfee, Meggers added. "Look how long it took them to build it. Security needs constant innovation. When was the last time that Microsoft innovated?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The free Security Essentials can be downloaded for Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 from the Microsoft Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

was sued on Tuesday by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission, which accused the bank of discriminating against
women by paying them less than men and subjecting them to a
"sexually hostile" work environment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The federal lawsuit alleged that JPMorgan fired Aimee
Doneyhue, who worked in a Columbus, Ohio office, after she
alleged the second-largest U.S. bank made it more difficult for
women than men to earn commissions and bonuses, and subjected
women to verbal harassment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It said the New York-based bank retaliated against Doneyhue
by subjecting her to ridicule, including telling her that she
was an "idiot," and fired her after learning from her that she
had consulted with the EEOC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The complaint seeks to recover back pay and other losses
suffered by Doneyhue and other women, punitive damages, an end
to practices that discriminate on the basis of gender, and
other remedies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; JPMorgan spokesman Joe Evangelisti declined to comment.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The case is EEOC v. JPMorgan Chase Bank NA, U.S. District
Court, Southern District of Ohio (Columbus), No. 09-711.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK (Reuters) - JPMorgan Chase  Co has reshuffled the leadership at its investment bank, naming a new chief executive who could eventually succeed Jamie Dimon as head at the No. 2 U.S. bank, in a shake-up that surprised many analysts and investors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan said Jes Staley, current head of the bank's key asset management unit, will become the chief executive of the investment bank. Dimon, 53, is not expected to leave any time soon, but Staley's promotion makes him a front- runner to succeed him, a person close to JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This sends the message that they have a deep bench and executives in place in the event Jamie Dimon were to depart," said Bill Fitzpatrick, an analyst at Optique Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making way for Staley to take over at the investment bank, co-CEO Bill Winters will leave the firm and the other co-CEO, Steve Black, will stay on only for the transition as executive chairman of the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jamie is a little young to be thinking about succession at this point," said Nancy Bush, an analyst and founder of NAB Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Dimon joins other Wall Street banks in firming up succession plans as the easing of the financial crisis gives him time to think about the future and as regulators step up scrutiny of bank governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The timing was right to begin the succession process," Dimon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley, 53, has held high-profile roles since he joined the bank 30 years ago as an economics graduate from Bowdoin College. He spent 20 years in the investment bank -- including nine years in the Latin America division -- and headed equity capital markets before becoming CEO of the private bank and then taking on the asset management operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other achievements, Staley persuaded Dimon in 2004 to take a stake in hedge fund Highbridge Capital, which has seen assets under management triple over the past five years, Duff McDonald wrote in his recent book about Jamie Dimon, "Last Man Standing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Callahan Erdoes, 42, chief executive of JPMorgan's private bank, succeeds Staley as head of asset management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WINTERS OUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winters and Black were deeply involved in the acquisition and integration of Bear Stearns Cos. Like Dimon, they did not receive a cash bonus for last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a meeting behind closed doors in London last week, Winters blamed "greedy bankers, investors and borrowers" for the financial crisis, according to a U.K. newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winters and Black have been investment bank co-CEOs since 2004 -- something of a record on Wall Street, where appointing co-heads often creates a power struggle, leaving just one head standing. Black focused mainly on credit and trading from the London office, while Winters, based in New York, focused on investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's investment bank largely avoided the complex debt securities linked to subprime mortgages that caused large losses for its rivals over the last two years. At the same time, it has become a major force for both debt and equity underwriting, topping third-quarter "league tables" according to preliminary data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winters' plans were unclear, but two people who have worked with him said his strong background in management and his experience during some of the worst days of the financial crisis will stand him in good stead if he seeks a management job elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUCCESSORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, a former protege of Citigroup Inc architect Sandy Weill, is regarded as a star on Wall Street who has led JPMorgan through face-changing acquisitions, including Bear Stearns and failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, ousted unceremoniously from Citigroup in 1998, may be looking to avoid the errors of his former mentor. Weill said in McDonald's "Last Man Standing," "I think I made a very bad decision on succession." Citigroup has struggled since Weill's departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As regulators scrutinize the boards and management teams of banks in the wake of the financial crisis, other banks have recently laid out succession plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think for every large bank there clearly is an increased regulatory pressure to have some kind of succession plan in place," said Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley said earlier this month James Gorman, 51, will take over from John Mack as chief executive on Jan 1.

&lt;p&gt; * Coca-Cola developing new "Freestyle" soda fountain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Aims to grow sales by offering wider choice to consumers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Matthew Bigg&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ATLANTA, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Coca-Cola Co (CCE.N) is to
expand testing of a new "Freestyle" soft drink fountain it
hopes will boost sales by allowing consumers to choose among
more than 100 of its drinks, company officials said on
Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The fountain uses touch-screen technology and smaller
quantities of concentrate in cartridges rather than in 5-gallon
boxes to expand the range of drinks on sale. Traditional soda
fountains allow customers to choose from about eight drinks.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "It (the new fountain) broadens the exposure for our brands
and gives us a chance to drive significant growth to our
customers," said Chandra Stephens-Albright, group director for
marketing and business development.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company will expand testing of the beta-phase product
in Atlanta, where there are currently 37 fountains including at
some AMC cinemas and Burger King BKC.N restaurants, as well
as in San Diego and Orange Counties in southern California.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Coca-Cola began design of the Freestyle in part in response
to a perceived problem: 30 percent of people at restaurants do
not buy a beverage at all, in part because they cannot get the
drink that they want.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We were capturing a smaller share of consumption because
we did not offer choices and at the same time the portfolio was
growing dramatically as we created new beverages," said Gene
Farrell, vice president of the Jet Innovation Program at
Coca-Cola North America.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Soda fountains account for about 30 percent of total Coke
product sales in North America, officials said. They declined
to put a dollar figure on the sales.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Some 45 percent of the outlets that have soda fountain
agreements with the company could support the Freestyle but
those outlets represent about 85 percent of sales in that area,
Farrell said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales have risen as much as 20 percent in some outlets
where the new fountain is being tested, though officials said
it was too early to draw firm conclusions on how the fountain
could affect sales in the long term.

&lt;p&gt;CINCINNATI--(Business Wire)--
General Electric Co. (NYSE: GE) saw an unusual bullish option spread earlier
today. At about 10:20 a.m. Eastern time, 15,330 GE November 16 puts traded on
the International Securities Exchange (ISE) for the bid price of $0.71, or $71
per contract. 

At the same time on the same exchange, another 15,330 contracts traded on the GE
November 18 call for the ask price of $0.67, or $67 per contract. Open interest
at both strikes was far less than today's volume, indicating that the puts were
sold to open and the calls were bought to open, thus initiating a bullish credit
spread on GE.

&lt;p&gt;CRANBURY, N.J.--(Business Wire)--
Visionet is launching the next generation of VisiMigrate, its Lotus
Notes-to-Microsoft SharePoint (MOSS) application migration tool, at the
Microsoft SharePoint Conference 2009 being held at the Mandalay Bay Convention
Center in Las Vegas from October 19 - 22nd. Visionet will be at Booth # 904. 

Earlier versions of VisiMigrate focused on groupware content migration from
Lotus Notes databases and applications to the Microsoft SharePoint platform
(MOSS). The VisiMigrate Version 2.0 toolset goes beyond mere content and data
migration and takes the leap forward to transform Lotus Notes applications into
SharePoint based web-applications. 

VisiMigrate works by creating custom SharePoint form templates that mirror
existing Lotus Notes form layouts and translating Lotus Script and formula based
business logic into Microsoft .Net code snippets. Then it packages the forms and
translated code into a Microsoft Visual Studio project that the developers can
use to quickly complete the application conversion process. 

Integral to this new version of the software is the companion assessment
application. This added feature creates an inventory of all Lotus Notes
applications and analyzes their contents to produce a conversion roadmap that
identifies the portions of the application that can be readily transformed into
SharePoint forms and Microsoft .Net code. It also estimates the manual effort
required to completely modernize the Lotus Notes application into a web-based
SharePoint application. 

More information about VisiMigrate is available at http://www.2SharePoint.com.

respectively.

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Environmental software company Village Green Global Inc is joining the dash in the market to track carbon footprints, partnering with software giant Microsoft Corp to capture the business of cities and local governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon tracking is a small but fast-growing market with companies like SAP AG and Johnson Controls Inc among those offering tools to monitor environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the formation of Village Green's U.S. unit this year, company Chief Executive Doug Smith said it plans to take 40 percent of the U.S. market for carbon-tracking software and become the market leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no point being second," Smith told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village Green started in Victoria, Australia in 2002 as an environmental consultancy and has done work in Malaysia, Ireland and the Middle East. Now it is now honing in on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at the U.S. alone in relation to stimulus funding in the clean tech sector, auditing is worth $2 (billion) to $5 billion," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The privately held company plans to become the U.S. market leader within two to five years, Smith said. It has an office in Palo Alto, California and is building a staff of 250.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village Green expects the industry to create 68,000 jobs for environmental auditors who work with the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TEAM WORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the partnership, Microsoft agents will offer Village Green's software as a carbon tracking tool to its public sector clients through its indirect sales model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said by working the public sector, Village Green can also reach small business communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Local government potentially (will be) picking up licenses for their business customers and they're providing the tools for their small businesses, so they can go online and do it for themselves," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village Green's tool, called SMARTWeb, tracks electricity use, water consumption, transportation, natural gas, waste and other factors to find ways to save energy and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village Green's customers save an average of 15 to 20 percent on their energy consumption "without spending any money, looking solely at how the staff uses the equipment in the building," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two main factors driving the U.S. market are corporate social responsibility and government policy, Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by Groom Energy Solutions, a U.S. firm that helps companies reduce energy consumption, estimated that about half the Fortune 500 companies have calculated their carbon footprints, compared with just 4 percent five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, new federal environmental regulations will require large emitters of heat-trapping emissions to start collecting data on greenhouse gases, under a reporting system the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Miszewski, Microsoft's general manager for its worldwide public sector, said the carbon-tracking market's growth depends in part what happens at the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel we're on the cusp of a very large market here that is about to be born in Copenhagen," Miszewski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope the current market size will be multiplying going forward and not only will we be working to protect the environment but also the global economy with sustainable green-oriented jobs," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Laura Isensee; Editing Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;QUITO, Sept 29 (Reuters) - A court in the Ecuadorean jungle
region where giant U.S. oil producer Chevron Corp (CVX.N) faces
a $27 billion environmental damages suit has named a new judge
to hear the case, after the previous one quit amid a bribery
scandal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; Chevron accused judge Juan Nunez of being involved in a $3
million bribery scheme. The company offered secretly videotaped
footage as evidence, shot with cameras hidden in a watch and a
pen, which prompted a local investigation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Nunez denied any wrongdoing but requested that he be taken
off the case. He has been replaced in the matter by Nicolas
Zambrano, according to an order released on Tuesday by the
Court of Sucumbios province.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Indigenous communities have accused Texaco, which Chevron
bought in 2001, of damaging the environment and their health
while operating petroleum facilities in the country's Amazon
region. Chevron denies the charges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company no longer has operations in Ecuador, where
leftist President Rafael Correa says he sides with the
plaintiffs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron accuses Correa's government of meddling in the
16-year-old case.

&lt;p&gt;         * Government sends letters to SADC member states          * Could boycott contact group meeting                    By Alain Iloniaina          ANTANANARIVO, Sept 29 (Reuters) - Madagascar said on Tuesday it may refuse visas to officials from the Southern African Development Community after African nations blocked the island's leader from addressing the U.N. General Assembly last week.          Prime Minister Monja Roindefo told Reuters he had sent letters to SADC member states represented on the Indian Ocean island to demand an explanation, as well as a letter of protest to the U.N. headquarters.          For now, we will leave it at that. Further actions (regarding visas) will depend on the responses we receive to our demands for an explanation, Roindefo said.          Andry Rajoelina, who seized power in a March coup, was barred from speaking at the U.N. summit following a chaotic vote tabled by the regional bloc.          SADC mediators, led by Mozambique's former President Joaquim Chissano, are expected in Madagascar for an International Contact Group meeting on Oct. 6.          The meeting to try to revive a power-sharing deal which the opposition, SADC and some foreign powers say Rajoelina broke when he unilaterally formed a government earlier this month.          The former DJ toppled former leader Marc Ravalomanana after weeks of street protests, triggering months of instability and social unrest which have alarmed foreign investors and hurt growth on the oil and mineral-rich island.          Close allies of the three opposition movement leaders -- Ravalomanana and former presidents Didier Ratsiraka and Albert Zafy -- say the trio remain committed to establishing a unity government.          Rajoelina's diplomatically isolated government has said it is considering boycotting the Oct. 6 meeting.          If this meeting looks likely to do nothing for Madagascar, or looks set to block things further then we will not participate, Roindefo said.          August's power-sharing deal, signed in Mozambique, collapsed after the country's power-brokers failed to agree on who should hold key posts, with Rajoelina demanding both the presidency and office of prime minister.          Some analysts say Rajoelina's hand was forced by powerful individuals who backed his power-grab.          Local media reports said Rajoelina met Ratsiraka and Chissano in Paris after leaving New York.  (Writing by Richard Lough; editing by David Clarke)

&lt;p&gt;Offers Virtual, Hands on Labs to Prepare Users for Cert Exam on Configuring
Windows Server 2008 Active Directory
PLEASANT GROVE, Utah--(Business Wire)--
TestOut Corporation-provider of online labs for IT certification training-today
launched a LabSim training course to help IT professionals prepare for the newly
updated Microsoft exam 83-640, Configuring Windows Server 2008 Active Directory.
With the 83-640 exam (previously the 70-640), Microsoft added performance-based
sections that require users to demonstrate configuration tasks on a live
computer. In addition to 60+ online lab simulations, the LabSim course adds new
practice exam questions, along with videos and written lessons, providing the
only fully integrated training course for users needing the practical experience
required by the new exam-and prospective employees. 

"TestOut has emphasized the importance of training IT learners for real-world
skills by providing hands-on, simulated online labs in every LabSim training
course for more than a decade," said Don Whitnah, vice president of product
development, TestOut. "While we added various questions to the practice exam for
the 83-640 course, our earlier course also provided performance-based scenarios
to help users truly learn - and demonstrate - the skills required for
configuring the Windows Server 2008 active directory. Having Microsoft add
performance-based scenarios to the exam further validates the focus TestOut has
placed on providing these practical skills and definitely puts more credibility
behind the certification itself." 

LabSim`s online labs enable users to freely work within a wide variety of
virtual environments to accomplish their tasks and build their skills. Students
aren`t limited to a prescribed pathway for completing tasks, nor are they simply
faced with a series of screen images. Every lab exercise and scenario is also
tracked, evaluated and scored for the students, who are immediately shown their
results with detailed feedback for each question. If they are weak in certain
areas, they can read an explanation of the correct methods to accomplish each
task. 

TestOut`s Product Update Guarantee gives customers access to up-to-date versions
of training software for a full year after their purchase, including the 83-640
update. Any TestOut customers who purchased the 70-640 LabSim course within the
past year qualify to receive the updated 83-640 course materials. Please note
that although the 83-640 exam is available mostly worldwide, it's delivered in
English. 

Pricing &amp; Availability

The LabSim 83-640 course is available now for $495.

&lt;p&gt;The World of Coca-Cola(R) Museum: A Real-life Tour of How Coca-Cola(R) is Made
and Bottled

ATLANTA, Sept. 29, 2009 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Nothing beats a refreshing
Coca-Cola(R). Yet few of us know much about the mystery drink founded by a man
by the name of Mr. Pemberton. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, Coca-Cola(R)
decided to open its doors to the public two years ago with a museum dedicated to
the tasty beverage. Bottleworks is the focal point of the museum, allowing the
audience to see the entire bottling process from fill to distribution. Museum
visitors feel like they are in a Coca-Cola(R) plant, with the production line
slowed down so that each step is fully demonstrated. In a normal plant, the line
speeds would move up 1200 bottles per minute; in the museum, they move at 1200
per hour.

Industrial Dynamics/filtec, the leader in bottle inspection, plays a major role
in Coca-Cola(R) plants across the country. The company produces the Omnivision
II Empty Bottle Inspector, the Lasetec II Laser Coding System and the FT-50 Fill
Level Inspector, all of which are displayed in the museum. The Omnivision II
Empty Bottle Inspector is the only system to provide a full 360-degree view of
the inside of a bottle prior to filling. The machine moves the bottle along the
conveyor while a high-tech camera-based system takes pictures of the inside of
each bottle, inspecting for damage and foreign items such as dirt and glass
particles that might be inside the bottle. If the camera system detects a
particle in the bottle, it is immediately rejected from the line. The system
provides a full 360-degree inspection of the outside of the bottles as well.
Next, the bottles move on to the Lasetec II Laser Coding System where they are
sealed with a stamp of approval. This includes the date of bottle inspection and
the production time.

Finally, the bottles are moved to the FT-50 Fill Level Inspector where they are
inspected for underfill or overfill, as well as for a secure cap. If a cap is
missing or cocked, the bottle is rejected.

This unique, state-of-the-art process can be viewed at the Coca-Cola(R) Museum.
"In a condensed plant experience, it is slowed down to a pace where people can
readily observe the process," explains Don Webb, Industrial Dynamics/filtec
World of Coca-Cola(R) Representative. "They can see a single production line,
and the camera taking pictures of the bottles, with the screen and monitor
facing the public. It's an enjoyable experience." Besides Bottleworks, visitors
to the museum can also taste over 60 different products from around the world,
experience the exciting 4-D theatre, see Coca-Cola(R) memorabilia, give a
7-foot-tall polar bear a hug and take home a free 8-ounce bottle of
Coca-Cola(R), fresh off the line. For more information, please visit

&lt;p&gt;Beta embraced by partners and technology enthusiasts; open to qualified users
free of charge
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Intermedia, the global leader in Microsoft Exchange hosting, announced that it
will continue the Microsoft Exchange 2010 beta it debuted on May 27, 2009.
Exchange 2010 is not yet available for sale from Microsoft. Intermedia offers
the world`s first hosted Exchange 2010 beta. 

"Our private label partners - as well as technology enthusiasts in the Exchange
administrator community - increasingly inquire about hosted Exchange 2010," says
Serguei Sofinski, Intermedia`s chief executive officer. "We`ve extended the beta
not only to accommodate them, but also to continue generating feedback that is
instrumental to developing a production-ready experience. Intermedia is poised
for a great launch thanks to our beta users." 

Because Intermedia`s Exchange 2010 beta is hosted, no software downloads or
installations are necessary. The company`s proprietary HostPilot Control Panel,
which partners and customers use to manage their Exchange accounts, supports
Exchange 2010. Unique in an industry that relies on generic control panels,
HostPilot provides business executives with a simple way to adjust common
Exchange settings - and IT administrators with a level of control comparable to
an on-premise Exchange installation. 

Intermedia`s hosted Exchange 2010 beta continues a tradition of practical
innovation. The 14-year-old company was the first to market Microsoft Exchange
2007 as a hosted service. Today, more than 200,000 premium Exchange mailboxes -
and 400,000 mailboxes overall - are under Intermedia`s management. Premium
mailboxes use Microsoft`s full MAPI license, which includes a downloadable copy
of Microsoft Outlook, the power to share calendars, and other features essential
to business. 

Exchange 2010 and its Outlook Web Access interface introduce several features
designed to enhance the user experience, such as conversation-style email
formats and full compatibility with Safari and Firefox browsers. Users can apply
for Intermedia`s beta at www.exchange2010beta.com. 

About Intermedia

Intermedia is the leading provider of hosted Microsoft Exchange and business
email to the small and medium-sized business market. The company specializes in

&lt;p&gt;New Cluster Manager System Improves Performance of Transactional Applications

First Product to Deliver Cloud-Based Scale-Out for Commercial Databases
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
xkoto (www.xkoto.com), the database virtualization company, today announced
availability of GRIDSCALE 5.1, the latest release of its active-active solution
for IBM DB2. 

GRIDSCALE 5.1 features a new cluster management system that dramatically
improves the performance of online transaction processing (OLTP) applications.
The product also is now available on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon
EC2), delivering the first cloud-based scale-out solution for DB2. With
GRIDSCALE, businesses can eliminate DB2 downtime, implement real-time disaster
recovery solutions, and lower the costs for business-critical DB2 databases
running on Linux, UNIX and Windows systems. 

"We have found GRIDSCALE 5.1 to be a solid active-active, cross-site solution
with our WebSphere application servers," said Maj Sweidan, Manager, Database
Engineering for UnitedHealth Group, a diversified health and well-being company
with more than $80 billion in revenues. 

Cloud Computing Support

The combination of GRIDSCALE 5.1 and DB2 is the only solution that allows
organizations to scale mission-critical database applications in the cloud, with
confidence. Until now, traditional clustering technologies were impossible to
deploy in the cloud, due to the lack of shared storage and limitations on
individual server capacity. GRIDSCALE`s active-active architecture enables
multiple DB2 databases running in the cloud to work together and avoid these
limitations. As a result, GRIDSCALE can prevent DB2 downtime and enable
applications to distribute load across multiple database servers running in the
cloud. 

"At IBM, we see tremendous interest among enterprises for both public and
private cloud computing," said Leon Katsnelson, Program Director, IBM. "Cloud
computing can lower overall computing costs and provide IT organizations
unlimited compute capacity on demand. GRIDSCALE is a key technology that enables
DB2 to scale and realize the benefits of elasticity in the cloud." 

For more information, including a demonstration of GRIDSCALE and DB2 running in
the cloud, watch the On Demand webinar hosted by IBM and xkoto by visiting
www.xkoto.com/promos/cloudreality/. 

Enhanced Locking

GRIDSCALE 5.1`s new, patent-pending Cluster Lock Manager is an industry first.
The Cluster Lock Manager delivers reliable scaling and management of
transaction-intensive workloads across a pool of independent database servers.
It operates completely transparent to an application to isolate and coordinate
row-level transactions across disparate database servers. As a result, GRIDSCALE
improves the overall performance of transaction intensive applications, such as
e-commerce and line-of-business systems. 

Other Enhancements

Other new features in GRIDSCALE 5.1 include:

* Automatic database recovery, allowing database failures to recover
automatically without intervention from IT staff 
* Transparent replacement of non-deterministic database functions, which
minimizes application changes required when using GRIDSCALE 
* Scripted GRIDSCALE Catalog, providing better support for dynamic SQL within
stored procedures 
* Client redirect, facilitating the configuration of databases that span
multiple data centers 
* Support for Kerberos security authentication

"The capabilities we are adding to GRIDSCALE broaden its appeal and will enable
us to more rapidly grow our installed base of users running business-critical
systems on DB2," said David Patrick, President and CEO of xkoto. "We are
confident that the new capabilities in GRIDSCALE will enable even greater
adoption of DB2 for mission-critical applications and to take advantage of the
cloud." 

Backed by IBM`s 24/7 worldwide client support organization, GRIDSCALE is an
active-active solution that virtualizes the database infrastructure. It enables
businesses to distribute application loads horizontally across multiple database
copies, resulting in better reliability and performance than that of more costly
and complex legacy clustering solutions. For more information about GRIDSCALE,

performance for business-critical applications. xkoto`s GRIDSCALE software uses
active-active technology to provide continuous database availability and
expanded scale-out. xkoto and GRIDSCALE have received numerous industry awards,

&lt;p&gt;CORALVILLE, Iowa--(Business Wire)--
Vivakor, Inc. (OTCBB: VIVK) today announced that John Gryga, former executive
with General Electric`s Healthcare division and former Director of Operations
for RadNet, has joined Vivakor`s Board of Directors. At RadNet, Mr. Gryga was
responsible for growing annual revenues from $20 million to over $150 million.
Mr. Gryga will steer Vivakor in the commercialization of several of its
Electro-Optic devices including its VivaSlices MRI image improvement software
and its VivaSight vision-screening digital photo-refractor ("DPR") product, and
other medical devices in development at Vivakor. 

"John brings a tremendous wealth of experience, contacts and specific
commercialization initiatives to the table. All of us at Vivakor welcome John
and are excited about the opportunities his presence on the Board will bring the
Company," said Vivakor`s Chairman, Matt Nicosia. 

In this capacity, Mr. Gryga will utilize his experience in commercialization of
medical devices to assist in the commercialization of Vivakor`s proprietary MRI
technology, VivaSlices. This technology is a software upgrade that allows MRI
units to achieve higher resolution by using a patented technology. Additionally,
VivaSlices may be useful in analyzing blood flow characteristics in patients
with hypertension or stroke. The estimated market potential for the VivaSlices
technology may be more than $300.0 million annually. 

Mr. Gryga will also play an advisory role in the commercialization of Vivakor`s
VivaSight technology, which is expected to modernize screening of children for
ocular disorders. Vivakor was recently awarded a grant from National Institutes
of Health-National Eye Institute through the Small Business Innovation Research
Awards for development of VivaSight DPR which is in the final stages of a
clinical validation study being conducted at the University of Iowa. Vivakor
believes that the DPR eye screening market potential will be $50.0 million per
year and expects a commercial launch of the product in the second quarter of
2010.

&lt;p&gt;Steve Black named Executive Chairman of the Investment Bank; Jes Staley to
become CEO of the Investment Bank; Mary Callahan Erdoes Appointed CEO of Asset
Management 
NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co. (NYSE: JPM) today announced senior leadership changes in
its Investment Bank and Asset Management businesses. 

Steve Black, co-CEO of the Investment Bank, will become Executive Chairman of
the Investment Bank. Jes Staley, currently head of Asset Management, has been
named CEO of the Investment Bank, reporting to Steve. Jes will continue to serve
on the firm's Operating Committee. Mary Callahan Erdoes, CEO of the Private
Bank, will succeed Jes as the CEO of Asset Management and will join the firm`s
Operating Committee. 

"With the credit crisis largely behind us and the economy recovering, the timing
was right to begin the succession process," said Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO
of JPMorgan Chase. He added, "Steve and Jes will work closely together and
complete a smooth transition at the end of 2010. Steve, Bill and the IB
Management Team have built one of the strongest investment banks in the world,
and I'm confident that together, Steve, Jes and the IB Management Team will
continue to build on this success." 

Bill Winters, co-CEO of the Investment Bank, will leave the company. Jamie Dimon
said, "Bill has played a critical role in building the great investment bank we
have today. Together with Steve, he helped steer the business through one of the
most tumultuous periods in our history and emerge from it even stronger. We want
to thank Bill for his exceptional service to this firm and wish him the best." 

Jes Staley began his career at J.P. Morgan in 1979 and worked in the Investment
Bank for 20 years. From 1980 to 1989, he worked in the bank's Latin America
division, where he served as head of corporate finance for Brazil and general
manager of the company`s Brazilian brokerage firm for eight years. He was one of
the founding members of J.P. Morgan's Equities business, which began J.P.
Morgan's extension into investment banking in the early 1980s. He headed Equity
Capital Markets before becoming CEO of J.P. Morgan's Private Bank in 1999. In
2001, he began his leadership of Asset Management and oversaw the highly
successful transformation of that business, which is a market leader today. 

Mary Callahan Erdoes joined J.P. Morgan in the Private Bank in 1996 as head of
Fixed Income for high-net worth individuals, foundations and endowments. In 1999
she became head of Investment Management and Alternative Solutions for the
Private Bank, and then assumed increasingly senior positions in the business. In
2005 Mary was named CEO of the Private Bank and joined the firm-wide Executive
Committee. 

Jes Staley said, "Bill, Steve and the IB employees have helped build the leading
Investment Bank in the world today, and I am extremely honored to be asked to
take on this critical role. I look forward to working with the leadership team
there, and together, I`m confident we can grow and secure our leading position
well into the future." 

Steve Black added, "Jes and I have worked closely together on the Operating
Committee for five years and I'm looking forward to working with him in the
Investment Bank. He's built an outstanding Asset Management business and will be
a great leader of the Investment Bank as we try to extend the competitive lead
we have today." 

Bill Winters said, "I`m very proud of what my colleagues and I have achieved in
the Investment Bank. We`ve successfully come through the turmoil of the past 18
months, and our business is best in class. Steve and Jes are extremely well
positioned to build on this success, and I wish them and all of my JPMC
colleagues the best. I`m looking forward to my next professional challenge." 

Mary Callahan Erdoes added, "It is a privilege to be asked to lead the firm`s
Asset Management business. I have been fortunate to work alongside Jes for the
last decade as he helped transform this business into an industry leader across
all asset classes and geographical regions. I look forward to building upon this
great success."

&lt;p&gt;With Microsoft set to wind down support for the Visual SourceSafe software version control system, the company is encouraging developers to move over to Microsoft's more full-featured ALM (application lifecycle management) server, the TFS (Team Foundation Server) product featured in the Visual Studio platform.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Company officials on Wednesday noted that Visual SourceSafe is on an "end of life" track, with support set to end in mid-2011. Afterward, users would need to pay for extended support, which would be available for a few years. But Microsoft is offering SourceSafe users a migration path via a new installation option for TFS planned expected next year, called TFS Basic installation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ Last year, Microsoft looked to "democratize" ALM with Visual Team System 2010. ]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see TFS as the successor to SourceSafe," said Brian Harry, who holds the title of technical fellow at Microsoft.&#160; The Basic Installation option would be featured as part of Visual Studio Team Foundation Server 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In 2002, we set out to build the next generation of development collaboration tool and that was TFS. Our initial emphasis was on enterprise software development teams," said Harry. &#160;TFS provides a collaboration platform combining capabilities for portal, version control, work item-tracking, build management, process guidance, and business intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Now, with the [planned 2010 release of TFS], we have taken a big step taking the TFS level of sophistication and bringing it to the SourceSafe user base," he said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Basic installation option of TFS is suited for SourceSafe users because it is easier to install than previous iterations, installing in about 20 minutes if the .Net Framework is present. Also, it will run on client OSes including Windows Vista and the upcoming Windows 7 release. TFS thus far has required Windows Server.&#160; With the client installation, users can have a software versioning server solution on their laptops, which then can be accessed by others over the Internet or on a LAN, Harry explained.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Plans also call for making the Basic installation much more affordable for SourceSafe users. TFS currently sells for about $2,700 plus $500 per user.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry was president of One Tree Software, which built SourceSafe in 1992 and was acquired by Microsoft in 1994. Although the product revolutionized version control by providing ease of use and a Windows GUI, it was built for a different time - before the advent of the Internet, ubiquitous LANs and databases and agile development practices, Harry said.&#160; The product, for example, lacks continuous integration and bug-tracking featured in TFS.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Asked what SourceSafe users think of end-of-life plans for their platform and the migration to TFS, Harry said, "I've not talked to a ton of them, but the ones I've talked to I think are very excited about it."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Harry stressed Micosoft's commitment to SourceSafe customers, noting an update to SourceSafe is planned as part of the 2010 product release wave for Visual Studio. The update will enable SourceSafe to work with Visual Studio 2010.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In another development in the TFS arena, users of mainframes would be able to access Microsoft's ALM server just like users of Windows, Unix and the Mac already can, with technology in development at Teamprise.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With a planned mainframe client, developers working on a mainframe could be "full and equal contributors to a development project that is being managed in Microsoft Team Foundation Server," said Martin Woodward, Teamprise senior software engineer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TFS currently can be accessed for Java, Mac, Unix and Windows projects, Woodward noted. "However we have a significant customer base that also have developers for whom the mainframe is their development environment -- they don't use tools like Visual Studio or Eclipse. They use a IBM 3270 Terminal and log onto the mainframe where they find their code and development tools," Woodward said."It is for these people that we are developing the Teamprise mainframe client," he said. The client is being developed on z/OS&#160; R08.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's Harry gives Teamprise's efforts a thumbs-up in a blog entry.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I'm really thrilled they are taking this step because I've always believed that it's important that all people in a software development project are able to access the project resources no matter what their role and no matter what platform they are on," Harry said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - www.infoworld.com/node/93983&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Goldman Sachs on Tuesday
advised investors to shy away from banks and insurance
companies that are heavily focused on commercial real estate,
saying that the downturn in commercial real estate was more
severe than Goldman had expected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; "Prices have yet to stabilize and thus are likely to
overshoot our original estimates further," Goldman analysts
said in a report.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Appraisal values have fallen 25 percent. Goldman expects a
decline from peak levels in 2007 of 40 percent to 42 percent, a
much steeper declined than the 28 percent it expected.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Sales prices have plunged 39 percent from their peak prices
verses Goldman's prior estimate 24 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At the same time, vacancy rates have risen 35 percent
versus the 17 percent Goldman had expected. Rents have fallen
by 9 percent, translating into fundamentals that have
deteriorated by more than twice the rate Goldman anticipated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman expects $287 billion of losses on commercial real
estate and construction loans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Goldman said it favors consumer-focused large banks, such
as JPMorgan Chase  Co (JPM.N) and Bank of America Corp (BAC.N)
over regional banks such as Western Alliance Bancorp (WAL.N)
and Marshall  Ilsley Corp MI.N, which are heavily focused on
real estate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Construction is still our main issue," the analysts wrote
in a research report. "Just like in residential, we expect
losses will be high and come on a two-to-three year lag from
the market peak, which translates to (the second half of 2009
and through 2010)."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Regional banks are overweight on construction loans versus
big banks, the report said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; As far as insurance companies, Goldman favors Arch Capital
Group Ltd (ACGL.O), Lincoln National Corp (LNC.N) and
RenaissanceRe Holdings Ltd (RNR.N) over real estate investment
laden Allstate Corp (ALL.N) and Hartford Financial Services
Group Inc (HIG.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It suggested avoiding most real estate investment trusts
and retain only those with very strong balance sheets,
including Taubman Centers Inc (TCO.N) and Essex Property Trust
Inc (ESS.N).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Ilaina Jonas)

&lt;p&gt;As companies of all sizes consider what portion of their IT infrastructure and business applications to move to the cloud, Microsoft has one word of advice: Balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In an interview this week, Stephen Elop, president of Microsoft's Business Division, which produces the Office software, stressed that companies will find the most success by accessing data through Web browsers and mobile devices when appropriate, in balance with desktop applications on a PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The best experience will be the combination of the PC, phone and the browser. That's essentially the focus of what we're doing," Elop said in a phone interview with CIO.com. "What we are not saying is, hey, everything is going to go up into a browser and that's the way people are going to get everything done. We disagree with that."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"What we are not saying is that everything is going to go up into a browser and that's the way people are going to get everything done. We disagree with that." Stephen Elop, President of Microsoft's Business Division&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hence the Microsoft-coined term "software plus services," a slight rephrasing of the software as a service (SaaS) model, where companies such as Google, Amazon and Salesforce.com host software applications on their own Web servers and provide them to customers as a service on demand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Apps Showdown Heats Up&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft Office has long been the king of business productivity applications and e-mail. Roughly 80 percent of businesses that run production tools use Office, according to data from research firm Forrester. But Google's Web-based Google Apps software, which includes Gmail, looms as a threat to the Office empire as businesses recognize the cost reductions and convenience of accessing productivity apps and an e-mail system in the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not surprisingly, Microsoft's Elop downplays the Google Apps threat to Office, saying that "the high bar for Microsoft is not to surpass the capabilities of some browser-based, simplistic piece of technology for word processing. Our challenge is to make sure that we continue to innovate beyond what we've already delivered with our products."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ironically, that Office innovation comes in the form of Office Web Apps, the very thing that Google already does. Elop sees the upcoming Office Web Apps - out now in technical preview and releasing in tandem with Office 2010 early next year - as a complement to the Office Desktop suite, but says that Office Web Apps can compete directly with Google Apps on their own.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If it's someone who just wants simple access to basic capabilities of word processing, spreadsheet, PowerPoint capabilities, on the day we release these products [Office Web Apps] there will be about 500 million Windows Live ID users and volume license purchasers who will have no-cost access to comparable capability [to Google Apps]," says Elop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Office 2010's One-Two Punch&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Industry analysts have noted that Microsoft's hand was forced to create online versions of Office because of the early success of free Web-based alternatives such as Google Apps and the Zoho suite.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Sheri McLeish, analyst at Forrester Research, says that Microsoft's expansion of Office was necessary and will provide Microsoft with a worthy one-two punch.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If we didn't have these free alternatives from Google and Zoho, surely Microsoft would not be doing this," says McLeish. "But all the competition in the productivity tools space benefits businesses and consumers."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google Apps, targeted by consumers and enterprises, is now being used by approximately 1.75 million businesses, according to Google. Some of these users value having a Microsoft alternative.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But in Microsoft's favor: some consumers and business users may be more likely to use Office Web Apps because Microsoft Office already has a broad reach on computers everywhere, says McLeish.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What kind of work with Office apps is better served in a browser than through a desktop application? Microsoft's Elop says a good scenario is a salesperson sitting in a parking lot of a customer site going over some numbers in an Excel spreadsheet using a netbook connected to the 3G network, and simultaneously editing the spreadsheet with someone in his finance department on the other end.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, says Elop, inserting video into a PowerPoint slide and editing it would work better on a PC.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SMBs Move Faster into the Cloud&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the moment, most Microsoft customers are juggling a mix of desktop and hosted Web applications, says Elop. But with online versions of content collaboration software Sharepoint and e-mail server Exchange available now, and with Exchange 2010 and Office 2010 (both to come packaged with desktop and online versions) due to ship in the next six months, Elop expects a healthy mix of on-premise and cloud to continue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We see organizations where, because of their corporate structure and geographic locations, they have a blend of on-premise and cloud. A big part of our value proposition is to support that diversity."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enterprises are likely to move slower to cloud-based services because they have more users and complicated applications and privacy issues, but small and mid-sized businesses have been moving data to the cloud more spontaneously, says Elop.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you a Tweeter?

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will block users running counterfeit copies of Windows from installing the free Security Essentials antivirus software, the head of the company's anti-piracy group said yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Security Essentials, which launched early Tuesday , is basic anti-virus and anti-spyware software that Microsoft touts as suitable for users who can't, or won't, pay for security.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"During installation, you ll be asked to validate Windows running on your PC to make sure that it s genuine," said Alex Kochis, director of Microsoft's Genuine Windows team, in a post to a company blog Tuesday. Genuine Windows is the umbrella label for several of the company's anti-piracy technologies, including product activation and the often-criticized validation and notification components, which regularly determine whether the copy of Windows running on a PC is legitimate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Part of the Security Essentials' installation process requires that users validate Windows. "Microsoft Security Essentials is available to customers running a genuine and properly licensed copy of Windows," the first installation dialog box reads. PCs that fail the validation check will display a second dialog that provides a link to the section of Microsoft's site where users can purchase -- or in some cases receive a free copy -- of Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Although Microsoft blocks pirates from downloading other free software it offers, it regularly makes major exceptions. Internet Explorer 8 (IE8), which Microsoft has billed as its most secure browser to date, can be downloaded and installed on a counterfeit copy of Windows, for example. And Microsoft lets people running bogus copies Windows obtain security patches via Windows Update.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On-again, off-again debates about the wisdom of blocking security-oriented downloads like patches or defensive software have centered around the argument that Microsoft should protect all users, including pirates, since hijacked PCs threaten the entire Windows ecosystem. In this case, though, one analyst isn't buying that line.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I can't see any justification for making Microsoft give away Security Essentials [to counterfeit Windows users]," said John Pescatore, Gartner's primary security analyst. "Those people have many other choices, including free. There are plenty of alternatives to Security Essentials," he said, adding that that makes a difference. Windows patches, on the other hand, aren't available from anyone but Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"It's like when you buy a car. If you buy a Ford, the company should have to fix the car when there's a recall, whether you bought the car from them, or bought it used from someone else," said Pescatore. "But if Ford said they were going to give all current owners free satellite radio, does that mean they have to give it away to everyone, including people who bought it used or even who bought Chevys?"&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Security Essentials can be downloaded for Windows XP, Vista and Windows 7 from the Microsoft Web site.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Goldman accused of violating disabilities law

 * Ex-VP seeks compensatory, punitive damages

 NEW YORK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - A former Goldman Sachs Group
Inc (GS.N) vice president and trader accused the firm of
dismissing her last year because of a disability, according to
a lawsuit in Manhattan federal court on Wednesday.

 The lawsuit said Sarah Hindlian, a member of a proprietary
trade idea generating unit, was diagnosed with a degenerative
disc disease in November 2004. She had spinal surgery in 2007.

 "Ms Hindlian alleges that the firm, due to her disability
and the firm's regarding her as disabled, terminated her and
discriminated against her in the terms and conditions of
employment," the lawsuit said.

 A Goldman spokeswoman declined to comment.

 Hindlian joined Goldman in July 2001 and was eventually
promoted to vice president in 2005 in the Americas Trading Unit
of the firm's Franchise Risk Management Department, the court
document said.

 The lawsuit accused her supervisor, Ted Wang, of telling
her on Oct. 31, 2007, "that she was not permitted to be sick
any more." It also said Wang in January 2008 offered Hindlian a
promotion involving analyzing large block trades but after
accepting, she never received the promised promotion.

 She was told on April 3, 2008, a day before starting short
term disability medical leave, by Wang and Managing Director
Paul Russo that Goldman was cutting 10 percent of its workforce
based on performance. Hindlian's employment was to be
terminated at the end of her medical leave.

 Trading desk seats were not handicap-accessible for her,
the lawsuit said.

 Her back problems started in late 2004 and she "experienced
extreme pain" according to the lawsuit. "As a result, she was
unable to walk. For three months in 2007, she was confined to a
wheelchair."

 The lawsuit said Hindlian filed a charge of discrimination
with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission
in March this year, charging Goldman with violating the
Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990. She took the case to
federal court "after exhausting her administrative remedies"
under the Act.

 She is seeking unspecified damages and a declaration that
Goldman violated the ADA.

 The case is Sarah E. Hindlian v Goldman Sachs 09-8308 in
U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York
(Manhattan)

are up significantly and doctors are working with their Invisalign
representatives to meet or surpass the minimum case and CE requirements by
year-end," said Dan Ellis, Align's vice president, North American sales. "We
want to do everything we can to help doctors achieve success, whether it's
recognizing their commitment to Invisalign proficiency, or by helping increase
their confidence in Invisalign products and treatment with new and improved
features."

As part of the Invisalign Proficiency Requirements, Align has developed new ways
to support doctors through this significant change, including a program to
recognize doctors who achieve the annual proficiency requirements by year end.
Doctors who meet the proficiency requirements of ten shipped cases and ten
Invisalign CE hours by the end of 2009 will benefit from a new addition to
Align's consumer marketing programs, one that encourages prospective patients to
seek out "Invisalign Preferred Providers." Starting in January 2010, this new
Invisalign Preferred designation will be highlighted on the Invisalign web site
and in television ads as a way to recognize doctors' commitment to continued
proficiency with Invisalign. The Invisalign Preferred designation will then be
awarded on an annual basis to doctors who meet the proficiency requirements for
a given year.

For doctors who are unable to meet the proficiency requirements this year, but
demonstrate a desire to continue using Invisalign, Align will offer a one-time,
additional six month qualification period that will enable doctors to secure
their Invisalign provider status for 2010. Many of these doctors lack confidence
with certain Invisalign techniques or with how widely Invisalign can be used in
their practices. Recently-announced new and improved features in all Invisalign
products may give doctors greater confidence in Invisalign and address perceived
limitations of Invisalign treatment, especially among doctors who have not used
the product extensively in recent years. The new features, which will be
available in mid-October, are designed to deliver better results across more
clinical situations, particularly with extrusions, rotations, and root
movements. The additional six month qualification period will give doctors an
opportunity to realize the value of these product improvements.

 The additional six month qualification period stipulates that:
 - Doctors who do not meet the proficiency requirements for 2009 but
   have at least one shipped case and at least one Invisalign CE hour
   at the end of this year will be allowed to maintain their active
   provider status through June 30, 2010.
 - Doctors who qualify for the additional six month qualification
   period can secure their provider status for the second half of 2010
   by meeting half of the annual proficiency requirements (at least
   five shipped cases and five Invisalign CE hours) between January 1
   and June 30, 2010.
 - Doctors will still be responsible for meeting the total annual
   requirements of at least ten shipped cases and ten Invisalign CE
   hours by the end of 2010 to qualify as providers for the following
   year.
Doctors with zero shipped cases or zero Invisalign CE hours at the end of 2009
will not be eligible for the additional qualification period. They will be able
to continue treating in-progress cases but will not be able to submit new
Invisalign cases or use Invisalign branding or marketing resources.

Align does not expect the Invisalign Proficiency Requirements to have a material
impact on the Company's fiscal year 2009 financial results. More information on
the Invisalign Proficiency Program and the additional qualification period are
available at http://vip.invisalign.com/proficiency.

About Align Technology, Inc.

Align Technology designs, manufactures and markets Invisalign, a proprietary
method for treating malocclusion, or the misalignment of teeth. Invisalign
corrects malocclusion using a series of clear, nearly invisible, removable
appliances that gently move teeth to a desired final position. Because it does
not rely on the use of metal or ceramic brackets and wires, Invisalign
significantly reduces the aesthetic and other limitations associated with
braces. Invisalign is appropriate for treating adults and teens. Align
Technology was founded in March 1997 and received FDA clearance to market
Invisalign in 1998. Today, the Invisalign product family includes Invisalign,
Invisalign Teen, Invisalign Assist, Invisalign Express, and Vivera Retainers.

&lt;p&gt; * Watson headed MA during Texaco takeover&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; * Ran exploration business outside North America&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Chevron shares down in afternoon trading
 (Releads; adds analyst comment on management, paragraphs 6-7)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Matt Daily and Braden Reddall&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Chevron Corp's
(CVX.N) David O'Reilly will hand Vice Chairman John Watson the
reins as the second-largest U.S. oil company brings several big
projects online and navigates through a massive, potentially
damaging lawsuit in Ecuador.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watson, 52, becomes chairman and chief executive at the end
of this year, Chevron said on Wednesday. He has been at Chevron
since 1980, in roles such as chief financial officer and head
of exploration and production outside North America. He also
led the integration of Texaco after the deal closed in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The California native, who currently oversees strategy and
development, will take the helm at a time when oil majors face
increasing competition from state-run oil companies for access
to the largest untapped reserves. Two-thirds of the world's top
20 oil companies are backed by governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly, a 62-year-old from Dublin, has worked for the San
Ramon, California-based company for 41 years and served in the
top two roles for the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A new CEO is just the latest change at the top of Chevron
in the past year, which has seen a new chief financial officer
take over and the appointment of a new chief in-house lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; While O'Reilly made headlines in June by debating the head
of the Sierra Club, an environmental group [ID:nN10466283], his
public profile was lower than that of many top executives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We really like that O'Reilly wasn't real outspoken and on
a lot of different boards," said Alan Brochstein, senior energy
analyst at Management CV, which rates executive teams.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "We sure hope Watson won't be either because quite frankly
we think Chevron has had, over the long term, one of the higher
returns for its shareholders," he added, noting that Watson had
"major skin in the game" with $30 million of Chevron stock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; ECUADOR THREAT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Watson faces a potential crisis from a $27 billion claim in
a lawsuit in Ecuador, where indigenous people blame Texaco for
polluting the areas where they live and damaging their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; A ruling in the 16-year-old case had been due in the coming
months, but that is now complicated by the judge's replacement
amid allegations he was involved in a $3 million bribery plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The CEO change is a "mild positive" for Chevron shares by
setting up a smooth transition, said James Halloran, consultant
with Financial America Securities in Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; But he said the road ahead looks tough since oil companies
largely occupy a second tier after national oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "They can no longer show up at the doorstep of countries
and get access to the oil," Halloran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; In the face of this challenge, Chevron in January dropped
its target for 3 percent compound annual production growth from
2005 to 2010, although in July it did bump up its 2009 output
growth target to 5 percent from 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; O'Reilly will depart as a number of sizeable projects come
online from Brazil to the Gulf of Mexico to Australia, where
the $37 billion Gorgon gas project just got the green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "He's left him with a well-stocked pond," said Fadel Gheit,
analyst at Oppenheimer  Co, who also identified access to new
reserves as Watson's biggest challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron's board elected George Kirkland, 59, to succeed
Watson as vice chairman. Kirkland will retain responsibility
for Chevron's global oil and gas exploration and production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron shares were trading 0.8 percent lower at $70.32, in
line with peers. Shares of larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp
(XOM.N) were down 0.7 percent at $68.61.

&lt;p&gt;Bottom Line&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V R2 and System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2008 R2 offer substantial performance and functionality enhancements over the previous editions, but support for non-Windows guests remains extremely limited.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft is poised to improve its standing in the world of virtualization with the much-anticipated update to Windows Server 2008 Hyper-V, Redmond's hypervisor-based server virtualization solution for 64-bit Intel- and AMD-based servers. First released last year, Hyper-V proved a less-than-compelling offering compared to virtualization platforms from VMware, Virtual Iron (now Oracle), Citrix, and other rivals. Hyper-V Release 2, part of Windows Server 2008 R2, delivers some exciting new features that change the game.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among Hyper-V R2's new features is support for 64 logical processors; Live Migration support, which allows admins to move a VM from one physical server to another without service interruption; VM Chimney, which provides TCP offload support; and a new processor compatibility mode for Live Migration, which enables migrations between different CPUs in the same family.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;[ See the InfoWorld Test Center review, "VMware vSphere 4: The once and future virtualization king. "]&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On top of these enhancements, Hyper-V will remain free with the purchase of Windows Server 2008, which seems like a great deal. However, to use the new Live Migration capability -- and to centrally manage more than one Hyper-V host -- you also need System Center Virtual Machine Manager (SCVMM), which costs $869 per physical server. Depending on what you're running at your organization, SCVMM may be a welcome addition. Among its features, it can manage both Hyper-V and VMware servers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Start your virtualization engine&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing Hyper-V is no different than installing standard Windows Server 2008, although you do need to install the new Hyper-V Manager MMC (or SCVMM). The Hyper-V Manager can be installed on the same server as SCVMM or on a separate machine. It can run on Windows Server 2008 or Windows Vista SP1.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Guest operating system images can be installed from physical media or ISO image files, as well as over the network from a network image server. I had no problems installing any of the supported versions of Windows or Linux that I tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Installing SCVMM 2008 R2 is somewhat more complex than installing the usual single application: It depends on SQL Server 2005 or SQL Server 2008 (SCVMM will install SQL Server Express, but you'll need the full SQL Server if you'll have more than 150 hosts), plus PowerShell 1.0, the Windows Automated Installation Kit 1.1, IIS 7.0, and an instance of System Center Operations Manager 2007 for reporting. Installing Operations Manager isn't strictly necessary, but only through the combination of SCVMM and Operations Manager can you monitor and manage virtual servers and their physical hosts together.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Worth the hype&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V's spiffy new features worked well; at least, those I was able to try did, which included Live Migration and processor-compatibility mode. My lab was not equipped to test 64-core support, and TCP offload requires a new NIC from Intel or Broadcom. Live Migration is not simple to implement, as it requires adding several roles to each Hyper-V server as well as using SCVMM, but the steps are not onerous and I had no trouble getting everything to work.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Live Migration is far superior to the Quick Migration feature in the previous version of Hyper-V. Using Quick Migration, it generally takes 30 seconds or longer to move a VM from one physical server to another, long enough that most client applications lose their connection to the server and experience some kind of failure. Live Migration moves a VM without any service interruption; even heavily loaded servers can be moved without problems. I saw short delays (one to two seconds) when migrating a VM with 4GB of memory while running load simulation tools, but the server was always reachable and the delay wasn't long enough to cause the application to fail. With smaller VMs (1GB and 2GB of memory) delays were not perceptible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V R2 also includes Cluster Shared Volumes, a new feature that allows two physical servers and multiple VMs to share the same volume or LUN. This not only makes setting up storage much easier, but it's necessary for VMs that may need to migrate from one physical server to another. Cluster Shared Volumes is the storage foundation that makes Live Migration possible.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The processor-compatibility mode for Live Migration eases the task of setting up backup servers or secondary servers for higher loads by negating the requirement that the physical servers have the same model CPU. Rather, the CPUs need only be from the same family, thus opening the opportunity to use older servers with earlier-model CPUs for backups. For instance, I was able to migrate VMs from an HP ML370 G5 with dual Xeon 5400 CPUs to an HP DL360 G4 with dual P4 Xeon 3.6GHz processors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Enable with caution&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Processor compatibility mode doesn't eliminate all CPU-related obstacles. For starters, migrations between AMD and Intel servers remain impossible (to be fair, no virtualization platform has overcome this hurdle yet). Further, the CPUs require support for either Intel Virtualization Technology or AMD Virtualization, which means you're limited to relatively recent CPU models. You won't be able to use those old Pentium Pro servers. Bear in mind that processor compatibility mode is turned off by default, as it can reduce the functionality of that nice, new processor to its base. In short, you don't want to enable processor compatibility mode if you're not concerned with migration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Also for performance reasons, VM Chimney and Virtual Machine Queue are both disabled by default. VM Chimney allows TCP/IP to be offloaded to a physical NIC, which reduces CPU loads substantially. However, it's not compatible with every NIC. Also, it's not suited for all types of traffic. You may not see improvement among applications with small packets and interactive traffic, though SQL traffic, backups, Live Migration, and other applications that make use of larger packets and streaming traffic will benefit greatly.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Virtual Machine Queue allows a NIC to use DMA (Direct Memory Access) to route network traffic directly into a VM's memory, which eliminates both packet copies in the virtual network and route lookups in the virtual switch, thus improving performance significantly. Currently, only a few Intel and Broadcom NICs support VMQ.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Robust management not included&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Hyper-V Manager plug-in for the ubiquitous Microsoft Management Console (MMC) is perfectly adequate for managing a single Hyper-V server. However, it's neither intended for nor capable of managing multiple Hyper-V instances. Hyper-V Manager can monitor only one Hyper-V server at a time, and it's incapable of kicking off a Live Migration or even a Quick Migration. For the more sophisticated tasks, you'll need SCVMM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCVMM offers substantial benefits for the price. In addition to allowing both manual and automatic Live Migration, it supports physical-to-virtual and virtual-to-virtual migration from VMware hosts to Hyper-V hosts. Further, it allows the same management of ESX hosts that you get through VMware vCenter (because it works through vCenter), enabling management of a mixed Hyper-V and ESX environment from one console. Moreover, SCVMM supports libraries of VM templates, hardware profiles, and ISO images to simplify the deployment of multiple VMs.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SCVMM also provides a fault tolerance feature similar to VMware's High Availability. You can monitor a server, and if that server stops responding, the VM will automatically restart on another server. Configuring this is not quite as simple as a drop-down menu selection; you need to script it, but it isn't difficult and certainly doesn't require research to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Finally, SCVMM also includes some nice monitoring and reporting tools. It can send e-mail notifications if utilization exceeds a given threshold, for example, and it provide reports that show that the Hyper-V server is earning its keep, and that help identify potential bottlenecks before they become problems. Performance and Resource Optimization (PRO) -- a new SCVMM tool that requires Operations Manager -- is useful for optimizing and troubleshooting a Hyper-V server. It provides application-aware advice on getting a Hyper-V server to run better. The advice can be basic, but it can produce useful information on making specific applications, such as SQL Server 2005, run in a VM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V vs. VMware&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given all the improvements Microsoft has poured into Hyper-V, one might wonder how it stands up to the offerings from the reigning virtualization champ, VMware. Though Hyper-V has made some dramatic strides, it needs to put on more muscle before it can go toe-to-toe with VMware vSphere 4 (or its predecessor, VMware Infrastructure 3).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;For starters, VMware supports 37 different operating systems, whereas Hyper-V R2 has trouble supporting any OS that doesn't have "Windows" in its moniker. Presentation of hardware resources such as video cards and NICs is particularly problematic under Hyper-V. In most cases, I ran into problems when installing nonsupported versions of Linux, including Fedora 11 and Ubuntu Server 9.04. Suse Linux Enterprise Server (versions 10 and 11) and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (versions 5.2 and 5.3) are the only Linux distributions officially supported, and VMs running these operating systems are limited to a single virtual CPU.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Release 2 of Hyper-V does match VMware in its support for 64 logical processors. (Windows Server 2008 R2 itself supports 256 logical processors, but only 64 can be used by Hyper-V.) Moreover, Hyper-V R2's new Virtual Machine Queue (VMQ) feature matches the direct memory access capabilities of the NetQueue used in VMware ESX 3.5 and 4.0. VMQ and NetQueue skip some virtual network overhead when moving traffic from the VM to the network adapter, essentially bouncing it from one place in memory to another, and then to the NIC. However, VMware's new VMDirectPath I/O feature surpasses both VMQ and NetQueue. VMDirectPath basically gives every VM direct access to the NIC as if they were the only OS on the hardware, making the path from OS to NIC a little more direct than VMQ and NetQueue.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;VMware vSphere 4 also offers some improved memory utilization, with the equivalent of thin provisioning. You can give VMs more memory than the server actually has, which is useful because you can dynamically reallocate memory from idle VMs to active ones, allowing more VMs to be run on a single system. Setting up VMotion in VMware is less difficult than getting Live Migration up and running; plus, VMware delivers a wider array of supported hardware configurations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Hyper-V may hold an economic edge, however. It likely will be more affordable than VMware, especially if you want to use Live Migration, because that functionality will run you extra with VMware. Further, vSphere will probably cost more than Windows Server 2008 Enterprise or Datacenter edition. I say "probably" because both Microsoft and VMware are murky about pricing; it varies depending on what type of company you have, how many units you buy, and a number of other obscure factors.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you're looking to virtualize only recent Microsoft operating systems for development or deployment, Hyper-V is a good choice, and it will be easy for experienced Microsoft admins to deploy and manage. VMware will represent a substantial learning curve for most administrators, especially non-Linux admins. On the other hand, if you want to virtualize operating systems not supported by Hyper-V -- such as any flavor of Linux besides Suse and Red Hat, Microsoft OSes older than Windows Server 2000, Solaris, NetWare, or FreeBSD -- or need the advanced features in vSphere, such as thin-provisioning or VMDirectPath, you'll want to go with VMware.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All in all, Microsoft shops will welcome the new features of Hyper-V R2. You'll need to invest in SCVMM to reap the full benefits of the update, and the combination is certainly not overpriced. Even without SCVMM, Hyper-V is a fine product and quite usable for single-server instances. If you want to manage multiple virtualization servers and take advantage of fault-tolerant VMs using Live Migration, you'll need SCVMM. Whether the new features will induce users of VMware to move is another question.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Failure to Properly Vet Texaco for Liability Likely Drove O`Reilly to Retire
Early, Say Amazonian Communities
QUITO, Ecuador--(Business Wire)--
David O`Reilly`s surprise early retirement as CEO of Chevron comes at a time he
was under increasing pressure from shareholders and the media over an
environmental liability in Ecuador that could eat up roughly 20% of the market
value of the company and has caused a wave of negative publicity and scrutiny
from Wall Street analysts and a potential criminal investigation by New York
Attorney General Andrew Cuomo. 

"David O`Reilly`s legacy will be marred by his inability to close out the
Ecuador problem which hangs over Chevron like an enormous dark cloud," said
Karen Hinton, a representative of the Amazonian communities who brought the
class action suit against the company in 1993. "His failure to deal with Ecuador
has allowed all sorts of ethical troubles in Chevron to fester and grow to the
point where they threaten to eat up a significant portion of the company`s
market value." 

The Ecuador liability - stemming from what experts consider the worst
oil-related contamination on the planet -- was inherited when Chevron, under
O`Reilly`s watch, paid $35 billion for Texaco in 2001, apparently without
accounting for a possible adverse judgment in the case, which was pending at the
time in U.S. federal court. At the time of the purchase, O`Reilly was warned by
shareholders and environmental groups at Chevron`s 2001 annual meeting to vet
Texaco before the purchase. 

O`Reilly ignored the warnings about Texaco`s Ecuador liability, which at the
time was estimated in the billions of dollars but the actual value of which has
been determined to be $27.3 billion, according to a report prepared by a
court-appointed Special Master in Ecuador. The lawsuit asserts Texaco
deliberately dumped more than 18 billion gallons of toxic waste into the Amazon
when it operated 356 oil wells in Ecuador from 1964 to 1990, poisoning an
ecosystem the size of Rhode Island, decimating the lifestyles of six indigenous
groups and causing an epidemic of cancers and other oil-related illnesses. 

Experts have called the disaster the "Amazon Chernobyl" and the world`s worst
oil-related disaster. Just this year, Chevron`s role in Ecuador has been covered
in unflattering fashion by 60 Minutes, the New York Times, the Washington Post,
the Wall Street Journal, the Financial Times, and a host of other publications.
A judgment in the civil trial is expected in 2010; Chevron has announced it
expects to lose and will seek relief in international courts. 

"David O`Reilly is either trying get out of Chevron before the Ecuador judgment
comes down and further embarrasses him, or he was hounded to retire so Chevron
could try to bury an obvious corporate governance problem given its failure to
properly vet Texaco," said Chris Lehane, a lawyer and political consultant
working for the Amazonian communities. 

Earlier this year, in an open letter to shareholders, the environmental group
Amazon Watch blasted O`Reilly for not properly vetting Texaco and therefore
overpaying for the company. "There is no evidence that Chevron`s management &#8230;
independently vetted Texaco`s representations at the time about the nature of
the lawsuit or the limitations of its [release] which no court of law in either
the U.S. or Ecuador has ever accepted as valid in reference to the civil
lawsuit," said the letter, signed by Atossa Soltani, the executive director of
Amazon Watch. 

There is also no evidence that O`Reilly`s team ever independently investigated
the circumstances surrounding a release Texaco secured from Ecuador`s government
after a purported $40 million "remediation" that appears to have been a sham,
said Andrew Woods, an American legal advisor to the plaintiffs. Two former
Texaco lawyers, Ricardo Reis Veiga and Rodrigo Perez Pallares (both now working
for Chevron), are under criminal indictment in Ecuador along with seven
Ecuadorian government officials for lying about the results of the remediation
to secure the release. 

Earlier this year, analysts at both Barclay`s and Oppenheimer warned Chevron`s
investors about the Ecuador liability. Oppenheimer said the $27 billion
potential liability "could depress the stock until a settlement is reached"
while Barclay`s called the Ecuador a "drag" on the company`s stock. The company
was also questioned by Risk Metrics, a leading investment advisory group, which
asked O`Reilly to increase Chevron`s level of disclosure about the Ecuador
lawsuit. 

Separately, New York Attorney General Andrew Cuomo has opened a probe of the
company for misleading shareholders over the Ecuador liability. In Chevron`s SEC
disclosures, the company claims the case is frivolous and that it cannot
estimate a potential loss, even though the damages claim of $27.3 billion is
spelled out in great detail in a 4,000-page report. 

Cuomo`s probe is under New York`s Martin Act, which allows for both civil and
criminal liability. 

Hinton said one of O`Reilly`s critical mistakes in regard to Ecuador was hiring
several "ideological lawyers" from the Bush Administration to run the company`s
legal department. These individuals, who had no experience in the oil industry,
believe they must win at all costs against indigenous groups in Ecuador rather
than work out a solution that would be in the best interests of the company`s
shareholders. 

Chevron`s legal department is supervised by Charles James, a neoconservative and
former assistant attorney general under John Ashcroft during the first term of
George W. Bush. Its General Counsel is R. Hewitt Pate, who also worked under
James and Ashcroft at the Department of Justice and who began his tenure with
Chevron in early August of this year. O`Reilly is the only CEO of an oil major
who has hired top lawyers because of their political ties rather than their
experience in the industry, said Woods. 

About the Amazon Defense Coalition

The Amazon Defense Coalition represents the plaintiffs in the lawsuit which
include dozens of rainforest communities and five indigenous groups that inhabit
Ecuador`s Northern Amazon region. The mission of the Coalition is to protect the
environment and secure social justice through grass roots organizing, political
advocacy, and litigation. Two of its leaders, Luis Yanza and Pablo Fajardo, are
recipients of the prestigious Goldman Environmental Prize.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Chevron Corp (CVX.N) said on Wednesday David O'Reilly would retire as chairman and chief executive of the second-largest U.S. oil company at the end of the year and be replaced by Vice Chairman John Watson.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Watson, 52, has worked at the company since 1980, including roles as chief financial officer and head of exploration and production outside North America. He also led Chevron's integration of Texaco after the transaction closed in 2001.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The California native, who currently oversees strategy and development, will take the helm at a time when oil majors face increasing competition from state-run oil companies for access to the largest untapped reserves. Two-thirds of the world's top 20 oil companies are backed by governments.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly, a 62-year-old from Dublin, has worked for the San Ramon, California-based company for 41 years and served in the top two roles for the past decade.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While his public profile was lower than that of some other top executives, he made headlines in June by debating the head of the Sierra Club, an environmental group.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A new CEO is just the latest change at the top of Chevron in the past year, which has seen a new chief financial officer take over and the appointment of a new top in-house lawyer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The CEO change is a "mild positive" for Chevron's stock, largely because it sets up a smooth transition, said James Halloran, consultant with Financial America Securities in Cleveland, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But he said the road ahead looks tough since oil companies largely occupy a second tier after national oil companies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"They can no longer show up at the doorstep of countries and get access to the oil," Halloran said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the face of this challenge, Chevron in January dropped its target for 3 percent compound annual production growth from 2005 to 2010, although in July it did bump up its 2009 output growth target to 5 percent from 4 percent.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;O'Reilly will depart as a number of sizeable projects come online from Brazil to the Gulf of Mexico to Australia, where the $37 billion Gorgon gas project just got the green light.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"He's left him with a well-stocked pond," said Fadel Gheit, analyst at Oppenheimer  Co, who also identified access to new reserves as Watson's biggest challenge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Watson also faces a potential crisis from a $27 billion claim under a lawsuit in Ecuador, where indigenous people blame Texaco for polluting the jungle and damaging their health.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A ruling in the 16-year-old case had been due in the coming months, but that is now complicated by the judge's replacement amid allegations he was involved in a $3 million bribery plot.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron's board elected George Kirkland, 59, to succeed Watson as vice chairman. Kirkland will retain responsibility for Chevron's global oil and gas exploration and production.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Chevron shares rose 0.1 percent to $70.99 on the New York Stock Exchange. Larger rival Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N) was down 0.2 percent at $68.94.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Matt Daily in New York and Braden Reddall in San Francisco; editing by Gerald E.

&lt;p&gt;NEW YORK--(Business Wire)--
Fitch rates J.P. Morgan Resecuritization Trust 2009-11. This transaction
consists of five non-crossed groups. Each group is a resecuritization of a
residential mortgage backed securities certificate. Fitch is not rating the
Group 4 certificates. 

Group 1 is a resecuritization of 10.7% interest in CWALT 2006-HY13, class 4-A-1.


Group 2 is a resecuritization of 25.7% interest in CWALT 2006-31CB, class A-4. 

Group 3 is a resecuritization of 5.7% interest in RALI 2006-QS7, class A-1, 7.0%
interest in RALI 2006-QS8, class A-1, 59.1% interest in RALI 2006-QS11, class
I-A-8, and 13.3% interest in RALI 2007-QS1, class II-A-6. 

Group 5 is a resecuritization of 30.5% interest in WFMBS 2006-AR12, class
II-A-1. 

As resecuritizations, the certificates will receive their cash flows from the
underlying classes of certificates. The underlying certificates represent
beneficial ownership interest in fixed-rate and adjustable-rate, conventional,
first lien residential mortgage loans, substantially all of which have original
terms to stated maturity of 30 years. 

This transaction contains certain classes designated as Base Certificates and
others as Exchangeable Certificates. The A-1 certificate of each group is a Base
Certificate and can be exchanged for certain combinations of A-3 through A-10
(as well as A-11 and A-12 in the cases of Groups 2, 3, and 5). 

The underlying collateral and cash flow structure were analyzed according to
Fitch's 'U.S. Residential Mortgage Re-REMIC,' 'ResiLogic: U.S. Residential
Mortgage Loss Model' and 'U.S. RMBS Cash Flow Analysis' criteria.

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft will not have to pay $388 million to a security software company for infringing on a patent, U.S. District Judge William Smith ruled Tuesday.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Uniloc, which has headquarters in California, had accused Microsoft of infringing a patent related to the antipiracy software-registration system Microsoft uses as part of its product activation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's successful appeal comes after a jury found in April that the company violated Uniloc's patent, which Smith vacated Tuesday. The case was heard in U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case, originally filed in September 2003, has taken several turns. Prior to the April decision, the same U.S. District Court found that no infringement had occurred. But in August 2008, the U.S. Court of Appeals reversed that decision and sent the case back to the District Court for a re-trial, which ruled against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Microsoft's product-activation procedure links software to particular machines, which is intended to reduce piracy.

&lt;p&gt;SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Organized by IQPC, the 5th Forum on Laboratory Informatics will be held October
26-28, 2009 in San Francisco, California (www.labinformaticsforum.com). 

This forum addresses the fundamental challenges of lab system integration and
interfacing, and is geared towards pharmaceutical and biotech professionals
involved in informatics, lab operations, research &amp; development, data management
and software development. 

Recent company mergers in the pharmaceutical industry have brought to light the
need for efficient collection, organization and consolidation of data and
information, which is even more challenging when systems are integrated.
Overwhelming amounts of accumulated data requires proper management from the
right systems and this remains a difficulty for many labs. 

Leaders from Pfizer, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Eli Lilly, Millennium (the Takeda
Oncology Company), Allergan Pharmaceuticals, Genentech, PhaseFour Informatics,
SmarterLab, Atrium Research &amp; Consulting will be discussing:

* Regulatory compliance and meeting FDA expectations 
* ELN and LIMS selection, evaluation and deployment with a focus on ROI and the
impact on business performance 
* Ensuring data quality and validation through electronic record management 
* Overcoming interfacing and integration issues when using software and
instruments from various vendors

Sponsors of the 5th Forum on Lab Informatics include Waters Laboratory
Informatics, CambridgeSoft and CSols Inc.

&lt;p&gt;52% of Exchange 2003 Users Plan to Upgrade to 2007 this Year
WALTHAM, Mass.--(Business Wire)--
Metalogix Software, a leading provider of email archiving solutions for
Microsoft Exchange as well as SharePoint migration, management, archiving, and
recovery solutions, today announced survey results on what versions of Microsoft
Exchange are in use by today`s organizations. The findings, based on responses
from more than 800 IT administrators, show that organizations have been cautious
about migrating to Exchange 2007 and some will skip Exchange 2007 and await the
release of Exchange 2010. Email archiving solutions, such as Metalogix
Professional Archive Manager for Exchange, can smooth migration processes by
reducing the overall amount of Exchange data for a faster and more efficient
migration path. 

Key results from the Metalogix survey include:

* 50% of Microsoft Exchange users are still using Exchange 2003 
* 46% of Microsoft Exchange users are running Exchange 2007 
* 48% of all Exchange users plan to upgrade their Exchange version this year 
* 52% of Exchange 2003 users plan to upgrade to Exchange 2007 this year 
* 20% of all Exchange users plan to upgrade to Exchange 2010 upon availability

"Email has become today`s No. 1 business application and companies are hesitant
to make any changes that might impact its performance," said Chris Risley, CEO,
Metalogix. "This has resulted in a relatively slow adoption rate of new versions
of Exchange." 

Based on this trend data, Metalogix anticipates that the adoption rate of
Exchange 2010 will not peak for at least two years. In the meantime, companies
are rapidly adopting solutions to securely retain, protect and archive their
email data. Metalogix also recommends that those organizations planning to
upgrade their Exchange environments implement an archiving solution first. This
speeds the process by reducing the Exchange data size before migration. 

Metalogix offers a powerful solution for Exchange archiving, Metalogix
Professional Archive Manager for Exchange. Available for Exchange 2003 and 2007,
Professional Archive Manager for Exchange leverages Hierarchical Storage
Management (HSM) technology to remove duplicate data and store original files on
less-expensive media. This reduces the amount of data to be backed up, increases
backup performance, reduces backup windows and speeds recovery time. It also
minimizes the overall data that must be migrated when upgrading to newer
versions of Exchange.

&lt;p&gt;SEATTLE (Reuters) - Microsoft did not infringe a patent held by anti-piracy software maker Uniloc Inc, a federal judge ruled on Tuesday, nullifying an earlier $388 million (242 million pound) damages award against Microsoft.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The decision, by U.S. District Judge William Smith, means Microsoft does not need to pay what would have been one of the largest damages awarded in a civil patent case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We are pleased that the court has vacated the jury verdict and entered judgment in favor of Microsoft," said Kevin Kutz, a Microsoft spokesman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A call to Uniloc was not immediately returned.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uniloc USA and its Singapore-based parent originally filed suit against Microsoft in 2003, claiming that Microsoft infringed its patent with security software it was using to prevent unlicensed use of its Windows XP operating system and parts of its Office suite of products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After six years of legal wrangling culminated in a trial earlier this year, a jury in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island found in favor of Uniloc in April, awarding the large damages against Microsoft. Microsoft then appealed the verdict.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The case: Uniloc USA, Inc., et al v. Microsoft Corp., et al, U.S. District Court District of Rhode Island (Providence), 1:03-cv-00440-S-DLM.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Bill Rigby; Editing by Gary Hill)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eleven years ago, Larry Page and Sergey Brin founded Google Inc. with a search engine and a plan. Now their company has grown into an online behemoth battling head-to-head with industry giant Microsoft Corp. while the term Google is a verb that means Internet search.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obviously, a lot has changed for the company and its founders since Sept. 27, 1998.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google celebrated its anniversary this year quietly, doing little more than changing the famed doodle on its search page from the usual Google to Goog11e .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But whether it celebrates its birthday or not, Google is one of the great Internet success stories to date. The company not only owns the search market with a share of more than 64%, it has branched out over the years with its hosted Google Apps applications like Gmail along with Google Maps , Google Earth and other products.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;More recently, Google has moved to take on Microsoft and its widely-used Internet Explorer in the browser business, and even disclosed plans this summer to develop an alternative to the Windows operating system. Just yesterday, Google announced plans to release an early version of its Google Wave collaboration tool to 100,000 users and developers for testing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I would say Google is the most influential Web company out there," said Ezra Gottheil, an analyst with Technology Business Research Inc. "It's rare to have a company grow like that, but we've seen others. It's just that the others either flamed out, were acquired or haven't yet reached a sustainable state. Look at Netscape, MySpace, Twitter, Youtube and Facebook."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Caroline Dangson, an analyst with IDC, noted that in a survey undertaken by the research firm last year, Google was easily the top consumer brand.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We have found that with consumer surveys, [Google] is the number one consumer brand," she added. "We conducted a survey including Yahoo, MSN, eBay, Amazon ... different consumer Web properties. Google was number one for all of our questions, from 'How much do you like the brand?' to 'How much do you use the brand?' to 'How much do you trust the brand?' There are few companies that are able to grow and dominate in this way."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google has grown to the point where it's become a threat to Microsoft , which has had a long and storied history of high-tech industry dominance. There was a time not so long ago when few believed that any company could rattle Microsoft, let alone a Web company like Google .&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But Google's vice-like grip on the lucrative search market forced Microsoft to spend massive amounts of money to overhaul its old and unexciting Live Search engine to create Bing , which was unveiled this summer. Microsoft went a step further by signing an agreement that calls for Internet pioneer Yahoo Inc. to use Bing as the primary search engine on its various sites.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Google was developing its Chrome browser to take on IE, and was looking to develop an operating system to compete with Windows.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Chrome browser , unveiled about a year ago, hasn't hurt Microsoft yet, but the company isn't giving up. Last week, for example, Google released a plug-in called Chrome Frame that lets users embed the Chrome browser into IE. The plug in, which is said to boost IE's browser's notoriously slow JavaScript speed, drew a quick response from Microsoft , which warned that it could cause security problems for users.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google in July announced plans to take on Windows with an open-source operating system, also called Chrome, that could run Internet-centric computers like netbooks as early as the second half of next year. Many other companies have tried and failed to take on Microsoft in the operating systems business, but analysts say that Google has the financial muscle, the engineering might and the industry clout to actually put up a realistic fight for market share.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google also moved this summer to make its hosted applications suite more attractive to large government users by announcing plans to tailor its cloud computing services for various federal agencies.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"In Microsoft's mind, Google is probably the biggest threat to their bread-and-butter operating system and desktop application businesses," said Dan Olds, an analyst with The Gabriel Consulting Group. "Google's dominance of the search business is also Microsoft's biggest opportunity in terms of new revenue and revenue growth. So to a large extent, the two companies are going to do battle on several fronts, which is good for consumers as it keeps innovation high and prices low, and it's also fun to observe."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Google, with a focus on its core business along with an ingrained innovative track, is also influencing a whole lot of up-and-coming Web 2.0 businesses, according to Olds.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The Google model of developing a killer application, optimizing it to provide high user value and gain user loyalty, and then monetizing it has been the model of choice for social networking companies. Take a look at Twitter," he said. "Google has gone from zero to industry giant in a record amount of time, starting with just a bunch of guys with a search engine to a company with a $156 billion capitalization in just over a decade. It's a company worth emulating."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Original story - here&lt;/p&gt;

    The Storage Visions Conference is the premier venue bringing together
digital storage oriented people from throughout the digital content
creation, distribution and user value chain.

    Here is the abstract of "Total Recall and Total Storage": What if you
never forgot anything? Trends in storage, sensing and computing will
bring about an e-memory revolution in the next 10 years that will enable
you to record as much of your life as you want, in previously
unimaginable detail. Everything you see and hear, every step you take,
every heartbeat, all of it could be captured digitally. You could have
Total Recall. Total Recall will revolutionize our health, our learning,
and our productivity. It will change the story we pass on to posterity,
taking us to a level of "digital immortality." The consequences to
society will be profound: some good and some bad. But good or bad, our
experience with the MyLifeBits research project and the CARPE research
community has convinced us that the e-memory revolution is inevitable.

&lt;p&gt;ExxonMobil Science Day to Encourage Opportunities for Dallas-Area Girls
DALLAS--(Business Wire)--
The Women`s Museum and ExxonMobil are teaming up to present ExxonMobil Science
Day, Wednesday, September 30, 2009, a program created to encourage and motivate
Dallas-area girls to pursue careers in science, technology, engineering, and
mathematics related fields. 

Female students from Irma Rangel Young Women`s Leadership School, Anson Jones
Elementary School and Fellowship Christian Academy will have the opportunity to
hear from a female geophysicist and enjoy an interactive science show. Guest
speaker Maria C. Guedez, a native of Venezuela, will offer insight into her
amazing journey from studies in Caracas, a master`s degree in earth science at
Rice University to ultimately a career at ExxonMobil Exploration Company. 

"We believe it is vital to continually reinforce to young people that math and
science are fun and exciting careers to pursue," said Truman Bell, senior
program officer for education and diversity, ExxonMobil. "We hope that this
science and engineering show sparks the girls` imaginations and encourages them
to stay interested in these important subjects. The Women`s Museum is doing
amazing work in this community, and we are proud to be a long-standing partner
with them." 

After the presentation, students will participate in the Earth Seen: Engineering
the Future, show by EarthCapades Environmental Vaudeville. The show will feature
unicycles, juggling, and comedy to entertain and educate audiences of all ages.
This energetic show is designed to encourage young children to take an active
interest science study. The students have the opportunity to interact throughout
the show as "engineers" while learning about science, ecology and the earth.
Sponsored by ExxonMobil, the show is currently being performed during the State
Fair of Texas daily at noon and 5 p.m. on The Women`s Museum outdoor stage. 

"The Women`s Museum is delighted to present this unique show to educate and
entertain our visitors," said Wanda Brice, CEO of The Women`s Museum.
"ExxonMobil is a great partner as we strive to showcase science- and math-based
fields for girls." 

Students will leave ExxonMobil Science Day with information on career options in
the science field and firsthand experiences with engineering, earth science and
energy. 

A Smithsonian affiliate, The Women`s Museum is the nation`s only comprehensive
women`s history museum that chronicles the lives of American women through
interactive exhibits. The Women`s Museum is supported, in part, by the City of
Dallas, Office of Cultural Affairs. Museum hours are Tuesday through Sunday,
noon to 5:00 p.m. (closed Mondays). For more information, please visit

&lt;p&gt;LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Environmental software company Village Green Global Inc is joining the dash in the market to track carbon footprints, partnering with software giant Microsoft Corp to capture the business of cities and local governments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Carbon tracking is a small but fast-growing market with companies like SAP AG and Johnson Controls Inc among those offering tools to monitor environmental impacts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the formation of Village Green's U.S. unit this year, company Chief Executive Doug Smith said it plans to take 40 percent of the U.S. market for carbon-tracking software and become the market leader.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"There's no point being second," Smith told Reuters in an interview.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village Green started in Victoria, Australia in 2002 as an environmental consultancy and has done work in Malaysia, Ireland and the Middle East. Now it is now honing in on the United States.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"If you look at the U.S. alone in relation to stimulus funding in the clean tech sector, auditing is worth $2 (billion) to $5 billion," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The privately held company plans to become the U.S. market leader within two to five years, Smith said. It has an office in Palo Alto, California and is building a staff of 250.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village Green expects the industry to create 68,000 jobs for environmental auditors who work with the public sector.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TEAM WORK&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;With the partnership, Microsoft agents will offer Village Green's software as a carbon tracking tool to its public sector clients through its indirect sales model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Smith said by working the public sector, Village Green can also reach small business communities.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Local government potentially (will be) picking up licenses for their business customers and they're providing the tools for their small businesses, so they can go online and do it for themselves," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village Green's tool, called SMARTWeb, tracks electricity use, water consumption, transportation, natural gas, waste and other factors to find ways to save energy and money.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Village Green's customers save an average of 15 to 20 percent on their energy consumption "without spending any money, looking solely at how the staff uses the equipment in the building," Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Two main factors driving the U.S. market are corporate social responsibility and government policy, Smith said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A recent study by Groom Energy Solutions, a U.S. firm that helps companies reduce energy consumption, estimated that about half the Fortune 500 companies have calculated their carbon footprints, compared with just 4 percent five years ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 2010, new federal environmental regulations will require large emitters of heat-trapping emissions to start collecting data on greenhouse gases, under a reporting system the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency finalized last week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Matt Miszewski, Microsoft's general manager for its worldwide public sector, said the carbon-tracking market's growth depends in part what happens at the United Nations climate summit in Copenhagen in December.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We feel we're on the cusp of a very large market here that is about to be born in Copenhagen," Miszewski said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"We hope the current market size will be multiplying going forward and not only will we be working to protect the environment but also the global economy with sustainable green-oriented jobs," he added.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(Reporting by Laura Isensee; Editing Richard Chang)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dave O`Reilly to Retire After 41 Years of Distinguished Company Service;
George Kirkland Named Vice Chairman, Retaining Oversight of Global Upstream
Operations


SAN RAMON, Calif.--(Business Wire)--
The board of directors of Chevron Corporation (NYSE: CVX) today elected John S.
Watson, 52, chairman of the board and chief executive officer of the company,
effective Dec. 31, 2009. Watson, who is currently vice chairman, succeeds David
J. O`Reilly, who will retire from the company and its board after a
distinguished 41-year career, including 10 years as chairman and CEO. 

The Chevron board also elected George L. Kirkland, 59, to be vice chairman of
the board, succeeding Watson in that capacity. As vice chairman and executive
vice president of Upstream and Gas, Kirkland will retain responsibility for
overseeing Chevron`s global exploration and production activities for crude oil
and natural gas. 

"Chevron is well positioned to enter the next chapter of its history and John`s
the right person to lead the company in the future," said O`Reilly, 62. "I am
enormously proud of what we have achieved in recent years, and John has played a
pivotal role in many of our most significant achievements. Not only has John
established himself as a proven leader, but his unique mix of corporate and
operational experience combined with his strategic vision makes him ideally
suited to be our next chairman and CEO." 

Watson said, "I am truly honored to follow Dave as chairman and CEO of Chevron
and to lead one of the strongest management teams in our industry. Under Dave`s
leadership, we have built a project portfolio that is the envy of our industry,
grown our profitability and moved our company to the forefront of our industry
in safety and reliability. Dave will leave a lasting legacy as one of our
industry`s most impressive and pragmatic leaders." 

Watson has had a 29-year career with Chevron and was named vice chairman of the
corporation on April 1, 2009. In his current role, he oversees a broad portfolio
of responsibilities, including strategic planning; business development; policy,
government and public affairs; major capital projects support; procurement; and
corporate compliance. 

A native of California, Watson earned a bachelor`s degree in agricultural
economics from the University of California at Davis in 1978 and a master`s
degree in business administration from the University of Chicago in 1980. 

Watson joined Chevron in 1980 as a financial analyst. He held financial,
analytical and supervisory positions before being elected president of Chevron
Canada Ltd. in 1996. In 1998, he was elected a vice president of the corporation
with responsibility for strategic planning and mergers and acquisitions. In
2000, he led the company`s integration effort following the Chevron-Texaco
merger and then became the corporation`s chief financial officer. 

In 2005, Watson was elected president of Chevron International Exploration and
Production with responsibility for the company`s exploration and production
activities outside North America. In 2008, he was elected executive vice
president for strategy and development. Watson is a director of the American
Petroleum Institute. 

O`Reilly is widely credited with transforming Chevron into one of the world`s
most formidable energy companies with an unwavering dedication to operational
excellence and what he often referred to as "getting results the right way." 

Since O`Reilly became CEO in 2000, the company has increased its production by
more than 60 percent; established the best exploration record among its peers in
the industry; advanced Chevron`s safety record to world-class levels; and been
among the best of its peer companies in total shareholder return over this
period. He also led two of the industry`s most significant and successful
transactions - the 2001 merger with Texaco and the acquisition of Unocal in
2005. 

"Leading this company and its outstanding people for the past 10 years has been
one of the greatest privileges of my life," said O`Reilly. "I leave knowing that
Chevron is in very capable hands and that its board and executive team will not
miss a beat in moving the company forward to even greater accomplishments." 

A native of Dublin, Ireland, O`Reilly joined the company as a process engineer
in Chevron Research Co. in 1968 after earning his bachelor`s degree in chemical
engineering from University College in Dublin. Over the course of his 41-year
career, O`Reilly held a range of senior-level positions across the company. From
November 1998 to January 2000, he served as vice chairman of the board,
responsible for Chevron`s worldwide exploration and production and corporate
human resources. He was elected chairman and chief executive officer on Jan. 1,
2000. In 2002, University College granted him an honorary doctor of science
degree in recognition of his outstanding career. 

Kirkland has served in numerous upstream leadership positions inside and outside
the United States over the course of his 35-year career with the company. He
joined Chevron as a construction engineer in New Orleans in 1974 and moved to
Caltex Pacific Indonesia in 1978. After returning to the United States and
holding positions of increasing responsibility in Chevron operations, Kirkland
became group manager of Upstream Technology for Chevron Research and Technology
Co. in 1990. 

In 1992, Kirkland was appointed general manager of production for Chevron
Nigeria Ltd. In 1996, he was named managing director for Chevron in Nigeria. He
became president of the company`s North American Exploration and Production
operations in 2001. He was later appointed corporate vice president and
president of Chevron`s International Exploration and Production operations in
2002 and assumed his current position in January 2005.

Dimon, 53, is not expected to leave any time soon, but Staley's promotion makes him a front- runner to succeed him, a person close to JPMorgan said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"This sends the message that they have a deep bench and executives in place in the event Jamie Dimon were to depart," said Bill Fitzpatrick, an analyst at Optique Capital Management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Making way for Staley to take over at the investment bank, co-CEO Bill Winters will leave the firm and the other co-CEO, Steve Black, will stay on only for the transition as executive chairman of the unit.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Jamie is a little young to be thinking about succession at this point," said Nancy Bush, an analyst and founder of NAB Research.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet Dimon joins other Wall Street banks in firming up succession plans as the easing of the financial crisis gives him time to think about the future and as regulators step up scrutiny of bank governance.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"The timing was right to begin the succession process," Dimon said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Staley, 52, has held high-profile roles since he joined the bank 30 years ago as an economics graduate from Bowdoin College. He spent 20 years in the investment bank -- including nine years in the Latin America division -- and headed equity capital markets before becoming CEO of the private bank and then taking on the asset management operation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Among other achievements, Staley persuaded Dimon in 2004 to take a stake in hedge fund Highbridge Capital, which has seen assets under management triple over the past five years, Duff McDonald wrote in his recent book about Jamie Dimon, "Last Man Standing."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Mary Callahan Erdoes, 42, chief executive of JPMorgan's private bank, succeeds Staley as head of asset management.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;WINTERS OUT&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winters and Black were deeply involved in the acquisition and integration of Bear Stearns Cos. Like Dimon, they did not receive a cash bonus for last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At a meeting behind closed doors in London last week, Winters blamed "greedy bankers, investors and borrowers" for the financial crisis, according to a U.K. newspaper.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winters and Black have been investment bank co-CEOs since 2004 -- something of a record on Wall Street, where appointing co-heads often creates a power struggle, leaving just one head standing. Winters focused mainly on credit and trading from the London office, while Black, based in New York, focused on investment banking.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;JPMorgan's investment bank largely avoided the complex debt securities linked to subprime mortgages that caused large losses for its rivals over the last two years. At the same time, it has become a major force for both debt and equity underwriting, topping third-quarter "league tables" according to preliminary data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Winters' plans were unclear, but two people who have worked with him said his strong background in management and his experience during some of the worst days of the financial crisis will stand him in good stead if he seeks a management job elsewhere.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;SUCCESSORS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, a former protege of Citigroup Inc (C.N) architect Sandy Weill, is regarded as a star on Wall Street who has led JPMorgan through face-changing acquisitions, including Bear Stearns and failed Seattle thrift Washington Mutual last year.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Dimon, ousted unceremoniously from Citigroup in 1998, may be looking to avoid the errors of his former mentor. Weill said in McDonald's "Last Man Standing," "I think I made a very bad decision on succession." Citigroup has struggled since Weill's departure.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;As regulators scrutinize the boards and management teams of banks in the wake of the financial crisis, other banks have recently laid out succession plans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I think for every large bank there clearly is an increased regulatory pressure to have some kind of succession plan in place," said Bush.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Morgan Stanley (MS.N) said earlier this month James Gorman, 51, will take over from John Mack as chief executive on Jan 1.

&lt;p&gt;Adds Monitoring for F5 Application Delivery Controllers to Bulletproof
Redesigned Client Access Service in E2010
SEATTLE--(Business Wire)--
Azaleos&#174; Corporation, the managed messaging and collaboration services company,
today announced that it will expand its market leading Managed Exchange Services
to also support Exchange 2010 when it ships later this year, and starting
immediately is offering a free basic upgrade to E2010 and migration of 500
mailboxes. To help customers maintain the highest levels of uptime for E2010,
Azaleos also announced a new monitoring service for F5 Local Traffic Manager
(LTM) appliances. This new offering is designed to increase the fault tolerance
and maintain the high availability of the Exchange Client Access Service (CAS),
which was redesigned to be the central hub of E2010. 

No Cost Upgrades to E2010

To help existing Exchange customers take advantage of the powerful new
capabilities in E2010, Azaleos is expanding its market-leading Managed Exchange
Services and offering a limited time free upgrade program. New Azaleos customers
will be eligible for a free basic upgrade, which includes the installation and
configuration of E2010 infrastructure, and the migration of 500 e-mail boxes. 

The new Azaleos remotely managed service for Exchange 2010 will be available
with the general availability of E2010 in November. Customers who take advantage
of this upgrade offer can begin to design a customized E2010 system and plan
their migration today. 

"Exchange 2010 offers customers a powerful set of new capabilities that address
storage, performance, and web client ease-of-use limitations in the current
version," said Scott Gode, vice president of marketing and product management
for Azaleos. "The free upgrade program and new monitoring service for F5 load
balancers are designed to help customers move easily, safely, and
cost-effectively to Exchange 2010." 

High Availability F5 Monitoring Service

With the release of E2010, Microsoft has redesigned the CAS to handle
connectivity for all major endpoint technologies in Exchange including Outlook,
Outlook Web Access, ActiveSync, and more. This increased dependency on CAS
creates a potential single point of failure that can bring down all E2010
services. To deliver the highest levels of resilience for CAS, Azaleos has built
a new 24X7X365 monitoring functionality for F5 LTM appliances. Azaleos has
extended its monitoring and reporting capabilities to cover metrics collected by
the BIG-IP, such as capacity, availability, and network performance. This
service provides continuous insight into the F5 LTM products, which play a
critical role in managing the flow of traffic and services between multiple
front-end servers in Exchange deployments. 

"Traffic management and intelligent load balancing have always played a central
role in large Exchange environments, and with the changes in Exchange 2010 they
are even more critical for preventing outages," said Calvin Rowland, Sr.
Director of Business Development for F5. "The new Azaleos monitoring service for
F5 Local Traffic Manager appliances ensures these devices are operating and
properly configured at all times, and prevents avoidable downtime by making
access to the Exchange Client Access Servers virtually bullet proof." 

Full Suite of Exchange Services

Azaleos offers the most complete and reliable set of remotely managed services
for Exchange (including E2010)-based messaging, SharePoint Server, and
Blackberry Enterprise Server. The company is the only service provider offering
on-premise remotely managed Exchange services, as well as a hybrid option that
allows customers to mix-and-match both on-premise and cloud-based e-mail
accounts using Microsoft Business Productivity Online Suite (BPOS). Azaleos`
full complement of add-on services includes:

* Filtering Services, cloud-based anti-virus/anti-spam service 
* Archive Services, e-mail archiving and storage for Exchange server 
* Mobile Services, turnkey management and monitoring for the Blackberry
Enterprise Server
* Continuity Services, e-mail business continuity and disaster recovery
* Active Directory Services, remote monitoring and management ofActive Directory
* SharePoint Services, remote monitoring and management of SharePoint

Availability and Pricing

The Azaleos remotely managed Exchange 2010 service will be available with the
general availability of E2010. Pricing for full Exchange monitoring and
management starts at $12 per user/month. The F5 LTM monitoring functionality is
available immediately and currently supports Exchange 2007 configurations. The
Azaleos E2010 special offers are available only through Dec 31st, 2009, for more

&lt;p&gt;Global "Front-of-Pack" Commitment - A Beverage Industry First - Aims to Help
Consumers Manage Their Energy Intake
ATLANTA--(Business Wire)--
The Coca-Cola Company today announced global plans to include energy information
(calories, kilocalories, kilojoules) per serving on the front of nearly all
product packages in a move to increase consumers` awareness about the calorie
content of its beverages. 

Coca-Cola is the first company in the beverage industry to make this kind of
international commitment. 

The new labels seek to make it even easier for consumers worldwide to make more
informed decisions about the beverages they drink based on their own individual
taste preferences and nutritional needs. The Company already has successfully
rolled out front-of-pack energy labeling throughout Europe and Australia with
Mexico and the United States currently in roll-out phase. The Coca-Cola
Company`s global commitment is to have front-of-pack energy information on all
products by the end of 2011. 

"Coca-Cola is the world`s most valuable brand, and with that comes a leadership
responsibility," said Muhtar Kent, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. "Now
more than ever, people expect facts about the products they consume to be both
readily available and visible. This global commitment is about making it easier
for consumers to quickly see the calorie information for our beverages." 

Research shows that front-of-pack energy information is an important tool in
helping people balance their overall dietary intake and physical activity. In
the United States, the new labeling replicates information that is located in
the Nutrition Facts box on the side panel of Coca-Cola products, making it
easier for consumers to see it, "at-a-glance." 

Dr. Rhona Applebaum, Chief Scientific &amp; Regulatory Officer, said, "We have been
a leader in driving and promoting efforts to advance fact-based nutrition
labeling. This new global commitment on front-of-pack energy is one more step in
providing consumers with important information they need to enjoy any of our
3,000 beverages sensibly, wherever they live. Our new product labels aim to help
people better balance their energy intake, as variety, moderation and regular
physical activity are the keys to effective weight management." 

The new labeling will show calories, kilocalories or kilojoules per serving on
nearly all Coca-Cola beverages, including all sparkling beverages, teas, energy
drinks, flavored water beverages, juices and juice drinks. According to local
regulations, label information may also include percent Daily Guidance
Indicators to show how the quantities of select nutrients fit into the national
or regional dietary guidelines. Nationally appropriate terms, such as Guideline
Daily Amounts (EU) and Daily Values (US and Canada), will be used when providing
this information. The only Coca-Cola products excluded from the policy are
fountain drinks, unsweetened/unflavored waters and returnable bottles. 

The new labeling and the broad portfolio of Coca-Cola products are complemented
by a wide range of Coca-Cola-supported programs around the world that promote
nutrition education and encourage physical activity among people of all ages.
The Coca-Cola Company supports active, healthy living programs in 100 countries.
In the United States, Coca-Cola sponsors Triple Play, a wellness program in
partnership with the Boys and Girls Clubs of America and the U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services. Results of a two-year study released two weeks ago
found that children who participated in the program increased their level of
physical activity, made smarter nutrition choices and improved their sense of
self mastery or control over their lives. 

The Coca-Cola Company is the world's largest beverage company, refreshing
consumers with nearly 500 sparkling and still brands. Along with Coca-Cola&#174;,
recognized as the world's most valuable brand, the Company's portfolio includes
12 other billion dollar brands, including Diet Coke&#174;, Fanta&#174;, Sprite&#174;, Coca-Cola
Zero&#174;, vitaminwater, POWERADE&#174;, Minute Maid&#174; and Georgia&#174; Coffee. Globally, we
are the No. 1 provider of sparkling beverages, juices and juice drinks and
ready-to-drink teas and coffees. Through the world's largest beverage
distribution system, consumers in more than 200 countries enjoy the Company's
beverages at a rate of nearly 1.6 billion servings a day. With an enduring
commitment to building sustainable communities, our Company is focused on
initiatives that protect the environment, conserve resources and enhance the
economic development of the communities where we operate. For more information

&lt;p&gt;Global Platform Introduced in Alliance with Spendvision; Delivers Step Forward
in Meeting Critical Reporting and Expense Management Needs of Businesses
SAN FRANCISCO--(Business Wire)--
Visa Inc. (NYSE: V) today announced the introduction of Visa IntelliLink Spend
Management - a new global information tool that provides extensive reporting and
expense management capabilities for organizations of all sizes on a single
scalable platform. 

Comprised of three core solutions - reporting, data services, and program
support - Visa IntelliLink Spend Management integrates with the entire suite of
Visa B2B payment products. The platform is designed to meet the key information
management needs of financial institutions and their clients across all small
business, commercial, purchasing, corporate, central travel, multinational and
fleet programs. 

The platform is unique in its ability to provide reporting and full-featured
expense management in a single, integrated offering, including:

* Extensive expense management capabilities, including compliance triggers,
receipt imaging, multi-level transaction data and direct ERP integration 
* Enhanced data capture, matching and delivery 
* Integration of non-card spend to support sourcing analytics across the entire
accounts payable function 
* Multiple branding options for issuers, including tools that can be customized
to support differentiation strategies 
* Dashboard management and flexible reporting tools, and alerts for cardholders
and commercial program managers 
* Options for extending capabilities beyond payment, including travel booking
integration

"Effective expense management requires flexible, intuitive, on-demand access to
information to support a stronger understanding of spend patterns, increased
control over spending and greater insights that help companies save time and
money," said Darren Parslow, head of global commercial solutions, Visa Inc.
"Visa IntelliLink answers a global need for visibility and control over
procurement, travel and entertainment expenses, in an easy-to-use, integrated
format that enables users to see and act on critical spend information. We
believe this new global platform offers reporting and expense management
solutions and capabilities beyond those available in the marketplace today." 

Benefits for card issuers and commercial clients

Through Visa IntelliLink Spend Management, financial institutions can create
significant advantage by addressing the needs of a spectrum of companies,
increasing differentiation, and deepening customer relationships. Capable of
tracking and reporting data on both local and multinational levels, the platform
can be implemented quickly by client organizations, and is simple for card
issuers to customize, deliver and support. 

For commercial card clients, Visa IntelliLink Spend Management provides enhanced
visibility into and control over expenses, as well as easy access to information
through dashboards and alerts, the ability to track both card and non-card
transactions, and local and global functionality, e.g., multi-language support,
dual- and multi-currency card program support, and local tax support. 

Visa IntelliLink Spend Management is provided through an alliance with
Spendvision, allowing Visa clients to utilize a proven, industry-leading
platform to strengthen their competitive advantage with converged transaction
management. 

"Spendvision is excited to partner with Visa to help financial institutions
increase their differentiation in the marketplace and enhance customer loyalty,"
said Robert Kirby, CEO, Spendvision. "Through just one platform we can support
their immediate reporting and expense management needs and also the more complex
requirements that clients demand. In an increasingly competitive marketplace
this solid foundation positions them strongly for tomorrow`s payment space." 

"Procurement is all about a company getting the best deals it can from suppliers
and ensuring that employees fully utilize those deals when making purchases.
Central to optimizing procurement functions is having accurate, timely and
actionable information about the company`s total spending patterns," said Nancy
Atkinson, senior analyst, Aite Group. "Visa IntelliLink Spend Management
provides a single platform that accommodates the needs of companies of all
sizes, specific tax requirements worldwide, and supports the full range of
commercial card products, including travel, purchasing, and fleet. Visa
IntelliLink Spend Management incorporates all spending - cards and non-cards
alike. It provides a single platform to collect and analyze worldwide purchasing
activities to provide a consolidated view and support effective spend
management, which will offer issuers a strong differentiator for their
commercial card programs." 

Visa IntelliLink Spend Management will replace, over a migration period,
existing Visa Information Source, Visa Information Source Select, and other Visa
information management tools with a single, global platform. The Visa
IntelliLink suite also includes a Compliance Management Tool for Government, a
leading solution currently used by U.S. banks with Federal Government agencies
and states to help ensure card program compliance with agency procurement and
travel policies. 

Visa IntelliLink Spend Management is available to commercial card issuers around
the globe immediately.

Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day

Here are highlights from Tuesday`s Analyst Blog:

Hewlett-Packard Guides In-Line

Hewlett Packard`s (HPQ) earnings guidance provided at the analyst meeting for
fiscal 2010 was in-line with the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.26 per share. 

The company expects revenue of approximately $117.0 - $118.0 billion, up
approximately 3.0% to 5.0% from 2009 estimated revenue. GAAP earnings per share
are expected to be in the range of $3.60 - $3.70, a growth of 17% to 20% from
2009 estimated earnings, while non-GAAP earnings per share are expected to be in
the $4.20 - $4.30 range. H-P also said the projections were conservative and
could easily exceed the company`s forecast. 

H-P`s guidance validates that the IT industry is expected to return to growth
and technology spending will rebound in 2010. Moreover, H-P sees a recovery in
its PC business, which will help the company grow its top line as its PC
division contributes nearly a third of overall sales. 

In order to cut the competition in the PC market and increase sales, the company
has launched new laptops for $298, which was sold at Wal-Mart (WMT) in July and
costs $100 less than a similar product from Dell (DELL). Also, H-P rolled out a
PC for the holiday season that costs $549, which is $150 less than the laptop
introduced earlier. This will definitely help HP grow its revenue in the PC
segment. 

H-P forecasted revenue growth of 2% - 4% in its services division and 3% - 5%
growth in its PC business. The company expects 0% - 2% growth in its printing
group and a 2% - 4% growth in storage and servers for fiscal 2010. 

H-P plans to improve margins driven by strong expense management and solid
contribution from services, as well as the savings from the acquisition of EDS.
The company saved $900 million through the end of the third quarter and expects
to save $2.1 billion by the end of fiscal 2010. H-P also rebranded its EDS
services division in order to better compete with its closest rival
International Business Machines (IBM). 

H-P`s 2009 third quarter revenue and adjusted earnings were slightly above the
Zack Consensus Estimate due to strong results in the Technology Solutions Group,
which represents more than half of the company`s total profits, highlighting the
strength in services. 

Moreover, H-P`s earnings guidance of $1.12 per share for the fourth quarter of
2009 was well above the Zacks Consensus Estimate. The company also expects
revenue to be up approximately 8% sequentially for the fourth quarter. 

We are confident about H-P`s performance going forward as demand is stabilizing
and its cyclical businesses (particularly consumer PC) are rebounding. Moreover,
H-P has gained share in both PCs and servers against its rivals making it the
number-2 provider of IT services, slightly behind IBM. 

However, we remain concerned about the long-term growth prospects for the
company`s printing unit, which has seen a revenue fall of more than 20% in the
current year and continued pricing pressure, which may lead to further erosion
of profits. 

While the company plans to control costs through layoffs and generate
incremental savings, the recovery will be slow. H-P faces intense competition
from IBM, Cisco Systems (CSCO) and others which have reported positive results.

&lt;p&gt; * Acquisition helps it expand in China and SE Asia&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; * Sees net profit, revenue up 25 pct in 2010
 (Adds executive quotes)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; By Manunphattr Dhanananphorn and Ploy Ten Kate&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; BANGKOK, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Thailand's Siamgas and
Petrochemicals PCL (SGP.BK) said on Wednesday a wholly owned
subsidiary would buy a 99 percent stake in Chevron Ocean Gas 
Energy Ltd from Chevron China Ltd (CVX.N) for $51 million.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Siamgas HK Ltd's acquisition of Chevron Ocean Gas, which
operates liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) berths, would help
increase the company's net profit and sales in 2010, Deputy
Managing Director Jintana Kingkaew told Reuters.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; "Our sales and net earnings should rise 25 percent next
year and about 10 percent should come from this China
acquisition," Jintana said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The acquisition would be financed by working capital, it
said. Siamgas, Thailand's number two LPG firm, vies with energy
giant PTT (PTT.BK) and smaller rival Picnic Corp PICN.BK.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Chevron Ocean Gas and Energy Ltd has an LPG terminal with a
production capacity of 100,000 tonnes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Siamgas has been looking to expand overseas to boost its
presence in China and Southeast Asia's LPG business.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company is also finalising the acquisition of an LPG
distributor in Vietnam, Jintana said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; The company more than doubled its earnings last year to
1.09 billion baht, boosted by strong LPG demand from households
and manufacturers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Jinta said the company was on track to achieve a 15 percent
growth target for both sales and net profit in 2009 thanks to
improving domestic markets.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; It has customers ranging from car maker Honda Motor
(7267.T) to shopping mall operator Central Pattana PCL (CPN.BK)
and is looking for acquisitions as the downturn throws up
bargains.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; At 0819 GMT, Siamgas shares were up 0.6 percent at 8.4 baht
while the main Thai stock index .SETI was down 0.4 percent.

&lt;p&gt;SYDNEY, Sept 30 (Reuters) - Australia's competition
regulator will not oppose the proposed acquisition by U.S. drug
maker Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) of rival Wyeth Corp WYE.N, it said
on Wednesday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt; The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said
competition concerns were resolved by Pfizer's undertaking to
sell certain Australian animal health assets. The $68 billion
transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt; For a related story, see [ID:nN21321177].
